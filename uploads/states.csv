In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a Catholic Charities organization in Wisconsin doesn’t have to take part in the Wisconsin unemployment insurance (UI) system.
The ruling overturns a 4-3 Wisconsin Supreme Court decision issued in March 2024 that declared the work of Catholic Charities Bureau Inc. of the Superior Diocese of the Catholic Church doesn’t get a pass from Wisconsin’s UI law on religious grounds.
The Wisconsin ruling, written by Justice Anne Walsh Bradley, declared that the Catholic Charities work is “secular in nature” and that the agency and its subsidiary organizations that took part in the case “are not operated primarily for religious purposes” as defined in the UI law’s religious exemption.

In Thursday’s ruling, Justice Sonya Sotomayor wrote for the Court that arguments the Wisconsin high court majority made amounted to making preferences of one religious denomination over another.
Her ruling noted that the church offers its own unemployment compensation program for laid-off workers and dismissed the suggestion that the organizations were “more likely to leave their employees without unemployment benefits.”
The Wisconsin ruling held that the agencies’ work was not religious in nature because they didn’t attempt to preach the Catholic faith to participants and did not serve only Catholics.
“Petitioners’ Catholic faith, however, bars them from satisfying those criteria,” Sotomayor wrote. The ruling quoted from the dissent by Justice Rebecca Bradley in the Wisconsin decision.
“Wisconsin’s exemption,” Sotomayor wrote, “as interpreted by its Supreme Court, thus grants a denominational preference by explicitly differentiating between religions based on theological practices. Indeed, petitioners’ eligibility for the exemption ultimately turns on inherently religious choices (namely, whether to proselytize or serve only co-religionists).”
The Wisconsin UI law exempts all churches, church conventions or church associations “without differentiating between employees actually involved in religious works” and those who are not, Sotomayor wrote.
Justice Clarence Thomas, while joining in the unanimous opinion, wrote a separate concurrence stating that because the Wisconsin ruling did not defer to the Bishop of Superior’s assertion that Catholic Charities and its affiliates are “an arm of the Diocese, the Wisconsin Supreme Court violated the church autonomy doctrine.”
In a separate concurrence  Justice Ketanji Brown  Jackson signaled how states could ensure that nonprofit employees of religiously associated organizations are covered by UI — by focusing on the work involved rather than its underlying motivations to determine who is and who is not exempt.
When the federal law was revised in 1970 to include nonprofit employees in state UI programs, Congress exempted certain church-affiliated employees. The goal, Jackson wrote, was to avoid the state getting involved in a dispute “over the sufficiency of a fired employee’s prayers or the accuracy of their scriptural teaching.”
The intent of Congress was to exempt “a narrow category of church-affiliated entities” that could produce such an entanglement “precisely because their work involves preparing individuals for religious life,” Jackson wrote.
She concluded: “It is perfectly consistent with the opinion the Court hands down today for States to align their [federally-based] religious-purposes exemptions with Congress’s true focus.”

The June 4 notice, first reported by The Public’s Radio, was obtained by Rhode Island Current Thursday. The two-page letter from Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, offers little information about the basis for the investigation.
“Our investigation is based on information that Rhode Island may be engaged in employment practices regarding its affirmative action program governing state government employment under state law that discriminate based on race, national origin, or other protected characteristics in violation of Title VII,” Dhillon wrote.  
“Accordingly, the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division has authorized a full investigation to determine whether Rhode Island is engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination as set forth above.”
Attorney General Peter Neronha also appeared caught off-guard by the notice of the probe.
“The Office is still reviewing, as the subjects and focus of their investigation are unclear,” Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said in an email Thursday. “We will share more information when we are able.”
Dhillon wrote that the investigation does not mean the DOJ has reached a conclusion or determination of violations of federal anti-discrimination protections.
Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Thursday.

The Senate on Thursday passed LD 957 with a 19-13 vote, after the House did so one day prior without a roll call. 
The bill would require the Maine Department of Education to convene a volunteer advisory committee to collect information and prepare materials to teach this history. It would also require the department to develop a process to enable schools to conduct internal audits of their curriculum to ensure the history is being adequately and accurately taught. 
Though, with a one-time cost of $15,000 for the department to convene the advisory group and prepare teaching materials, the legislation is expected to be placed on the appropriations table. 
Bills that land on this table, which is managed by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee that sets the budget, have already passed the full Legislature with initial votes. However, if they don’t have a specific funding source, they have to vie for remaining unappropriated money.
Essentially, that’s everything being voted through with a fiscal note because lawmakers are still drafting what will be in the next two year budget plan. 
This bill is one of several being considered this session to ensure diverse histories are taught in Maine schools, though the other bills seek to make sure already required curricula are actually being taught. 
Lawmakers revisit bills to ensure diverse histories are taught in Maine schools

Maine has required Wabanaki and African American studies to be taught in schools since 2001 and 2021, respectively. 
But, school districts have failed to consistently and appropriately include Wabanaki studies in their curricula, according to a 2022 report, and many caution African American studies could see the same fate without additional resources and accountability measures. 
Last year, two separate bills were combined into one that proposed establishing a commission on Wabanaki and African American studies but that legislation died without final action. This idea is back for consideration this session with distinct bills. 
LD 1474, sponsored by Rep. Laurie Osher (D-Orono), would permanently establish a Wabanaki studies specialist in the Maine Department of Education to ensure the standards are being met.
LD 1202, sponsored by Talbot Ross, would create the African American Studies Advisory Council to serve as a resource for educators, schools and the Department of Education to ensure the implementation of the curricula in accordance with existing state law. 
Neither bills have received floor votes so far. 
Another bill, LD 339, that sought to pilot a Wabanaki-centered curriculum for Wabanaki children attending public schools has been rejected by both chambers and is now effectively dead.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/American-History-2-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 15:14:54.150245

(File photo by Getty Images)Continuing to provide grocery assistance to more than half a million South Carolinians could cost the state upwards of $100 million annually under proposed changes to the federal program.
For the last half-century, the federal government has fully funded benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. But Republicans’ massive bill on taxes and spending, as passed by the U.S. House, would require states to pay a portion of those benefits starting in 2028, plus a greater share of what it costs to administer the program.
While the U.S. Senate is likely to make changes to what’s dubbed the “big, beautiful bill,” advocates worry about major cuts to the 61-year program and what that would mean to the families who rely on it.
U.S. House Republican plan would force states to pay for a portion of SNAP benefits

“I can’t imagine the state is even closely prepared for all this,” said Sue Berkowitz, director of the Appleseed Legal Justice Center.
If the House plan holds, the Palmetto State’s total cost could triple, or in the worst-case scenario, increase elevenfold to $370 million.
What changes
That’s because it bases states’ share of the cost on how well they distribute benefits correctly: States with an error rate of 6% or less would be responsible for paying 5%. Those with an error rate higher than 10% would have to pay one-quarter of the cost.
And the latest data puts South Carolina in the latter category. In 2023, the state’s error rate was a whopping 22.6%, the fourth-worst in the nation, overwhelmingly due to overpayments.
State officials say that’s an anomaly.
Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, South Carolina’s error rate was historically in the lowest category. That changed in 2022, when the state’s error rate went to 9% amid changes to the SNAP program during the global pandemic. Then it shot up in 2023.
After a re-training of staff, the state Department of Social Services expects a big drop in the 2024 error rate, which should be released next month.
Can SC afford it?
The chief budget writer of the South Carolina House said the state has the money to continue the program, as long as the error rate returns to pre-pandemic levels. Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister pointed to hefty surpluses in tax collections in recent years as an example of the state’s fiscal health.
SC legislators get extra $1B to spend as budget negotiations begin

The budget that takes effect July 1 includes $1.2 billion placed in reserves. About $500 million more is unspent and available following an update in revenue estimates last month.
The question is whether funding for the food program will stand up against other budget priorities in the years to come, said Bannister, R-Greenville.
Rep. Bill Herbkersman was less certain of South Carolina’s ability to pay.
The Bluffton Republican chaired the subcommittee that oversees the budget for South Carolina’s child welfare and social services agency for many years. He does not think the state can guarantee it will have the funding every year to keep the program going on a recurring basis.
In total, the federal government provides South Carolinians $1.3 billion in annual benefits for groceries, according to the latest figures.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which heads the SNAP program, and the state split the $66 million bill for administrative costs.
What frustrates Herbkersman the most are the overhead costs just to operate the program — three-quarters of which South Carolina will have to pay under the proposed changes.
“As a taxpayer, I’m incensed by that,” he said.
As for payment errors, those can occur from miscalculations in a household’s expenses and families struggling to provide the necessary documents updating their income in the case of a job change or loss, according to the USDA.
According to state officials, the federal government calculates the error rate by checking a small sample of beneficiaries.
DSS also has struggled to process applications for benefits within the 30-day window allowed under federal regulations. The USDA put the state on notice last year, both for timeliness and for not properly informing people of denied benefits.
As millions wait on food stamp approvals, feds tell states to speed it up

To address that, DSS started making much-needed upgrades to its technology. The agency has set aside about half of the $74 million it needs to replace equipment that’s as much as five decades old.
Those upgrades “will significantly improve the state’s ability to process applications in a timely manner,” according to an agency statement.
Rising demand
But the fundamental issue is a rise in the need, according to DSS.
South Carolina, like many other states, has seen the weekly application volume for SNAP benefits rise substantially — 7,000 applications for benefits each week on average, a nearly 50% increase over pre-COVID numbers.
As of last September, one in nine South Carolinians were receiving SNAP benefits. More than half went to families with children, while more than one-third went to families with an elderly or disabled adult, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Lee Patterson has seen that firsthand as Richland County Library’s social work director who helps people fill out applications. She’s not sure why more people are applying for aid, but she suspects it’s closely tied to the rising cost of housing.
“The first bill people usually pay is the rent,” she said. “When the price of housing goes up, then the ability to pay for food goes down.”
Applicants who aren’t elderly or disabled can deduct only $672 from their income when calculating whether they qualify for food benefits. Meanwhile, the median cost of rent and utilities in South Carolina is nearly double that, according to U.S. Census data.
Patterson and her team have the experience to help smooth the way for people seeking aid. But for those applying on their own, especially for the first time, it can be tricky.
For example, when it comes to proving income changes, applicants often have to go back to a former employer and ask for documentation that shows they no longer work for that company. Those employers don’t always respond, and in some cases may have closed entirely, Patterson said.
A second pain point for applicants can be waiting for a phone interview with DSS staff, which the federal government requires for benefits. South Carolina was allowed to waive those interviews during the pandemic, likely contributing to the state’s increased error rate, but they resumed in July 2023.
The call volume for these interviews is often high, and it’s not uncommon for an applicant to wait on hold for an hour. The library has a phone available for applicants to use. If they don’t get through, they may have to return multiple days in a row to complete their interview, Patterson said.
What’s next?
Advocates expect changes to the U.S. House proposal, as several key Republicans in the Senate have publicly opposed shifting food benefit costs to states. Negotiations are expected to continue into next week, Politico reported, with the goal of passing the bill by July 4.
The final plan remains to be seen.
The executive director of Foodshare South Carolina is concerned about what might ultimately happen to other SNAP-related programs.
Omme-Salma Rahemtullah said she relies heavily on the state-funded program known as Healthy Bucks, which provides additional money for SNAP recipients to purchase fruits and vegetables. They can use these benefits at farmers markets. Or they can get a box of produce worth $20 from Foodshare.
Rahemtullah worries that if the state has to spend more on general SNAP benefits, there may be less available to keep Healthy Bucks operating.
Healthy Bucks began as a pilot in six counties in 2014. It’s since expanded to all 46 counties, according to the state Department of Social Services. In 2023, the Legislature provided an additional $5 million to the agency to further expand the program.
Beyond upping the cost to states, the federal proposal also expands requirements for SNAP recipients.
Under existing rules, people under 55 who can work — what the government calls “able-bodied adults” — are limited to three months of food benefits over a three-year period unless they can prove they work, volunteer or attend job training at least 80 hours each month, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The proposal would expand those rules by a decade — to people under 65 and, for parents of school-age children, they would be exempt if their children are younger than 8, rather than 18.
“As less money comes into the state from the federal level, the state will have to find ways to make that up for a lot of things,” said Berkowitz, the Appleseed advocate. “I just hope feeding people will be a priority.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/grocery-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 15:14:54.150245

With regard to their total nursing staff, eight of Iowa’s 410 nursing homes were staffed at least 40% below the level that was expected, based on residents’ acuity levels, during the fourth quarter of 2024. That marks a slight improvement from the 11 homes that fell into that category during the third quarter of the year.
The data also shows that among the 50 states, Iowa continues to rank in the middle of the pack, with staffing levels that average roughly 20% below expectations.

The data is reported by the facilities themselves to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and is then analyzed and published by the nonprofit Long Term Care Community Coalition. The coalition’s analysis shows that in late 2024, just over 90% of all nursing homes across the country were staffed below the level expected based on their residents’ needs.
In Iowa, the homes that provided the lowest number of total nursing staff hours per resident, per day, are scattered among both rural and urban counties. Among the 12 lowest-ranked Iowa homes, six are operated by the same company — Care Initiatives of West Des Moines.
The 12 homes, and their deviation from the expected hours per resident, per day, for all nursing staff were:
Fonda Specialty Care, Pocahontas County: 47.7% below expected levels.
Mount Ayr Health Care Center, Ringgold County: 43.9% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest-ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 44.3% below expected levels.
Accura Healthcare of Marshalltown, Marshall County: 43.5% below expected levels.
Kingsley Specialty Care, Plymouth County, 42.8% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 40% below expected levels.
Bettendorf Health Care Center, Scott County: 42.8% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest-ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 43.8% below expected levels.
Avoca Specialty Care, Pottawattamie County: 42.2% below expected levels.

Panora Specialty Care, Guthrie County: 40.5% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest-ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 42.8% below expected levels.
Northgate Care Center, Allamakee County: 39.9% below expected levels.
The Ivy at Davenport, Scott County: 39.1% below expected levels.
Aspire of Perry, Dallas County: 39.1% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest-ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 43.1% below expected levels.
Belle Plaine Specialty Care, Benton County: 39.1% below expected levels.
Fewer hours by registered nurses 
The analysis also shows that many nursing homes continue to rely on lesser skilled certified nursing aides, rather than registered nurses, to provide much of the care – with many homes falling far below the recommended level of staffing by registered nurses.
In Iowa, 12 nursing homes provided at least 60% fewer staffing hours by registered nurses than recommended. The Iowa facilities that deviated the most from the expected number of registered-nurse hours per resident, per day, during the fourth quarter of 2024 were:
Nora Springs Care Center, Floyd County: 76.9% below expected levels.
Garden View Care Center, Page County: 75.6% below expected levels.
Crystal Heights Care Center, Mahaska County: 69.7% below expected levels.
Caring Acres Nursing and Rehab Center, Cass County: 69.4% below expected levels.

Silver Oak Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, Linn County: 61.3% below expected levels.
Colonial Manors of Columbus Community, Louisa County: 60.2% below expected levels.
Congress questions staffing mandates
The staffing data shows U.S. nursing homes, on average, delivered 3.75 hours of nursing care per resident, per day – which is significantly below the 4.95 hours that would be expected based on residents’ acuity levels.
The expected staffing levels that are used as a benchmark in the analysis are calculated using an evidence-based, case-mix adjustment methodology that accounts for the specific care needs of residents within each specific care facility, using data provided by the facilities themselves.
“The significant staffing shortfall is more than just a statistic,” said Richard Mollot, LTCCC’s executive director, “it reflects the daily reality of thousands of vulnerable residents enduring avoidable pain and neglect simply because too many nursing homes are not being held accountable for meeting even basic care standards.”
The average U.S. nursing home provided 3.75 total nurse staff hours per resident day in the fourth quarter – almost the same level as the 3.73 hours reported in the third quarter.
In addition to showing that just over 90% of nursing homes are reporting staffing levels below their expected levels, the analysis indicates the median nursing home fell 24.9% short of expected total staffing levels and 42.3% short of expected staffing levels for registered nurses.
The analysis also found that more than a third of all care facilities — 36% of the total – reported no presence of a medical director, despite federal requirements that a medical director oversee the quality of clinical care provided in every facility.
As in the third quarter of 2024, only two states — Alaska and Oregon — met or exceeded their expected staffing levels, while North Dakota (-4.1%) ranked fourth in staffing adequacy, narrowly missing its expected target.
The states with the worst average staffing levels in both the third and fourth quarters of 2024 included Illinois, Texas, Missouri, Georgia, New Mexico and Indiana.
Congress is currently considering proposals that would require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to delay, until January 2035, enforcement of new minimum staffing standards for nursing homes.

The Arkansas Board of Corrections filed a lawsuit in Pulaski County Circuit Court on Dec. 14, 2023 against Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the secretary of state and Arkansas Department of Corrections, challenging the constitutionality of Act 185 and 659 of 2023.
Act 185 requires the secretary of corrections to serve at the pleasure of the governor rather than the board, while Act 659 alters the reporting structure for the directors of the Division of Correction and Division of Community Correction, requiring them to serve at the pleasure of the secretary rather than the board. 
The board argued the laws violate Amendment 33 of the Arkansas Constitution, which protects the power of constitutional boards like the board of corrections from “usurpation by the Governor or the General Assembly, or both,” according to Thursday’s ruling. 
Arkansas judge sides with prison board in dispute with governor, corrections secretary

A circuit court judge granted a preliminary injunction in January 2024, which Attorney General Tim Griffin appealed. 
The Supreme Court’s ruling Thursday dismissed the state’s motion to send the case back to the circuit court, order the preliminary injunction vacated and the case dismissed as moot.
The high court also dismissed a motion to disqualify the corrections board’s attorney from further participation in proceedings before the court. 
In its motion to remand, the state argues the controversy ended when the board fired former Corrections Secretary Joe Profiri. The firing was part of a dispute between the board and the executive branch that started in late 2023 over who controls the state’s prison system.
The board’s refusal in November 2023 to approve a request to increase prison capacity by 500 beds prompted harsh public criticism from Griffin and Sanders. The board responded by hiring an outside attorney the following month to represent it in employment matters. 
Because Profiri was fired prior to the entry of the preliminary injunction, the lower court’s finding of irreparable harm was erroneous, the state argued. The board said it wasn’t seeking court confirmation of its right to fire Profiri, but relief from the legislation regarding the board’s authority under Amendment 33. 
Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Karen Baker said she agreed with the board’s assertion that Profiri’s termination doesn’t resolve the ultimate question of whether the board controls the secretary or division directors, and therefore the dispute is not specific to the individual holding the secretary’s office. 
“The Board’s complaint concerns the Challenged Legislation and the resulting changes to the Board’s supervisory authority. This dispute exists notwithstanding the individual who holds the Secretary position and is not personal to Secretary Profiri,” Baker wrote. “Further, because this case presents an existing legal controversy, it is not moot. Therefore, we deny appellants’ motion to remand.”


Let us know what you think...




The state also filed a motion to disqualify the legal counsel obtained by the corrections board, arguing the firm was obtained illegally. The board didn’t follow state law for securing outside counsel, and the board did not have the “authority to hire special counsel because the Board is not a constitutional officer,” the attorney general’s motion argued.
The circuit court denied this motion, explaining that “the Board is a constitutionally created board, making its members constitutional officers” who therefore had the legal authority to hire special counsel.  
The attorney general typically represents state agencies, but state law gives constitutional officers the ability to hire outside counsel when they disagree with the attorney general over a constitutional provision.
In dismissing this motion, Baker notes the board correctly points out that “an order denying a motion to disqualify adversary’s counsel in a civil proceeding is not an appealable final order.”
“As a general rule, an appeal from an interlocutory decision brings up for review only the decision from which the appeal was taken, here, the granting of an injunction,” Baker wrote. The motion to disqualify the attorney is outside the scope of the Supreme Court’s review of the preliminary injunction, she said.
The high court majority affirmed the lower court’s issuance of an injunction because its “findings that there would be irreparable harm were not clearly erroneous.” 
The crux of the lawsuit, Baker wrote, is whether the board retains ultimate authority over the corrections secretary and directors or whether the challenged legislation constitutionally transfers that power to the governor and corrections secretary. 
“The evidence presented to the circuit court demonstrates that, in the absence of the injunction, the dispute will be ongoing until the constitutionality of the Challenged Legislation is resolved,” Baker said. “This, coupled with appellants’ failure to even argue their likelihood of success on the merits, leaves us with little choice under our deferential standard of review. 
“We hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the Board demonstrated that irreparable harm would result in the absence of the requested preliminary injunction, and we affirm,” she added. 
Arkansas Supreme Court sends AG’s FOIA lawsuit against prison board back to circuit court

Special Justices Troy Braswell and Bud Cummins joined in the decision. Associate Justice Barbara Webb concurred in part and dissented in part. Associate Justice Shawn Womack dissented. Associate Justices Cody Hiland and Nicholas Bronni, both of whom were appointed by the governor, did not participate. 
Webb wrote that she agreed with the majority that the matter is not moot because Profiri’s termination doesn’t resolve the question of whether Acts 185 and 659 of 2023 are unconstitutional. She also agreed that it’s not appropriate to disqualify the board’s counsel at this time. 
However, she argues the board “failed to demonstrate irreparable harm” and the circuit court therefore erred in enjoining the challenged acts. 
“The crux of the Board’s claim for irreparable harm was Secretary Profiri’s alleged acts of insubordination, which were directly attributable to Act 185 requiring the Secretary to serve at the pleasure of the Governor rather than the Board,” Webb wrote. “This harm is not irreparable…By definition, if a secretary may be terminated and his actions undone, then it cannot be said that any harm resulting therefrom is ‘irreparable.’”
In his dissenting opinion, Womack argues the court must vacate the preliminary injunction and dismiss the lawsuit because sovereign immunity bars the board’s lawsuit against the governor, corrections secretary and Department of Corrections. 
Sovereign immunity, which Womack cites often in court opinions, is the legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts.
“Even if that was not so, the Board would still lose because it failed to show irreparable harm — a necessary element to establish entitlement to a preliminary injunction,” Womack wrote “Therefore, I also join the other dissenting opinion in this case.”
Regarding the issue of the disqualification of the board’s “potentially illegally retained counsel, I again remind citizens of this state of their ability to protect themselves ‘against the enforcement of any illegal exactions whatever,’” he said.

Michael now works in a small-town hospital in Canada. KFF Health News and NPR granted him anonymity because of fears he might face reprisal from the Trump administration if he returns to the U.S. He said he feels some guilt that he did not stay to resist the Trump agenda but is assured in his decision to leave. Too much of America has simply grown too comfortable with violence and cruelty, he said.
“Part of being a physician is being kind to people who are in their weakest place,” Michael said. “And I feel like our country is devolving to really step on people who are weak and vulnerable.”
Michael is among a new wave of doctors who are leaving the United States to escape the Trump administration. In the months since Trump was reelected and returned to the White House, American doctors have shown skyrocketing interest in becoming licensed in Canada, where dozens more than normal have already been cleared to practice, according to Canadian licensing officials and recruiting businesses.
The Medical Council of Canada said in an email statement that the number of American doctors creating accounts on physiciansapply.ca, which is “typically the first step” to being licensed in Canada, has increased more than 750% over the past seven months compared with the same time period last year — from 71 applicants to 615. Separately, medical licensing organizations in Canada’s most populous provinces reported a rise in Americans either applying for or receiving Canadian licenses, with at least some doctors disclosing they were moving specifically because of Trump.
“The doctors that we are talking to are embarrassed to say they’re Americans,” said John Philpott, CEO of CanAm Physician Recruiting, which recruits doctors into Canada. “They state that right out of the gate: ‘I have to leave this country. It is not what it used to be.’”
Canada, which has universal publicly funded health care, has long been an option for U.S.-trained doctors seeking an alternative to the American health care system. While it was once more difficult for American doctors to practice in Canada due to discrepancies in medical education standards, Canadian provinces have relaxed some licensing regulations in recent years, and some are expediting licensing for U.S.-trained physicians.
In mere months, the Trump administration has jeopardized the economy with tariffs, ignored court orders and due process, and threatened the sovereignty of U.S. allies, including Canada. The administration has also taken steps that may unnerve doctors specifically, including appointing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead federal health agencies, shifting money away from pandemic preparedness, discouraging gender-affirming care, demonizing fluoride, and supporting deep cuts to Medicaid.
The Trump administration did not provide any comment for this article. When asked to respond to doctors’ leaving the U.S. for Canada, White House spokesperson Kush Desai asked whether KFF Health News knew the precise number of doctors and their “citizenship status,” then provided no further comment. KFF Health News did not have or provide this information.
Philpott, who founded CanAm Physician Recruiting in the 1990s, said the cross-border movement of American and Canadian doctors has for decades ebbed and flowed in reaction to political and economic fluctuations, but that the pull toward Canada has never been as strong as now.
Philpott said CanAm had seen a 65% increase in American doctors looking for Canadian jobs from January to April, and that the company has been contacted by as many as 15 American doctors a day.
Rohini Patel, a CanAm recruiter and doctor, said some consider pay cuts to move quickly.
“They’re ready to move to Canada tomorrow,” she said. “They are not concerned about what their income is.”
The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which handles licensing in Canada’s most populous province, said in a statement that it registered 116 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of 2025 — an increase of at least 50% over the prior two quarters. Ontario also received license applications from about 260 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of this year, the organization said.
British Columbia, another populous province, saw a surge of licensure applications from U.S.-trained doctors after Election Day, according to an email statement from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. The statement also said the organization licensed 28 such doctors in the fiscal year that ended in February — triple the total of the prior year.
Quebec’s College of Physicians said applications from U.S.-trained doctors have increased, along with the number of Canadian doctors returning from America to practice within the province, but it did not provide specifics. In a statement, the organization said some applicants were trying to get permitted to practice in Canada “specifically because of the actual presidential administration.”
Michael, the physician who moved to Canada this year, said he had long been wary of what he described as escalating right-ring political rhetoric and unchecked gun violence in the United States, the latter of which he witnessed firsthand during a decade working in American emergency rooms.
Michael said he began considering the move as Trump was running for reelection in 2020. His breaking point came on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob of Trump supporters besieged the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the election of Joe Biden as president.
“Civil discourse was falling apart,” he said. “I had a conversation with my family about how Biden was going to be a one-term president and we were still headed in a direction of being increasingly radicalized toward the right and an acceptance of vigilantism.”
It then took about a year for Michael to become licensed in Canada, then longer for him to finalize his job and move, he said. While the licensing process was “not difficult,” he said, it did require him to obtain certified documents from his medical school and residency program.
“The process wasn’t any harder than getting your first license in the United States, which is also very bureaucratic,” Michael said. “The difference is, I think most people practicing in the U.S. have got so much administrative fatigue that they don’t want to go through that process again.”
Michael said he now receives near-daily emails or texts from American doctors who are seeking advice about moving to Canada.
This desire to leave has also been striking to Hippocratic Adventures, a small business that helps American doctors practice medicine in other countries.
The company was co-founded by Ashwini Bapat, a Yale-educated doctor who moved to Portugal in 2020 in part because she was “terrified that Trump would win again.” For years, Hippocratic Adventures catered to physicians with wanderlust, guiding them through the bureaucracy of getting licensed in foreign nations or conducting telemedicine from afar, Bapat said.
But after Trump was reelected, customers were no longer seeking grand travels across the globe, Bapat said. Now they were searching for the nearest emergency exit, she said.
“Previously it had been about adventure,” Bapat said. “But the biggest spike that we saw, for sure, hands down, was when Trump won reelection in November. And then Inauguration Day. And basically every single day since then.”
At least one Canadian province is actively marketing itself to American doctors.
Doctors Manitoba, which represents physicians in the rural province that struggles with one of Canada’s worst doctor shortages, launched a recruiting campaign after the election to capitalize on Trump and the rise of far-right politics in the U.S.
The campaign focuses on Florida and North and South Dakota and advertises “zero political interference in physician patient relationship” as a selling point.
Alison Carleton, a family medicine doctor who moved from Iowa to Manitoba in 2017, said she left to escape the daily grind of America’s for-profit health care system and because she was appalled that Trump was elected the first time.
Carleton said she now runs a small-town clinic with low stress, less paperwork, and no fear of burying her patients in medical debt.
She dropped her American citizenship last year.
“People I know have said, ‘You left just in time,’” Carleton said. “I tell people, ‘I know. When are you going to move?’”

(Photo courtesy the Maryland Department of the Environment)A 2,000-gallon diesel spill from tanks on the Johns Hopkins Hospital campus in East Baltimore that contaminated a portion of the Baltimore harbor had been contained as of Thursday morning, officials say.
The fuel traveled about 1.3 miles through the city’s storm drains after Wednesday’s spill and emptied into the Patapsco River near Harbor East, officials said at a Thursday morning news conference.
Officials from city, state and federal agencies responded to the spill Wednesday afternoon and overnight, which caused an odor in the surrounding area, and turned the water red, thanks to a dye in the oil.
With about 600 feet of booms, the spill was contained to a marina area about 150 yards wide and 200 yards long, near the South Central Avenue Bridge, where a number of sailboats and other watercraft are moored.

“This has been a robust and a truly collective effort,” said Gov. Wes Moore (D), who responded to the scene in Baltimore early  Thursday. “We have seen over 100 personnel literally work through the night to make sure that we had this situation under control and contained.”
A third-party vendor was delivering the diesel to the hospital when the spill occurred, read a statement from Liz Vandendriessche, a Hopkins spokesperson. The fuel was being pumped into two tanks, which supply power for backup generators at the hospital, but they were overfilled, leading to the spill.
Hopkins officials reported the leak at about 11 a.m. Wednesday, initially calling it a “contained 200 gallon diesel spill,” according to a news release from Moore’s office.
But by 1 p.m., Baltimore City fire officials were responding to a 911 call reporting a fuel spill at a Harbor East marina. First responders from the city, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the U.S. Coast Guard “very, very rapidly” deployed a boom to contain the contamination, said Baltimore Fire Chief James Wallace.
“Those actions taken by those three agencies have really reduced the footprint of this incident,” Wallace said. “This could have been far, far worse than what it was.”
At 6:48 p.m. Wednesday, Hopkins modified its report, indicating that it was a 2,000-gallon uncontained spill, according to the governor’s office.
“We immediately notified the Maryland Department of Environment of the overflow while continuing to investigate, and we proactively reached out again to MDE as we learned more about the estimated overflow volume,” said Vandendriessche. “We also are actively working with local, state and federal authorities to support the response in the Baltimore Inner Harbor.”
As of Thursday morning, officials were flushing the storm drains to force the rest of the diesel out of the underground pipes and into the containment area in the harbor, Wallace said. From there, the contaminated water could be pumped into a 4,000-gallon pump truck.

“We need to push the product down, push it down to the harbor, where we have skimmers, where we have capability to capture and retain product,” Wallace said. “So, that’s the operation right now. This operation will continue through a majority of the day.”
State officials found about a dozen geese that had been covered in oil, which were captured and taken in by a wildlife rehabilitator, said Geoffrey Donahue, director of Emergency Preparedness and Response at the Maryland Department of the Environment.
Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott said that city officials were evaluating the city’s storm drain system to ensure the flushing effort succeeded.
“They have the capability to look at that by GIS mapping, but we also had them physically going and popping manholes, because nothing beats being able to see it — or in this case, see it and smell it — with your own eyes, ears and nose,” Scott said.
Emergency response teams were preparing Thursday for the possibility of rain in the days ahead, particularly Friday afternoon, which could flood the storm drains with runoff and complicate the effort to flush the system in a controlled manner.
“Should this happen, and rain come behind it, we’re going to lose control — in the worst case scenario,” Wallace said. “But right now, as I said, we’re absolutely on schedule.”

More than 300 students and staff prepare for plug to be pulled on Wind River Job Corps, severing path to certifications, high school diplomas and driver’s licenses. 
The post Wyoming students ‘devastated’ after federal decree upends Riverton trade school appeared first on WyoFile .","RIVERTON—What began as a trickle soon turned into a flood of people streaming out of the Wind River Job Corps. More than 100 students and staff walked off the campus Wednesday afternoon to raise awareness of their plight: that Wyoming’s only Job Corps center will soon be shuttered by federal decree. 
The students were predominantly young men, and most had dropped out of high school. Some had made mistakes, finding themselves in trouble with the law. Others had gotten mixed up with drugs, lived on the streets and served prison time. Some, feeling aimless, just wanted to find purpose. 
All had found promise here at Wind River Job Corps, a trade school that offers paths to high school diplomas, driver’s licenses and certifications in fields like welding and truck driving. 
Igor Bool grew up in Ukraine and was adopted by a Gillette family when he was 13. As a teenager, he said, he made bad choices. Bool, now 17, came to Wind River Job Corps “to start a life and start making better choices … and find a career that could potentially lead me to a life of success.”
The center, which employs roughly 150 people and currently serves 178 students, was thrown into chaos when the U.S. Department of Labor announced last week it would pause operations at contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide. The decision aligns with President Donald Trump’s budget proposal and “reflects the Administration’s commitment to ensure federal workforce investments deliver meaningful results for both students and taxpayers,” the announcement read. 
For Wyoming’s only Job Corps center the news has disrupted career tracks and left employees and students reeling. Staff have spent the past week scrambling to prepare for an abrupt closure date of June 23, and fear the loss will leave many students to fend for themselves with zero resources. 
“Our kids are just devastated,” said Wind River Job Corps administrator Jerri Prejean. “It’s so sad.”

Bool just arrived at the center in April. He is nearly finished with the online high school program to earn his diploma but won’t be able to start his training in petroleum. Though disappointed by the news, Bool showed resilience beyond his years. 
“I was kind of disappointed because I have no place to go, so I thought they were just gonna put me back on the streets,” he said. “But it is what it is. I can only control myself and my choices and what I’m gonna do, I cannot control the situation because it’s out of my hands. So I just gotta stay positive.”
Not everyone was as upbeat. 
Jamie Maloid, 25, is one of the lucky ones. Having arrived at Job Corps in 2023, he just graduated after finishing his certifications in the petroleum program. He plans to move to Greeley and start a career. 
“For the other people that aren’t finished, I feel bad,” Maloid said. “I kind of feel like just taking that opportunity away from them that I was able to gain is heartbreaking.”
Incidents, budget
Job Corps is a 61-year-old federal program that offers free career training for low-income young adults. Funded by Congress, the program seeks to teach young people the academic and vocational skills they need to secure meaningful and lasting employment. The program was created in 1964 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty.
Wind River Job Corps is a comparatively new center. The campus opened in 2015, north of Riverton, to much fanfare with dignitaries attending the grand opening and touting the economic boost promised by its first-of-its-kind petroleum technician training program.
It includes classrooms, hands-on training facilities and dorms. Students come from around the country to attend the program, including from Wyoming and the nearby Wind River Indian Reservation. Through the program, they can obtain their driver’s licence, high school diploma and career preparation in one of 10 trades — from carpentry to electrical work and heavy equipment mechanics.

Once they get their certifications, Prejean said, staff ushers them through a transition phase to ensure the student has job placement, an apprenticeship, college, military or advanced training. Wind River Job Corps even pays to fly the students to where their next life stage will take place. 
“I try to do job placement with students around our community,” Prejean said, noting that she works with local companies like Bechtel Construction to funnel skilled workers into Wyoming positions. 
Some 75% of Wind River Job Corps students graduate, she said. “Of those, 85% go to a job trade match. You don’t even have those kinds of numbers from college.”
The success of Riverton’s center does not match a national narrative cited in the closure decree, Prejean said.
In April, the Department of Labor released the Job Corps Transparency Report, which analyzed the financial performance and operational costs of the most recently available metrics from program year 2023. According to that report, the national program’s average graduation rate is less than 40%, and it costs $80,000 per student per year. Job Corps also has faced significant financial challenges under its current operating structure, the DOL release said, including a $140 million deficit in 2024.   
Those findings spurred the DOL to pause the program. It halted contracts to its 99 contract-operated centers, which will impact an estimated 25,000 students. 
“A startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve,” Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a release about the pause.

The narrative painted in that report — which used data from the end of the COVID-19 pandemic — is incongruous with Wind River Job Corps, Prejean said. It has clear benefits to students, local businesses that need skilled workers and the 150 employees who are residents of Fremont County, she said. 
Due to DOL’s mandate, Wind River staff are anticipating a closing day of June 23 unless some overriding action occurs. The outcome of the federal budget bill, officially called the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” could also impact the program. The bill passed the U.S. House last week and must still clear the Senate. 
“All students will be connected with the resources they need to succeed as this transition takes place,” the DOL said in its release. 
At Wind River, however, staff and students did not see it that way. 
Uncertainty
In the final weeks before the anticipated closing, staff are racing to secure job placements and obtain diplomas for the students. But for students and staff, the future beyond that is a question mark. 
Jaden Flowers, 23, didn’t finish high school in Los Angeles, where he grew up. He had a child at age 15 and his mom was sick, he said, so school wasn’t a priority. He migrated to Colorado after that, and was unhoused and unable to find a job this spring when he discovered Job Corps.

He’s only been in Riverton for two months and said it’s been a great experience. He is trying to get as many petroleum certifications as possible before June 23, he said, so at least he’ll have some leverage for finding a job. In terms of a plan, however, he hasn’t figured that out. 
“I don’t really have nowhere to go, so it’s just back to where I left off,” he said. 
That’s a common story, he added. 
“It’s a mess. It’s crazy how they’re just kicking us out, with nothing, no place to go,” Flowers said. Wind River Job Corps teachers are doing everything they can to help, he added. “They are really trying.” 
Joshuwa Begley, 25, is nearly finished with the program. He arrived two years ago, looking for a change from his life of meaningless jobs and substance abuse, he said. It worked. 
“I changed my life,” he said. “I am a year sober from all the drugs I used to do.”
He earned his high school diploma at Job Corps and just needs to pass a final test to complete his heavy truck driving program.

Begley had intended to stay in the area and had found a job with a local construction business. But because he won’t receive the completion money promised to him in the Job Corps contract and he doesn’t have a place to live, he said, he is instead going back to Georgia where he’ll move in with his grandmother. 
“It just kind of sucks,” Begley said. “All my hard work is going down the drain.”
Junior Chapa, 21, was incarcerated for two years in prison in Texas. When he got out, his probation officer suggested Job Corps. 
“So I came here to better myself, get my high school and my trade and stuff like that,” he said. He intended to obtain heavy truck driving and petroleum-related certifications. “This was like my only option to do better.”
He isn’t sure what he’ll do now, he said. 
Employees are also reeling, said Samantha March, who works in human resources. Many staffers have come to her seeking answers, she said Wednesday, pausing as she choked up. “And we don’t have any to give.” 
Another employee, Kathy, who declined to give her last name, said she worked all weekend trying to help students. 
The closure is profoundly unfortunate, she said. “We may not be 100% successful with every student that comes here, but we have changed enough lives that it is 100% worth it.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Early 2027 could be when Rhode Island’s two casinos finally go smoke free under a compromise brokered by the Senate’s new majority leader.
Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, told Rhode Island Current Thursday that legislation will likely come before the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming next week. The long-awaited proposal ends a loophole that has allowed Bally’s Lincoln and Tiverton casinos to avoid the state’s indoor smoking ban.
“This took a lot of time meeting with Bally’s and the union representing the people there,” Ciccone said in an interview
But Patti Doyle, a Bally’s spokesperson, said it’s not a done deal.
“Conversations between Bally’s and other stakeholders are ongoing,” Doyle said in an email.
Ciccone has long opposed banning smoking at the two casinos, saying he believes it would cost visitors, and revenue. He initially sought to negotiate an agreement between the Providence-based casino giant and its union workers to expand existing non-smoking areas at the Lincoln facility. But union officials opposed any deals that kept smoke inside, Ciccone said.
Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley said in an interview Thursday that workers were willing to find common ground, but their goal was always to get smoking out of the state’s two casinos.
“It’s not good for them, it’s not good for the customers, it’s not good for the state,” Crowley said.
So Ciccone instead focused on what Bally’s could stomach in the effort to end smoking. That led to his last-minute filing of a bill, submitted on May 23, to raise the cap on marketing reimbursements the company receives from the Rhode Island Lottery — a measure the Senate approved 32-4 on Tuesday despite objections from state regulators.
While seemingly unrelated to the smoking debate, the marketing measure intends to help Bally’s offset any revenue losses from a smoking ban. The company has projected an annual loss of $20 million, Doyle previously said.
Should the revised legislation be approved by the General Assembly, Ciccone said the ban would take effect January 2027. The original companion bills introduced by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski and Rep. Teresa Tanzi, both South Kingstown Democrats, called for smoking inside the state’s casinos to cease immediately upon the governor’s signature.
Sosnowski did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Tanzi questioned why the Senate would consider allowing employees to work within the smoke for an additional 18 months.
“These workers deserve to have a smoke-free environment now,” she said in an interview. “I look forward to understanding the justification of the 18-month delay.”
But Crowley called Ciccone’s proposed date “a big win” for Bally’s workers, who have spent years urging lawmakers to end smoking at casinos. The proposal was among the top legislative priorities this year for the AFL-CIO, which commissioned a poll in February suggesting nearly 7 in 10 survey respondents “strongly” or “somewhat” supported a smoking ban.
Legislative leaders also appear on board. Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi is one of 10 co-sponsors listed on the latest edition of Tanzi’s bill, which has the backing of 55 of the chamber’s 75 members. Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, has stated she personally supports a smoking ban.

Senate rolls the dice on more online betting vendors 
New compromise struck on the smoking ban comes a day after the Senate voted 30-3 in support of Ciccone’s bill to open Rhode Island’s online sports betting industry to new vendors, ending International Game Technology (IGT) PLC’s five-year monopoly over the state’s digital sportsbook.
Democratic Sens. Dawn Euer of Newport, Tiara Mack of Providence, and Linda Ujifusa of Portsmouth voted against the legislation.
The bill as approved in a revised form bars the Rhode Island Lottery from extending IGT’s contract beyond Jan. 31, 2026, even though the company’s deal to operate the Sportsbook RI app runs through November of that year. Ciccone said Thursday that the change was made to align with the Lottery’s plans to issue a request for information on expansion in the first quarter of 2026.
A Lottery-commissioned report by Spectrum Gaming Group recommended adding four to six new online sports betting vendors, but only if the state makes itself more attractive to popular companies like DraftKings and FanDuel.
Spectrum found that companies may not be interested in expanding to Rhode Island due to its 51% tax on operators’ revenues — tied with New York and New Hampshire for the steepest in the country.
Lottery Director Mark Furcolo wrote to the Senate Committee on Gaming and Labor on April 30 that the legislation could violate regulators’ constitutional authority to renew gaming contracts. Furcolo also had concerns with the economic feasibility of expanding to five vendors.
“The bill now addresses our primary concerns but does not eliminate the constitutional issue raised in the letter,” Paul Grimaldi, a spokesperson for the Lottery, said in an email Thursday.
Ciccone’s bill now heads to the House for consideration. Companion legislation sponsored by Rep. Matthew Dawson, an East Providence Democrat, remains held for further study following its initial May 1 hearing before the House Committee on Finance.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is term-limited and announced he will run for Colorado governor in 2026. The Democrat has joined a growing number of legal challenges to Trump administration policies. 
Other Democrats running for attorney general include Secretary of State Jena Griswold, Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty, former speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Crisanta Duran and worker and consumer rights attorney David Seligman. Conner Pennington is the only Republican candidate to file paperwork in the race so far.
Doshi’s campaign website says she will focus on defending Colorado from actions from the Trump administration, fighting for a fair economy and protecting Colorado’s rights, values and public safety. 
“Right now, the rule of law is under attack by those who have abandoned patriotism for power. Colorado’s next Attorney General must have a proven record of taking on the toughest fights — and winning,” Doshi said. “I’ve taken on powerful executives in boardrooms and corrupt officials in government, and I’m ready to defend the rights and freedoms of every Coloradan.”
The attorney general heads the Colorado Department of Law and oversees enforcement of consumer protection and antitrust laws, defends state laws in legal challenges, and advocates for law enforcement and community safety.  
Primary elections to decide party nominees for state offices will be held in June 2026.

“The President’s budget will greatly endanger wild horses and burros,” Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada, said in a statement to the Current. “I am deeply concerned by how these cuts will impact the care of these beloved creatures. Even more worrying is the omission of the long-standing provision against horse slaughter.”
The proposal, horse and burro advocates note, mirrors Trump’s 2017 budget, which initially called for a 30% cut to the program’s funding and the elimination of protections against slaughter. Congress restored the protections against killing the animals and augmented funding.
“Typically, the president’s appropriations bill contains a provision prohibiting horse slaughter. The Trump budget bill does not have this provision, opening the door to animals being sold off for slaughter,” said Dick Cooper, a spokesman for Titus.

The budget proposal is straight from the pages of Project 2025, the ultra-conservative manifesto of which Trump once claimed ignorance, but has since adopted de facto as a blueprint for his policies.
“What is happening to these once-proud beasts of burden is neither compassionate nor humane, and what these animals are doing to federal lands and fragile ecosystems is unacceptable,” says Project 2025, which asserted “the uncontrolled growth of wild horses and burros poses an existential threat to public lands.”
More than half of the nation’s wild horses, estimated between 70,000 and 95,000, are in Nevada, notes Project 2025. “Congress must enact laws permitting the BLM to dispose humanely of these animals.”
The policy is an “attack on animal welfare and America’s public lands,” according to American Wild Horse Conservation (AWHC), a wild horse advocacy organization.
“This budget would be a bullet to the head of America’s wild horses if passed by Congress,” said Suzanne Roy, executive director of AWHC. “Slaughter is a barbaric solution to a fundamentally broken federal program.”
The current program is focused on what critics contend are inhumane roundups that end in the warehousing of the creatures in government holding facilities.
A better solution, say horse advocates, is increasing fertility control efforts and restoring habitat.
Last month, Titus announced the formation of the Wild Horse Congressional Caucus, “to encourage federal policies for more humane treatment of wild horses and burros,” according to a news release.
Days later, Titus and 82 members of Congress urged a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee to craft legislation requiring the BLM to spend at least 10% of the Wild Horse and Burro program’s $140 million budget on fertility control in additional herd management areas.
Utah horseman concludes 6,000-mile ride through 25 states to spotlight the wild horse crisis

“The letter included several requests but notably included language maintaining the prohibition on the sale or adoption of healthy wild horses and burros that results in their destruction,” Titus said in a news release.
Titus has opposed the BLM’s use of aircraft in roundups. The U.S. has paid helicopter companies $57.4 million for roundups since 2006, according to Titus, a process she has attempted to ban.
“Scientific research has shown that more humane and cost-effective alternatives, like fertility control, are equally effective in controlling equine populations,” according to the May statement from Titus announcing the Wild Horse caucus. “The BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program, however, currently spends less than four percent of its budget on these methods.”
Diverse interests, ranging from cattle ranchers to animal activists, have called for vast reductions to wild horse populations, which they contend are three times the number public lands can accommodate.
“The greatest threat to our wild horses and burros and our public lands right now isn’t the BLM, it’s not cattle, ranching or mining interests. It’s not animal advocates. It’s climate change and the new reality is fast settling in,” Stephanie Boyles Griffin, the chief scientist of the Humane Society of the United States’ (now Humane World for Animals’) wildlife protection department,  told Reuters in 2021.
Americans, deeply divided on a plethora of topics, are on common ground when it comes to wild horses, says AWHC, which commissioned a 2017 poll that revealed 83% of Trump voters supported protecting wild horses and burros from slaughter, compared with 77% of Hillary Clinton’s supporters.
“After decades of costly and ineffective roundups, the BLM now stockpiles more wild horses in government pens than remain free on the range,” said Roy in a news release. “Americans deserve a better federal plan that  genuinely tackles off-range holding issues without resorting to slaughter.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-05 18:10:12+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT municipal camp bills, proposed after Bethany scandal, expire",Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/05/bethany-ct-scandal-camp-licensure-bill/,Proposed regulations spurred by a child sex abuse scandal at a Bethany camp will not come to pass after session ended without a vote on them.,"Some lawmakers’ attempts to pass two bills spurred by a child sex abuse scandal at a town-run camp in Bethany came to an end at midnight on Wednesday when the legislative session came to a close. 
Senate Bill 6, which would have required camps operated by towns and cities across Connecticut to be regulated by the state, had received support in the Senate, but efforts to move that forward came to an unceremonious end when the House failed to take it up on the last day of the session. House Bill 6952, which would have required a more limited set of safety measures for those camps, was never voted on by either chamber.
“It’s very unfortunate, disappointing,” Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Bethany, told The Connecticut Mirror on the Senate floor Wednesday night. “I hope that we’ll get the chance to try again next year.”
Cabrera said he thinks that confusion over S.B. 6 and its impact stood in its way. In addition to other unrelated provisions on food assistance, disconnected youth and the Early Start program, that bill would have required municipal camps to be licensed by the Office of Early Childhood in the same way that private camps are. 
Municipalities overwhelmingly voiced opposition to the legislation, citing concerns about the financial impact of complying with regulations like ratios of bathrooms to the number of campers. They said that such changes could close camps and shut low-income families out of an inexpensive child care option in the summer months. Advocates argued that these concerns were overblown and that it was possible to get to a middle ground that would have assured the safety of campers with only modest increases in cost.
The bill gained traction after a scathing report was released on May 15 that detailed the findings of an internal investigation into how the town of Bethany and its first selectwoman, Paula Cofrancesco, handled allegations of sexual abuse by an employee who worked with children at the local school and in the town-run summer camp. 
After Cofrancesco learned of those allegations, the report found that she deceived Bethany residents and failed to protect local children from an alleged abuser — then resisted efforts to make those programs safer. More than a year later, no arrest had been made despite findings by experts at the Yale Child Advocacy Center and the state Department of Children and Families that the allegations were credible, and in that time an additional victim alleges she was abused.
The report also found that Bethany’s Parks and Recreation Department was poorly run. According to the report, the department “had no filing or record-keeping system, written safety policies, or documented training protocols for its staff.” 
According to an interview in the report with Cofrancesco’s assistant, no background checks were conducted until 2024. 
Cofrancesco was among the voices of opposition back in 2023 when the legislature took up a similar bill that attempted to create oversight for town camps. At the time, she argued that municipal camps already received enough oversight, including from elected leaders like herself.
Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, who is co-chair of the Committee on Children, had championed the bill’s passage on the Senate floor. She said that licensing municipal camps is an equity issue, because many low-income families rely on town camps and should be able to count on them to be checked for safety, on par with the way the state regulates private camps.
Maher said she believes there is a pathway forward to come to an agreement in the future and had hoped to carve out a middle ground that would have satisfied the concerns of municipalities. She had hoped to develop a task force to bring stakeholders to the table to discuss the best path forward.
“The most important thing to me is that municipal camps are taking care of our children, that our children are safe, that parents know that their child is safe in the summer,” she said. “Most parents drop their kids off and have no idea that they are not licensed and there’s no oversight except through the municipality. So, we want to make sure that there’s first aid training, that there’s mandated reporter training, that they have staffing ratios that make sense that keep kids safe.”
H.B. 6952 was an attempt to carve out a more modest set of regulations based on safety concerns. That bill would have required prospective employees age 18 and older to submit to comprehensive background checks, which many municipal camps say that they already do but which is not required by the state. It would also have required at least one staff member over the age of 18 for every 12 children, mandatory reporter training for leadership, and that such programs, because they are exempt from camp licensing, would not be allowed to call themselves “camps.” 
Many municipal Parks and Recreation departments took issue with the bills. In written testimony, Stephanie Crane, the recreation director for Bolton, said the S.B. 6 “could result in reduced program registrations, the loss of high school employees, and potentially force the closure of many recreational programs due to staffing shortages.”
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, also spoke out in opposition to the bill on the Senate floor. 
“I think it’s a great thing that you want to feel better, but I can tell you that you are not going to protect children with a piece of legislation that will not stop someone from putting hands on children,” Osten said on the Senate floor. “The only thing that stops people from putting hands on children is to put them in jail, to incarcerate those people, to make sure they stay there a really long time. And when they get out to follow them and make sure they get the treatment they can. And our bills today don’t address that issue.” 
Rep. Mary Welander, D-Orange, said she hoped to come to the table next year, and was encouraged by testimony submitted by municipal camps.
“The good news is that through the public hearing we did learn that the overwhelming majority, if not the entirety of municipal camps are already doing the vast majority of what was being asked for,” she said.
Welander said that while background checks would not have prevented the Bethany case, since that counselor did not yet have a record at the time of the alleged abuse, the internal investigation did raise concerns and questions about what else could be done to prevent a similar case in the future. 
“It’s not just about background checks, it’s also about best practices,” she said, emphasizing that there should be measures in place to ensure that concerning behavior is addressed, “and that the people that work with the children are taught to recognize the signs that something might be going on that is unacceptable.”
But for Acting Child Advocate Christina Ghio, background checks are still the major focus. 
“From our perspective the core of the issue is that background checking, so I hope there is a way to make sure that, at a minimum, we can get background checks for all of those settings even if we can’t get full licensure.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_1001_SR_Bethany_015-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

As part of police accountability measures passed in 2021, the Legislature required law enforcement agencies to report to the state Criminal Justice Training Commission when officers leave the department for any reason, use force that results in death or serious injury, are charged with a crime or are found to commit certain misconduct.
The law also required departments to continue investigations even if an officer resigns before the probe is finished.
This is meant to ensure “bad-apple” officers who should lose their state certification don’t slip through the cracks. Losing those credentials blocks officers from working as police in the state, even if they quit their job to evade formal discipline.
The Criminal Justice Training Commission suspected agencies weren’t reporting misconduct as they should have. So it requested the state auditor’s office look into compliance.
Officials see the resulting audits as a teaching moment on the new reporting requirements. The objective is to increase public trust and improve transparency.
“This isn’t like a gotcha, it’s not a punishment,” said Kimberly Bliss, the commission’s assistant director focused on certification. “This is an educational piece for us to make sure that agencies across the board learn what they’re supposed to be doing.”
Last month, Bliss and Michael Huynh, from the state auditor’s office, led a presentation on the audits at the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs conference in Spokane. Afterward, police officials told Bliss they realized they hadn’t reported correctly.
The first two new audits, of the Renton and Des Moines police departments, both showed missteps.
After reviewing department records, auditors found Des Moines didn’t report three of four sustained misconduct allegations. That conduct included violations of the state’s controversial pursuit law that lawmakers later rolled back, wrongful use of a Taser and improper handling of drug evidence.
Des Moines Police Chief Ted Boe blamed the lack of reporting on the law being unclear. For example, while some parts of the statute are more specific, one provision says officers can be decertified for failing “to meet the ethical and professional standards required of a peace officer or corrections officer.”
In response, the Criminal Justice Training Commission agreed to develop guidance on what conduct falls under that umbrella.
Des Moines also notified the state training commission of all officers who had left, but four of those notices came well after the 15-day window in the law.
Meanwhile, in Renton, auditors found the department didn’t report that two officers were involved in a use of force incident in 2022 until learning of the audit. The chief said this was an oversight.
Renton also was a little late on reporting two officer separations.
For both departments, the auditor’s office recommended outlining the reporting process in agency policy.
“One thing we found was that one person would be responsible for notifications, and if they didn’t do it, no one knew,” said Huynh, a program manager with the auditor’s office.
Police accountability advocates see failing to comply with the law as a symptom of a systemic problem.
“This is not an oversight. It’s a pattern. A culture. One where data is withheld, timelines are ignored, and truth is treated like a suggestion,” Nickeia Hunter, whose brother was killed by police, said in an email. “Until truth is demanded and enforced, we will remain stuck in a cycle where transparency is performative and justice is optional.”
Next up for these new state audits are the Kitsap County Sheriff’s Office and the police wing of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. Auditors will continue looking into a pair of agencies at a time indefinitely.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/police-cars-night-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

Renee Erickson, second from left, a Wichita Republican who leads the Kansas Legislature's school finance task force, said Kansas should retain use of high school graduation statistics to measure student achievement despite criticism it was unclear earning the diploma meant students were prepared for college or the workforce. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Legislature's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Disagreement exists on the Kansas Legislature’s task force reworking the state’s public school finance formula about the importance of high school graduation rate as a measure of student success.
A member of the task force pointed to alleged manipulation of student records at Wichita Southeast High School as evidence of why a district’s annual graduation rate shouldn’t be viewed as a significant metric, while others defended graduation rates as an evaluation tool when determining whether districts prepared students for the workplace or college.
Rep. Kristey Williams, an Augusta Republican, said the Wichita school district had touted a 5.1 percentage point surge in its graduation rate in 2024 to 84.3%. Wichita Southeast’s graduation rate climbed 12.5 percentage points in 2024 to a record-high 86.3%.
Southeast’s principal was replaced last week amid reports of suspected grade fixing that may have been associated with helping students meet graduation requirements.
“I wouldn’t use graduation rates,” said Williams, who didn’t see a meaningful correlation between graduation rate and student success. “If we want to baby sit, that’s one thing. If we want to have a safe place for them, that’s one thing. But that doesn’t mean you’re learning anything.”
Frank Harwood, a deputy commissioner of the Kansas State Department of Education, said one potential incident of administrative misconduct shouldn’t justify dismissal of graduation rates as a means of measuring school districts.
“When you look at any industry, including the Legislature, there are bad actors,” he said. “It doesn’t mean you should throw out that metric all together. I’m not saying graduation rate is the best indicator, but I think it is an indicator that we can’t just ignore.”
The Kansas State Board of Education made elevating the state’s high school graduation rate a feature in its “Kansans Can” agenda and in terms of school district accreditation. The state board’s graduation-rate goal was set at 95%.
Kansas’ adjusted cohort graduation rate, which tracked student graduation within four years and took into account transfers, has ranged from 86% to 89% during the past decade.
In 2022-2023, more than 90 of the state’s 287 school districts graduated 100% of students. Twenty school districts had graduation rates below 80% during that academic year. The Wichita district’s graduation rate was at 79.2% during that period, while the Kansas City, Kansas, district came in at 73.4%.
Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican serving as chairwoman of the Legislature’s school-finance task force, said Kansas should continue to include graduation rate in a set of evaluation metrics. She said the state needed to develop a definition of what a high school diploma revealed about students.
Erickson said employers had reported a high school diploma didn’t guarantee a quality worker. University or college officials indicated high school graduates didn’t necessarily have skills to succeed in higher education, she said.
“I have post-secondary folks in my office frequently and they’re saying, ‘They’re not prepared for our level of work,'” the senator said. “I’m not blaming. I’m just telling you, if you can’t acknowledge that, we’ve got a problem.”
Task force member Pat Pettey, a Democratic senator from Kansas City, Kansas, said it would be folly to drop the graduation rate as an indicator of a school district’s ability to prepare students for the future.
“I still am a strong supporter of graduation rates because having a high school diploma is a key to opening the first door to get a job. I don’t believe it is the key, but if they don’t have that they’re not on a trajectory to be economically successful,” Pettey said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Renee-Erickson-education-task-force.png,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.

When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.










These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.


– Celina Damian, California student loan servicing ombudsperson


Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
‘Can’t wait for Washington’
Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.

Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
Repayment
Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.

“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
‘Incentive to hike prices’
Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

Potholes deepen in Fairbanks, washed-out culverts block salmon in the Mat-Su, and rural communities from Ketchikan to Kotzebue are left waiting on repairs that may never come. A trip on the Kenai Peninsula leaves your teeth rattling and your fishing poles clanking in the back of your rig. Our state’s transportation system is in a state of disrepair.  
And yet the state is poised to spend at least half a billion dollars building a second bridge across one of Alaska’s most ecologically significant and beloved wetlands: the Mendenhall Wetlands in Juneau. 
The proposed Juneau-Douglas Second Crossing – termed the Juneau Douglas North Crossing by DOWL, the engineering firm contracted to assess and build this structure – is being marketed as a strategy to reduce commute times, link the Douglas Island communities to emergency services, and promote development. But even if these reasons are held up under scrutiny – and none of them are as simple as they sound – the second bridge comes at a staggering cost estimated between $290-450 million. In a time when Alaska faces over $2 billion in deferred maintenance on existing roads and bridges, we must ask: Is this the best use of public funds? 
Juneau has already developed more than 40% of its wetlands. In a state where habitat loss is often distant and gradual, the proposed Second Crossing represents an immediate and irreversible threat to an intact, high-value ecosystem. Once roads and bridges fragment this landscape, the consequences – disrupted migration, habitat degradation, declining fish and bird populations— are permanent.  
A Highway to Nowhere?
The Juneau Douglas Second Crossing’s installation bill could exceed half a billion dollars, which doesn’t include annual maintenance costs. That’s money that could fix existing infrastructure all over the state, such as roads that rural Alaskans use to access schools, groceries, medical care, and subsistence hunting and fishing grounds. Project funds could also easily maintain the bridge that currently exists between Douglas Island and the Juneau mainland.  
Unlike these lifeline routes, the Second Crossing is a convenience project, not a necessity. Juneau’s population is gradually shrinking. The most cost-efficient second bridges would shave only a few miles off driving time from the existing bridge. The roads and bridges in place today are not failing. This is a solution in search of a problem, and it comes at a cost that all Alaskans would bear. 
 A Wetland of Global Significance

This project just doesn’t pencil out and is not fiscally responsible. The Mendenhall Wetlands are one of the most ecologically important habitats in Alaska, recognized globally as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by the National Audubon Society. A 5,000-acre ecosystem provides essential habitat for millions of migratory birds traveling the Pacific Flyway each year—including sandpipers, dowitchers, plovers, and waterfowl. These wetlands are also a critical nursery for salmon and trout, with rich tidal channels that shelter juvenile fish before they head to sea. The Mendenhall Wetlands have been called the Heart of Juneau. 
It’s not just birdwatchers and fishers who value the space. The Mendenhall State Game Refuge was designated in 1976 by the Alaska State Legislature. It was in part designated so hunters could pursue waterfowl and have an accessible place to hunt. In 2023, the Alaska Department of Fish & Game added over a dozen anadromous fish to the Anadromous Waters Catalog (AWC) fish streams after surveying the wetlands. A total of 230 species of birds have been documented within the wetlands – that’s 69% of the 335 bird species for all of Southeast Alaska – including 36 different waterfowl species, according to Audubon Alaska. The Mendenhall Wetlands support one of Southeast Alaska’s most popular and accessible waterfowl hunting areas, drawing hunters from across the region each fall and over 1800 annual local resident hunters (ADF&G). 
For many, it’s a tradition passed down through generations, a place where families hunt ducks and geese on public lands, some just minutes from their homes.  
 The Opportunity Cost

Building this road means more than just the loss of habitat. It means lost opportunities elsewhere. Alaska’s existing road system is aging and underfunded. Major corridors in the Interior and Southcentral suffer from poor drainage and frost damage. Coastal communities face landslide risks and storm-damaged causeways. Ferry service remains unreliable for many Southeast residents. Every dollar spent on a vanity project like the Second Crossing is a dollar not spent on infrastructure Alaskans actually rely on. 
Let’s be clear: this is not a NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) issue. It’s a matter of statewide priorities. From Cold Bay to Prudhoe, we all have a stake in how limited public funds are used. Do we choose to invest in maintenance, safety, and real community needs, or spend lavishly on speculative development that benefits a few, while costing us all? 
 A Smarter Path Forward

Alaska doesn’t need another expensive, new road project. What we need is leadership that respects our budget, our wildlife, and our way of life. Preserving the Mendenhall Wetlands as a globally important ecosystem, a rich fish and wildlife habitat, and a cornerstone of Southeast Alaska’s outdoor traditions is not just the right thing to do—it’s the smart thing. 
Let’s repair what is broken. Let’s protect what is working. And let’s leave the Mendenhall Wetlands wild for the generations of Alaskans yet to come, like nature, and the state legislature intended.

DemasElectronic theft of benefits and unauthorized use of food assistance cards is costing Michiganders millions if not billions of dollars in fraud, supporters of legislation to require a photo and a signature on Michigan Bridge cards said during a Thursday meeting of the state House Government Operations Committee.
Rep. Jason Woolford (R-Howell), sponsor of House Bill 4515, told lawmakers Thursday that Michigan has seen instances of organized crime stealing people’s Electronic Benefits Transfer, or EBT, data to drain people’s SNAP, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, benefits which are informally known as food stamps. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXA May statement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture said SNAP benefit fraud efforts have  “dramatically” increased in recent years through card skimming and cloning efforts. And as President Donald Trump’s administration has zeroed in on cracking down on bad actors stealing food assistance dollars from those who need them, Judicial Officer of the United States Department of Agriculture John Walk said these crimes hurt Americans on multiple levels.
“These are truly sick and depraved individuals who are stealing food from low-income Americans for their own profit,” Walk said in May. “It is especially disturbing when international criminal organizations siphon tax dollars away from SNAP beneficiaries to fund their own illicit activities.”
Woolford’s bill would require those using Michigan’s food assistance card, known as the Bridge Card, to have their photograph and signature appear on the card.
The bill isn’t meant to inconvenience anyone in need of food assistance in Michigan more than the inconvenience many Michiganders face when getting a photo for a driver’s license, passport, or a Costco membership card, Woolford said. And although the nonpartisan House Fiscal Agency places estimates of implementing photo and signature requirements at between $1.5 million to $4.5 million annually, based on other states that have done so, Woolford said the change could save taxpayers billions in fraud.
“That’s my concern, that the amount of money we’re losing here, money that quite honestly could go to other people that are being denied benefits or that we don’t have the money to take care of because of the waste, fraud and abuse,” Woolford said.
In the House Fiscal Agency’s analysis of the bill, savings to Michigan as a result of reduced fraud are indeterminate and likely negligible. Regardless of whose image would appear on a card, in order for whole families to benefit from food assistance, federal rules mandate that states can’t hinder members of a household from permitted purchases, so anyone with the pin number can make a purchase regardless of the image on the card, the analysis said.
On Thursday, Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford Township) said during his law enforcement career prior to joining the Legislature, he saw frequent fraudulent use of food assistance cards. At the same time, when considering concerns that having to get a photo taken would place an undue burden on recipients, Harris said he’d be interested in seeing if the bill could be further fleshed out to allow images already in the Michigan Department of State’s database for state IDs to be used for Bridge Cards.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1257-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

(Screenshot from National Archives film)Shaun Nadolny is finally making the trip from Wisconsin to visit his great-uncle’s grave in the Brittany American Cemetery in France.  
Last in a two-part series on Pennsylvania’s 28th Division and a new memorial to soldiers who were killed in the fight to liberate Gathemo, France. Read the first part here.

Tradition holds that for visiting family members, staff will place moistened sand on the engraving on the marker for Jerome Nadolny, who was killed in the fierce fighting around Gathemo, a small village in Normandy, using a wet sponge. The process brings the name out on the marble Latin cross, so it can easily be seen from 15 to 20 feet away.

An American and French flag – standing about knee high – will be placed in front of the grave. Traditionally, the U.S. marker is symbolically on the right side – as if it were in the soldier’s right hand and facing home. The French will be on the left – always toward inland territory.
Then, he and his cousin, Kurt, will travel to Gathemo, where nine soldiers of the 28th Division, including three from Pennsylvania, lost their lives as the Allies pushed inland from the beaches of Normany to liberate Europe. 
They’ll be the sole American relatives of the fallen soldiers who will be on hand for a ceremony Saturday honoring their sacrifice during the fight for the town 81 summers ago. The gathering will include the dedication of a plaque and memorial and a renaming of a street in honor of the 28th Division, a Pennsylvania National Guard unit before the war. The trip is the culmination of an improbable sequence of events that began when Nadolny went in search of the war history of a long-lost great-uncle. Nadolny admits to feeling a little pressure, because he doesn’t want to let his family down or any of the other families. 
“I know it’s going to be a heavy experience for me personally. I wish I could share this with my dad,” he said. “It was on my bucket list to just go to that cemetery, but now to actually go to the cemetery? It’s obviously a trip of a lifetime, right?“
Gathemo today
Visitors to Normandy will notice Allied flags – American, British, and Canadian – hanging not just on poles, but in windows and on doors in village after village. This isn’t just a phenomenon that happens in the typical tourist areas around the landing beaches or landmarks made famous in the 1962 movie, The Longest Day, or the HBO miniseries, Band of Brothers.
The Battle of Normandy stretched beyond what happened on June 6, 1944. Allied troops applied relentless pressure in an effort to push the German occupiers back.
The clash lasted for more than two months, as it became a war of attrition. Allied troops had to constantly resupply the front lines, while the enemy dealt with losses – in terms of men and machines – it simply couldn’t replace
In the end, the Allies suffered 210,000 casualties,while the Germans dealt with losses of 400,000 men. 
Town and after town touched by the Battle of Normandy has its own monuments or historical markers to pilots whose downed aircraft crashed nearby, soldiers who died in their streets or units that helped liberate them.
In Periers for example, The Four Braves memorial honors the 90th Infantry Division — which liberated the town as part of Operation Cobra. This was a piece of the successful U.S. breakout — which played a big role in the rapid collapse of the Germans’ defense in Normandy.
Two Pennsylvanians who lost  their lives — Private 2nd Class Andrew J. Speese III of Philadelphia and Sgt. Tullio Micaloni of Oneida — are immortalized as part of the memorial.

One tour group recounted how in the town of La Haye du Puits, a man noticed they were Americans. He hurried home and later found the group at a restaurant eating lunch. He excitedly, in French, described what it was like as a boy in the summer of 1944 to see his home liberated.  
As his story was translated, he pulled a piece of silk parachute from his jacket — given to him by a U.S. soldier. He simply wanted to share his gratitude for the sacrifice made by the Allies.
Even in 2025, people in Normandy’s villages and towns still think there is history to be acknowledged and a debt owed.
Gathemo, with a population of 267, will join the others Saturday, with a permanent “thank you.” 
Over several days in early August, 1944, the 28th attacked German troops occupying the town.
Progress was slow, measured in a few hundred yards at times, but by the afternoon Aug. 10, the 28th had liberated Gathemo. The division’s losses were nine men killed, including three from Pennsylvania, and an estimated 235 wounded.

– – From The Bloody Patch: A True Story of the Daring 28th Infantry Division 



The 77-day Battle of Normandy came to an end on Aug. 19, after tens of thousands of German troopers were captured when the Falaise pocket was closed by Allied troops.
A mere 10 days after that, the men of the 28th Division were in Paris, taking part in the liberation day parade through the city. 
Located nearly 90 minutes from the English Channel and Omaha Beach, Mayor Christelle Errard describes Gathemo as having all the hallmarks of a quaint Norman community – a bakery, a bar, gift shops and five farms. 
The church, destroyed in the fight, was rebuilt after the war and features a pointed bell tower. According to the mayor, the granite used for the altar and the cross came from Gathemo’s quarries.

‘There are no words strong enough’ 
The town’s role in the Allied push to encircle and destroy part of the German Army in the final weeks and days of the clash has largely been forgotten – overshadowed by the fight in Mortain and Saint-Lambert-sur-Dives, among others. Errard became mayor of Gathemo in July of 2020 and has lived in the community for a decade. She was born in another historically significant part of France – Verdun. It’s the site of one the longest and most ferocious battles of the First World War.  
“We have a mission in our world: to listen to our history, to transcribe it, so as not to forget Our duty to remember is here. And the witnesses of this period will soon all be gone. I also understood that many don’t want to share what they experienced,” she wrote in an email exchange using Google Translate to go from French to English. “My father never spoke about this period when he was 6-years-old, yet four years ago, on his deathbed, he relived the scenes he had witnessed.”

Now, she said, it’s Gathemo’s turn to pay tribute to the young Americans who fought to liberate Europe. 
“Many returned home with physical and mental injuries, but many, like Pvt. Nadolny, did not return to their families,” Errard wrote. “My son will be 23 in June, the same age Pvt. Nadolny was when he lost his life in Gathemo, for Gathemo. I cannot remain indifferent. The tribute is small, but I hope it is the beginning of another story for Gathemo and all the people who will stop and pay their respects at this memorial.”
The monument with the names of the nine men killed will be located close to the back of the church in Gathemo. It will be on a granite stone with an M1 helmet featuring the division logo placed on top. A plaque honoring the entire division will be dedicated, and a street will be renamed in honor of the 28th Division, which, according to unit lore was nicknamed the “Bloody Bucket” by the Germans because of the red keystone patches worn on their uniforms. 
The Mike Pride Museum in Normandy covered the 1,800 Euro price tag.
“Dear American friends, there are no words strong enough to express our gratitude and respect,” Errard said. “I would like to say BRAVO and THANK YOU.”
Two men who were just children at the time of the battle will be on hand for the ceremony – 87-year-old Guy Lelandais and 80-year-old Michele Golonde. 
Errard says for Lelandais, whose cousin was killed by an exploding shell in front of his eyes, preserving the history of the liberation of his hometown has been a lifelong passion. He has – collecteding testimonies from around the region.

Galonde was just six months old when the 28th Division pushed the Germans out of Gathemo, hiding in a cellar with his family, according to Gerrard. His older sister was in front of the baby carriage he was in when a shell exploded – wounding her in the leg, which left her permanently disabled.  But as fate would have it, she likely saved Galonde’s life because of where she was standing. 
Nadolny plans to have dinner with the mayor and hopes to shake Lelandais’ hand and ask him what he remembers about the fight to free the town. 
“I mean sincerely, we are so thankful…my family and I are almost just unbelievably thankful,” he said. “(Jerome) was a blue-collar soldier that gave everything and moved us along, So to me, that’s what it’s about. A lot of forgotten stories. So, if we can share a little bit of it or be a part of it, I think it’s incredible.”
The commemoration is a reminder that “freedom has a cost and that true friendship endures,”  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a letter to the event organizers.
“More than 80 years ago, the sons of Pennsylvania crossed an ocean to stand in defense of liberty and peace, forging a bond of courage and shared sacrifice. The soldiers of the 28th Infantry Division fought with extraordinary bravery, with some making the ultimate sacrifice,” Shapiro said. “The people of Gathemo have, across generations, honored the legacy of these brave men not only with gratitude, but with a deep and enduring partnership that continues to unite our communities. Pennsylvania is proud of the heritage of the 28th Infantry Division and of the shared history we hold with our friends in Gathemo.”
The ceremony is set to begin Saturday, June 7, at 5 a.m. EST and will be livestreamed on the Mike Pride Museum YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@grpicardie3945.

Some question the precedent that sets.,"Earlier this year, Margaret Joyce was charged alongside four other individuals with abusing Bridgeport’s absentee ballot system during the city’s 2023 Democratic mayoral primary.
And this week, the 46-year-old was cited again by state election enforcement officials — this time for violating the state’s absentee ballot laws during a 2024 re-do election between Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim and his Democratic challenger John Gomes.
According to State Election Enforcement Commission staff, Joyce told state investigators that she was compensated during those 2024 elections for the sole purpose of soliciting absentee votes — which is a violation of state law. They said she also admitted to taking possession of at least one voters’ absentee ballot ahead of those contests, which is a felony in Connecticut.
But Joyce, who is now homeless and living out of her car, is unlikely to face any consequence for the actions she took during the 2024 elections, which were held after Ganim’s victory in 2023 was overturned in court due to widespread allegations of absentee ballot fraud.
The SEEC staff recommended the commission settle the case against Joyce — who is already facing nine felony charges tied to the 2023 election — and issue Joyce a fine of $1,000 for what they described as an “egregious” violation of state law.
But the SEEC also acknowledged that Joyce was unlikely to pay that fine because of her financial circumstances. They said she will qualify to have the fine waived because she is considered indigent.  
Joyce previously told investigators with the Connecticut Chief State’s Attorneys office that she worked for Ganim in 2023 and 2024 and was paid by his campaign. 
Joyce could not be reached for comment for this story. Her attorney, Robert Koetsch, did not return a call to his office.
Ganim did not respond to an email that was sent to a spokesperson for his office.
Members of the SEEC ultimately voted to settle the case against Joyce. But before they did, two of the commissioners openly questioned what type of precedent they were setting, and what message it might send to candidates who are running for political office in the future.
Stephen Penny, chairman of the SEEC, specifically asked what would prevent Ganim or any other political candidate from hiring low-income individuals to repeatedly violate the state’s absentee ballot laws.
“What is there in this process that would discourage candidates for the office of the mayor for the city of Bridgeport from putting indigent people in this position, over and over and over again?” Penny asked. 
Gregory Piecuch, another commissioner, made a similar point, and suggested that the SEEC needs to start investigating the candidates and treasurers paying campaign workers who mishandle absentee ballots.
“What we have seen, particularly since COVID, is a proliferation in the use of absentee ballots by campaigns,” Piecuch said. “…The use of absentee ballots has grown, and so too has the ability of folks to be acting in concert and perhaps using the indigent as a way to escape liability.” 
“That is something that we are going to have to take a much closer look at going forward,” Piecuch added.
William Smith, an attorney for the SEEC, explained to the commission that the case against Joyce, which included video footage of her allegedly picking up an absentee ballot at a voter’s house, was one of more than 30 investigations stemming from the election contests between Ganim and Gomes in 2023 and 2024.
According to Smith, Michael Brandi, the SEEC’s former director, made the decision to focus those cases on the individual campaign operatives who were allegedly mishandling absentee ballots. Smith said that is why Ganim and his campaign team were not investigated as part of the complaint that was filed against Joyce.  
Brandi, who retired earlier this year, did not respond to phone call for this story. 
“Based on the former executive director’s strategy, we were focused on the participants who were actually on the ground, knocking on doors,” Smith told the commission. 
It’s not just members of the SEEC, however, who are starting to question why it is largely campaign operatives who are being hit with fines and criminal charges in Bridgeport.
People involved in election cases in Bridgeport and attorneys for some of the defendants who are currently facing charges are also critical of the fact that campaign directors and political candidates who benefited from the alleged absentee ballot fraud are not being investigated and criminally prosecuted. 
Ken Krayeske, who is representing Nilsa Heredia, another low-level campaign worker who was charged with mishandling absentee ballots during Ganim’s 2019 election, said the string of alleged election fraud that has taken place in Bridgeport is unlikely to end if the people at the top are not held accountable.
“Why isn’t the person who benefited from these schemes in 2019 and 2023 a defendant here,” Krayeske said, referring to Ganim. “It is a crime to solicit someone to go out and take absentee ballots.”
Krayeske said it will be deeply unfair if people like Joyce and his client, who lives in P.T. Barnum Apartments, a public housing facility, are convicted of felonies, while the individuals who hired them and paid them are left unscathed. He said he would consider that selective prosecution.
Prena Rao, an attorney who led a civil lawsuit challenging Ganim’s primary victory in 2019, said the trial in that case highlighted the instructions that many lower-level campaign operatives receive during many Bridgeport elections. 
Rao, who grew up in Bridgeport, said there is clearly evidence in some of the ongoing criminal cases that the people accused of illegally collecting absentee ballots were also being paid by campaigns.
“I don’t think that justice will be done until the folks involved in orchestrating this process and giving people directives and issuing checks and payments also face consequences,” Rao said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bridgeport-complaint-video.png,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma City federal judge this week placed an indefinite ban on enforcement of a state law criminalizing undocumented immigrants living in Oklahoma.
The decision from U.S. District Judge Bernard Jones extends the two-week hold he implemented for House Bill 4156 on May 20 to last until he makes a final ruling on a lawsuit challenging the statute. 
HB 4156, enacted last year, created the state crime of “impermissible occupation,” threatening fines and jail time for immigrants living in Oklahoma without legal residency.
Past rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court and judges across the country have made clear that immigration enforcement is the federal government’s responsibility, not an individual state’s, Jones wrote in his decision issued Tuesday. Federal law preempts state laws on the issue, rendering Oklahoma’s new statute unenforceable, the judge decided.
“In the end, that is why H.B. 4156 must fail — not to excuse unlawful presence or shield criminal conduct, but because it is what the Constitution demands,” Jones wrote.
Oklahoma still has the power to prosecute U.S. citizens and noncitizens alike for crimes that might stem from unlawful immigration, the judge said.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond had contended HB 4156 helps law enforcement stop drug trafficking and other crimes. Drummond called Jones’ previous two-week hold “outrageous,” “perverse” and “contrary to the rule of law.”

“The attorney general is committed to ensuring the state has the agency to protect Oklahomans,” Drummond’s spokesperson, Phil Bacharach, said Thursday. “HB 4156 is a commonsense and necessary law and Oklahoma must be able to enforce it.” 
Jones blocked enforcement of the law for nine months last year after former President Joe Biden’s Administration filed a lawsuit. The ban lifted when President Donald Trump withdrew Biden’s case.
Two undocumented residents of Oklahoma and two immigrant-focused organizations based in the state refiled the lawsuit last month, contending HB 4156 is unconstitutional.
Attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Tulsa law firm Rivas & Associates are representing the plaintiffs.
“Once again, the court has made it clear that the state of Oklahoma may not enforce HB 4156 while our litigation proceeds,” ACLU of Oklahoma legal director Megan Lambert said. “People who are immigrants join the long American tradition of coming here in search of a better life and the freedom and opportunity we offer. Anti-immigrant policies do not represent our state, and we are grateful for the relief this provides while we continue to fight for the rights and safety of Oklahoma’s immigrant communities.”

“Neither the University of Florida nor the Board of Governors, nor (Santa) Ono would have been in this position,” had HB 1321 been in effect before the presidential search, Perez said during a media availability.
Representatives voted 104-8 on that bill this session, which would have repealed the public records exemption on applicants for presidencies at state colleges and universities. The Senate companion bill,  SB 1726, cleared all its committees of reference, but the full Senate never considered it.
Back to the drawing board: UF presidential finalist nixed for conflicting DEI stances

The State University System Board of Governors rejected University of Michigan President Santa Ono during the final phase of the presidential search process this week. The 6-10 vote against Ono followed hours of questions about his conflicting stances on diversity, equity, and inclusion. He was unanimously approved by UF trustees the week before.
“All of the deficiencies that Ono had prior to the presidential search coming to a conclusion, and eventually going before the BOG would have been discovered,” Perez said. “It was not discovered because no one knew that Ono was the one that was going to be nominated, unanimously approved, and sent to the BOG.” 
  Speaker Daniel Perez via Florida House
 The House sponsor of the bill, Rep. Michelle Salzman, said the measure was about “transparency, term limiting bureaucrats, and good governance.” Gov. Ron DeSantis said the bill, which included a provision prohibiting his office’s involvement in searches, would “kneecap our ability to hold higher ed accountable.”
Speaker voted for secrecy
The law that put secrets in the dark once had the support of Perez.
State law, since the signing of SB 520 in 2022, requires university presidential searches to be conducted outside the public eye, none of the applicants known to the public unless part of the “shortlist” of finalists unveiled in the final phases, and the finalist(s) must be approved by the chair of the Board of Governors. That bill passed the House 86-26, with Perez voting in favor.
“What many fought back on was that the BOG chair had to have the veto power. Well, he had the veto power. He never used it. And then here we are with a presidential candidate for a major university, flagship university for the state of Florida, in a very embarrassing moment for the entire state of Florida, something that should have been avoided, could have been avoided,” Perez said. 
UF has twice, consecutively, named a sole finalist despite the “shortlist” language in law.
Perez said the school will have a problem trying to find a president now that the “process is flawed.”

Senate president wishy-washy
Opponents of the House proposal have said keeping searches confidential initially prevents a candidate’s current employer from discovering their employee is applying for a new job. That, in turn, encourages more candidates to apply.
Senate President Ben Albritton doesn’t see the issue as clearly as Perez.
Albritton replied to Perez’s comments in his own media availability held about an hour after Perez’s.
“I’m not sure it would have” avoided Ono’s rejection, Albritton said.

“One way to look at it would be that way. Another way to look at it would say that the system worked.”
Albritton added: “I applaud the Speaker and the House for taking it head on. It’s a complicated situation. Let’s keep talking about it.”
The Legislature is not poised to address policy issues unrelated to the budget in the final days of its extended session.
“Are there some circumstances where it would be better to have multiple [finalists]? Maybe. Are there some circumstances you’re better off to have one? Maybe,” Albritton said. “I’m not going to give you something definitive at this point.”
Perez said he hopes changes can come before any more searches fail.
“The House tried for this to never happen. Yet we were the only ones that believed in that policy. I still believe in that policy,” Perez said. “Hopefully, now that we have seen this example come to fruition and become a reality, unfortunately, we can now once again have that consideration and that conversation of the policy that the House passed.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Senate President Valarie Lawson quietly recused herself from two labor bills decided Wednesday. The reason: She’s awaiting the advice of a state ethics panel on conflicts of interest with her job as head of one of the state’s two largest teachers unions.
Despite Lawson’s abstention, two union-backed bills secured approval with decisive majorities of the 37-member chamber. One would extend organizing rights to university graduate students; the other enhances information-sharing about union members between their employers and local bargaining units.
As the end of session looms, with hundreds of bills expected to be considered by both chambers in the final weeks, it’s still unclear when and whether Lawson should be participating in discussions and decisions that overlap with her day job as president of the National Education Association of Rhode Island.
Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, was elected Senate president on April 29, filling the opening left after the death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. She requested an advisory opinion from the Rhode Island Ethics Commission on May 23, according to a letter obtained by Rhode Island Current. The commission, which last met on May 20, has not set a date to consider a recommendation from its staff on Lawson’s request.
Lawson in the letter referred to a June 2024 ethics recommendation, when she was majority leader, determining that she could still vote on a swath of proposed changes to the state pension system despite being a retired teacher and head of the teachers union. The ethics panel concluded that Lawson would not benefit from the proposed changes any more than the 68,000 retirees and active state workers and teachers, including 400 of her co-workers at the state teachers’ union.
Lawson sought to distinguish between actual conflicts of interest, rooted in financial gain, and a “subjective perception of bias” — the latter of which is not addressed by the state ethics code.
“The Code of Ethics does not address perceived general biases, political views or personal opinions unless they intersect with financial interests,” Lawson wrote. “This is intentional as the Code of Ethics may not infringe upon either legislative or executive powers.”
Lawson also pledged in the letter to recuse herself from any discussions and votes on bills related to pension benefits that would affect her “rights or entitlements as a participant in the state’s Pension system.”
Her letter does not mention potential conflicts on labor bills, including the two she abstained from Wednesday.
‘What happens behind closed doors?’
Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, downplayed Lawson’s recusals.
“In any part-time legislature, most members will have full-time jobs as well, and it is inevitable that potential conflicts will arise,” Pare said in an emailed response Thursday. “The members of the Senate recuse themselves in these situations. Throughout her tenure in the Senate, President Lawson has recused out of an abundance of caution when a potential conflict arises, and she did so yesterday as well.”
The precautionary measure did not put Sen. Ana Quezada at ease. Quezada, a Providence Democrat, did not vote for Lawson for Senate president because she worried over the conflicts of interest with her union job.
“For me, it is still a concern,” Quezada said in an interview Thursday. “Even if she recuses herself from voting on the floor, what happens behind closed doors?”
Indeed, it was behind-the-scenes negotiations, not public votes, that prompted the first Senate president, East Providence Democrat, Billy Irons, to resign. Irons abruptly left the leadership post at the end of his first year, in 2003, amid news reports he accepted payouts from insurance companies in exchange for defeating legislation the industry opposed.  
“Recusing from a vote is only part of the actions as Senate president,” John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island, said. “Lawson is also the person who decides if a committee can move forward with a vote on the legislation.”
Exercising caution might sound like the best choice amid uncertainty. But her constituents, and the 12,000 teachers she leads, could lose out if she recuses herself unnecessarily, too.
This was the conclusion of a pair of Brown University professors in a paper in the 2024 Roger Williams University Law Review in examining non-judicial recusals from 2006 to 2018.
“Recusing might make political sense,” the authors stated. “Stepping aside makes it impossible for political opponents to claim that voting was improper. But this is where the phrase ‘out of an abundance of caution’ falls apart. That phrase implies that there are no costs to recusing, just possible benefits. But there are real costs—direct and indirect—to this kind of ‘abundance of caution.’ The direct cost of legislative recusal is the disenfranchisement of constituents.”
Without an ethics opinion on the bills up for a vote Wednesday, it’s unclear whether Lawson could have participated in the decisions.










Recusing from a vote is only part of the actions as Senate president. Lawson is also the person who decides if a committee can move forward with a vote on the legislation.


–  John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island


Marion acknowledged the timing of the state ethics reviews and meetings – typically once per month — made it difficult for Lawson to get timely advice in the end-of-session scramble.
But the proposals themselves were introduced on Jan. 31, giving Lawson ample time to ask for more general input from the ethics panel. Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone requested an advisory opinion from the Ethics Commission on his ability to discuss and vote on gun-related legislation immediately after he was elected the Senate’s no. 2. The commission approved its staff recommendation at its May 20 meeting.
Lawson waited more than three weeks after she was tapped as president to ask for an ethics opinion. 
“It’s surprising given the scrutiny on her dual roles that she isn’t doing more publicly to make sure that she’s getting sound advice on what she can and can’t do in her role as Senate president,” Marion said. “The next few weeks are going to highlight that challenge.”
Companion legislation in the House to Ciccone’s bill expanding organizing rights to college graduate students remains held in committee following an initial Feb. 12 hearing. The House Committee on Labor is scheduled to vote Thursday night on a companion to the other union bill, requiring regular updates from union employers to the local bargaining units.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi remained noncommittal when asked for comment Thursday, only saying that both bills were “under consideration.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)LINCOLN — A new vacancy on the three-member Nebraska Liquor Control Commission came at the request of Gov. Jim Pillen, which the former commissioner in that seat said happened because the governor wanted more “cannabis experience” on the regulatory board.
Former Commissioner Harry Hoch, Jr., speaking with the Nebraska Examiner, confirmed this week that he was told he would not be reappointed to another six-year term to the Liquor Control Commission after his term expired May 24. Hoch said he had put in a request to be reappointed but withdrew it after talking with Dave Lopez, Pillen’s chief of staff, so his last day was May 24.

Hoch said the “nice” conversation with Lopez “basically boiled down to [that] I wasn’t going to be reappointed, because the governor wanted to get more cannabis experience in my seat.”
“There was no Hanky Panky there. It’s all above board,” Hoch said of his resignation, adding that he parted ways with the executive branch officials, “basically friends still.”
Medical cannabis duties
Under a ballot measure approved by about 67% of voters in November, the three members of the Liquor Control Commission also jointly serve on the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission.

Pillen’s two new at-large appointees to the medical cannabis board were confirmed by the Nebraska Legislature last week. The commission’s first meeting is Monday at 3 p.m.
“If you think about it, the three Liquor Control commissioners were put on the cannabis board just because it was a convenient way,” Hoch said.
In his resignation email, dated May 20, Hoch said it was “a pleasure to be able to serve and use my 40 years of industry knowledge” during his six years on the Liquor Control Commission.
Hoch represented Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, which consists of Saunders County, Douglas County and western Sarpy County.

The resignation had nothing to do with the later action to suspend without pay the Liquor Commission’s executive director — an employee of the commission — one day after a federal search warrant was carried out on the commission, Hoch said.
The former commissioner said he did not know those “goings on.” Authorities have shared no other information about that investigation.
There has been no public announcement or call for applications for the 2nd District Liquor Commission vacancy. There was no announcement or call for applications for the Medical Cannabis Commission as of March 31, either. Pillen made the six-year appointments April 24.
Applications for open appointments to boards and commissions are available here.
‘A role even more critical’
In a May 20 email exchange between Lopez and Hoch, Lopez said the Governor’s Office would put out a statement recognizing Hoch’s service and look for another way that the former commissioner could serve. It’s unclear whether any statement was sent about Hoch.
“As discussed, I will personally see to identifying several possibilities for continued state-appointed service that will befit your experience, wisdom and stature,” Lopez wrote to Hoch. “I cannot overstate how valuable it is to have good people willing to serve in appointed positions, and candidly, I am hopeful we can engage you in a role even more critical than LCC is presently.”

Pillen confirmed in an interview this week with the Examiner that he directed the call for Hoch’s resignation, as he believes serving at the “pleasure of the governor” means appointing someone when a term expires, though he was grateful for Hoch’s work.
Hoch was appointed by former Gov. Pete Ricketts. Pillen accepted Hoch’s resignation May 21.
Asked if Pillen had a reason for Hoch’s resignation, the governor said: “No, just time.”
A spokesperson for the governor declined to comment on the pending appointment process beyond a previous comment that the vacancy would be filled “in due course.”
‘Important we get it right’
Pillen reiterated that he also always supported medical cannabis but does not support a “leak” to recreational marijuana — ”no way, shape or form.” He previously said access to medical cannabis should only come after U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.
Pillen committed to taking the medical cannabis duties seriously while protecting kids.
“We’re gonna do it, fulfill the will of the people as quickly as possible,” Pillen said.
He then pointed to the “be quick, but don’t hurry” phrase popularized by former American basketball Coach John Wooden and added: “This is important we get it right.”

(NCDPI Screengrab)When Kimberly Jones was selected as the 2023-24 North Carolina Teacher of the Year she earned a two-year appointment to the State Board of Education. This week, as the veteran Chapel Hill English teacher attended her final meeting in that leadership capacity, she challenged both the board and state legislators to invest more in public schools.
Jones urged the State Board of Education on Thursday to stay grounded in the constitutional mandate to provide every North Carolina child with a sound basic education.

“Be wary of oversimplified solutions to complex challenges,” Jones advised. “Invest not only in outcomes, but in the conditions that produce them — teacher retention, culturally relevant pedagogy, instructional materials that reflect diverse experiences and perspectives and learning environments that allow our students to feel safe, both physically and emotionally.”
During her time on the board, the Trump administration’s U.S. Department of Education has sought to block diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs nationwide. Jones cautioned her colleagues to never confuse neutrality with justice.
“Please make equity, access, or whatever synonym meets the current criteria to guide your compass, even when that path is hard to navigate. The very future of our democracy and our society depends on how courageously you continue to steward this responsibility,” Jones said.
As Newsline has previously reported, this legislative session state Republican lawmakers have advanced multiple proposals to eliminate DEI from all corners of the public sector — government, higher education and K-12 education.
At the same time, the North Carolina House has passed legislation that would promote “wholesome” content for students, but that critics have derided as an invitation to censorship. The bill would require the State Board of Education to maintain a database of all banned media across the state with annual updates.
Jones reminded the board that reading and inquiry are not a nuisance, but rather an engine of learning.
“In my classroom, we use complex questions to feel reading, research, and rigorous dialogue to build empathy and to strengthen civic understanding,” she said. “I believe students of every background and every region of our state deserve access to such curricula. Ones that affirm their identity, reflect their communities, inspire their best efforts, and invite them into meaningful conversations about the world they are inheriting and shaping.”
Jones, a high school English and AP African American studies and Holocaust educator, said students should be encouraged to explore not just what was said or written, but why it mattered.
For legislators who will be working on a compromise budget in the weeks ahead, Jones urged improved funding for schools and better respect for educators.
“Public education cannot be reimagined if it is consistently underfunded, undermined, or politicized,” she said. “If we are to recruit and retain a diverse, highly qualified, and effective workforce, then we must offer more than praise. We must offer respect, autonomy, and trust.”

Jones said her classroom colleagues simply deserve more.
“We need competitive teacher pay that honors both experience and expertise. We need sustainable investments in student mental health because no curriculum is effective in a crisis. We need clean modern school buildings, not just in select counties but in every community.”
The House budget proposes to increase new teacher pay from $41,000 a year to $48,000 for the next school year but offers little to more experienced teachers. The Senate budget offers average raises of 2.3% in FY 25-26 with a $3,000 bonus spread out over two years. The two sides are reportedly far apart from reaching a consensus.
Beyond the classroom, Jones said lawmakers should acknowledge those behind the scenes — cafeteria workers, bus drivers, and those willing to pitch in to maintain the grounds and buildings when the needs surpass the resources.
For parents and community advocates, Jones encouraged them to visit a classroom, become a mentor, vote in their local school board elections, and ask their local school district leaders what they’re doing to serve the most marginalized students.
Jones said it’s important to understand that not every student learns the same way, and not every parent’s experience with their school is universal.
“In public schools, there are no applications for admission. There are no filters to whom we serve. We don’t select who enters our classrooms, but every day we get the unparalleled opportunity to shape and influence what kind of person leaves our classrooms.”
Jones said that during challenging times she reflects on a proverb which holds that children are born with their hands closed because that’s where their gifts and talents lie.
“As they grow, their hands begin to open so they can share those talents with the world. At its most essential level, education is not about what we put into young people. It’s about what we pull out of them,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NC-State-Board-of-Education-June2025.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

The travel ban applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
The policy change restricts entry for citizens of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and do not hold a valid visa.
The policy takes effect Monday at 12:01 a.m. and does not have an end date.
Here’s what to know about the new rules:
How Trump justified the ban
Since returning to the White House, Trump has launched an unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him.
The travel ban results from a Jan. 20 executive order Trump issued requiring the departments of State and Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence to compile a report on “hostile attitudes” toward the U.S.
The aim is to “protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes,” the administration said.
In a video released on social media, Trump tied the new ban to a terror attack Sunday in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. The suspect in the attack is from Egypt, a country that is not on Trump’s restricted list. The Department of Homeland Security says he overstayed a tourist visa.
Who is exempt from the ban
1. Lawful residents: green card holders, citizens of designated countries who have obtained legal residency in the U.S.;
2. Dual citizens: U.S. citizens who also have citizenship of one of the banned countries;
3. Some athletes: athletes and their coaches traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup, Olympics or other major sporting event as determined by the U.S. secretary of state;
4. Afghans who worked for the U.S. government or its allies in Afghanistan and are holders of Afghan Special Immigrant Visas;
5. Iranians belonging to an ethnic or religious minority who are fleeing prosecution;
6. Certain foreign national employees of the U.S. government who have served abroad for at least 15 years and their spouses and children;
7. Refugees: Those who were granted asylum or admitted to the U.S. as refugees before the ban entered into force;
8. Individuals with U.S. family members who apply for visas in connection to their spouses, children or parents;
9. Diplomats and foreign government officials on official visits;
10. Those transiting the U.S. to the U.N. headquarters solely for official business related to the U.N.;
11. Representatives of international organizations and NATO on official visits in the U.S.;
12. Children adopted by U.S. citizens.
Which countries are affected
Trump said nationals of countries included in the ban pose “terrorism-related” and “public-safety” risks, as well as risks of overstaying their visas. He also said some of these countries had “deficient” screening and vetting or have historically refused to take back their own citizens.
His findings rely extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of visa overstays of tourists, business visitors and students who arrive by air and sea, singling out countries with high percentages of remaining after their visas expired.
“We don’t want them,” Trump said.
The inclusion of Afghanistan angered some supporters who have worked to resettle its people. The ban makes exceptions for Afghans on Special Immigrant Visas, generally people who worked most closely with the U.S. government during the two-decade war there.
The list can be changed, the administration said in a document circulated Wednesday evening, if authorities of designated countries make “material improvements” to their own rules and procedures. New countries can be added “as threats emerge around the world.”
Early reactions to the ban
International aid groups and refugee resettlement organizations roundly condemned the new ban.
“This policy is not about national security — it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,” said Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America.
The African Union Commission expressed concern Thursday about the “the potential negative impact” of the ban on educational exchanges, business ties and broader diplomatic relations.
“The African Union Commission respectfully calls upon the U.S. administration to consider adopting a more consultative approach and to engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned,” the commission said in a statement.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, called the order “unnecessary, overbroad and ideologically motivated.”
How the ban is different from 2017
During his first term, Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries including Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.
It was one of the most chaotic and confusing moments of his young presidency. Travelers from those nations were either barred from getting on their flights to the U.S. or detained at U.S. airports after they landed. They included students and faculty, as well as businesspeople, tourists and people visiting friends and family.
The order, often referred to as the “Muslim ban” or the “travel ban,” was retooled amid legal challenges until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.
The ban affected various categories of travelers and immigrants from Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Syria and Libya, plus North Koreans and some Venezuelan government officials and their families.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25156397352976-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

[…]","A St. Louis Metro Police car outside Carnahan Courthouse in downtown St. Louis (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).A St. Louis civil rights law firm filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging the state takeover of the St. Louis police as unconstitutional.
ArchCity Defenders filed the lawsuit in Cole County circuit court on behalf of two St. Louis city residents, Jamala Rogers and Mike Milton. The state and Attorney General Andrew Bailey are the defendants.
The lawsuit seeks to overturn provisions of a bill Gov. Mike Kehoe signed into law in March, which put the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department under a state board instead of local control. The law, reversing a statewide vote from 2012 that put the board under local control, was needed, supporters said, to address high crime rates.
With Kehoe’s signature, St. Louis joined Kansas City as the only major metropolitan police force in the country under control of a state board rather than local officials. 
The plaintiffs argue the law violates two parts of the state constitution: the prohibition on unfunded state mandates and on special laws targeting a particular locality.
The law will “subject the city to an unfunded mandate that diverts resources away from needed programs to prevent crime, overturns the democratic vote of the people with no rational basis to believe it will help increase public safety,” the lawsuit states, “and will derail any progress that has been made in reducing the level of violence and improving law enforcement community relations.”
The bill established a floor for the police budget in St. Louis, setting a minimum portion of  general revenue funds that must be used for police each year, rising to 25% in 2028. 
Previously, there was no minimum funding requirement for the St. Louis city police, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit argues the city will need to either reallocate money from other programs and services or raise taxes. 
The two St. Louis city residents named as plaintiffs are activists who have advocated for policies to reduce poverty, prevent violence and increase community trust in law enforcement, according to the lawsuit.
Those plaintiffs believe that the “policies they are advocating for and the programs they implement will increase public safety,” the lawsuit states, but that “funding and support for those policies are now in jeopardy because of the state takeover law.”
The city charter also requires pay parity between police officers and firefighters and emergency medical personnel, meaning that if the state board increases police officers’ salaries, the city will be under the increased strain of matching those salaries. 
“There will be even less funds available for the city to implement holistic, poverty-reducing programs that have a proven effect on increasing public safety in the region,” the lawsuit states.
Under the state’s Hancock Amendment, the state is forbidden from imposing unfunded mandates on local governments.
The second component of the lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional because it violates the prohibition against the legislature enacting certain local or special laws. It argues the law regulates the affairs of St. Louis when a general state law could be made applicable to it. 
“The state has no rational basis for imposing minimum police department funding requirements only on the city of St. Louis and excluding other municipalities from those requirements,” the lawsuit states.
The plaintiffs ask the court to declare the state takeover provisions invalid under the constitution, and sever them from the rest of the wide-ranging crime bill in which they were passed.
The bill restored the governing system that controlled the police department from 1861 until the 2012 vote. 
The bill was passed despite the 2012 vote, and “despite the City’s robust funding of the police department at the expense of other needs, and despite the falling crime rate in the city of St. Louis,” the lawsuit states. The plaintiffs argue that the city has struggled to fund services like affordable housing and violence prevention services, which could reduce crime, while providing “steady funding” for the police department. 
The Board of Police Commissioners has six members — the mayor of St. Louis and five people appointed by the governor and subject to state Senate confirmation. 
The bill passed on party-line votes in the House and Senate earlier this year, with Democrats opposed.

Opponents argued it was racist because Black Democrats held the major offices in St. Louis at the time of passage and is unneeded because crime is decreasing. Senate Democrats filibustered the bill, winning additions of provisions banning the shackling of pregnant prisoners, establishing a fund for exonerated prisoners to receive restitution from the state and limiting what jails and prisons can charge inmates for phone calls.
Critics point to statistics showing a drop in violent crime in St. Louis under local leadership. They say Kansas City has fared no better despite being under state control since the 1930s.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)The Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives announced Thursday that it has filed a lawsuit against Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson for her alleged failure to comply with a subpoena issued by the chair of the chamber’s oversight body.
The complaint, House of Representatives v. Benson, filed in the Michigan Court of Claims on Wednesday, follows the House Oversight Committee’s request for election training materials from Benson and her office, which resulted in a subpoena.
House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township) last month asked the full chamber to hold Benson in civil contempt for her alleged failure to provide the materials, which the House moved as a resolution later that day.
Now, the chamber’s Republicans have sued Benson seeking a declaratory judgment holding that the House issued a valid subpoena to which the secretary of state must comply. That lawsuit also seeks an injunction prohibiting Benson or the Michigan Department of State from modifying relevant records in the initial request.
A request for comment from the department or Benson was not immediately returned. Benson however in a press conference when the House held her in contempt said the move was a political stunt and that if they wanted to go to court, she would see them in court.
In a statement, DeBoyer said his commitment to bringing accountability to Lansing wasn’t lip service. 
“After going years without legislative oversight, Benson has clearly grown comfortable operating independent of the other, co-equal branches of government,” DeBoyer said. “For months, we have tried to get her cooperation through requests, then accommodating offers, and then legal demands. Her continued defiance now brings us to the courtroom, where we will continue to diligently work to deliver government transparency for the people of Michigan.”
DeBoyer added that all government officials, regardless of their title, each of them have a responsibility to uphold their constitutional duties and adhere to the law.
“Yet, Jocelyn Benson, one of the most powerful office holders in Michigan, must instead be brought to court and forced to comply with Michigan statute,” DeBoyer said. “We will not let her disregard for the law keep us from delivering results to the people we represent.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AMR_0051-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees (Brandon Bell/Getty Images).More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.
Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
 GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
 Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
 Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.



Hunger in North Carolina

In a recent interview with NC Newsline, Amy Beros, the President and CEO of the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina, which serves an array of urban and rural counties, said her agency is already struggling to cope with rising demand and expects that proposed cuts in Washington will worsen the situation.
“In the past three years, just in our 34 counties that we serve, hunger has increased by over 150,000 people,” Beros said. “We’re seeing it worse than we saw at the height of the pandemic. It’s the worst than we’ve seen in nearly two decades, and unfortunately, with the decisions that are being made at the state level and federal level right now, we anticipate that that need is going to rise drastically with the proposed cuts.”
–Rob Schofield



Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.










The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.


– Marsha Keene, CEO of the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in Missouri


In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
‘I’d probably close the doors’
The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.

But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.

Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.

In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
‘It’s time to sound the alarm’
Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

SPRINGFIELD – While Illinois State Police has long investigated child sex crimes, a new measure would explicitly name addressing internet crimes against children as a core mission of its criminal division.

House Bill 2586, also called Alicia’s Law, would add to the current 13 missions of the Illinois State Police Department of Criminal Investigations. It passed both chambers of the Illinois General Assembly unanimously in late May.

The bill is named after Alicia Kozak, a survivor of and advocate against online crimes against children, who was at the center of the first nationally known case of child grooming and abduction in 2002. At age 13, Kozak was abducted from her home after months of online grooming by a 38-year-old man, who took her across state lines and chained her in a basement, where she was sexually assaulted and tortured for four days. The perpetrator livestreamed Kozak’s abuse, which was quickly reported to the FBI by a viewer, aiding in Kozak’s release.

“I’ve spent the last 25 years sharing my story and presenting to audiences about online safety and advocating for critical change. And through my work, I’ve heard so many heartbreaking ‘if only’ stories, ‘if only we had known sooner’ or ‘if only we could have stopped it,’” Kozak said in an interview. “Now, with Alicia’s Law in Illinois, Illinois children are safer.”

If signed by the governor, Illinois will be the 13th state to adopt a variation of Alicia’s Law. In most states that have passed a version of the law, it allows states to create a task force to investigate internet crimes against children. Illinois already has such a task force that was created in 2004, although it’s currently under the attorney general’s office.

Illinois’ task force coordinates the AG’s office with state law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute child exploitation cases. During an October 2021 news conference, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said his office managed over 5,100 cyber tips the year prior, an increase of over 2,000 since 2018. Raoul said he expected that number to continue to grow, in part due to increased reporting and awareness by social media and apps.

Illinois State Police Director Brendan Kelly said although ISP has become “much more engaged” in cases involving internet crimes against children in recent years, he said he believes it needs to be explicitly stated in statute that investigating those types of cases is one of ISP’s core duties.

Through talks with Kozak about the issue, Kelly said ISP drafted the bill and spearheaded efforts to get it passed during this year’s legislative session.

“We believe that this is something that is critical, this is important and that is essential to what our values are as the Illinois State Police,” Kelly said. “Making sure that this is a legal, permanent function of our agency is something that I think needed to be done because we want to make sure that these efforts are sustained over time.”

Kozak agreed.

“Before the law, investigating crimes against children in Illinois wasn’t really a legal obligation, it was something Illinois state police would choose to do when resources allowed,” Kozak said. “And now, with Alicia’s Law, it’s a permanent responsibility, it’s no longer optional.”

Kelly Armstrong on Thursday appointed a Minot attorney to a judgeship in the North Central Judicial District covering Burke, Mountrail and Ward counties.
The appointment of Steven Lautt is effective Aug. 4. The judgeship is chambered in Minot. 
Lautt, a Minot native, has been with the Minot law firm of Pringle and Herigstad since 2012. He is the general counsel for several regional agriculture and telecommunications cooperatives and a statewide nonprofit organization, according to a news release from the governor’s office. 
Lautt earned his bachelor’s degree from Tabor College in Kansas, and his law degree in 2012 from the Washburn University School of Law in Kansas. He is a former president of the Ward County Bar Association and current president of the North Dakota Association for Justice. Lautt serves on the board of directors of the Minot-based Northern Plains Children’s Advocacy Center.
The North Central Judicial District judgeship became vacant June 1 with the retirement of Judge Douglas Mattson, who was first elected as judge in 2002.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)TOPEKA — Kansas measles cases rose to 71 and were found in 11 counties in south-central and southwest Kansas, the state reported Wednesday.
Sixty-nine cases are associated with the outbreak in southwest Kansas, where three hospitalizations have also been reported, according to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment dashboard.
Counties where measles have been reported are Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa, Morton, Pawnee, Reno, Sedgwick and Stevens. Gray has the most cases with 25 and is part of what is considered the outbreak, in which transmission is connected to other cases within an area. Sedgwick and Reno counties are outside the outbreak area, and the two cases there have been connected to international travel, the Sedgwick County Health Department website said.
County health departments continue to hold vaccine clinics. The Sedgwick County Health Department has one scheduled from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at the Evergreen Recreation Center, 2700 N. Woodland, Wichita.
In data updated Wednesday, KDHE indicated 57 cases were in children ages birth to 17 years, with the remaining 13 in people ages 18 to 64 years. Among the 69 cases associated with the outbreak, 58 were in unvaccinated people, one person was not age-appropriately vaccinated, five people were age-appropriately vaccinated, three people had vaccination statuses that could not be verified and two were pending verification.
Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection prevention and control at the University of Kansas Health System, said in a previous story that fully vaccinated people can get the disease but typically have fewer complications and overall less severity of illness. With one dose of the vaccine, people have 93% protection from measles, and after two doses, 97% protection, he said.

The stakes could not be higher—this is a matter of life and death. 
To say that Waterbury’s handling by Prospect Medical, who bought the hospital for $31.8 million in 2016, has been poor would be an understatement. Senator Chris Murphy has called it an outright “abomination.” The private equity model of Prospect has destroyed any hope of the hospital doing what it should: provide good, accessible healthcare to those in the area. 

Gray West
My first exposure to the issues with Waterbury Hospital occurred in Waterbury at the Brookside Housing Cooperatives, a local complex of housing cooperatives. Alex Kolokotronis, the Director for Naugatuck Valley Project, while guiding a tour of the cooperatives made it clear that “at the end of the day it affects everyone in the area.” 
The city of Waterbury, with a population of 114,990, should not have to depend on a hospital whose owners look to maximize profits instead of providing the basic healthcare necessities. The for-profit ownership model of hospitals, exemplified by Prospect Medical’s handling of Waterbury Hospital, endangers public health and must be stopped. 
Waterbury was first opened in 1890 with just 30 beds available and has expanded since to 357 licensed beds. Waterbury has a Cardiology, Orthopedic Surgery, a Surgical Innovation Center, and a Family Birthing Center, and it offers an extensive array of additional services. On paper, Waterbury sounds like a thriving, well-funded, and modern hospital. The issue: private-equity ownership. 
Since Waterbury Hospital was bought by Prospect Medical, there have been extensive issues of ownership and mismanagement that all are rooted in the private equity model of Prospect. The model? Initially infuse hospitals with large amounts of funding, then saddle the hospitals with massive amounts of debt, cut staff, cut supplies and investments, maximize profits before selling or declaring bankruptcy. That is exactly what Prospect has done. 
Prospect came into the Waterbury ownership with the promise of “turning around [the] financially challenged hospital.” It was seen as just that, a possible salvation for a faltering hospital. A 2024 investigation by state health inspectors was “concerned that the ICU is often inappropriately staffed” and that Waterbury was “not providing quality patient care.” 
Sarah Campell, a former nurse at Waterbury, spoke with the CT Insider. She painted a devastatingly bleak portrait of Waterbury. She reported water leaks, broken beds, inoperable computers, a lack of cell service, and plumbing issues. It would then make sense that Prospect was issued a $60,000 fine for health code violations that same year. 
Prospect followed the private equity playbook with chilling precision. In January, Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, having milked profits from people just looking for good healthcare. When I say milked, I mean the fact that Prospect owes Waterbury roughly $22 million in unpaid city taxes. This bankruptcy filing ripples far beyond Waterbury, threatening Prospect’s other Connecticut hospitals, Manchester Memorial and Rockville General as well. Hospitals are not hedge funds. People’s health is not an asset class. Waterbury should have been treated like a place of care, not a business deal. 
Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) reached a deal to buy all three hospitals in 2022 with a settled amount of $435 million dollars. However, this quickly fell through due to a series of lawsuits and counter-lawsuits between the two groups over the true value of the assets. YNHH and the overarching healthcare system allege that once the $435 million dollar settlement was reached and signed, Prospect began to neglect the properties, decreasing the overall value of purchasing for YNHH. With reports of neglecting to pay rent and the denial by Prospect to provide YNHH with an audit, a spokesperson reported, “The lawsuit filed by Prospect is a clear attempt to shift attention away from the for-profit, California-based company’s mismanagement of their Connecticut facilities and neglect of the communities who entrusted them with their care.” 
Monetarily the for-profit private equity was successful for Prospect. The issue is that this model comes at the risk and expense of real people, with real issues, and real health to take care of. The truth seems to be that Prospect did not and does not care about this when it comes to the monetary value of their stakeholders and investors. 
Something must be done about Waterbury, Manchester Memorial, and Rockville General as soon as possible. Terms of settlement and discussion need to be moved away from money and look at the real thing being discussed, which is the lives of people. The lives of people who actually depend on the services and care of these hospitals. No person should enter a hospital and worry about the quality of service, lack of staffing, or be boarded in an ER for a full day before being seen. 
Connecticut lawmakers are taking action this session with House Bill 7067 calling for an expedited timeline for acquisition of bankrupt hospitals and Senate Bill 1507, a proposal to flat out ban private equity ownership of hospitals. 
Waterbury’s story shows what happens when healthcare becomes a profit machine instead of a public good. It should be treated as such and used as a lesson for healthcare across America. Prospect’s structure harming everyday citizens is not a uniquely Waterbury issue, it is one that can be seen across the United States. It’s time to put an end to the era of profit-first healthcare. People’s lives—not private equity returns—must come first.

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder.Georgia’s state Senate will have a new face when lawmakers return to work next year, and seven people are vying to be the one posing for photos under the Gold Dome when the dust settles.
  Former Sen. Brandon Beach. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The spot opened in this off-year election after Alpharetta Republican Sen. Brandon Beach stepped down following his appointment to serve as U.S. Treasurer under President Donald Trump.
Election Day is scheduled for Aug. 26.
Senate District 21 includes much of Cherokee County and some of north Fulton County. With seven candidates on the ballot, it’s likely that none will win an outright majority, and the most probable outcome is a runoff between the top two vote getters regardless of their party. The runoff is planned for Sept. 23.
Beach has been a stalwart ally to Trump – he was a leader in backing the false idea that the 2020 election was rigged and in pushing back against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ criminal case against Trump – and his former district rewarded him for his devotion.
Beach, who had served in the Senate since 2013, won just over 70% of the vote against his Democratic opponents in 2024 and 2018, the only times he faced a challenge from the other party. In 2024, Beach slightly outperformed Trump in the district, earning 81,481 votes, good for just over 70%, compared with Trump’s 78,544, or about 66.5%, according to data from the Georgia Secretary of State’s office analyzed by the Georgia Recorder.
So it’s no surprise that six of the seven Senate hopefuls are running as Republicans. Five of them came to Canton Monday for a forum hosted by the conservative Americans for Prosperity and answered questions about their commitment to principles like smaller government and lower taxes.
Policy-wise, there was not a whole lot of space between the candidates at the forum. Each said they support legislation expanding school vouchers, reducing or eliminating the state income tax and reducing government regulations – though the candidates did express some disagreement on accomplishing those goals.
Lance Calvert
  Lance Calvert. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Lance Calvert is the founder and owner of a Canton-based maintenance and repair business for retail and restaurants who says he wants to help repair the country.
“God’s going to fix this country, but he’s got some people that he needs to participate with him. Trump got this thing started, whether he knew or not to begin with. But there’s a lot of people who’ve been called forward, and they’re going to answer the call, we’re gonna do this. We’re going to turn this country around.”
While some candidates proposed a gradual approach to reducing the state income tax, suggesting a state equivalent to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, Calvert advocated for a quick and direct approach.
“Eliminate it. We’ve got the money,” he said.
Income taxes account for about half of state funds, according to the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, with sales taxes making up the second largest revenue source at about a quarter.
Stephanie Donegan
  Stephanie Donegan. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Stephanie Donegan, an entrepreneur and business strategist, said she’s seen the effects of rising prices for things like health insurance and will support conservative fiscal policies she says will help people keep more of their income.
“I love Georgia, I love the people of Georgia, and what I’ve been seeing is that what the people in Georgia have been asking for and need, we have not been getting. I truly believe I am that person who can do it. I can clearly sit up here among a group of amazing men, but men nonetheless, and still have a voice,” she said.”
Responding to a question about outreach to Latino voters, Donegan, who is Black, said Republicans have not done enough to reach minority voters.
“If we’re not careful, we’re going to become a blue state,” she said. “We are purple. We have a lot of people moving in here from blue states, from Philadelphia, New York, California, and if we don’t get people to understand that they have a place in this party and why they should vote for these conservative values, we’re going to lose this state, and that’s going to be a shame.”
Brice Futch
  Brice Futch. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Brice Futch, a Cherokee County firefighter, said he’ll push for expansive conservative policies, including replacing the state income tax with a consumption tax on goods and services purchased as well as expanding Georgia’s school voucher program.
“I believe the next step is ESAs, education savings accounts,” he said. “With that, the full amount of money that is given to the student over the life of the student would be loaded on a debit card. Parents would take their debit card and go to the education institution of their choice. If they decided they want to homeschool, they could also use that for homeschool curriculum as well. I also think it needs to apply to local funding and not just state funding.”
Georgia’s current school voucher program is available to students in low performing schools and provides funds based on the state’s share of the cost to educate that student, with the local share of the money staying in the local district.
Though Monday’s discussion centered on economic policies, Futch also pledged to be a strong voice on cultural issues.
“I believe you have to look at broader moral values,” he said. “If you want somebody that’s going to stand up and introduce legislation to outlaw puberty blockers in 2026, I’m your guy.”
A ban on the drugs that doctors prescribe to some transgender youths to delay the onset of puberty has been proposed but hasn’t passed. Georgia prohibits gender affirming surgeries and hormone treatments for transgender minors.
Steve West
  Steve West. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Steve West, the CEO of a metal fabrication company, stepped down from a seat on the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners to run for the seat.
“I want to run for the state Senate so I can go down to represent our district and cut taxes, bring business in, keep Georgia the best place to work, the best place to do business. You can tell I’m one that doesn’t speak very well. But I love the county. I love District 21. I’ve been a life-long resident of this district.”
West, who was first elected to the commission in 2014, said he may not be the slickest orator, but he says he has a record of serving the community and proposed ending the state film tax credit.
“I’m not the guy that wants to have his picture put in the paper every day. I want to be the one that goes down and fights for District 21 on the issues that we’re talking about tonight,” he said. “I want to go down and look at doing away with funding Hollywood and putting that money back into the income tax. Take away the income tax, quit funding Hollywood. Let’s look at deregulation so we can get projects done.”
Brian Will
  Brian Will. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Brian Will, an entrepreneur and author, resigned from a seat on the Alpharetta City Council to seek a place in the Senate.
For a Republican candidate, Will took several unorthodox positions on popular conservative programs, including the school voucher program and eliminating the state income tax.
In each case, Will supported the concept but found fault with how state leaders implemented them.
He said he supports the voucher project but said not enough people can take advantage of it and fully funding it would be too expensive. He said eliminating the state income tax and instituting a consumption tax would harm low-income Georgians who spend a greater portion of what they earn.
“This is why we need Georgia DOGE. We’ve got to go find out where the money went, who got it, for what, and how much, and then start cutting what we’re spending and come back and lowering the taxes.”
Will also had different ideas on the bill sometimes billed as Georgia DOGE, the Red Tape Rollback Act supported by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, which passed the Senate this year but stalled in the House. He argued the proposal would create more red tape.
“Simply put, we have 150,000 rules and regulations in the state of Georgia. We have 100 different agencies. Each agency is going to be required to go through every single one of those rules to determine if that rule costs more than $3 billion to implement over a five-year period. Now I’ve done math on this. I’ve done some research on it. It’ll take us about four years to get through every single rule to figure out if it’s a good rule that doesn’t cost money. The problem now is that the clock starts again. We have to do this every four years.”
Jason Dickerson
One Republican candidate qualified with the Georgia Secretary of State’s office to appear on the ballot but did not participate in Monday’s forum.
Jason Dickerson did not respond to a request for comment, but according to his qualifying documents, Dickerson is a Cherokee County investment manager. On his campaign website, he describes himself as “A conservative Republican businessman – not a typical politician.”
Debra Shigley
  Debra Shigley. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Attorney Debra Shigley is the sole Democrat in the race, who announced her candidacy last month. Last year, Shigley challenged the powerful House Speaker Pro Tem, Milton Republican Jan Jones, but lost by about 62% to 48%.
Members of her party are likely hoping that a crowded Republican field will split the conservative vote and put her into a runoff at a time when turnout could be low and Democrats are riled up to vote.
In a phone call, Shigley said voters in the district are not happy with what they are seeing from the government and she’s hoping to convince them she can help be a part of the solution.
“I know what it’s like to be a hardworking Georgian raising a family and wanting to make sure that they have every opportunity in front of them. I have been raising my kids here in the district and I never thought I would get into this arena, but as a mom, as a lawyer, as a small business owner, I just felt I could not stay on the sidelines because what we’re seeing here in our own community as well as in the state and even in our country is not going in the right direction, and something’s got to change.”

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, is stepping down from her leadership role at the end of the month. 
Russo has served as minority leader since January 2022 and she will continue to serve as state representative until her term ends on Dec. 31, 2026. She made the announcement to her caucus Thursday morning.

“Serving as the Ohio House Minority leader for the last three and a half years has been an incredible honor,” she said in a statement. “It has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding positions I’ve had the privilege to hold.”
Russo was first elected as state representative in November 2018, flipping a previously held Republican seat. She worked in health policy for more than 20 years before entering politics. Russo ran for Congress in 2021, but lost to U.S. Rep. Mike Carey 58% to 42%. 
“Every strong leader knows the importance of a thoughtful transition,” she said in a statement. “At the beginning of this session, I communicated to members that I wanted to remain in leadership through the important state operating budget negotiations.”
Heading into the legislative summer break and the rest of the General Assembly session, however, she said it “is important that I give the next leadership team ample time to thoughtfully and carefully plan how to navigate our caucus priorities after this budget cycle and to continue building our effort to pick up more seats for Democrats in the Ohio House in 2026.”  
Russo also said she wants to focus on her family, policy work and serving her district. 
“My son just graduated high school, and I look forward to spending the summer with him and my family preparing to send him off to college,” said Russo, who has three children. “Any decisions regarding my political future, will come at a later time.”
Russo is term-limited in the House and has been tight-lipped about her future plans. 
During her time as minority leader, Russo has been forced to navigate a Republican supermajority. 
“Over the last few years, my colleagues and I have stood strong in the face of attacks on our most basic rights and values, and despite tough odds we were successful in standing up for all Ohioans,” Russo said.
Ohio Democrats secured a couple of major victories in 2023 — voting down an effort that would have made it harder to pass constitutional amendments, and voting to enshrine abortion and reproductive rights in the state’s constitution. 
Russo’s announcement comes the same month Ohio Democratic Party Chair Liz Walters announced her plan to step down. So far, Dr. Amy Acton is the only Democratic candidate who has announced they are running for governor in 2026. Republican Vivek Ramaswamy is running for governor and Ohio Lieutenant Governor Jim Tressel is considering running. 
Ohio Supreme Court Judge Jennifer Brunner is the only Democrat in statewide office in Ohio.
“During her time as minority leader, Leader Russo has led Ohio House Democrats in fighting back against threats to our democracy, working to pass legislation that benefits Ohio families, and even picked up democratic seats during a difficult election cycle,” Walters said in a statement. “In an extremely difficult legislature, she has found countless ways to deliver for Ohioans.”
Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie J. Antonio, D-Lakewood, said she enjoyed working with Russo. 
“Leader Russo has been a dedicated advocate for working-class Ohioans and a fighter for fairness and justice in our state,” Antonio said in a statement. “I am confident that her voice will remain critical in shaping Ohio’s future, and I look forward to working with the next leader who will inherit the strong foundation she built in the House.”

(Photo credit: Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)House Speaker Daniel Perez said Thursday the chamber will try again next year to pass a repeal of the “free kill” statute following Gov. Ron DeSantis’ veto of the proposal.
DeSantis on May 29 vetoed the Legislature’s attempt to remove the bar on parents of adult children and the adult children of single parents from suing hospitals and physicians for non-economic damages for the deaths of loved ones. The governor said repealing “free kill” would increase health care costs for Floridians and make it harder to keep physicians in the state.
“Of course, the governor has in his right the power to veto this bill, and he chose to do so,” Perez told reporters. “I disagree with the veto, and we will be bringing that bill back next year for a continued conversation.”
Lawmakers passed HB 6017 with bipartisan support. Repealing the ban on suits to recover non-economic damages is one of the perennial arguments in Tallahassee, as business interests and medical groups oppose the move.
Perez said he remains opposed to placing caps on the pain-and-suffering damages, which is something that DeSantis said could make him support the repeal in the future, along with caps on attorneys’ fees. The family members barred from suing for pain-and-suffering damages can recover economic damages, such as lost wages, medical bills, and funeral costs.
“I don’t think that we should determine how much a person’s life is worth when someone negligently ended it,” Perez said.
The Senate also rejected a bid to cap the damages at $1 million on April 30. Florida, for now, remains the only state banning the recovery of pain-and-suffering damages for parents of adult children and adult children of single parents.

Lawmakers appropriated $312 million to purchase the facility from The GEO Group.
The state expects to take over the facility July 25.
The Board of Corrections must approve it.
“This move not only strengthens our public safety infrastructure, but also reflects our commitment to better outcomes for staff, inmates and the people of Oklahoma,” said Steven Harpe, Oklahoma Department of Corrections director, in a statement.
Built in 1998, the facility houses about 2,100 Oklahoma offenders, said Kay Thompson, a Department of Corrections spokeswoman.
The facility has medium security beds and a protective custody unit, she said.
The purchase price includes 560 acres, the buildings and equipment, Thompson said.
Current Lawton Correctional Facility employees will be offered employment after the successful completion of a background and drug test, Thompson said.
Some lawmakers were critical of the decision to purchase the prison, saying they were not told about it until the last minute.

,DC,2025-06-05 15:15:03+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump opens investigation into Biden autopen use,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-opens-investigation-biden-autopen-use,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump late Wednesday ordered the White House legal counsel and U.S. attorney general to investigate when Biden administration staff used an autopen to sign the former president’s name on official documents, alleging that Biden might not have known or approved of their actions.The inquiry represents an escalation in Trump’s animosity toward and legal action against former President Joe Biden, who vehemently denies the allegations that he didn’t know what executive orders or pardons were signed during his term.Trump has repeatedly suggested that Biden wasn’t fully cognizant during the end of his administration. Similar concerns were reported on by dozens of news organizations following Biden’s answers and behavior during a debate in June 2024.Biden’s apparent confusion during some of the debate raised alarm bells among fellow Democrats and eventually led him to withdraw from his reelection campaign, later endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris.Trump’s memorandum alleges “Biden's aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and assert Article II authority.“This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden's signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.” The memo stated that if Biden staff used an autopen, a mechanical device that mimics a person’s signature, “to conceal this incapacity, while taking radical executive actions all in his name, that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden's name.”Trump said Thursday during an appearance in the Oval Office that he hadn’t discovered any evidence that Biden aides violated the law.“No, but I've uncovered the human mind,” Trump said. “I was in a debate with the human mind and I didn't think he knew what the hell he was doing. So it's one of those things, one of those problems. We can't ever allow that to happen to our country.”  Biden released a written statement rejecting the claims Trump laid out in the memo, arguing the investigation “is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.”“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,” Biden wrote. “Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.""",,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

The utility, which provides electricity to most of Nevada, is asking state regulators to approve a revenue increase of $215.7 million that could hike  rates by 9% in Southern Nevada. It’s also asking to increase shareholder return on equity from 9.5% to 10.25%; level the playing field between rooftop solar and conventional ratepayers; and save low-income Southern Nevadans about $20 a month by eliminating their basic service charge.
“NV Energy is acting like it’s so benevolent,” Las Vegan Angel DeFazio told the Current of the proposed elimination of the service charge for customers earning less than 150% of the federal poverty level. “They’re not the good guys. They’re passing it on to us. They’re just redistributing the cost.” 
But representatives of charitable groups and veterans organizations that receive grants from NV Energy voiced support for the rate hike, as did the Asian Chamber of Commerce and Latin Chamber of Commerce. 
“My business community relies on energy, relies on being able to open their doors and conduct business. That takes an investment. That takes reliability. That is NV Energy,” said Peter Guzman, president of the Latin Chamber of Commerce. 
Guzman said he was not asked by NV Energy to speak on its behalf. The utility’s spokesperson did not respond when asked if NV Energy solicited support from the organizations. 
Longtime gaming executive and former acting UNLV president Don Snyder, who is currently chairman of the United Way Board of Directors, defended the utility’s bid to raise rates. Snyder said the non-profit touches one in four Nevadans through a variety of services. 
“We are uniquely positioned to understand the needs of our community, particularly our low income individuals and families,” Snyder told PUC Commissioner Tammy Cordova, who is presiding over NV Energy’s rate hike request. Snyder added United Way has a “longstanding partnership” with NV Energy, its employees,  and its foundation, which “provides financial grants supporting utility assistance for our low income senior citizens.” 
Others contend now is no time to raise the cost of electricity. 
Dr. Mary House, co-founder of Caring, Helping & Restoring Lives (CHR), urged the commission to hold NV Energy accountable for energy policies that she says disproportionately affect low-income individuals and families.
“They’re sacrificing necessary medicines just to pay their bills. They’re limiting how much they spend on groceries just to pay their bills,” House said, adding many of the families her organization serves pay a disproportionate share of their income toward electricity. 
House added that she has taken steps to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and increase energy efficiency. “But many households, the ones who I represent, don’t have the means to even make those changes.” 
House also encouraged the utility to fully refund overpayments of at least $17 million the utility assessed against some 70,000 customers in multi-family units over a 20-year span.  
Angela Hollimen moved to Las Vegas in 2018. The retiree said although she lives with family, making ends meet remains a struggle. 
“Since I moved here, I’ve noticed that everything’s been going up,” she said, adding her family has taken all the recommended steps to reduce energy costs. “Were doing what we’re supposed to do, and questioning whether we should have moved here.” 
Tracy Puckett, another retiree, said she “saved and saved” to install a $30,000 rooftop solar array on her home. NV Energy’s efforts to tweak its net metering formula will cost her and other solar customers more, extend the time it takes to recoup their investment, and deter more ratepayers from going solar. “I want my investment to mean something.”
The utility’s request to impose peak usage rates on customers drew protests from ratepayers who say the scheme penalizes working people who are not home to run appliances during hours when the system faces less demand. 
A customer using 5 kWh would pay $27 more per month, while a customer using 6 kWh would pay $38 more per month, according to data provided by Advanced Energy United, a trade group that represents renewable energy providers. 
Total usage during the monthly billing period would be irrelevant.
Should the PUC turn down the proposal for a peak demand rate, NV Energy wants to increase the basic service charge in Southern Nevada from $18.50 to $24, far less than the projected increase of maximum demand charges. 
The proposed changes “reflect the company and its shareholders’ best interests and not its customers’,” Julia Hubbard of Solar United Neighbors (SUN), an organization dedicated to educating ratepayers, said at the consumer session. “When someone goes solar, they are not just saving on future utility bills. They are adding infrastructure to the grid on their dime.”
“This proposal doesn’t account for their recent mismanagement of customer classifications, resulting in millions of dollars in overcharges, or lack of real progress on their transportation electrification plan and their community solar program,” Hubbard said, adding the utility, charged with constructing 120 electric vehicle charging stations, has completed 40. 
Hubbard said NV Energy’s plan to change the way it calculates net metering by calculating excess energy returned to the grid every 15 minutes rather than monthly, would reduce the value of rooftop solar and disincentivize investment in “a powerful tool that Nevada residents can use to lighten their energy burden while contributing to statewide goals.” 
The change is expected to increase monthly bills for rooftop solar customers by about $11 a month, and would affect customers who apply for net metering after Oct. 1 of this year. 
The move would delay return on investment for homeowners who install rooftop solar in the future, Hubbard said. 
“People are struggling to pay their energy bills,” she said. “This is not the time to raise rates.” 
The PUC will hold hearings on NV Energy’s rate hike request in September. If approved, the changes would go into effect in April 2026.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/D4983C29-B5B1-4344-BDEC-BCAF52B32D8C-1024x589.png,,,2025-06-05 11:08:15.310363

The library relies on the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) for about half of its annual funding.
The money helps pay for things like interlibrary loans, professional development for librarians across South Dakota, summer reading program support and public access to paid educational databases.
Access to that funding was called into question twice over the last six months. First, Former Gov. Kristi Noem released a budget plan that slashed state funding for the library to a level too low to meet the federal match necessary to secure IMLS funding.
State lawmakers returned enough money to the library in their final budget in March to maintain access to the grants, but an executive order to gut IMLS from President Trump threw the South Dakota State Library’s future into question again.

Money for the grants is congressionally appropriated, but advocates worried that IMLS staff cuts caused by the Trump order would make it impossible for the federal agency to process grant applications.
In the face of that uncertainty, the State Library announced a suspension of the courier service that delivers books from library to library through interlibrary loans. Without a courier service, local libraries would’ve needed to mail materials ordered through interlibrary loan.
State Librarian George Seamon got good news in late spring. He told the South Dakota Library Board of a notice from IMLS on the state’s federal grant on April 24.
It was to be the board’s last meeting. Lawmakers dissolved the citizen-led advisory group and cut three positions from the State Library as part of the compromise deal to save it. Seamon told the board during the April meeting that the departing employees had new jobs.
He also said the state had received half its IMLS money, and that securing the other half was contingent on answers to some follow-up questions from IMLS on how the dollars would be spent.
Nancy Van Der Weide, spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, confirmed this week that the remainder of federal funding has now been secured. The state library is an arm of the state Department of Education.
The interlibrary loan courier service will resume June 1, she wrote in an email to South Dakota Searchlight.
The future of funding on the federal side beyond this year is unclear, however. Congress appropriates IMLS funding in periodic increments, most recently in 2018. Congress faces a choice of whether to re-up IMLS funding beyond 2025.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-05 14:56:11+00:00,CT Mirror,"Despite key bills’ passage, legislative session ends on sour note",Ginny Monk and Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/05/ct-legislative-session-ends/,"A number of bills passed in the waning hours of CT's 2025 legislative session, but many more died, and there were a few twists along the way.","Although the General Assembly closed out the session with hugs, cheers and applause, it was tinged with a sour note after a dispute among Democrats over a few lines in the state budget that allow the state to take financial oversight of Ansonia.
Republicans, displeased that the lines targeting Ansonia had been included in the budget, moved to undo them by amending an unrelated bill.
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, voted alongside Republicans, and the amendment passed with Ritter’s support, 80-70.
But victory was fleeting. The move prompted a filibuster from one Democrat on the newly amended bill, a rare move from the majority party. 
Rep. Kara Rochelle, D-Ansonia, who was in favor of the state takeover, made clear that she planning to kill the amended bill by speaking until the midnight adjournment.
The tactic worked — legislators moved on, and the bill died without a vote.
The budget provision was an unwelcome surprise to the city’s Republican mayor, David Cassetti.
Rochelle has been a critic of Cassetti and his management of the city. The pair long have feuded.
“She brought a personal gripe to Hartford. She’s entitled to have that gripe, but I think she shouldn’t have used the process to try to get even with her mayor,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. 
Candelora called the surprise effort to force state oversight on Ansonia “the most egregious abuse that I’ve ever seen in this building.”
Ritter said he regretted the inclusion of the Ansonia language in the budget: It should have been a separate bill subjected to a public hearing, and the unsuccessful 11th-hour fight to strip it took up time that could have been used to pass other bills.
Ritter said he voted with Republicans to uphold his end of a deal to pass other bills important to his caucus. 
“Culture’s important,” Ritter said.
Rochelle offered no regrets.
“I encourage everyone to look at what’s happening with the finances of Ansonia,” she said. “That’s all I’m going to say tonight.”
Despite the Ansonia disruption, the House and Senate passed most of the day Wednesday easily, with most of the priority legislation they planned to move forward this session already approved. They spent hours debating the bonding bill, which passed the Senate in the afternoon. The Senate also gave the final nod of approval to a climate change bill.
Other than those, the day passed with mostly smaller bills. Lawmakers slowed down in the late hours. Less than an hour before midnight, the House was waiting for the Senate to send bills downstairs and announced Little League wins in their districts, teenagers getting driver’s licenses and interns’ future plans.

The Senate then passed dozens of bills in the last few minutes of the night on a consent calendar.
In the last few weeks of the six-month session, lawmakers have passed an omnibus housing bill, legislation to cut down on energy costs, a bill to improve early child care and education and reforms to Connecticut’s special education cost sharing system.
After weeks of negotiations with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office that included a since-rejected proposal to draft a one-year budget for the first time since the 1990s, lawmakers passed the biennial budget Tuesday.
Democratic leadership told members they were happy with the work accomplished this session.
“I think that we have a strong record of achievement in this session, but there is more work to do. This is an extraordinary year,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney, D-New Haven, in his closing remarks.

Still, thousands of bills died after committee passage. Democrats have already hinted at topics they’d like to work on again when the Connecticut General Assembly is next scheduled to convene in February. Looney said first on his list is a bill that expands services for children’s behavioral health.
The possibility of a special session remains, depending on the federal budget from Washington. If federal funds to Connecticut are cut, particularly for human services and health care, lawmakers may have to gather to adjust the budget. Looney told members it seemed likely he’d see them again in a few months for those adjustments.
Lamont has a few weeks to sign bills into law and is expected to veto at least one — a bill that would offer benefits to striking workers. He’s already signed several bills into law.
The governor visited the House of Representatives and Senate just before 9 p.m. Wednesday to chat with lawmakers and received a standing ovation. He told members of the media afterward that he was ultimately happy with how the budget negotiations turned out.

“Look what we did on child care,” Lamont said outside the House chambers. “Look what we did on special ed. Look at the investments we made that’ll make a big difference for our towns and cities for years to come.”
Drama in the Senate chambers
On the third floor, Lamont walked into a drama over whether the Senate would call a vote on a bill sought by Republicans and opposed by the building trades and the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
The measure, House Bill 7004, is intended to give Plainfield, a small town in eastern Connecticut, the ability to hold a referendum over a proposed trash-to-energy plant. 
A negative referendum vote would not kill plan, but it would be a factor that the state Siting Council must consider, said Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton.
Business in the Senate stopped Wednesday night while legislators talked over whether the bill would get a vote, as demanded by the Senate Republican minority. Without a vote, the GOP threatened to halt business by filibuster.
“This is a top Republican priority,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
The House passed the bill on a 104-43 vote at 12:06 a.m. Tuesday. Most of the no votes were cast by Democrats.
The bill’s impact would be broader than Plainfield: It would expand the number of so-called “environmental justice”  communities able to hold referenda by raising the population threshold from 10,000 to 16,000.
Environmental justice communities are any U.S. census block for which at least 30% of the population consists of low-income people who have an income below 200% of the federal poverty level.

Labor lobbyists were fuming at the prospect of the Democratic majority calling the bill for a vote as part of a last-night deal to smooth business. At that moment, Lamont arrived and was immediately confronted by Jennifer Berrigan of the Connecticut AFL-CIO.
“She was not talking about the other bill that she cares deeply about,” Lamont said after their conversation.
“The other bill” is the measure that would provide jobless benefits to strikers, and the AFL-CIO is already angry at Lamont over his pledge to veto it. 
Berrigan spoke animatedly to the governor, her words inaudible to onlookers. 
Lamont said the topic Wednesday night was HB 7004, the siting bill. He was not familiar with its details and looked to Matt Brokman, his chief of staff.
“I think it’s not a bill you really like,” Brokman said, telling the governor it could hamper the ability to site necessary projects in Connecticut.
Lamont said his night-time stroll was meant to be purely social.
“I think I did this last time, to just go around, say, ‘Hi, thank you for a good session. Good working with you. Now get out of here,’” he said.
The Senate passed the bill at 11:15 p.m. on a 25-11 vote, with every Republican in support.

No charter school change
For years, some education lawmakers have tried to back-pedal on a decade-long standing piece of legislation that made it more difficult for charter schools to open in the state.
An effort to change it came up empty again this year.
Prior to 2015, a charter school could begin recruiting students and building its campus as soon as it received approval from the state Board of Education. That year, however, a bill changed the process into a two-tier approval system, where the state Board of Education grants “initial” approval and a charter school can only open in Connecticut after receiving funding approved by lawmakers.
Senate Bill 1439 proposed to “include funding for new charters granted by the State Board of Education in the Governor’s annual budget, revise the process by which charters are granted for state charter schools, include charter school students in a town’s resident student count for purposes of education cost sharing grant calculations, and require a biennial report regarding charter schools to be submitted to the General Assembly,” according to language in the bill.
It had passed out of the Education Committee 30-14 and 37-17 in the Appropriations Committee but was never taken up by the House or Senate.
Scholarship opportunities 
Several bills that expanded scholarship opportunities merged into the budget this year, including for students who qualify for the Roberta B. Willis grant and for students looking to become educators.
The budget allotted $6 million in each of the next two fiscal years for aspiring educators. The scholarship was proposed this year to expand from offering up to $10,000 annually to graduates from priority school districts, or the top 10 lowest performing districts in the state, to anyone who’s underrepresented in the teaching profession and willing to become an educator in a shortage area.

Child Advocate
The House and Senate have also approved a bill that would change the reappointment process for the state’s Child Advocate, a position that has subpoena power to investigate all matters related to children in the state, including child welfare and unexpected deaths. 
If Lamont signs the bill, the Child Advocate will be selected for a term of five years instead of four. The bill also requires the Office of the Child Advocate’s advisory committee to evaluate the advocate’s performance and recommend whether they should be reappointed or not.
Earlier in the session, lawmakers had considered a significantly different version of the bill which would have taken the selection process away from the governor altogether. At the time, proponents said that facing appointment and reappointment by the executive puts the advocate in a delicate position in which they are serving as a watchdog for the executive branch while also reliant on its favor for their position. 
But after pushback from Lamont, that provision of the bill was stripped out, and the new legislation allows the governor to retain the power to appoint the position. Lawmakers have called the new bill a compromise, since it would create public-facing information about the effectiveness of the advocate’s performance, making any future decision to decline reappointment of an effective advocate more transparent.
Omnibus education bill fails
The legislature’s omnibus education bill, House Bill 7009, which included dozens of provisions from establishing a state seal of civics education, requiring school boards to annually adopt policies limiting smart-devices, changing kindergarten waiver requirements, and more, was never taken up by the Senate.
The bill passed the House on a 128-20 vote in early May and was noteworthy for what it did not address: a recent report by the Office of the Child Advocate concluding that Connecticut is one of a dozen states with “no meaningful regulation of homeschooling.”
Nonprofits and inflation rates
For years, nonprofits that contract with the state have struggled to pay bills and employees, and wages have been stagnant. To that end, Senate Bill 1358, which passed through both the House and Senate, would tie increases in wages and Medicaid rates to inflation. 
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, said the bill was long in the making.
“The concept of the bill itself is very important,” Osten said. “It is not a new concept, by the way — we use this for nursing homes and residential care facilities right now, so this is continuing that concept so that the nonprofit providers can be set up to have a standard increase in their funding, based on the consumer price index each year.”
Gian-Carl Casa, the president of the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance, said nonprofits have been struggling for a long time with stagnant employee wages and with the rising costs of health insurance, energy and rent. 
But when those organizations are pinched, they are unable to improve wages. After inflation, that effectively results in a pay cut for workers. “Many nonprofits now provide food panties for their employees because they have been so poorly paid.”
Green crabs
On Tuesday, Lamont signed into law a bill that allows Connecticut restaurants to serve green crabs, one of the state’s most invasive species. 
House Bill 6222 passed the House and Senate in May and allows restaurants to serve other “bait” species as well, without gaining a license from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. 
Restaurateurs said in public testimony that they benefit from the new law, citing the high culinary value of green crabs. 
On a similar note, the bill authorizes the Department of Agriculture to study lowering the minimum harvest size for oysters to smaller than 3 inches, the current standard. Bill proponents cited consumer demand for smaller oyster sizes, whereas opponents of the bill — oyster industry members — said that the current standard of harvest size preserves the health of Long Island Sound’s species. 
The new law demonstrates, among other things, the prevalence of industry and consumer demands versus environmental concerns in Connecticut’s aquaculture.

Earned wage access regulations loosened
As inflation, economic uncertainty and Connecticut’s high cost of living continue to strain wallets, legislators approved Senate Bill 1396, a bill that makes it easier for workers to receive pay advances for hours worked before their official pay day.Under the bill, which originated in the Banking Committee and was later amended by the Senate, so-called “earned wage access” payments will now be exempt from certain portions of the state’s small loans law, relaxing previous regulations that went into effect last year. The measure limits how much borrowers can request to less than $750, prevents them from requesting more than what they will actually earn in a pay period, and caps any related finance charges at $4 per transaction, or a maximum of $30 per month. The bill also restricts third-party earned wage access providers from pursuing people who fall behind on repayment. Supporters said the changes protect workers and will make it easier for them to access money when they need it by requesting part of their paycheck early. But consumer protection groups criticized the measure, arguing that because earned access wages are expected to be paid back so quickly, typically by their next check, already cash-strapped borrowers could end up in trouble. The bill passed unanimously out of the Banking Committee and received a 35-13 vote in appropriations before clearing the Senate 32-3. But the measure sparked debate and significant questions before Wednesday’s 101-46 vote in the House, where dissenting lawmakers argued it did not do enough to protect users from high interest fees and finance charges that could trap vulnerable workers in a spiral of debt. “I know what happens to our low-income folks, our folks that don’t really know how to navigate the financial system,” said Rep. David Rutigliano, R-Trumbull, who compared the practice to a payday loan and described it as “predatory.” Earned wage access regulations have been a focus of several state legislatures in 2025, with lawmakers in Maryland, Arkansas and Utah passing new measures guiding how providers should operate. Banking Committee co-chair Rep. Jason Doucette, D- Manchester, argued that SB 1396 is the best version of the regulation to date. “This bill will end up being, believe it or not, the strongest consumer protection bill for this product in the country,” he said.

Better prison meals, reporting on strip searches and more power for the Correction Ombuds 
An omnibus bill put forward by the state Department of Correction was mostly folded into the state budget. The provisions include a ban on nutraloaf — a solid “loaf” made of a mix of different foods that is sometimes used as a form of punishment — and a requirement for “palatable” meals, a study on the possibility of relocating the Bridgeport and New Haven Correctional Centers, a protocol for documenting inmate assaults on correction officers, a plan to improve retention and recruitment, and reporting on strip searches.
Removed from the bill was a mandate to release a report on medical malpractice cases that took place under the care of the Department of Correction, as well as approximately $11.6 million that would have gone to educational and vocational programming. The bill also does not include a reference to a pilot program for two body scanners, although Ritter said at a Wednesday press conference that the funds for the scanners was included in the budget. 
A bill that would give more power to the correction ombuds, including the ability to subpoena witnesses and to conduct unannounced visits to correctional facilities, passed the House of Representatives four hours before the close of the legislative session. It had previously passed the Senate 36-0.
The bill extended the term of the ombuds from two to four years. It also requires a correction officer who sees a fellow officer engage in an inappropriate use of force to report that colleague to the warden, who must then report it to the commissioner of the Department of Correction and the state police, and it requires the department to instate body cameras for correction officers in the facilities.  
Modifications to hate crimes laws
After a lengthy and highly technical debate, the House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday revising the state’s laws on hate crimes. 
The original bill came out of the work of Lamont’s Hate Crimes Advisory Council, which was convened in 2021. Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said Tuesday that the purpose was to consolidate Connecticut’s hate crimes laws, which are “scattered,” “inconsistent” and “difficult for police officers and prosecutors to charge,” into one place. 
The bill will move all the current statutes that pertain to hate crimes into one section, increases penalties for criminal acts that are found to have been motivated by bias against a protected group, and extends the power of the Attorney General’s office to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. 
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, protested Tuesday against an amendment to the bill that removed an earlier provision that would have required someone who committed a murder that was also classified as a hate crime to serve life without parole. 
“When somebody kills someone — I don’t care how old you are — and you kill a Black person not because they were trying to do something, but merely because they were Black, that’s a different kind of evil,” said Fishbein. 
Stafstrom said they did not want to take away discretion from judges, particularly if a hate crime was committed by a young person. He also said nothing prohibited a judge from imposing a sentence of life without parole. 
“A 19-year-old kid, even a 19-year-old kid who commits a hate crime might — might — be a different person when they reach the age of 50 or 55 or 60, and we should at least allow that 19-year-old kid the opportunity to make their case at the Board of Pardons and Paroles,” said Stafstrom.  
The amendment passed 102-46. 
Fishbein offered an amendment that would have included law enforcement as a protected class, along with race, gender, sexual orientation, age and other characteristics. The House opted to pause the debate and resume it the next day, when Fishbein withdrew the proposal. 
The House passed an amended version of the bill unanimously on Wednesday.

Roaming dogs debated but run out of time
Late in the evening, House lawmakers spent about half an hour debating whether to increase penalties on the owners of roaming dogs — only to give up before the clock struck midnight.
The penalty for anyone whose dog is caught wandering on private lands or a public highway is currently a fine that would increase to $350 under Senate Bill 1446, with even greater penalties for subsequent offenses. In addition to the state ban, many towns have their own leash laws.
After introducing the bill, state Rep. Jack Fazzino, D-Meriden, faced questions from Republicans who said they were concerned that owners could be penalized for simple mistakes. 
“I could see dogs getting loose a couple of time on the owner,” said state Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott. “They’re excited, they’ve got the zoomies, they take off, I can certainly see it happening.” 
While Fazzino said that the bill was intended to deal with dogs that are habitually allowed to roam free, Rojas afforded to “throw him a bone” after several rounds of questions and pass over the bill, sending into the scrap heap of the legislative session.
Mobile home bill
A bill that would have offered more protections for mobile home residents died Wednesday night after passing the House earlier in the week.
House Bill 5428 would have required park owners to disclose any ancillary fees, such as extra costs to own a pet or have a washer and dryer, ahead of time, and increase relocation payments for residents from $10,000 to $20,000 if the owner sells the park with the intent to turn it into something else, among other measures.
It would also have required that park owners test the power of fire hydrants on their properties and report the results to fire marshals, a measure added in the wake of two fires at parks in East Hartford that were difficult to control because the hydrants didn’t have enough water pressure.
The bill passed the House after being stripped of proposals to implement caps on land rents and ancillary fees but wasn’t called in the Senate.
Prescription drug prices
The Senate on Wednesday gave final passage to a bill that aims to reduce the cost of prescription drugs for Connecticut residents and increase transparency of the pharmaceutical industry.
The proposal requires state-regulated insurance plans to count certain out-of-pocket drug costs toward an enrollee’s deductible, even if someone goes outside of their insurance plan to buy medication, if they find a cheaper price. The change is meant to ensure that purchases from companies like GoodRX, which offer drug coupons for discounts on medications, can still count toward a deductible.
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, said the measure would “get people savings right there at the pharmacy.” Gilchrest served as co-chair of a bipartisan prescription drug task force that met over several months earlier this year to weigh possible solutions to the rising cost of medications.
The legislation also seeks to increase transparency into the practices of pharmacy benefit managers, middlemen commonly referred to as PBMs that help to manage drug benefits for health plans. The bill requires that the state Insurance Department report each year on the percentage of drug rebate dollars that insurers put toward reducing premiums for policyholders.
PBMs arose to help health plans negotiate with drug companies and save money on prescriptions but have come under fire over the last year for driving up costs for people and health plans to reap bigger profits for themselves. Gilchrest called it “vitally important” to bring transparency to the inner workings of PBMs.
The bill also allows state agencies to opt into a bulk drug purchasing program and requires the state to petition the federal government to authorize the production of generic GLP-1s.
The measure drew wide support in both chambers, passing with a vote of 142-5 in the House, and 32-4 in the Senate.

Final Actions
In the frantic final stretch, the Senate added more than 30 bills and resolutions to a consent calendar that they passed with less than 10 minutes to spare. Among the items was Senate Bill 1558, which would create a new tax credit for anyone who challenges another state for taxing them on income earned while in Connecticut. 
The idea is one that stretches back to February 2024, when Gov. Ned Lamont announced that he wanted to create an incentive to encourage someone to sue New York — where tens of thousands of Connecticut residents commute ​​— over the taxes on wages they earned working from home. 
After a year of waiting, lawmakers and members of Lamont’s administration decided to re-up their offer. 
“This is a critical emerging policy issue as telework arrangements have become increasingly common since the pandemic,” Jeffrey Beckham, the secretary Office of Policy and Management, said in testimony in support of the bill. “Many of these workers would receive favorable tax treatment if their income were sourced to Connecticut, and our position is that our state is the correct tax jurisdiction for our citizens when telecommuting from their home.”
After passing their consent calendar, the Senate voted on the very last bill of the session, House Bill 7192, implementing recommendations of the state’s bipartisan drug task force. The roll call was taken at 11:58 p.m.

(Provided)As torrential rains inundated Kentucky in April, Union County Judge-Executive Adam O’Nan needed labor to fill and distribute sandbags to protect homes and businesses from flooding.
  With a phone call, local students from the Earle C. Clements Job Corps center stepped up to the task. 
“They loaded those bags for them and were a tremendous help,” O’Nan said.
Now the hundreds of students and employees at the center in Union County will be scattering to uncertain futures after the Trump administration on May 29  announced that it would “pause” Job Corps operations across the country. 
O’Nan, a Republican, said that would be a loss for his county.
“It really is difficult to measure the value because we’re just so used to them being around, and not that we take them for granted, but they’re just part of us,” O’Nan said.  “If, in fact, this is the end of Job Corps, that’s just going to be a big void for us.” 
The abrupt halt would be an even bigger loss for the center’s mostly low-income students who are feeling panic, anger and desperation about their futures, said Jonathan Brown, the finance and administration director for the Clements center in Union County. 
“Either they have nowhere to go — they’re homeless or house insecure, they don’t have safe places to go — or they’re just not done with their trade,” Brown said. “I couldn’t imagine going to college for two years, halfway done, and then my school closes and loses its accreditation and none of my classes count.” 
Brown said the contracts to run the center, including contracts for employees, are being cancelled with a deadline of June 30 to have students returned to their home states. Guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor states the department will cover the cost to send students back to their home states by the end of the month and connect them with other job training and educational opportunities.
The Jobs Corps center in the county seat of Morganfield is one of dozens across the country — including two others in Kentucky in Floyd and Muhlenberg counties —  funded by the federal government that have offered young people free training in a wide variety of career paths including culinary arts, welding, nursing, electrical work, diesel mechanics and more. 
Brown said the center is the second largest in the country in terms of students served. He said the center is contracted to serve over 1000 students, bringing in usually about 30-40 new students each week. He said about 275 employees serve those students. 
Created 61 years ago as a part of President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty, Job Corps enrolls people between the ages of 16 and  24 who are dealing with challenges such as poverty, homelessness, a disability or falling behind on reading and writing skills. 
In announcing the “pause,” the Trump administration cited data from 2023 that it argues shows cost overruns and low graduation rates.
But Brown, the Job Corps administrator in Union County, argues the April report from the Trump administration is largely misleading, cherry-picking data from 2023 when centers were still rebounding from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Brown also thinks the “pause” of operations is essentially a closure.
‘A failed experiment’
Brown said the headwinds for his center began to pick up months ago with various positions and departments being cut, but he became particularly troubled with the center’s situation when enrollment of new students was halted in March. 
He said the Department of Labor stopped doing background checks for new students, essentially stopping the center from bringing in new students. 
Then in April, the department issued a report looking at graduation rates and the cost to graduate students from each center, stating that the average cost for each student at a center was a little over $80,000 and the average graduation rate from the centers was 38.6%. 
In early May, the Trump administration sent a budget request to Congress that eliminated funding for the Job Corps, calling it “a failed experiment to help America’s youth.” In testimony before Congress on May 15, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told lawmakers the president’s budget request signaled a need to “refocus” on “where those dollars are going to have the outcome for the workforce.” 
On May 29, Chavez-DeRemer announced the “pause” of Job Corps center operations, citing the report from April as evidence of the ineffectiveness of the Job Corps programs. 
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education, training, and community,” Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement provided in a press release. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve. We remain committed to ensuring all participants are supported through this transition and connected with the resources they need to succeed as we evaluate the program’s possibilities.” 
In Union County, Brown acknowledges there are “inefficiencies” within Job Corps and that some centers perform better than others. But given the United States is the “richest country in the history of the world,” he questioned why the federal government couldn’t provide “this small amount to give people that second chance.” 
An information sheet provided to the Lantern from the director of the Earle C. Clements center asserts the average graduation rate for Job Corps centers is higher than the average graduation rate for two-year community and technical colleges. The information sheet also asserts the average cost per student is lower, and comparable to community and technical colleges, when Job Corps enrollees who don’t ultimately graduate are taken into account.
 The April report released by the Trump administration says the Earle C. Clements center has a graduation rate of 47% and a cost per enrollee of $67,713 in 2023, both figures better than the national average in the report. 
Job Corps’ operations cost roughly $1.53 billion in fiscal year 2024, making up a small fraction of the $6.75 trillion of federal government spending that fiscal year.
“I wish it was a more nuanced look at how to make the program better to meet that national need to provide skilled labor while also serving disadvantaged youth,” said Brown.
A Department of Labor spokesperson did not respond to several emails requesting comment about criticisms of its April report. 
Finding meaning in helping students
Amanda Moore, the manager of Amanda’s Floral and Gift Shop in Sturgis, said the loss of Job Corps in Union County  “is really going to impact our whole community.” 
Her relatively new business hosted two paid internships with Job Corps students, one of whom worked on revamping the store’s website. 
“It kind of gives those kids a chance to get out into the real world without some of the struggles that they have at home,” Moore said. “Getting away from where they are and coming to the Job Corps Center and having a chance at life.” 
Job Corps students also put together a “wonderful meal,” she said, for a local gathering called “Derby Days” celebrating the running of the Kentucky Derby. 
“All the Derby favorites: They made a virgin mint julep, all the cucumber sandwiches that you could eat,” Moore said. “They put their heart and soul into all of that, and that was a big deal downtown here in Sturgis.” 
Brown, the finance and administration director for the local center, said the backgrounds of students can vary depending on what circumstances qualify them to enroll. It’s not uncommon for students to show up with only a garbage bag of “old, dirty clothes.” 
Finding meaning in helping those students is what has kept Brown, a Union County native, working at the center for 11 years, starting as a career counselor for students. He’s loved the work since “day one.” 
“My whole job was about the student, whatever they needed to get through the program, get their credentials, get their high school diploma, get a good job,” Brown said. “It’s stressful and it’s hard, but it’s meaningful. And you can see it every single day — the meaning.” 
He believes Job Corps is unique from other educational opportunities because it provides young people a safe place, free of charge, to sleep, have regular meals and work on a career away from the challenges they left behind. To make sure these young people, he said, don’t fall through the cracks. 
“I don’t know what a lot of this population will do. I don’t know what options they really have,” Brown said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2356-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 11:08:15.310363

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)It’s been more than 30 days since a hearing in a conflict over the language of a proposed 2026 reproductive rights ballot initiative, but with no decision yet from the Idaho Supreme Court, the group leading the push to restore abortion access in Idaho says the delay is hurting their organizing efforts.
Idahoans United for Women and Families launched its citizen-led initiative effort in April 2024 and submitted proposed ballot titles in August. A new state law also requires a fiscal impact statement to be attached to initiatives, and the group alleged Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican who has been outspoken about his anti-abortion views, and the Division of Financial Management inserted language that was prejudicial. They pointed in particular to a statement that said costs associated with the prisoner population and the Medicaid budget could occur.
Idaho Supreme Court hears arguments in abortion ballot initiative lawsuit

As part of the initiative process, the Attorney General’s Office is responsible for drafting short and long ballot titles that summarize what the legislation would do if passed. State law says the language must describe the proposal accurately and use common language without phrasing that is likely to prejudice voters. 
The complaint filed by Idahoans United with the Idaho Supreme Court in late January called the statement biased and says it includes contradictory language, “wrongly implies” that Medicaid and corrections spending would increase, and “prejudicially includes an irrelevant reference to the state’s $850 million Medicaid budget.” 
Labrador’s office did not respond to requests for comment. In court filings, Labrador did not address the fiscal impact statement component of the complaint, and only spoke to the “fetus viability” language that Idahoans United said was objectionable because it is not medical terminology. Labrador said it is common parlance and there is no difference between that language and “fetal viability.” 
In a separate court filing, officials with the Idaho Division of Financial Management did not speak to the rationale for the fiscal impact statement, but restated the language and denied that it was prejudicial to the initiative. 
 Group filed motion to expedite Idaho Supreme Court ruling in abortion initiative case

The Idaho Supreme Court heard arguments April 25, and there have been no updates since then, despite a motion to expedite. The last court battle over ballot titles was in 2023, when Reclaim Idaho said Labrador’s office also prejudiced its initiative language about changing the state primary election system.
In that case, oral arguments were held on a Monday and a decision came out that Thursday, with a unanimous vote in favor of Reclaim Idaho. Ultimately, voters overwhelmingly defeated the initiative in the November 2024 election. 
Idaho has a citizen ballot initiative process, but only its Legislature can propose constitutional amendments, unlike many other states. So instead of a constitutional amendment, the voters are asked to approve a citizen-crafted piece of legislation to be adopted. The measure requires a simple majority of voters to pass.
Idahoans United submitted a policy that would establish a fundamental right to contraception and fertility treatments under state law, including in vitro fertilization, the right to make decisions about pregnancy and childbirth, legalize abortion before fetal viability, and preserve the right to abortion after viability in medical emergencies. 
Fetal viability would be determined by a physician and what treatment is available, but the commonly accepted gestational age of viability in the medical community is 23 to 24 weeks.

The group’s spokesperson and lead organizer, Melanie Folwell, told States Newsroom that the delay has forced them to cancel a planned kickoff rally on June 14 at the Idaho Capitol. The rally is now scheduled for June 28, in hopes there will be a decision by then.
The initiative needs more than 70,000 valid signatures from districts across the state, and organizers had hoped to gather 10,000 of those in June alone. But the initiative language must be finalized and approved before any signatures can be collected, and the signature goal must be reached by April 30, 2026, to qualify for the ballot.  
“We won’t get another June. We won’t get another crack at this in the coming months, and there are some real impacts to having to pursue a lawsuit,” Folwell told States Newsroom.
The frustration is not directed at the court, Folwell said, but rather at state offices that crafted the language.
“I can’t speculate as to their intent, but in providing us with unclear titles and fiscal impact statement, we have certainly been slowed down,” she said. “It didn’t need to be this way.”  
There will also be financial effects, she said, because adding pressure to the timeline will increase the costs associated with mobilizing volunteers and canvassers to gather signatures by the deadline.
Nate Poppino, spokesperson for the Idaho Supreme Court, told States Newsroom in an email that the court does not comment on judicial deliberations, and opinions are issued at the court’s discretion.
“Sometimes the issues the court must consider resolve quickly, and sometimes they require longer discussion,” Poppino said.
Each opinion starts with one authoring justice, he said, and a draft is circulated among the other justices who can edit and weigh in before anything is finalized. That includes details like wording and the legal issues involved.
“If it’s a situation that involves a dissent, that also is examined by the full court,” he said.

When Thomas Fugate graduated from college last year with a degree in politics, he celebrated in a social media post about the exciting opportunities that lay beyond campus life in Texas. “Onward and upward!” he wrote, with an emoji of a rocket shooting into space.
His career blastoff came quickly. A year after graduation, the 22-year-old with no apparent national security expertise is now a Department of Homeland Security official overseeing the government’s main hub for terrorism prevention, including an $18 million grant program intended to help communities combat violent extremism.
The White House appointed Fugate, a former Trump campaign worker who interned at the hard-right Heritage Foundation, to a Homeland Security role that was expanded to include the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships. Known as CP3, the office has led nationwide efforts to prevent hate-fueled attacks, school shootings and other forms of targeted violence.
Fugate’s appointment is the latest shock for an office that has been decimated since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and began remaking national security to give it a laser focus on immigration.
News of the appointment has trickled out in recent weeks, raising alarm among counterterrorism researchers and nonprofit groups funded by CP3. Several said they turned to LinkedIn for intel on Fugate — an unknown in their field — and were stunned to see a photo of “a college kid” with a flag pin on his lapel posing with a sharply arched eyebrow. No threat prevention experience is listed in his employment history.
Typically, people familiar with CP3 say, a candidate that green wouldn’t have gotten an interview for a junior position, much less be hired to run operations. According to LinkedIn, the bulk of Fugate’s leadership experience comes from having served as secretary general of a Model United Nations club.
“Maybe he’s a wunderkind. Maybe he’s Doogie Howser and has everything at 21 years old, or whatever he is, to lead the office. But that’s not likely the case,” said one counterterrorism researcher who has worked with CP3 officials for years. “It sounds like putting the intern in charge.”
In the past seven weeks, at least five high-profile targeted attacks have unfolded across the U.S., including a car bombing in California and the gunning down of two Israeli Embassy aides in Washington. Against this backdrop, current and former national security officials say, the Trump administration’s decision to shift counterterrorism resources to immigration and leave the violence-prevention portfolio to inexperienced appointees is “reckless.”
“We’re entering very dangerous territory,” one longtime U.S. counterterrorism official said.
The fate of CP3 is one example of the fallout from deep cuts that have eliminated public health and violence-prevention initiatives across federal agencies.
The once-bustling office of around 80 employees now has fewer than 20, former staffers say. Grant work stops, then restarts. One senior civil servant was reassigned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency via an email that arrived late on a Saturday.
The office’s mission has changed overnight, with a pivot away from focusing on domestic extremism, especially far-right movements. The “terrorism” category that framed the agency’s work for years was abruptly expanded to include drug cartels, part of what DHS staffers call an overarching message that border security is the only mission that matters. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has largely left terrorism prevention to the states.
ProPublica sent DHS a detailed list of questions about Fugate’s position, his lack of national security experience and the future of the department’s prevention work. A senior agency official replied with a statement saying only that Fugate’s CP3 duties were added to his role as an aide in an Immigration & Border Security office.
“Due to his success, he has been temporarily given additional leadership responsibilities in the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships office,” the official wrote in an email. “This is a credit to his work ethic and success on the job.”
ProPublica sought an interview with Fugate through DHS and the White House, but there was no response.
The Trump administration rejects claims of a retreat from terrorism prevention, noting partnerships with law enforcement agencies and swift investigations of recent attacks. “The notion that this single office is responsible for preventing terrorism is not only incorrect, it’s ignorant,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an email.
Through intermediaries, ProPublica sought to speak with CP3 employees but received no reply. Talking is risky; tales abound of Homeland Security personnel undergoing lie-detector tests in leak investigations, as Secretary Kristi Noem pledged in March.
Accounts of Fugate’s arrival and the dismantling of CP3 come from current and former Homeland Security personnel, grant recipients and terrorism-prevention advocates who work closely with the office and have at times been confidants for distraught staffers. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the Trump administration.
In these circles, two main theories have emerged to explain Fugate’s unusual ascent. One is that the Trump administration rewarded a Gen Z campaign worker with a resume-boosting title that comes with little real power because the office is in shambles.
The other is that the White House installed Fugate to oversee a pivot away from traditional counterterrorism lanes and to steer resources toward MAGA-friendly sheriffs and border security projects before eventually shuttering operations. In this scenario, Fugate was described as “a minder” and “a babysitter.”
DHS did not address a ProPublica question about this characterization.
 Rising MAGA star
The CP3 homepage boasts about the office’s experts in disciplines including emergency management, counterterrorism, public health and social work.
Fugate brings a different qualification prized by the White House: loyalty to the president.
On Instagram, Fugate traced his political awakening to nine years ago, when as a 13-year-old “in a generation deprived of hope, opportunity, and happiness, I saw in one man the capacity for real and lasting change: Donald Trump.”
Fugate is a self-described “Trumplican” who interned for state lawmakers in Austin before graduating magna cum laude a year ago with a degree in politics and law from the University of Texas at San Antonio. Instagram photos and other public information from the past year chronicle his lightning-fast rise in Trump world.
Starting in May 2024, photos show a newly graduated Fugate at a Texas GOP gathering launching his first campaign, a bid for a delegate spot at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. He handed out gummy candy and a flier with a photo of him in a tuxedo at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. Fugate won an alternate slot.
The next month, he was in Florida celebrating Trump’s 78th birthday with the Club 47 fan group in West Palm Beach. “I truly wish I could say more about what I’m doing, but more to come soon!” he wrote in a caption, with a smiley emoji in sunglasses.
Posts in the run-up to the election show Fugate spending several weeks in Washington, a time he called “surreal and invigorating.” In July, he attended the Republican convention, sporting the Texas delegation’s signature cowboy hat in photos with MAGA luminaries such as former Cabinet Secretary Ben Carson and then-Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).
By late summer, Fugate was posting from the campaign trail as part of Trump’s advance team, pictured at one stop standing behind the candidate in a crowd of young supporters. When Trump won the election, Fugate marked the moment with an emotional post about believing in him “from the very start, even to the scorn and contempt of my peers.”
“Working alongside a dedicated, driven group of folks, we faced every challenge head-on and, together, celebrated a victorious outcome,” Fugate wrote on Instagram.
In February, the White House appointed Fugate as a “special assistant” assigned to an immigration office at Homeland Security. He assumed leadership of CP3 last month to fill a vacancy left by previous Director Bill Braniff, an Army veteran with more than two decades of national security experience who resigned in March when the administration began cutting his staff.
In his final weeks as director, Braniff had publicly defended the office’s achievements, noting the dispersal of nearly $90 million since 2020 to help communities combat extremist violence. According to the office’s 2024 report to Congress, in recent years CP3 grant money was used in more than 1,100 efforts to identify violent extremism at the community level and interrupt the radicalization process.
“CP3 is the inheritor of the primary and founding mission of DHS — to prevent terrorism,” Braniff wrote on LinkedIn when he announced his resignation.
In conversations with colleagues, CP3 staffers have expressed shock at how little Fugate knows about the basics of his role and likened meetings with him to “career counseling.” DHS did not address questions about his level of experience.
One grant recipient called Fugate’s appointment “an insult” to Braniff and a setback in the move toward evidence-based approaches to terrorism prevention, a field still reckoning with post-9/11 work that was unscientific and stigmatizing to Muslims.
“They really started to shift the conversation and shift the public thinking. It was starting to get to the root of the problem,” the grantee said. “Now that’s all gone.”
Critics of Fugate’s appointment stress that their anger isn’t directed at an aspiring politico enjoying a whirlwind entry to Washington. The problem, they say, is the administration’s seemingly cavalier treatment of an office that was funding work on urgent national security concerns.
“The big story here is the undermining of democratic institutions,” a former Homeland Security official said. “Who’s going to volunteer to be the next civil servant if they think their supervisor is an apparatchik?”
 Season of attack
Spring brought a burst of extremist violence, a trend analysts fear could extend into the summer given inflamed political tensions and the disarray of federal agencies tasked with monitoring threats.
In April, an arson attack targeted Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, who blamed the breach on “security failures.” Four days later, a mass shooter stormed onto the Florida State University campus, killing two and wounding six others. The alleged attacker had espoused white supremacist views and used Hitler as a profile picture for a gaming account.
Attacks continued in May with the apparent car bombing of a fertility clinic in California. The suspected assailant, the only fatality, left a screed detailing violent beliefs against life and procreation. A few days later, on May 21, a gunman allegedly radicalized by the war in Gaza killed two Israeli Embassy aides outside a Jewish museum in Washington.
June opened with a firebombing attack in Colorado that wounded 12, including a Holocaust survivor, at a gathering calling for the release of Israeli hostages. The suspect’s charges include a federal hate crime.
If attacks continue at that pace, warn current and former national security officials, cracks will begin to appear in the nation’s pared-down counterterrorism sector.
“If you cut the staff and there are major attacks that lead to a reconsideration, you can’t scale up staff once they’re fired,” said the U.S. counterterrorism official, who opposes the administration’s shift away from prevention.
Contradictory signals are coming out of Homeland Security about the future of CP3 work, especially the grant program. Staffers have told partners in the advocacy world that Fugate plans to roll out another funding cycle soon. The CP3 website still touts the program as the only federal grant “solely dedicated to helping local communities develop and strengthen their capabilities” against terrorism and targeted violence.
But Homeland Security’s budget proposal to Congress for the next fiscal year suggests a bleaker future. The department recommended eliminating the threat-prevention grant program, explaining that it “does not align with DHS priorities.”
The former Homeland Security official said the decision “means that the department founded to prevent terrorism in the United States no longer prioritizes preventing terrorism in the United States.”

The Delaware Division of Small Business (DSB) has awarded a new round of Encouraging Development, Growth and Expansion (EDGE) grants to 10 small businesses across the state, providing $650,000 to support a range of innovative and community-driven ventures.
Winners of the Spring 2025 EDGE grant competition were recognized during a ceremony held June 4 at Bally’s Resort in Dover. The awards were presented by DSB Director CJ Bell and Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez.
“I am incredibly excited by the diverse range of small businesses that we were able to support during this round of the EDGE competition,” said Bell. “These companies are contributing to the quality of life of Delawareans in a variety of ways. I’m proud that through this funding we are able to help elevate them to the next level.”
Launched in 2019, the EDGE program has now distributed nearly $8 million to 120 small businesses statewide. The initiative supports young Delaware businesses with fewer than 10 full-time employees through a competitive selection process, culminating in public pitch sessions to expert judges. Five businesses in STEM fields each receive up to $100,000, while five “Entrepreneur Class” businesses receive up to $50,000.
Patibanda-Sanchez emphasized the broader impact of this investment. “Small businesses enhance economic diversity in our state by helping create new industries, jobs and markets. When small businesses thrive, we all thrive,” she said.

This round’s recipients include ventures in mental health, biotechnology, menopause care, agritourism, and sustainable meat production. Several address significant public needs, from expanding therapy access in Wilmington to researching treatments for rare diseases.
The selected businesses reflect the program’s continued efforts to support historically underrepresented entrepreneurs. Since the EDGE program began, 54% of awardees have been woman-, minority-, or veteran-owned, with another 18% representing more than one of those categories.
In total, 139 businesses applied for the spring competition, matching the program’s initial 2019 turnout. Finalists presented in May at the BPG Brandywine Building in Wilmington, and 10 were selected: seven based in New Castle County, one in Kent, and two in Sussex.
Past EDGE winner Donny Legans, owner of Rail Haus in Dover, praised the program during the ceremony, describing the award as a catalyst for growth and strategic planning.
“Receiving the EDGE grant was a game changer for us,” Legans said. “It undoubtably made us a stronger business that forced us to look at our weaker areas and address them with a solid strategy.”

(Photo by Brian Venua/KMXT)Alaska school districts hiring from the Philippines are taking some of the country’s best and brightest teachers. It’s a win for Alaska kids, but what does that mean for students back in Southeast Asia? KMXT’s Brian Venua explores brain drain and brain gain in Part 5 of a five part audio series, Mabuhay sa Alaska.
When Alaska school administrators toured Pajo Elementary School, each class greeted them by welcoming them to the Philippines in both English and in Filipino. The administrators were there to see what the teachers they hire from the Philippines experience before moving to Alaska.
But the students are the other side of that story — These are kids that get left behind when Filipino teachers are hired abroad.
When recruiters opened up appointments for screening, all 720 spots were filled in just 16 minutes. The only advertising was a few posts on social media. But one consequence of hiring abroad is fewer quality teachers in the Philippines — a phenomenon known as brain drain.

Conversely, Alaska gets brain gain. Hiring teachers has largely been a success for the state’s kids. Recruiters on the 2025 trip picked some of the most highly educated teachers from the island nation. Kodiak Island Borough School District, for example, has more doctorate degrees from its 30 or so Filipino teachers than it does from its over 300 American hires.
“We were impressed with the quality of teachers that we met over there. And we were able to choose – from there – the top of the top,” said Cyndy Mika, the district’s superintendent. She said there have been more remarkable candidates than they can hire during recruiting trips.
It’s hard to say what the impact is on the Philippines, though.

Mika said that so far, a surplus of workers in the Philippines is helping address her district’s shortage.
“A lot of the teachers that we interviewed in the Philippines, when they first got their start, it was as a volunteer teacher,” she said. “They weren’t being paid because there weren’t jobs. They’re producing too many teachers.”
But Mika is concerned that taking so many highly qualified teachers could create a sort of skill ceiling there, if the country’s best teachers keep leaving for Alaska and other destinations.
That doesn’t change that her priority is the kids in the community where she works.
“My number one concern as a superintendent in Kodiak is getting the best quality teachers we can in front of our students,” she said. “If we didn’t have these Filipino teachers, who would we have?”

She said that without international hires, vacant teacher positions would lead to smaller teacher-to-student ratios and more burnout for her staff.
Remittance and returning teachers
It’s not a one-way street, though.
Many Filipinos working abroad send a lot of money home – 8% of the country’s economy, according to some reports. Their experience, professional development and cultural knowhow gained in the U.S. is valuable, too, and sometimes comes back.

Edna Auxtero is the administrator for Tagaytay Christian Academy, a private school about a two-hour drive from Manila. She said hiring Filipino teachers is a huge compliment to the country’s educational system.
“I’m so proud that they’re even interested to get Filipinos,” Auxtero said. “That’s always my dream – that the priority for employment in other countries are Filipinos.”

TCA’s principal, and many of its teachers, are alumni. Auxtero hopes some of them will go to Alaska someday and return with new skills.
“My hope is that they will come back to build the nation and impart all their knowledge, experiences to the next generation so that Philippines will rise up also,” she said.

“They can expect that for teachers under J1 visas,” said Serjoe Gutierrez, a Kodiak music teacher and one of the district’s first direct hires from the Philippines.
J1 visas require international hires to go back to their home countries after a few years. But Gutierrez, and many others, are on potential paths to permanent residency through H1B visas.

But he still thinks about kids he taught at a private school in Iloilo City.
“I do worry, sometimes,” Gutierrez said. He thought about it even before coming to Alaska. “I was thinking about it before resigning, but I told myself it’s for me. The kids, they would gain more experience – they’re still young. But I’m not getting any younger, so I need to do something for myself, too.”
Kodiak is his home now.
“I do love my country. I do love the Philippines, but I think being a teacher in Kodiak – being here in Alaska – opened a lot of opportunities for me,” he said.
He said he’s not sure he would have had the same chances to travel and play piano and violin publicly in the Philippines. He hopes to be one of the first to get a green card through the school and stay in the U.S. indefinitely.

Mike Dunleavy called a news conference on the governor’s floor of the Alaska State Capitol. The shades were drawn, and a handful of reporters lined a long conference room table, as Dunleavy spoke and took questions for over an hour, explaining his criticisms and his veto. 
In offices throughout the rest of the building, legislators on all sides of the politically contentious debate on how to fund Alaska schools, watched from behind closed doors, as well as school district leaders, news outlets, and Alaskans across the state — live, via the cameras of Gavel Alaska.

In the room, Gavel production crew Michael Penn operated a live camera broadcasting  Dunleavy, with Tulio Fontanella sitting to the governor’s right side, in a baseball cap, microphone in hand. 
During the May 19 news conference, Gavel Alaska was nearing the end of another legislative session. For nearly 30 years, Gavel has provided a free, public broadcast of the business of the state government to the rest of Alaska. A team of eight, mostly seasonal staff, operates cameras and broadcasts remotely from a ground floor production studio at KTOO Public Media, on Egan Drive along the waterfront of Juneau.
“It’s kind of the C-SPAN of Alaska,” said executive producer Will Mader, referring to the nonprofit cable TV network that has streamed the U.S. government in Washington, D.C., since 1979.
Above the chambers and committee rooms of the Alaska State Legislature, overlooking lawmakers’ debates, governors’ speeches, the prayers over floor sessions and the introductions of guests in the galleries, cameras and microphones capture the business of the State Capitol and Gavel broadcasts it live to Alaska. The team has just wrapped up covering another 120 day legislative session, with over 800 hours of live coverage broadcasting from the Capitol. 
The team of Gavel Alaska are used to dealing with technical problems, but now, they’re facing a potential new hurdle of federal cuts. Gavel’s crew finished the session at a sensitive time for public broadcasting. President Donald Trump has proposed large-scale cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides a share of funding to KTOO and public media across the country and state. 
Looking closely at Gavel Alaska gives a sense of the work that goes into giving the public access to state government. While the people in front of the cameras make the news, the people behind them rarely capture public attention. 
Behind the cameras
On a late winter morning, Mader sits in front of a wall of monitors, gearing up for a busy day covering the Alaska State Legislature, which typically runs from January to May. 
Teams of two staff monitor three or four robotic cameras in each chamber of the House and Senate, the committee rooms, and the hallways. During hearings or floor sessions, they toggle between cameras to focus on who is speaking, add captions with names and titles, feature speakers’ presentations and provide information for public comment.

Mader said the most newsworthy topics are recorded and streamed on KTOO’s statewide public affairs TV channel, KTOO 360TV. It’s also transmitted via satellite through the Alaska Rural Communications Service statewide, for those without consistent internet. “So it’s available to anyone out in rural Alaska that can view it, just with an antenna,” he said.
Though all hearings are livestreamed online, on some days there can be up to six committee meetings at a time, so Mader said that can be a challenge deciding which three to feature at once. “We always cover House and Senate floor sessions, and we almost always cover finance (committee) meetings,” he said. “The budget is always the No. 1 issue in session. So that’s one reason for covering finance, as well as that it’s the last stop for most legislation before it gets to the floor.”
The Gavel broadcast launched in 1996, first with one cameraperson moving a manually operated camera between rooms of the Capitol to cover meetings, “which isn’t ideal, because people are facing all different directions,” Mader said. 
Eventually, the Legislature started some basic webstreaming with its own cameras. Ultimately the Legislature agreed to an informal partnership with Gavel and KTOO to provide a more quality broadcast.  
“They share access to the cameras, and then they get a higher quality video feed from those cameras,” said Mikko Wilson, production manager at KTOO. 
The Gavel production at the Capitol saw a major technological upgrade in 2020, when grant funding and the purchase of new robotic cameras arrived at the same time as the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We had the quotes for the cameras. And I picked up the phone and said, ‘Ship ’em. Send us the cameras, like we need the robots now!” Wilson said, smiling. “And so that was my COVID project in 2020, pulling about 2 miles of cable and installing the 40-something-odd cameras inside.” 
At the controls are new seasonal staff, like fresh college graduates learning broadcast production, as well as veteran Alaska journalists, like longtime Juneau photojournalist Michael Penn and former TV broadcaster Bob Laurie.
In a small studio off the main production bay, Laurie wrapped up covering a committee meeting and had time to talk. “I try to really listen closely to what is being said, so that I can make sure I get the right names up, the right explainers, and kind of follow the flow of what is going on in the room. It takes a lot of focus for me,” he said.

Laurie first covered the Legislature as a young TV reporter, for a highly contentious session in 1981. 
“The leadership in the House, it took them a long time to organize…before they had their 21 votes together,” he said, to form a majority caucus. “We didn’t have the, you know, 121 day sessions, and people were dissatisfied with nothing getting through. Things were held up.”
He said he slept on someone’s floor while covering the action. “I was the first full-time television reporter from outside Juneau to cover the Legislature,” he said. “My competition followed about three days later — three days after I got on the air.”
That launched a television reporting career, then work in state government, before Laurie returned to cover the session seasonally with Gavel.
“So this is nice, clean. This is raw. All we’re doing is getting the different shots,” he said. “This is what is actually happening, so people can see their representatives at work.”
Some days Laurie is in the studio, and some days he’s in the Capitol operating a camera to cover live events, like speeches from the governor or Alaska’s U.S. senators. He said it’s an opportunity for Alaskans to watch their elected officials in action. 
“They can actually sit there and actually watch it and say, ‘Oh, that’s who I elected,’” he said. “Whether it’s good or bad. Without any editorial comment.”

Across the hall, Tulio Fontanella is covering a Senate Finance Committee hearing a report on the state’s oil revenues. He grew up in Juneau and just graduated from college with a degree in sports media. He said while there’s some comparisons to sports broadcasting, it’s much slower. 
“There will be times that you’ll stay on a wide shot, just because you don’t know who’s gonna talk next or how quickly they’ll be done talking,” he said. “There’s other people who pause a long time before they start speaking, so it’s a balancing act, getting that right.”

His partner in the booth on captions, Robbie Gabel, who also grew up in Juneau, is also in his first year of broadcast production. 
“I like when it’s a little more hectic. It’s a little slow. So it’s fun when they’re trying to get stuff in,” he said. “I like it when it’s more hectic and a lot more going on.”
The crew is on duty whenever legislators are live, so that means long hours and sometimes weekends, especially when bills are being voted on, and final budget negotiations take place at the end of May.
“It’s more complicated than someone would think,” Fontanella added. “This type of television, you know, is somewhat simplified, but also still more complicated than anyone would guess. Like Will does so much planning for what we do. And Mikko, with all the tech mishaps or whatever needs to be set up — they do a lot of work.”
Like C-SPAN, Gavel broadcasts the activities of all three branches of Alaska’s government: the Legislature; the executive, such as governor’s speeches or news conferences; and the judiciary, including oral arguments before the Alaska Supreme Court.  
At times, Gavel broadcasts emergency response updates, such as from the U.S. Coast Guard or National Weather Service; it provided updates when one of the strongest storms on record, Typhoon Merbok, hit in 2022, impacting more than 35 communities in Western Alaska.  
Gavel partners in Juneau and statewide
Gavel Alaska is an independent press outlet, but those broadcasts require close coordination with public offices around the state. 
For broadcasting the Alaska Supreme Court, that’s the court clerk’s office; for the Legislature, that’s daily coordination with the media team of the Legislative Affairs Agency, a nonpartisan support agency based in the Terry Miller Legislative Office on 6th Street behind the Capitol. 
The agency also provides webstreaming on the state’s website of all legislative floor sessions and committee meetings, for the public record, said Tim Powers, the agency’s chief technology and operations officer.

“So KTOO is going to do their high production quality for all the popular meetings, and we’re still going to create the record for everything that may not be as popular, yeah, and won’t have as high demand on television,” he said.
The agency also coordinates all call-ins for the public to comment. “You can testify on every bill in every committee in Alaska when they have public testimony, and that is not the case in other states,” he said. 
“In some other states, you have to go to the State House to testify. In some other states, you’re not allowed to testify, even if you do go to the State House, because they just don’t take it. So it’s unique, uniquely Alaskan, and I think it’s a benefit to us,” Powers said. 
Powers said typically they see an estimated 1 million minutes per year of teleconferencing. “Yeah, it’s a lot of people connected,” he said.
The Gavel livestream is watched closely by Alaska news outlets and journalists too, like Matt Acuña Buxton, who writes the political newsletter, the Alaska Memo.  
“Literally — and I mean literally — I couldn’t do my job covering the Alaska Legislature from Anchorage without Gavel Alaska’s hard work,” he said. “It’s a lot more than just a camera in a legislative hearing, and Gavel’s crews do so much behind the scenes to ensure we can see what’s going on in Juneau, whether it be news conferences or the beloved hallway cameras. 
“Their work with the broadcast during the day, which has to keep up with packed days of simultaneous hearings as well as the slow days, does a good job of balancing the big-ticket issues while also offering a wide look at things that you didn’t know needed to be on your radar.”
Federal funding under threat
KTOO receives local funding, as well as federal funding, whose future is now uncertain. 
The partnership with the state to broadcast Gavel Alaska is an informal one. “We don’t receive any state funding for actually making this happen,” said KTOO manager Justin Shoman, “So we’re really relying on these other sources.”
Since its start in 1996, the public television broadcast has been partly funded by the City and Borough of Juneau, to provide Alaskans access to the Capitol. Amid a long-running dispute on the location of Alaska’s capital, the city’s funding of the broadcast continues still today.
“Regardless of where the capital is in Alaska, it’s still inaccessible easily to a large number of people,” Mader noted. “So that’s why I think, of all the states, having this service is most crucial in Alaska.”
The Gavel Alaska staffing and production costs about $750,000 per year, Shoman said, with $455,000 funded by the city. 
The remaining roughly $295,000 is funded by a mix of sponsorships, underwriting, community donors and federal grant funding, including funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which also supports the general TV operations of KTOO. “The majority of CPB funding goes to television. That’s simply because television is more expensive to produce,” Shoman said. 
That federal funding is threatened now, as Trump has proposed steep cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
Shoman and other supporters of public broadcasting in Alaska are actively advocating, including flying to Washington, D.C., and meeting with Alaska’s congressional delegation, urging them to protect the funding. 
“For those who are concerned with the future of Gavel Alaska and that level of government, accessibility and transparency — it is reliant, in Alaska, on some federal funding, and it’s important that people know that,” Shoman said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSCF4772-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 11:08:15.310363

With $49,000 in student loan debt, Josue Villalpando figured becoming a homeowner was a long way off.

“The thought of purchasing a home was definitely floating around, however I never actually looked into it knowing that I had such a big burden with my student loans,” he said.

A recent graduate of the University of Illinois Chicago, Villalpando, 29, took out private loans to pay for college. Unlike federal student loans, private loans typically have higher interest rates and fewer forgiveness programs, making them harder for borrowers to pay off.

Then, his fiancé came across the SmartBuy program – an initiative set up by the state to help incentivize residents to purchase a home while paying off their student loan debt, one of the leading factors delaying homeownership among young adults.

SmartBuy pays up to $40,000 in student loans and contributes up to $5,000 towards a down payment or closing costs at the time of purchase.

“He showed it to me and said, ‘Hey, maybe, let’s fact check it, and let’s make sure it’s a real thing, because it’s almost too good to be true, right?’” said Villalpando, who received his degree in communication.

Records obtained by the Illinois Answers Project show that a total of 755 houses have been purchased through the program, with 482 still in process from the second round of applications.

Villalpando closed on his home in Lansing, Illinois in March.

“With my student loans being fully paid off, I know I can comfortably pay my mortgage without having to worry about financial constraints,” said Villalpando. “The SmartBuy program is what made me take the initiative.”

But the long-term viability of SmartBuy remains uncertain.

Renewal for the program is dependent on reallocation of state funding. After the first round closed in 2021, it took the state more than three years to reopen the program, which closed for the second time in February.

The uncertain timeline for program renewal raises questions about it being a viable option for tackling the staggering $63 billion in collective student loan debt the state faces.

Illinois has the seventh highest average state debt in the nation. Coupled with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, the burden of these loans become even more substantial for some borrowers, effectively delaying the purchase of a home, the decision to start a family and progress towards economic advancement.

With federal student loan programs in disarray, innovative, state-level programs like SmartBuy offer an alternative answer to combating the crisis. But federal funding, legislative approval and borrower awareness remain barriers to sustained coverage and widespread success.

Student loans are also preventing qualified applicants from pursuing professions with costly higher education requirements, like legal and medical careers.

“Tuition for undergraduate and law school has grown at something like three to five times the rate of inflation over the last 40 years,” said Bob Glaves, executive director of the Chicago Bar Foundation, which promotes equitable access to justice and legal aid in Chicago.

“We don’t have a way to measure [this], but I think everybody knows how many people, particularly from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, are not even pursuing these careers, not even pursuing higher education, because they see the price tag and the amount of debt they’d be taking on and just aren’t going to do that,” said Glaves.

The burden of this long-term debt has created a financial paradox for many graduates.

“When we think of the American dream and [how] everybody should have equal opportunity, this is a big part of it — education,” said Glaves. “Being able to make that realistically accessible to everybody in a way that’s fair to everybody. We’re falling short of that in the system we have right now.”

What does student loan debt look like in Illinois?

Nicole Johnson, 35, is currently on track to receive her fourth higher education degree by the end of September — a master’s in journalism from Northwestern University’s Medill School.

This will be her third master’s degree in the past 12 years.

Johnson is a strong advocate for education, having worked in numerous public service roles, including as a former third grade teacher in Chicago Public Schools. In 2019, Johnson ran in the 20th Ward aldermanic election, losing to Jeanette Taylor in the general runoff.

“I wanted to be part of being able to provide young people with a good education, because education was the thing that opened so many doors for me and exposed me to a new world,” said Johnson.

Growing up in Englewood, Johnson was exposed to disparity and inequity at a young age.

Motivated by the stark economic inequities she witnessed in her own community, Johnson sought out numerous higher education degrees as a means to increase her earning potential.

“Your economic outcomes and possibilities are going to be quite limited unless you do some type of investment,” she said.

Her degrees haven’t come for free. Johnson’s current student loan balance is over $200,000, a number that would take decades to pay off without any kind of repayment or forgiveness program.

Johnson isn’t alone. Nearly 1.6 million Illinoisans are currently living with student loan debt.

The average borrower in the state owes about $39,000 in student loans, according to the Education Data Initiative, a research group that collects data and statistics on the U.S. education system.

More than half of all borrowers in the state are under the age of 35, and only 13.4% of student borrowers owe less than $5,000. A majority of borrowers owe more.

25 – 34 year olds account for the most borrowers of any age group – more than 558,000. But 35 – 49 year olds like Johnson have the highest total outstanding debt of over $22 billion.  Together, the two age groups account for almost 68% of the state’s federal loans.

While residents like Johnson have sought relief via. federal forgiveness options, recent changes and cuts at the federal level have made the future of these programs uncertain.

The Department of Education has been the U.S. government’s administrator of all federal aid programming since 1965, but this is soon to not be the case.

With the Trump administration’s announcement that student loan oversight will be moved to the Small Business Administration, and the U.S. Department of Education being effectively cut in half, many borrowers are left wondering how this will impact their relief options.

In February, former President Biden’s SAVE program – the lowest monthly income-driven repayment plan to date –  was issued an injunction by a U.S. appeals court. Several Republican-led states rejected the plan and sued the Biden administration, citing that it was “​​unlawfully trying to mass cancel hundreds of billions of dollars of loans.”

Monthly payments for those enrolled in SAVE have been placed in a period of forbearance, with accruing interest, until the court reaches a final decision.

On May 5, the Federal Student Aid office resumed its collection of many student loans, which had been effectively paused since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since Johnson has returned to school, her loans have been in deferment. But when she purchased a home in 2021, she said student loan and credit card debt notably impacted the mortgage rate she was able to qualify for.  “It was definitely an impediment,” said Johnson.

The dissolution of the U.S Department of Education has left millions of student loan borrowers, including Johnson, confused and wondering what the future of their repayments will look like in the wake of a departmental restructuring.

Rae Kaplan, a Chicago-based attorney specializing in student loan law and bankruptcy solutions, said she has witnessed despondency in a number of clients as a result of student loan debt.

“I’ve had people come in and tell me that they didn’t want to get married or have a family because their student loans were so daunting,” said Kaplan. “And the point is that student loans were meant to lift people up, not to be this weight dragging everybody down,” she said.

According to Kaplan, a majority of clients don’t even realize what options are out there.

Several federal and state-based forgiveness solutions can provide effective relief for borrowers over a period of time, even amidst the disorder of the FSA. They just need to know what their choices are, said Kaplan.

Relief options for Illinois residents

Johnson was formerly enrolled in the SAVE program, but like many other federal borrowers, qualifies for other income-driven repayment plans like Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

To qualify for PSLF, individuals must work full-time for a governmental body or select non-profit organization. PSLF forgives the total remaining balance on all federal student loans after 120 monthly payments determined by a qualifying repayment plan.

“Essentially, you only have to make payments on your loans for 10 years… and the payment is very reasonable, because it’s about 10% of your discretionary income,” said Kaplan.  “So for a lot of people, that means the monthly payment is no more than their cell phone bill,” she said.

Working on and off in the public sector for nearly a decade, Johnson already has 93 qualifying monthly payments towards her student loans. Her nearly six figure balance will be completely forgiven once she completes the remaining 27 over the next two years.

Kaplan estimates that nearly 30% of Illinois residents qualify for this program, along with additional state-based loan forgiveness and repayment opportunities.

According to the Education Data Initiative, only about 18% of eligible student borrowers end up applying for loan forgiveness at all.

“We go on WGN TV, we go on WGN radio, and try to get the word out that if you are an Illinois resident and you work in the public sector, there are some really good options out there to get your loans reduced and forgiven, but people think that it must not apply to them,” Kaplan said. “I hear all the time.”

Johnson says borrowers may also remain unaware of forgiveness programs because of prevailing social taboos. “Honestly, student loan debt is not a conversation,” she said. But specialists like Kaplan are working to change that by speaking openly about local repayment options.

The Illinois Student Assistance Commission, a state-based government agency that provides higher education resources to students and families, administers a number of relief programs for residents.

Dollar amounts for each award are subject to annual reviews by the Illinois General Assembly and the Office of the Governor, but last year the state awarded nearly $4 million in loan repayments to qualifying residents through their seven ISAC-administered programs. ISAC has increased funding for most of those programs for the 2025 fiscal year.

Last year, 649 residents enrolled in an ISAC repayment program, but many more than that qualify for the award, according to Kaplan. Frequent federal policy changes and extended loan repayment uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to lowered demand, according to ISAC.

“We’ve been in an extended period of uncertainty with respect to loan repayment since 2020,” said Lynne Baker, managing director of communications at ISAC. “There were extended forbearances as a result of the pandemic, which meant that there was a period when people didn’t have to pay on their loans and likely were not focused on loan forgiveness programs,” she said.

Although a majority of borrowers’ student loans are federally allocated, in 2019 to 2020 approximately 10% of college graduates in Illinois had private student loan debt.

In response to growing concerns about the impacts of large private student loans, The Office of the Illinois State Treasurer created the Student Empowerment Fund in 2024, a $1.5 billion investment fund providing capital for lower-rate private loans for residents attending in-state institutions.

“This program aims to alleviate student debt burdens in Illinois and make it possible for more students to pursue higher education,” said Eric Krol, director of communications for the Treasurer’s Office.

Kaplan said while it’s essential to know what relief programs exist, the best way to tackle student loan debt is preemptively.

“Having a good plan and strategy, knowing the laws, knowing who should be the federal parent, plus borrower, and exactly what those payments are going to look like is really key, and can really avoid wasting a lot of money,” she said.

“For 90% [of borrowers] there’s something you can do to lower your payments and even get on track to have your loans forgiven. I just don’t want people who have loans to feel hopeless, because I talk to a lot of people every day who feel hopeless about their loans,” said Kaplan.

The SmartBuy solution

Illinois will have the greatest decline in the number of new homeowners in the next two decades – a decrease of more than 7% by 2040, according to the Urban Institute, a non-profit economic and social policy research firm.

While multiple factors can be linked to this decline, data from the Federal Reserve suggests historic levels of student loan debt are to blame.

A little over 20% of the decline in homeownership rates among 24-32 year olds from 2009 to 2014 can be attributed to rising student loan debt across the country.

“Student loan debt is one of the single largest barriers delaying younger households from achieving their dream of homeownership,” said Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) Executive Director Kristin Faust in a press release.



[caption id=""attachment_69873"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""] Through the SmartBuy program, Josue Villalpando was able to close on his home in Lansing, Illinois in March 2025. “With my student loans being fully paid off, I know I can comfortably pay my mortgage without having to worry about financial constraints,” said Villalpando. (Provided by Josue Villalpando)[/caption]



The state came up with SmartBuy as a proposed solution. The program was created using a $25 million capital bill fund from Gov. JB Pritzker’s 2019 Rebuild Illinois Plan.

“Through SmartBuy, we have seen that this targeted relief can help new buyers overcome this financial burden and secure a home much earlier, allowing for a better opportunity to start building equity,” Faust said.

The first round of SmartBuy paid off an average of $26,700 in student loan debt per buyer, with the second round expected to average $28,800 per buyer.

Of course the program does come with specific eligibility requirements.

A buyer’s full student loan debt must be paid off at the time of purchase. If their debt exceeds $40,000, they must make up the difference at the time of closing. Villalplando said he needed to come up with an extra $9,000 before closing on his Lansing home.

Buyers also need to have a minimum credit score of 640 and live in the home for at least three years after closing or repay a portion of the debt assistance. IDHA determines the interest rate on the home’s mortgage.

So far, of the 631 loans closed in the first round, 15, did not make it through the three year forgiveness period. IDHA told the Illinois Answers Project they do not possess data as to why the borrower had to sell.

Chicago residents must have a household income of less than $134,000 and the purchase price for a one unit home must be under $610,000 and no more than $754,000 for a two-unit.

“There is no requirement in terms of where the home is or the census tract it’s in,” said Jason Finn, a Chicago-based realtor who works with SmartBuy applicants.

According to data obtained from IDHA, about 87% of homes purchased in the first round and 75% of homes purchased in the second round of the program were located in the Chicago region of Illinois.

“This is the sixth different IDHA program that I’ve worked with, and, for the folks that can benefit, I think it’s a bigger boom than any of the other programs they’ve had,” said Finn.

“I’ve had a lot of clients that have huge amounts of student debt, well into the six figures. Many of them aren’t working in a career that was envisioned when they incurred all that student debt. So, I’d love to see more opportunities like this.”

What begins as an investment in future prosperity can become a prolonged financial strain that limits career choices and delays other life milestones. The SmartBuy program hopes to make Villalpando’s story a more common one.

“I know many people who have student loan debt just following them for 15 plus years, and it seems like it’s never ending,” said Villalpando.

“So I just hope [SmartBuy] keeps going,” he said.

A new proposal on student loan debt

Even with available state-sponsored and federal forgiveness programs, and unique opportunities like SmartBuy, eligibility for these options can be so specific that many borrowers still fall through the cracks. For example, the borrowers who work in service-oriented careers but don’t qualify for PSLF.

That is what led members of the Chicago Bar Foundation, the charitable arm of the Chicago Bar Association, to develop a comprehensive legislation proposal addressing the coverage gap.

“We had an advocacy committee that really started this process of getting feedback on, how did [student debt] get like this? How did we get to this position now where it costs so much to go to school and we have people graduating with these mortgage sized debts?,” said Glaves.

The proposed legislation includes a simplification of current repayment programs by incorporating a multi-tiered income-based repayment program that places stricter limits on borrower loan sizes.

“It really has to be done with some more accountability on the amount that’s borrowed in the first place, both on the schools and the borrower,” said Glaves. “Otherwise taxpayers are on the hook for a lot of this.”

Glaves believes setting realistic borrowing limits will also mitigate national student loan default rates, which have declined in recent years, though such limits may prevent students from accessing sufficient funds to cover their educational costs.

The initiative also suggests Congress should allow bankruptcy options as a last resort. While not impossible, Glaves said filing for bankruptcy is extremely difficult within the current financial aid system.

“Someone gets in a situation where that income based approach isn’t going to work for them, there should be an option to file for bankruptcy at that point, as there is in every other kind of instance, in our country,” said Glaves.

Filing for bankruptcy typically results in additional consequences for borrowers, impacting their credit score and ability to acquire future loans. But if necessary, this option can substantially aid borrowers who, for reasons out of their control, aren’t able to complete their degrees and now have a mountain of debt to pay off.

The proposal has received support from the Illinois delegation and a general recognition from Congress of the need for a unified legislation approach, but Glaves expects it will not be passed during the current political term. Still, he remains hopeful.

“This is just one of those issues that, because it really does require some bigger changes to the system, we’re going to continue to work on,” said Glaves. “Even if there isn’t a lot of promise to have this happen in the short term politically.”

With an uncertain political landscape and climbing student debt, borrowers like Johnson wonder what the future of education will look like without a clear plan in place.

“Education is going to look different in 20 years, who knows what’s going to happen,” said Johnson. “In my mid-30s I’m thinking, okay how are my kids going to go to school?”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico’s relatively cool and moist weather so far this spring will dry and warm up in coming weeks, putting fire managers and forecasters on high alert for wildfires before the start of the seasonal monsoon rains this summer.
This year’s low snowpack has already put much of the state in drought conditions, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham recently declared a state of emergency and additional actions to prevent fires over the coming weeks.
Recent rains around the state offer some relief, as May and June typically emerge as some of the driest months, said George Ducker, a wildfire prevention and spokesperson at the New Mexico Forestry Division.
But the projected warm temperatures through the next several weeks could mean the recent spouting of new plants could aggravate the problem, he said.
“We could see a substantial dry up of these flashy fuels, the grasses and even shrubs,” Ducker said. “Then, if you get a start, get a little bit of wind — there would be more fuel to burn.”
The recent rains did not herald the start of the monsoon, the seasonal tropical patterns that provide Arizona and New Mexico with critical moisture, said Andrea Bair, a forecaster with the National Weather Service Western Region based in Salt Lake City, at a National Integrated Drought Information System presentation Tuesday.
Rather, she said monsoons are expected to start in mid-June and could be stronger than past years, but hot temperatures will continue to dry out the soils and stress plants across much of the Southwestern U.S.
“The drought looks to continue throughout the season and the monthly outlook forecasts,” she said. “So not a lot of relief is expected.”
The rains lessened the acute risks of fire in the Southwest, said Jim Wallmann, a senior forecaster for the National Interagency Coordination Center Predictive Services. But other parts of the county are seeing wildfires “extremely early” in the fire season, he said, noting the 1,000-acre Banana Lake fire in Montana.
“We’re having to spread our resources over a much greater footprint of the country,” Wallmann said. “That could affect how big a fire gets in California, if we’re stretched and can’t send everything to California while it’s burning; we’ll be on fires burning everywhere else.”
Ducker said the concerns about availability for resources to fight wildfires is “a bridge we’ll cross when we come to it,” and said the state is working to be prepared.
“We have the resources to be able to jump on fires as they start,” Ducker said. Our federal partners seem to be in the same place where they’re ready to respond, so right now we’re just waiting for June to see what it shows us.”

Larry Rhoden speaks to the media during a press conference on March 13, 2025, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Republican South Dakota Governor Larry Rhoden signed an executive order this week to plan for future disasters as the Trump administration works to shift the responsibility for disaster relief to state and local entities.
“We pray that the most challenging circumstances will never arise, but we are preparing so that South Dakota can face such situations with determination, resilience, and grit,” Rhoden said in a press release.  
President Trump has called the Federal Emergency Management Agency a “disaster” and suggested it might “go away.” FEMA is led by Homeland Security Secretary and former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. 
Trump signed an executive order in March titled “Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness,” which says “federal policy must rightly recognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the State, local, and even individual levels.”
The Trump order also instructs federal agencies to reevaluate grants, contracts, and technical assistance funding programs. FEMA has since ended the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The 2021 program aimed to direct $1 billion in funding toward infrastructure projects to help communities across the U.S. “reduce their hazard risk” as they “build capability and capacity.” According to a tally of federal cuts compiled and updated weekly by the governor’s office, $8.9 million in South Dakota projects were set to benefit from BRIC grants.
End of FEMA program affects drinking water, building code updates, tornado shelter in SD

Critics say the shift in disaster relief responsibilities and funding from the federal government to state and local governments will leave poorer, rural states unprepared and unable to respond.
Rhoden says the task force will “support” the Trump administration’s executive order. 
Rhoden dubbed the group the Governor’s Resilience and Infrastructure Task Force, or GRIT. He said the task force will serve as an advisory body to “develop policy recommendations, assess risks and vulnerabilities, and support long-term planning and investment in critical infrastructure systems across our state.”
The task force will be chaired by Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen. Adjutant General Mark Morrell of the South Dakota National Guard will serve as vice chair. Venhuizen said the task force is more than a response to President Trump ending programs and planning to shift responsibilities to states. He said the concept of the task force has been under consideration since last year.

Kim Reynolds talks to reporters May 17, 2022, after signing legislation dealing with biofuels at a farm near Prairie City. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As she considers whether to sign legislation limiting the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines, Gov. Kim Reynolds faces a decision that will forever define her legacy in the Iowa Republican Party: whether to uphold the constitutional rights and the property rights of Iowa landowners, or whether to put ethanol industry profits ahead of those rights.
The party platform unequivocally supports landowner rights. The Iowa House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, have passed bipartisan legislation that would protect those rights. This should not be a difficult choice.
However, there are many special interest groups urging the governor to veto House File 639, claiming it would harm the ethanol industry and derail future economic development opportunities in the state. But if those claims were true, why do nearly 30% of Iowa’s ethanol plants choose not to participate in this risky CO₂ pipeline venture? Why is Summit Carbon Solutions suing multiple Iowa counties over zoning ordinances, the very tools those counties use to guide and protect local economic growth?
The self-serving arguments of the ethanol industry do not stand up to scrutiny. Privately owned carbon dioxide pipelines do not align with the constitutional definition of “public use” necessary for eminent domain, and they do not justify using the government’s “takings” power to force private landowners to participate in a speculative business enterprise. Essentially, these special interests are asking the governor to pick economic winners and losers at the expense of constitutional rights.
Importantly, HF 639 does not stop the pipeline project, nor does it prevent voluntary easements. In fact, Summit has already secured all necessary voluntary agreements in Minnesota and must now do the same in South Dakota to meet Iowa Utilities Commission conditions for construction here. Iowa landowners deserve the same rights as landowners in our neighboring states.
If this project truly serves a vital economic need and garners legitimate support, it can move forward through the free market—without coercion, and without undermining the rights of landowners.
I commend Gov. Reynolds for engaging a broad range of stakeholders in this conversation. Listening to the public and not just to special interests is essential for crafting sound public policy, but it does not change the dilemma facing the governor: constitutional rights vs. special interest profits.
By signing HF 639, Gov. Reynolds would uphold constitutional rights, curb the misuse of eminent domain for private profit, demonstrate her commitment to the Republican Party’s property rights platform, protect landowners from inadequate insurance coverage, and strengthen the public accountability of the Iowa Utilities Commission.
It would ensure she is forever remembered as a champion of the Republican Party’s commitment to constitutional rights and private property rights.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/reynolds-gaggle-5.17.22-prairie-city-biofuels-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

For 32 years, the kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Willie Cook remained a mystery. 
Then, in 2008, sheriff’s deputies in Siskiyou County got their first big break: A man came forward to say he had witnessed the kidnapping. Steve Marshall was only 10-years-old when Willie disappeared, but his memory of that August day remained vivid. 
So vivid, in fact, that the District Attorney’s Office built its case around his testimony, charging a local man with murder. 
Deep inside the file, however, lay evidence that would cast doubt on Marshall’s testimony. Would anyone discover it? 
To find out, read the gripping narrative of the cold case from CalMatters investigative reporter Anat Rubin. 
The story is part of a series exploring how poor people accused of crimes in California are routinely convicted in California without anyone investigating the charges against them. 
Defense investigators are perhaps the most important safeguard against wrongful convictions. But, as Rubin found, close to half of California’s 58 counties do not employ any full-time public defense investigators. 
Among the findings of her investigation:

Of the 10 California counties with the highest prison incarceration rates, eight have no defense investigators on staff. 
In Riverside, for example, the district attorney has 30% more lawyers than the public defender but 500% more investigators.
Hidden in the data is the greatest tragedy of failing to investigate cases: wrongful convictions. 

Maurice Possley, a leading expert on exonerations, said that a failure to investigate is at the heart of most of the cases he reviews. He’s astounded by what he finds when he looks at the evidence. 

Possley: “If someone had just made the effort. This was all sitting there.”

Winding down gas-powered appliances in SoCal

Air quality regulators are expected to vote Friday on rules that aim to phase out water heaters and other heating systems powered by natural gas, writes CalMatters’ Alejandra Reyes-Velarde.
Officials at the South Coast Air Quality Management District — which oversees four counties in the Los Angeles basin including Orange County and parts of L.A. and San Bernardino counties — say that home appliances are one of the largest sources of smog-causing gases in the region.
If the rules are approved, 30% of heating appliances sold in the region must be zero-emissions beginning in 2027. Consumers also wouldn’t be required to swap out their appliances immediately, but could buy electric-powered heat pumps when it comes time to replace their natural gas water heaters, central heating systems or furnaces.
Contractors and developers oppose the phaseout, citing higher costs: Installing a heat pump in lieu of a natural gas water heater costs $2,000 more, and replacing a furnace costs $8,000 more.

Court hears arguments for solar compensation ☀️

On Wednesday the California Supreme Court heard arguments involving a lawsuit against state regulators for their decision to dramatically reduce the compensation customers with solar installations receive for the excess energy they generate. 
As CalMatters’ Malena Carollo explains, in 2022 the California Public Utilities Commission slashed compensation payments utilities paid homeowners with rooftop solar panels by around 75%. The commission said the updated rates reversed what it saw as unfair subsidies to well-to-do solar customers, striking a balance between affordability and encouraging renewable energy alternatives. Since then, demand for rooftop solar projects has taken a nosedive.
The rooftop solar industry, ratepayers and renewable energy groups opposed the reduction and three environmental groups are suing the commission. They argue that the commission didn’t properly consider benefits to customers and disadvantaged communities when it changed the rules. The court is expected to issue its decision in about a month.

The post Falling office building values still a concern for Boston’s budget, think tank says appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IT’S ROUND 2 for Mayor Michelle Wu and the Boston Policy Institute. The think tank that repeatedly clashed with City Hall over taxes is out with a follow-up to their report last year that Boston is facing a stormy revenue picture in the years ahead, as remote work has led to a loss in the value of office buildings. Their takeaway, as put by Evan Horowitz, the Tufts University analyst and author of both last year’s report and the one out Thursday: The revenue picture now “looks worse than we expected.” The city’s $4.6 billion operating budget heavily relies on property taxes, which are calculated based on assessed values of a property and an applied tax rate. Commercial property taxes make up a third of the budget. The think tank’s latest report says property taxes are a “very stable” source of revenue, having helped Boston power through past economic downturns. But several notable buildings, such as 101 Arch Street and 400 Atlantic Avenue, are now trading hands at discounts ranging from 50 to 70 percent. With hybrid work, high mortgage rates, and federal tariffs leading to increased costs, “there’s no reason to expect a near-term turnaround in the value or profitability of office spaces,” the report said. The report added that “the total assessed value of all office properties in Boston fell 9 percent in FY 2025 (in real terms), a one-year decline comparable only to the [2008] financial crisis and the bursting of the [2001] dot-com bubble. And while those earlier, recession-induced drops were short-lived, today’s slump seems more durable.”The Boston Policy Institute’s new report, like the one in 2024, doubled down on what it termed a city budget “shortfall” due to falling office building values, saying the new estimate totals $1.7 billion over the next five years, revising up from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Wu administration officials have previously disputed the think tank’s use of the word “shortfall,” noting any revenue decrease from commercial property taxes would have to be made up by an increase in residential property taxes. The mayor, joined by House lawmakers, pushed for property tax shift legislation last year on Beacon Hill, only to see it die in the Senate. The legislation would have temporarily shifted more of the tax burden onto commercial businesses in order to avoid a spike in residential property taxes. The Boston Policy Institute, a nonprofit, has emerged as a rival to a longtime city watchdog, the Boston Municipal Research Bureau (BMRB). While BMRB gets money from the city’s top businesses, like Fidelity and State Street, the BPI does not reveal its donors. As with the February 2024 report, the think tank provided Thursday’s report under an embargo, meaning reporters could not share the findings with the Wu administration for comment. The latest report comes as Wu faces a challenger, Josh Kraft, the son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. The younger Kraft, a longtime nonprofit executive, has criticized Wu for declining to cut the city’s budget. Wu, for her part, has said her administration is “preparing for worst case scenarios while refraining from preemptive disruption of city services,” and noted that cuts would lead to fewer police and firefighters. In her fiscal year 2026 budget proposal, she proposed slowing growth, with the operating budget coming in at $4.8 billion, a 4.4 percent increase from the previous year, down from a 7 percent increase the year before that. In May, Wu touted Moody’s Investor Service and S&P Global Ratings, two ratings agencies, both handing the city a AAA bond rating, the same week that Moody’s downgraded the United States. The city has held the top credit rating, an indication of fiscal health, since 2014. “Boston’s commercial and retail properties continue to rebound from elevated vacancy rates seen during the pandemic and these metrics now compare favorably to similar large metro areas in the US,” S&P wrote in its assessment, dated May 13. “It is working to address the effects of declining office building values, which are not expected to affect the city’s revenue collections due to the structure of its tax collections, but may result in a shift of the tax burden to residential taxpayers due to the city’s dual tax rate,” the rating agency added. S&P also noted the city’s effort to convert some downtown office space into residential properties in a bid to boost foot traffic, improve housing supply, and stabilize property values. “These office conversions face several challenges; the success of this program, however, will be felt over an extended time horizon,” the agency’s analysts wrote.The post Falling office building values still a concern for Boston’s budget, think tank says appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/0Traffic.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

,California,2025-06-05 12:31:00+00:00,CalMatters,The Man Who Unsolved a Murder,Anat Rubin,,,,,https://calmatters.org/investigation/2025/06/public-defense-investigators/,"If you’re accused of a crime, will someone investigate your side of the story? In California, there’s no guarantee.","On Aug. 28, 1976, sometime between 7:30 and 8 p.m., a 6-year-old boy named Willie Cook disappeared from the bed of his father’s pickup in Happy Camp, a secluded logging community in Northern California’s Klamath National Forest. Willie’s father, Bill Cook, had been working on his lawn mower at a repair shop in the center of town. When he was done, he told Willie to wait in the truck with the family dog while he ducked into the bar across the street. He was gone less than 20 minutes. The sun had set behind the mountains, but there was still light in the sky.
Cook searched the area on foot, then drove in the direction of the family home. After he circled town a couple more times, he called law enforcement to report that his son was missing. He gave the local deputy a description: Willie was 42 inches tall and weighed 45 pounds. He was wearing a black baseball jersey, jeans and white tennis shoes. His right eye was blue, and his left eye was a mix of blue and brown. He was, Cook said, “a very good boy, and had never wandered off in the past.” 
By midnight, 150 people were searching for Willie, combing the dense woods surrounding the town. But Cook did not believe his son was lost in the forest. From the moment he had walked out of that bar, he was certain that someone had taken him. “I felt it,” he said. “I felt it all over.”
Willie’s body was discovered six months later in a small cardboard barrel at a campground along the Klamath River, more than 50 miles from Happy Camp. The Siskiyou County sheriff’s office launched a murder investigation but never solved the case. 
After 32 years, sheriff’s deputies got their first big break when a man came forward to say he had witnessed the kidnapping. Steve Marshall was only 10 years old in 1976, but his memory of that August day was vivid: He was sitting alone in his mother’s blue station wagon, parked outside the Headway Market, within view of the repair shop and the old bar. He was eating a vanilla ice cream cone. His brother was inside the market with their mother. They would be having spaghetti for dinner that night — his favorite.

Marshall seemed to remember what happened next as though it were unfolding in slow motion: The sound of a logging truck as it roared past. Willie’s Labrador wagging his tail. And a young man in blue jeans and a vest, his long hair in two braids, standing on the opposite side of the street, staring at the boy and his dog.
Marshall recognized him. His name was Gregory Nelson. And Marshall said he had a clear view of him as he crossed the street, grabbed Willie, shoved him into a VW bus and drove off, disappearing down the one-lane highway that cut through town. Marshall had tried to tell his mother what he’d seen, but she’d brushed him off. For the next few decades, he mostly kept it to himself. But the memory, he said, had haunted him.
The Siskiyou sheriff arrested Nelson, then 51, and brought him in for questioning. He had a couple grams of methamphetamine and several syringes in his pocket. After two days of interrogation, he confessed. The following day, the sheriff told a local reporter that a cold case is like a puzzle. “After 32 years, we’re finally getting the pieces put together.”
Nelson was charged with kidnapping and murder. Siskiyou’s chief public defender, Lael Kayfetz, thought there was little chance of overcoming a signed confession and an eyewitness account. Then the prosecutors turned over the recordings of Nelson’s interrogation. When Kayfetz watched the footage, she said, “my eyeballs fell out of my head.” 
She realized she needed to test the claims against her client, but she couldn’t do it on her own. “I’m an expert on the law,” Kayfetz said. “I’m not an expert on getting the facts.” She needed an investigator. 
The prosecutors were working closely with detectives at the sheriff’s office, issuing warrants and building a case. They also employed their own team of five investigators. 
That year, Siskiyou County’s public defender didn’t have a single defense investigator on staff. 
***
Lawyers have a constitutional obligation to investigate every case. But a CalMatters investigation found that poor people accused of crimes, who account for at least 80% of criminal defendants, are routinely convicted in California without anyone investigating the charges against them. Close to half of California’s 58 counties do not employ any full-time public defense investigators. Among the remaining counties, defendants’ access to investigators fluctuates wildly, but it’s almost always inadequate.
The cost of this failure is steep, for individual defendants and for the integrity of California’s criminal justice system. Of the 10 California counties with the highest prison incarceration rates, eight have no defense investigators on staff, according to an analysis of staffing and prison data. 
The lack of investigators affects counties throughout the state, from poor, rural areas like Siskiyou to the state’s largest and most well-funded public defense offices. Los Angeles employed just 1 investigator for every 10 public defenders — one of the state’s worst ratios, according to the most recent data from the California Department of Justice. Only seven California counties met the widely accepted minimum standard of 1 investigator for every 3 attorneys. 
The situation is most alarming in the 25 California counties that don’t have dedicated public defender offices and pay private attorneys to represent indigent people in criminal court. Most of these attorneys receive a flat fee for their services, and the cost of an investigator would eat away at their profits. Some counties allow contracted attorneys to ask the court for additional funds for investigations, but court records show the attorneys rarely make those requests. 
In Kings County, which has one of the highest prison incarceration rates in California, contracted attorneys asked the court for permission to hire an investigator in 7% of criminal cases from 2018 to 2022. In Lake County, attorneys made those requests in just 2% of criminal cases over a three-year period; in Mono County, it was less than 1%. To earn a living from meager county contracts, research shows, private attorneys and firms must persuade defendants to accept plea deals as quickly as possible. An investigation is an expensive delay.
Defense investigators interview witnesses, visit crime scenes, review police reports and retrieve video surveillance footage that might prove the defendant was on the other side of town when a crime was committed, or that an assault was an act of self-defense. They do work that most lawyers are not trained to do. Without them, police and prosecutorial misconduct — among the most common causes of wrongful convictions — remain unchecked, significantly increasing the likelihood that people will go to prison for crimes they did not commit.
“Law is important, but the facts are what influences the law,” said Aditi Goel, executive director of the Sixth Amendment Center, a national nonprofit focused on improving indigent defense. “The heart of a case is what happened.”
***
In 2008, Kayfetz and her four staff attorneys were left to sleuth most cases on their own, and they worried about what they might be missing. Siskiyou County provided them with a small budget to contract with a private investigator, but the Nelson case, which had already spanned three decades, would burn through their entire investigation fund for the year. Still, Kayfetz didn’t feel as though she had a choice. Nelson was facing life in prison, and the sheriff was in the papers talking about closure for the Cook family. 
She called Rob Shelton, an investigator who had spent most of the previous two decades in law enforcement — first with the Coast Guard, then as a harbor patrol officer in Ventura, and recently as a probation officer for Siskiyou. He’d crossed over into defense investigations, and this would be his first homicide case for the public defender’s office.

Nelson’s mug shot had by then been published on the front page of the Siskiyou Daily News. His hair was graying, and his cheeks were deeply sunken. Shelton knew that look. He had seen it on the probationers he had monitored, people whose hard lives were etched into their faces. He had come to view their struggles with the law as a symptom of their poverty and addiction. But he also believed Nelson was guilty. It was hard for him to imagine that the sheriff would pursue a case without concrete evidence, and even harder to believe that the district attorney would push it toward trial. 
Kayfetz handed Shelton the records she’d gotten from the prosecutors, and he spent those first few weeks combing through old police reports.
As he made his way through the documents, he found black-and-white copies of photographs the sheriff’s deputies had taken as they searched Happy Camp in the days after Willie’s disappearance: The chain-saw repair shop where the truck had been parked. The old bar across the street. And a building that looked as though it had recently burned down. It was familiar to Shelton, though he couldn’t initially place it.
Then one day, while he was staring at the photo, it clicked. It was the Headway Market, where Marshall said his mother had been shopping when he witnessed the kidnapping.
“There was no store,” Shelton said. “There was just ruins.” 
Shelton walked down the street to the Siskiyou County assessor’s office to pull records on the property. The market, he learned, had burned down a few months before Willie Cook was taken.

California is the birthplace of public defense. The nation’s first public defender office opened in Los Angeles in 1913. By the time the U.S. Supreme Court established in 1963 that defendants have the right to an attorney in state criminal proceedings, more than a dozen California counties were already providing free representation to poor people accused of crimes.
As the nation caught up, California slipped behind. The state kept its defender system entirely in the hands of its counties. Today, it is one of just two states — alongside Arizona — that don’t contribute any funding to trial-level public defense, according to the Sixth Amendment Center. The state does not monitor or evaluate the counties’ systems. There are no minimum standards, and for many defendants there are no investigations — even in the most serious cases.
Meanwhile, prosecutors have robust, in-house investigative teams. In Riverside, the district attorney has 30% more lawyers than the public defender but 500% more investigators, state data shows, in addition to the support of the county sheriff and various municipal police departments. This pattern repeats throughout the state. In what is supposed to be an adversarial legal system, indigent defendants and their attorneys are often on their own, facing an army of investigators who are working to secure a conviction. 
Hidden in that data is the greatest tragedy of failing to investigate cases: wrongful convictions. The National Registry of Exonerations is filled with cases in which convictions were overturned when someone finally looked into the prisoner’s claims, years or even decades after they were imprisoned. 
Hundreds of those cases are in California. In one exoneration out of Fresno, Innocence Project investigators found nine witnesses who corroborated their client’s alibi: He was more than 25 miles away at a birthday party at the time of the crime. In a recent case out of Los Angeles, investigators found evidence of their client’s innocence in a police detective’s handwritten notes, material that had been included in a file turned over to the defense before trial. If their cases had been investigated on the front end, these men might have been spared a combined 30 years in prison. 
Maurice Possley, the exoneration registry’s senior researcher, said that a failure to investigate is at the heart of most of the registry’s 3,600 cases.
When he looks at the evidence that overturned these convictions, he’s astounded the defense didn’t find it when the case was being prosecuted. 
“If someone had just made the effort,” he said. “This was all sitting there.”

Shelton was in his early 40s when he got the Nelson case. He had been living in Siskiyou for years, but he hadn’t shed his Southern California accent. He was soft-spoken, smiled often, and had the easy mannerisms of someone who had spent a lot of time at the beach. It didn’t take long for him to build a rapport with Nelson, and he visited him frequently at the Siskiyou County jail. Nelson told him he had no memory of the events that Marshall had recounted for the deputies. Those claims of innocence had sounded hollow to Shelton, but the picture of the burned market changed his thinking about the case. Now he wondered whether anything Marshall had said was true.

Detectives with the Siskiyou sheriff’s office had interviewed Marshall several times in October 2008, a month before they arrested Nelson. Kayfetz requested those recordings, and she and Shelton listened to the tapes.
In the first interview, Marshall initially hedged his words. When a detective asked him whether he saw Willie — who was Marshall’s cousin — on the day he was taken, he said that it “seemed like” he did. Then he said that he watched Nelson grab Willie and put him in the van, where another man was crouching in the passenger seat.
“You saw that?” the detective asked. 
“That was with my own eyes I saw that,” Marshall said. 
Minutes later, in a second accounting, Marshall added an accomplice — the woman who would later become Nelson’s wife slid the van door open and jumped inside before they drove off. Three days later, an additional woman appeared in the story — the wife’s sister — and the man in the passenger seat was gone. 
It was remarkable to Shelton that the detectives didn’t challenge Marshall on these discrepancies. Each time he told the story, he added details — the ice cream flavor, the face his brother made at him as he walked into the market.
When a detective asked whether Marshall had said anything to his mother when she came back, he replied that he had tried but that his brother was teasing him. “That’s why I just threw it aside,” he said. “Because my brother, he made me mad.” Marshall eventually told his mother what had happened, he said, but neither of them mentioned it to Cook when they joined the search party later that night.

A newspaper clipping related to the Willie Cook murder case from the Sept. 15, 1976 edition of the Sacramento Bee.
In a separate interview with detectives, Marshall’s mother corroborated his account. “I should have listened to him,” she said. “It was like he was trying to tell all of us that he had seen who took Willie. Is that possible? But nobody would believe him, because he was a little boy.”
In one of the recordings, the detectives alluded to some kind of legal trouble Marshall was facing. “You’re taking care of us, and we’re going to scratch your back in return,” a detective had promised him. 
During his fourth and final recorded interview with detectives, Marshall had something new to share: He wasn’t just a witness to Willie’s kidnapping. He was also a witness to his murder. Months after the kidnapping, Marshall said, he took a trip with his father to visit his grandparents on the Hoopa reservation, some 70 miles from Happy Camp. It was there, he said, while hiding behind a tree in the back of Nelson’s house, that he saw Nelson take Willie out of a locked van and heard him say, “This is the last time you’re going to even breathe air.”
“I’m standing right there, and I’m watching him from that tree,” he told a detective. “I’m watching him put his hands around that little boy and strangle him until that little boy was dead.”
The detective conducting the interview initially seemed alarmed by this change in the story. She told Marshall that her sergeant would need to speak with him “about the differences in your statement from the first time that we talked to you.” She left the room but came back alone. “I think you and I pretty much clarified everything,” she said. 
In her report, she wrote that Marshall had witnessed the murder “four or five days” after the kidnapping. That was an error — Marshall repeatedly said four or five months had passed between the kidnapping and the murder, according to a transcript of the interview. But that error would find its way into Nelson’s confession.
From Marshall’s testimony, police and prosecutors created their theory of the crime, interview transcripts and court filings show. They proposed Nelson was a pawn in a scheme hatched by his sister-in-law — one of the women Marshall named as an accomplice — who wanted to hurt Cook by taking his son. Maybe she had been jealous of his success. Maybe she wanted to avenge her husband, who had been tried, and later acquitted, for the murder of Cook’s brother. 

A newspaper clipping related to the Willie Cook murder case from the Feb. 23, 1977 edition of The Dunsmuir News. 
Nelson and his sister-in-law were both Native American. To Kayfetz, law enforcement’s assumption that they would kidnap and kill a child as an act of revenge, or in a fit of jealous rage, played into racial stereotypes and became the “underlying stench” of the case. 
The evidence had suggested that Willie was kidnapped by a sexual predator. His body was naked when it was discovered. Now law enforcement posited he was murdered in a family feud. 
Even Willie’s father initially had a hard time believing this theory. “I just can’t imagine that,” Cook told a detective in 2008. “Over something that stupid? My gut feeling is no.”
But the deputies were insistent. Eventually, Cook began to come around to the possibility that Nelson was the killer. 
Deputies exhumed Willie’s body, but it did not provide any new evidence. Far too much time had passed.
***
When Shelton began working on the case, he was shocked whenever he discovered that law enforcement had made a mistake, or that prosecutors had failed to turn over a key document. 
He would burst into Kayfetz’s office, saying, “You’re not gonna believe this!” And Kayfetz would tell him, dryly, “There’s no Santa or Easter Bunny, either.” 
He would soon lose that sense of disbelief. 
As the investigation progressed, Shelton became convinced that Marshall had invented most of his story. Marshall had given detectives the names of other potential witnesses, but those turned out to be dead ends. Still, Siskiyou’s district attorney, Kirk Andrus, seemed determined to move forward, and Nelson was losing hope. 
Then, one day, while he was looking through old police files, Shelton found a list of materials the deputies had entered into evidence in 1976. It included references to interviews they recorded with potential witnesses. Shelton scanned the list and saw Marshall’s name. The prosecution’s star witness had spoken to officers just days after Willie disappeared. If law enforcement still had access to these recordings, they hadn’t shared them with the defense.
When Kayfetz asked the district attorney’s office to turn over the evidence, the prosecutors said they didn’t have it. But Shelton learned the tapes from the case had recently been digitized and enhanced by the Justice Department, at the request of the Siskiyou detectives. Kayfetz filed a second motion to get the recordings. When the judge ordered the prosecutors to explain how the tapes had gone missing, they said that they had found them and that they had been lost on a detective’s desk, according to court documents.

Soon Kayfetz and Shelton were listening to Marshall, 10 years old, answering questions about the evening Willie disappeared. There was no ice cream. Marshall’s brother was not in the car, but his older sister was. Their mom didn’t go to the grocery store, but she did stop at a liquor store to buy a TV Guide. When they drove through the center of town, Marshall waved to Willie, who was sitting in his dad’s truck. 
“I said, ‘Hi, Willie,’ and he said ‘Hi’ back. And I said, ‘Where’s your dad?’ And he said, ‘He’s in the bar.’” When they drove by again, Willie was gone. 
“Am I allowed to go now?” Marshall asked the detective. 
In a separate interview that same day, Marshall’s mother corroborated her son’s account. Nobody mentioned Nelson. Nobody said anything about witnessing a kidnapping.
***
Shelton felt as though they were pulling a string and unraveling the district attorney’s case. 
He discovered that Marshall had a motive for becoming useful to law enforcement in the fall of 2008. He had violated the terms of his probation for a drunken-driving conviction and was facing prison, but police kept the violation off his record, Shelton said.
Kayfetz was encouraged by the evidence that was mounting in Nelson’s favor, but if the case went to trial, she would have to contend with the fact that he had confessed to the crime. 
She sent the footage of his interrogation to Richard Leo, a University of San Francisco law professor and one of the nation’s foremost experts on coerced confessions, and asked him to testify on Nelson’s behalf. She couldn’t afford his fee — she was already pushing the outer limits of her budget. And when she first reached out, Leo told her he didn’t have time to take on another case. But she begged him to watch the footage before he made up his mind.
Even now, almost 17 years later, he remembers how stunned he had been when he first saw it. Among the 2,400 cases he’s consulted on, he said, the Nelson case stands out as one of the most egregious examples of a coerced confession he has ever seen. He called it “a form of psychological torture.” 
“There’s a sequence to this — a long interrogation, lie to the suspect about evidence, attack the suspect’s denials, cause him to doubt his memory,” he said. “Sometimes you see this person denying and admitting at the same time: ‘I couldn’t have done this. I have no memory. You’re telling me I did this, maybe I did this.’”
Leo said Nelson was subjected to almost every tactic known to lead to a false admission of guilt. He agreed to do the case for a reduced fee — a “bro deal,” Kayfetz called it — in exchange for permission to include it in a future book.
More than 12% of the wrongful convictions listed on the National Registry of Exonerations involved false confessions. In a recent case in San Bernardino, police officers pushed a man to admit to killing his father after he called police to report him missing. During a marathon interrogation, officers told the man they had conclusive evidence of his guilt and got him to agree with a gruesome scenario that they had pulled, it seems, from thin air. A few hours after he confessed, police officers located the man’s father. He was alive and well.

In 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics conducted a census of the nation’s public defender offices. It found that 40% had no investigators on staff and that 93% failed to meet the National Association for Public Defense’s industry standard of at least 1 investigator for every 3 attorneys. 
The study made it clear that, across the country, investigators were seen as a luxury, not a necessity. CalMatters interviews with top public defenders in several states, along with recent reports examining indigent defense systems, suggest that’s still the case.
In Mississippi, only eight of the state’s 82 counties have public defender offices. The rest rely on private attorneys who are paid a flat fee — one that rarely covers the cost of an investigator. A 2018 report found that, in many Mississippi counties, with the exception of murder cases, the attorneys “never hire investigators and have no time to investigate cases themselves.” Appointed attorneys told researchers they would “get laughed out of court” for requesting additional funds for an investigator. 
Public defender systems that are funded and controlled by state legislatures also have severe investigator shortages. The head public defender in Arkansas, Gregg Parrish, said he has only 12 staff investigators, responsible for assisting in felony cases, including capital cases, in all of the state’s 75 counties. Minnesota’s top public defender, William Ward, said he is trying to maintain a ratio of at least 1 investigator for every 7 public defenders but knows that’s not enough. “I would rather have a great investigator and an average lawyer than an average investigator and a great lawyer,” he said. “Investigators make all the difference on a case.”
Colin Reingold remembers one case in particular from his time as a public defender in Louisiana’s Orleans Parish. His client was accused of breaking into a car, but he insisted he was entering the car to leave a note offering to do yard work.
Reingold sent an investigator to the car owner’s house, but there was no one home. His client had two prior felonies, and a car burglary would qualify him for a life sentence. When the prosecutor offered 10 years in exchange for a guilty plea, Reingold advised him to take the deal. But his client begged him to find the note, he said. 
That year, Orleans Parish had 65 public defenders and three investigators. The one assigned to the man’s case refused to give up. She tried for six weeks to find the car’s owner. In the week before the plea hearing, she stopped by his home almost daily. One evening, he answered the door. He said, “Oh yeah, I still have that note!”
Reingold presented the note as evidence, and his client was released from jail. 
It was, he said, a rare stroke of luck. “The scary thing is, we don’t know all the other times we’ve missed things like that.” 
***
Just weeks before Nelson’s trial was set to begin, the prosecution was still turning over discovery materials. 
Shelton began to make his way through the latest batch. Many of the documents were familiar — duplicates of reports and transcripts he had already reviewed. But he stumbled on a few photographs, tucked into the file, that he hadn’t seen before. In the foreground of one of the pictures, leaning up against a trailer home, something caught his eye — a cardboard cylinder, not quite 2 feet tall. It looked just like the barrel in which Willie’s body was found. 
“Jesus Christ, man. That’s it right there,” he said to himself. “It was in their hands. They had it all along.”
The trailer belonged to a man who had lived in Happy Camp in the 1970s and whom everyone knew as Sonny. He washed trucks for a local logging company and lived on the owner’s property. Cook told police he had been on that property with Willie the day of the kidnapping, which is probably why the deputies photographed the area.
When Shelton went back to Happy Camp to learn more about Sonny, he discovered he had been arrested less than a year after Willie’s body was found, when a 5-year-old boy told his parents that Sonny had sexually abused him. The boy’s family had owned the logging company, and Sonny had been their employee. Prosecutors didn’t file charges, and Sonny was released.
According to documents Kayfetz filed with the court, the boy, who was in his late 30s when Nelson was arrested, had always wondered about the connection between Willie’s murder and his own abuse. His grandmother once told him she believed the cardboard barrel had come from their family’s property — she said it was a container for the detergent that Sonny used to wash the trucks.

He had recently searched for the Cook case online and was surprised to find that it had been reopened and that Nelson had been charged with the crime. He wondered: Did the police know about Sonny?
The local press had published a phone number for the Siskiyou detective’s bureau, urging people to come forward with relevant information about the crime. He called and left a message, but no one called him back. He called a second time and explained to a receptionist who he was and why he was calling. He was still waiting for a reply. 
Sonny did eventually go to prison for sexually abusing a child. A mother reported him to the police when she learned he had been molesting her son for years. She told investigators that after Sonny was sentenced, other boys came forward to say he had abused them as well, according to a statement filed in court. He died in 2001.
To Shelton, these discoveries seemed like “a game changer.” He shared the details with Kayfetz. “I was like, ‘This is done,’” he said.
But the jury would not get to see the photo of the barrel or hear from Sonny’s accusers. The prosecution fought to exclude the evidence, arguing it didn’t prove Sonny had ever met Willie, let alone had kidnapped and killed him. And the judge agreed.
“It never even made it to court,” Shelton said. “Our job was to create reasonable doubt. We never planned to solve this case and figure out who did kidnap Willie. But I think we did, and no one cared.” 
The case would radically alter Shelton’s beliefs about the justice system and his perception of how police and prosecutors operate. “I used to be on their team,” he said. “And when I worked for the defense I started to see that, you know, sometimes it’s more about winning than actual justice.” 
He began to view his job as “quality control” for law enforcement agencies.
“Some district attorneys are wonderful and they disclose everything,” he said. “They’re not all like that. And so, if you’re a defendant and you draw a dishonest attorney, well, is that it? Is your fate sealed?”
It would be, Shelton said, if you didn’t have anyone to look into your side of the story.

Over the past 20 years, California has introduced ambitious legislation aimed at reducing incarceration, earning the state a reputation as a leader in criminal justice reform. But those efforts are routinely undermined by California’s failure to provide defendants with a proper investigation of the charges against them. 
“That’s what’s so shocking — that it’s California,” said Goel, of the Sixth Amendment Center. “There’s perception, and then there’s reality. When will the state look in the mirror and see what it really is?”
Investigations affect every part of the criminal justice process. They’re not just about figuring out whether a client is innocent. Even if a case is moving toward a plea deal, an investigation can turn up information that forces a prosecutor to reduce the charge or compels a judge to grant bond or shorten a prison sentence. 
Lawyers are discouraged from interviewing witnesses on their own. If a witness later changed their story or disappeared before trial, the attorney might have to testify on their client’s behalf and recuse themself from the case. 
California lawmakers are considering a bill that could bolster defense investigations by eliminating flat-fee contracts. But it faces opposition from county officials, who say it would force them to increase their defense budgets without helping them pay for it. 
New York was once very similar to California. Its counties managed their own public defender systems, without much input or funding from the state, until a class-action lawsuit, settled in 2015, led to statewide changes. 
New York created an office tasked with improving public defense, eventually giving it some $250 million to dole out each year. Counties that take the money must prioritize certain aspects of public defense, including investigations. In a recent report to the agency overseeing the effort, these counties consistently said the ability to investigate cases was among the most profound impacts of the new funding. Some described specific cases that ended in acquittal or significantly reduced charges as a result.
California was also sued over claims it failed to provide competent defense. To settle the lawsuit, filed in Fresno County, Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 expanded the scope of the Office of the State Public Defender, which had previously handled death penalty appeals, to include support and training for county-based public defender systems.
But the governor committed only $10 million in one-time grants to the effort, and that money has since run out. 
***
Nelson’s trial began in September 2009. The case hinged on Marshall’s account and Nelson’s confession. Kayfetz built much of the defense on what Shelton had discovered. 
The jury deliberated for six days and could not come to a decision. Seven jurors believed Nelson was guilty of murder, and five did not. Six believed he had kidnapped Willie, the other six did not. The judge declared a mistrial. A few weeks later, Andrus, the district attorney, announced he was dismissing the charges against Nelson and his sister-in-law, whose kidnapping case was awaiting trial. 
In a press release, Andrus said it was “the most difficult and painful decision I have made in my professional career.” He told a news reporter that his office had a heavy caseload and didn’t have the staff to prosecute the case. Andrus noted that he could always refile the charges if new evidence emerged or a new witness came forward. 
Nelson was released, but he didn’t get to go home. He had to answer for the drugs he had on him at the time of his arrest and was sent to a Humboldt County jail. 
“I left here just to be interviewed, and 16 months later I got out,” Nelson said from his home in Hoopa. “They got their hook in me, and they kept it in me. There’s nothing you can do when you’re in that situation.”

Nelson said he’s certain he would be in prison if not for Shelton. “He believed what I told him,” he said. “Without that investigator, you don’t have a chance.”
Marshall and his mother have since died. 
Shelton retired from defense investigation last year. He was initially hesitant to talk about the Nelson case and insisted that he had only been doing his job. He said he doesn’t want to be the hero of a story that is still, at its core, a tragedy. “Imagine being Bill Cook,” he said. 
Although CalMatters was unable to reach Willie’s parents, a Facebook group dedicated to his memory, which has been inactive since 2016, includes posts from family members who express the belief that Nelson is guilty. 
That’s what compounds the tragedy of the case for Kayfetz.
“They took a decades-old bandage off of these people’s hearts and just ripped it off,” she said. “It’s every kind of miscarriage of justice.”
Last year, the Siskiyou public defender’s office finally got its first staff investigator. Kayfetz said she needed to “clone him.” She cobbled together funding from a couple of new grants to hire a second, who started earlier this year. But she said it’s still not enough. 
The Nelson case, she said, “rose and fell on the quality of the investigation.”
For his part, Andrus said he doesn’t believe Shelton’s work had much impact on the case. He said the prosecutors and sheriff’s deputies had always known that Marshall was “a compromised witness.” 
“There were so many nails in the coffin of Steve Marshall’s credibility that it didn’t need more,” he said. “He was not the kind of person that we would want to rely on in a murder case.” 
He said they had a duty to “look into his statement, see if we can corroborate it.” And Nelson had confessed. The other evidence they gathered, he acknowledged, “was not very strong.” 
They pushed the case forward anyhow. 

How we reported on California’s lack of public defense investigators
To report and write this story, CalMatters reviewed police reports, case files and other materials related to the kidnapping and murder of Willie Cook and the subsequent case against Gregory Nelson. We spoke with more than 45 people and made an effort to interview everyone who is named in the article. Some people have since died, could not be reached or declined our invitation. To quote people we could not speak with directly, including Bill Cook, Steve Marshall and Marshall’s mother, we relied on transcripts from recorded interviews with law enforcement.
CalMatters also analyzed staffing data, incarceration rates and caseloads for California’s 58 counties. We obtained this data from the California Department of Justice, the Judicial Council of California and the Vera Institute of Justice, as well as from court records.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/101324-The-Investigators-MG-CM-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234
,California,2025-06-05 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California is failing to provide a vital safeguard against wrongful convictions,Anat Rubin,,,,,https://calmatters.org/investigation/2025/06/public-defense-investigators-takeaways/,"If you’re accused of a crime, will someone investigate your side of the story? In California, there’s no guarantee.","A CalMatters investigation has found that poor people accused of crimes, who account for at least 80% of criminal defendants, are routinely convicted in California without anyone investigating the charges against them. 
Close to half of California’s 58 counties do not employ any full-time public defense investigators. Among the remaining counties, defendants’ access to investigators fluctuates wildly, but it’s almost always inadequate.
The cost of this failure is steep, for individual defendants and for the integrity of California’s criminal justice system.
Defense investigators interview witnesses, visit crime scenes, review police reports and retrieve video surveillance footage that might prove the defendant was on the other side of town when a crime was committed, or that an assault was an act of self-defense. They do work that most lawyers are not trained to do. Without them, police and prosecutorial misconduct — among the most common causes of wrongful convictions — remain unchecked, significantly increasing the likelihood that people will go to prison for crimes they did not commit.
In our new investigation, we examine the consequences of this pervasive issue through a reopened kidnapping and murder case in Northern California’s Siskiyou County.
Here are the takeaways:
1. Of the 10 California counties with the highest prison incarceration rates, eight have no defense investigators on staff. 
The lack of investigators affects counties throughout the state, from poor, rural areas like Siskiyou to the state’s largest and most well-funded public defense offices. 
Los Angeles employed just 1 investigator for every 10 public defenders — one of the state’s worst ratios, according to 2023 data from the California Department of Justice. Only seven California counties met the widely accepted minimum standard of 1 investigator for every 3 attorneys.

2. The situation is most alarming in the 25 California counties that don’t have dedicated public defender offices and pay private attorneys. 
Most of these private attorneys receive a flat fee for their services, and the cost of an investigator would eat away at their profits. Some counties allow contracted attorneys to ask the court for additional funds for investigations, but court records show the attorneys rarely make those requests. 
In Kings County, which has one of the highest prison incarceration rates in California, contracted attorneys asked the court for permission to hire an investigator in 7% of criminal cases from 2018 to 2022. In Lake County, attorneys made those requests in just 2% of criminal cases over a three-year period; in Mono County, it was less than 1%. To earn a living from meager county contracts, research shows, private attorneys and firms must persuade defendants to accept plea deals as quickly as possible. An investigation is an expensive delay.
3. Prosecutors have an overwhelming advantage when it comes to investigator staffing. 
In Riverside, the district attorney has 30% more lawyers than the public defender but 500% more investigators, state data shows, in addition to the support of the county sheriff and various municipal police departments. 
This pattern repeats throughout the state. In what is supposed to be an adversarial legal system, indigent defendants and their attorneys are often on their own, facing an army of investigators who are working to secure a conviction.

4. Hidden in the data is the greatest tragedy of failing to investigate cases: wrongful convictions. 
The National Registry of Exonerations is filled with cases in which convictions were overturned when someone finally looked into the prisoner’s claims, years or even decades after they were imprisoned. 
Hundreds of those cases are in California. In one exoneration out of Fresno, Innocence Project investigators found nine witnesses who corroborated their client’s alibi: He was more than 25 miles away at a birthday party at the time of the crime. In a recent case out of Los Angeles, investigators found evidence of their client’s innocence in a police detective’s handwritten notes, material that had been included in a file turned over to the defense before trial. If their cases had been investigated on the front end, these men might have been spared a combined 30 years in prison. 
Maurice Possley, the exoneration registry’s senior researcher, said that a failure to investigate is at the heart of most of the registry’s 3,681 cases.
When he looks at the evidence that overturned these convictions, he’s astounded the defense didn’t find it when the case was being prosecuted. 
“If someone had just made the effort,” he said. “This was all sitting there.”
5. California, once a leader in public defense, has fallen far behind.
The nation’s first public defender office opened in Los Angeles in 1913. By the time the U.S. Supreme Court established in 1963 that defendants have the right to an attorney in state criminal proceedings, more than a dozen California counties were already providing free representation to poor people accused of crimes.
As the nation caught up, California slipped behind. The state kept its defender system entirely in the hands of its counties. Today, it is one of just two states — alongside Arizona — that don’t contribute any funding to trial-level public defense, according to the Sixth Amendment Center. The state does not monitor or evaluate the counties’ systems. There are no minimum standards and, for many defendants, no investigations — even in the most serious cases.
Investigations affect every part of the criminal justice process. They’re not just about figuring out whether a client is innocent. Even if a case is moving toward a plea deal, an investigation can turn up information that forces a prosecutor to reduce the charge or compels a judge to grant bond or shorten a prison sentence. 
Lawyers are discouraged from interviewing witnesses on their own. If a witness later changed their story or disappeared before trial, the attorney could have to testify on their client’s behalf and recuse themself from the case. 
6. This is a national problem.
In 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics conducted a census of the nation’s public defender offices. It found that 40% had no investigators on staff and that 93% failed to meet the National Association for Public Defense’s industry standard of at least 1 investigator for every 3 attorneys. 
The study made it clear that, across the country, investigators were seen as a luxury, not a necessity. CalMatters interviews with top public defenders in several states, along with recent reports examining indigent defense systems, suggest that’s still the case.
In Mississippi, only eight of the state’s 82 counties have public defender offices. The rest rely on private attorneys who are paid a flat fee — one that rarely covers the cost of an investigator. A 2018 report found that, in many Mississippi counties, with the exception of murder cases, the attorneys “never hire investigators and have no time to investigate cases themselves.” Appointed attorneys told researchers they would “get laughed out of court” for requesting additional funds for an investigator. 
Public defender systems that are funded and controlled by state legislatures also have severe investigator shortages. The head public defender in Arkansas, Greg Parrish, said he has only 12 staff investigators, responsible for assisting in felony cases, including capital cases, in all of the state’s 75 counties. Minnesota’s top public defender, William Ward, said he is trying to maintain a ratio of at least 1 investigator for every 7 public defenders but knows that’s not enough. “I would rather have a great investigator and an average lawyer than an average investigator and a great lawyer,” he said. “Investigators make all the difference on a case.”
7. New York stands as a model of how to reform the system. 
New York was once very similar to California. Its counties managed their own public defender systems, without much input or funding from the state, until a class-action lawsuit, settled in 2015, led to statewide changes. 
New York created an office tasked with improving public defense, eventually giving it some $250 million to dole out each year. Counties that take the money must prioritize certain aspects of public defense, including investigations.

Gavin Newsom in 2020 expanded the scope of the Office of the State Public Defender, which had previously handled death penalty appeals, to include support and training for county-based public defender systems.

It needs a reform that can retain its benefits and deal with its downsides.,"Guest Commentary written by

Nick Yost
Nick Yost created and formerly led the environmental section of the California Department of Justice. As general counsel of the Council on Environmental Quality under the Carter administration, he was lead draftsperson of National Environmental Policy Act regulations.


Daniel Yost
Daniel Yost is an attorney and the former mayor of Woodside. He was a founding board member of Peninsula Clean Energy.


In 1947, decades before the federal Clean Air Act, California’s leaders began regulating the causes of harmful air pollution. It was also our state that, in 2006 under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, passed arguably the most aggressive greenhouse gas reduction law in the world, setting off a global race for climate action.
California’s leadership on the environment has a well-deserved reputation.
So it is with a great deal of pride, and no small amount of sadness, that a growing flaw in the California Environmental Quality Act, one of the principle legal mechanisms we use to protect clean air and water, conserve sensitive lands and habitats and address the pollution that causes climate change, is now cause for concern. 
CEQA, as its colloquially known, embodies the proposition that you should “look before you leap” on issues that could have negative environmental or public health impacts. The law’s core legal principle holds that decisionmakers should know the environmental consequences of their actions before taking them.
This purpose remains a worthy one. Unfortunately, over time CEQA has led to unfortunate and inadvertent consequences — in particular, it is commonly used to block much-needed housing in California. But the law is not only harmful in its use: The mere threat of a CEQA lawsuit is enough to stifle new housing developments since such suits can add substantial time, cost and risk for builders who already face daunting construction costs.
The dilemma is how to retain the beneficial essence of CEQA while dealing with the downsides. A bill in the California legislature deals with this and deserves support.
Assembly Bill 609 creates an exemption from CEQA for infill housing projects that are compliant with local laws and not in environmentally sensitive locations. “Building up” in urban locations reduces development pressure on open land in outlying areas. It also reduces commute times and reduces pollution.
As a father and son with lifetimes of experience in environmental causes, we write with some ambivalence. Decades ago, one of us was responsible for the emergence of CEQA as a “super statute,” drafting the amicus brief to the California Supreme Court in Friends of Mammoth v. Mono County — the bedrock case in which the court ruled CEQA extended a public “right of action” against private activity.
Some may view any changes to CEQA as a “camel’s nose under the tent,” inevitably leading to its demise. Our view is the opposite: Like all laws, CEQA derives its social license from its good-faith application. But when a bedrock environmental law is used to cause measurable environmental harm — for example, by displacing housing developments to agricultural and open lands — that undermines political support for the law.
Thoughtful reforms such as AB 609 can maintain CEQA’s core focus on environmental protection, while enabling housing to be built more quickly, cheaply and sustainably.
For those that view climate change as one of the key issues of our time, infill housing is a critical solution. For those that want to see California’s environmental values shape the nation, without cheaper housing, California will lose population and electoral power to other states. 
After the 2030 census, projections show that California could lose four congressional districts (and four electoral college votes), while states with cheaper housing, like Texas and Florida, stand to gain.
If reducing the cost of housing alone is not enough, then for those that care about the environment and climate change, there is plenty to love in the growing push to legalize more infill homes in our cities.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/080719_LosAngeles_AW_CM_61.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

Highly publicized immigration raids have rattled the community and prompted lawmakers to push for more laws protecting immigrants.


Hospitals. Schools. Shelters.
Those are some of the places that California lawmakers want to shield from immigration arrests and raids. They advanced a package of bills this week as President Donald Trump’s administration continues its ramped-up deportation campaign around the country. 
The Democratic-dominated Legislature can’t block federal agents from entering places where someone has allowed them to be. They also can’t stop ICE from going where officers have the  legal authority to be, such as immigration courthouses. But the bills the state Senate passed Monday push local officials to limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to require agents to get a warrant to enter. 
One bill would bar immigration agents from entering “nonpublic” parts of schools without a warrant. Another would do the same in hospitals, and prohibit health care providers from sharing patients’ immigration status with federal authorities unless they have a warrant. Another would limit immigration agents from accessing homeless or domestic violence shelters. 
Other bills limit information sharing. One would require California health departments, when issuing birth certificates, to shield the parents’ countries of birth from the publicly viewable portion of the document. Another would require cities and counties that license street vendors — a business dominated by immigrants — from sharing information about licensees with federal authorities.
Senate Majority Leader Lena Gonzalez, a Long Beach Democrat who authored the schools bill, said she was responding to a recent string of highly publicized raids and other enforcement operations that have rattled immigrant communities and threaten to send workers, students and patients into hiding.
ICE last week raided two San Diego restaurants in a search for workers allegedly living in the country illegally, setting off a confrontation with protesters outside. Immigration agents in April showed up trying to speak with students at two Los Angeles elementary schools; school administrators turned them away. That month they also detained a group of day laborers in the parking lot of a Pomona Home Depot. 
The lawmakers’ proposals sailed through the Legislature so far, and passed the Senate this week with near-unanimous support from Democrats. They now head to the Assembly.
“Every student, regardless of their immigration status, should be given the right to a free and fair education,” Gonzalez said.

Sen. Jesse Arreguin, a Berkeley Democrat who authored the hospitals bill, said it was “about making sure that people can access health care in California without fear of being arrested or deported.”
Though Republicans generally opposed the bills, some acknowledged they were concerned about the widespread fear sown by the sight of federal agents. For Republicans, the politics of a flashy GOP-led immigration crackdown remain delicate in California, where more than one in four residents is foreign-born. 
Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil, a Modesto Republican, criticized Democrats for what she called overblowing “a problem that is very real” and said she was worried school officials would be stuck between state law and complying with federal agents’ requests or orders.
“I definitely believe we have a problem in this state, and we exacerbate that problem by continuing to instill fear in young people,” she said during debate about Gonzalez’ schools bill. “When we talk about ICE agents in masks and instill fear that way, we are doing a disservice to the educational system.”
Her Republican colleague Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh joined Democrats in voting for the bill limiting law enforcement access to schools. She opposed the other bills, including one requiring school officials to notify parents, staff and community members if immigration agents come to campus.
“When someone enters the school we always want to make sure they’re official,” the Redlands lawmaker said. “Putting in statute knowing and asking whether or not someone has a warrant or has an official capacity to enter the school, is really a no-brainer.”

California resists Trump’s immigration crackdown
Kevin Johnson, an immigration law professor and former dean of the UC Davis School of Law, said he expects the legislation, if enacted, would have a limited effect on ICE operations, given that the state is already engaged in a yearslong back-and-forth with the federal government over whether to cooperate with immigration authorities. 
The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are both trying to withhold federal funding from California over its sanctuary law that prohibits state and local police from arresting immigrants on behalf of ICE, and limits their cooperation in transferring detainees to immigration custody. Federal courts upheld the law during the last Trump administration.
In his second term, Trump is further pushing the boundaries in an aggressive effort to curb both illegal and legal forms of immigration. That includes everything from rescinding a longstanding policy of avoiding arrests in “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools and hospitals, to arresting immigrants when they show up for required check-ins or immigration court hearings, to seeking to deny U.S. citizenship from immigrants’ American-born children.
The state may have the authority to shield babies’ parents’ birthplaces from public view, Johnson said, but he theorized that if the U.S. Supreme Court allows Trump to repeal birthright citizenship, the federal government could require people to show proof of their parents’ birthplace to become an American citizen. 
“They can only do so much to limit what the federal government can do,” Johnson said of the state. “We’re in the middle of a long, protracted skirmish between the state and federal governments on immigration.”
Still, he said, forcing federal agents to get warrants to search for or arrest someone could help immigrants feel safer going out in public. 
“We at least have to get the federal government to think about complying with the law, as opposed to just sending out hordes of ICE agents wherever,” he said.
Immigrant aid groups set to lose funding

The effort to protect vulnerable immigrants comes as California nonprofits are scrambling to respond to increased enforcement and competing for limited resources. 
California spends $60 million a year on immigration legal aid and in a special session in December gave that fund a one-time boost of $10 million. 
Some Democratic lawmakers this year have backed advocates’ requests to further increase that funding even as the state stares down a $12 billion budget deficit. Gov. Gavin Newsom has already proposed other cuts to immigrants’ social services to address the shortfall. 
One program that would run out of money without new funding is the Children’s Holistic Immigration Representation Project, a pilot program started in 2022 to provide lawyers and social workers for unaccompanied minors facing deportation.
Originally slated to last through summer 2024, the program has helped about 800 immigrants who arrived as children. The California Department of Social Services has kept it going with a one-time $4.2-million boost in money originally budgeted for other immigration legal services. That money will run out at the end of June.
This year, advocates and legal service providers say they’re not expecting there to be any extra money to go around. 
When California made $5 million of the legal aid funding available this year, organizations across the state applied for six times that amount, said Lisa Hoffman, co-executive director of the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant in Berkeley. 
Hoffman said state funding helps her nonprofit pay caseworkers and attorneys to represent 50 young immigrants between ages 17 and 22. The clients, many of whom fled violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, get help with their cases and assistance enrolling in school, securing transportation and going to the doctor. 
“By investing in these services now, it prevents much more serious, longer-term problems,” she said. “Even if they are allowed to stay, but they drop out of school or don’t get the support they need, it’s going to create much bigger and more expensive problems down the road in terms of homelessness, mental health challenges.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/120224_Deportation-Protest_FG_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)An effort to mitigate devastating flooding in Ellicott City is moving forward with the announcement of two $5 million loans to complete projects that will divert storm-driven flash flooding away from downtown Ellicott City businesses.
The $10 million in loans are the first of from a state account created in 2021. In Ellicott City, the money will go toward two projects designed to move tens of thousands of gallons of floodwater per second off Main Street.
State and county officials are already looking to other projects, even as its ability to secure federal loans and disaster recovery aid remains uncertain.
“At a time when we’re watching the federal government cancel supports for emergency management and telling states and local jurisdictions that if tragedy happens, you are now on your own, in Maryland, we’re choosing to move differently and actually invest in our local jurisdictions, both in preparation and also in recovery,” Gov. Wes Moore said Wednesday as he toured the site.
Officials said the projects could be duplicated in other areas prone to similar floods including an area of western Maryland ravaged last month by flood waters.
“It’ll be used 100% here” in Maryland, said Department of Emergency Management Secretary Russ Strickland. “It’s not dependent on federal money, which, right now, obviously, we’re in a very uncomfortable situation with Washington.”
In January, President Donald Trump called for eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and FEMA in April said it was canceling funding for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, program. The move hit funding earmarked for fiscal years 2020-2023, putting roughly $1 billion in projects approved in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in jeopardy.
Scores of federal lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats — have called for BRIC funding to be restored.
The Ellicott City projects, meanwhile, will proceed with state money.

Tunneling equipment — a 300-foot long device nicknamed “Rocky” — is expected to begin cutting a channel a mile long and 18-feet wide through granite 150 feet below ground. It will stretch from the west end of Ellicott City and terminate at the Patapsco River, with the capacity to move 26,000 gallons of water per second from downtown Ellicott City to the river.
A second project, called the Maryland Avenue Culvert, will move water from the Tiber-Hudson branch to the Patapsco River.
The two projects are part of a massive effort to make the historic mill city prone to flooding more resilient.
The county is coupling the projects with water retention ponds. Three ponds, with a combined capacity of over 12 million gallons, are already been built. Others remain in the design phase.
Howard County Executive Calvin Ball (D) called it “the single largest public works project” in county history.
“When complete, these projects will work together to reduce the quantity and the velocity of water on Main Street during major flooding events, and make Ellicott City a national, if not international, model of resiliency,” Ball said.
Moore said the projects will “save lives … but also help save the community and will also help save the state money.”
“Because, you know, what’s more expensive than preparing for the next big flood? Having to recover from the next big flood — immeasurably more expensive,” he said.
Moore said every dollar spent on flood mitigation saves taxpayers “an average of $6 in return when it comes to recovery costs.”
Flood-prone Ellicott City has seen three major events since 2011, including what was called a once in a 1,000-year storm in 2016, when flooding along Main Street damaged buildings and killed two people. Two years later, another storm dumped 8 inches of rain in two hours on Ellicott City.
The floods resulted in plans to make the area more flood-resilient, demolition of some buildings, debris clean up after big storms, an alert system, automated gates to high-ground areas and the stormwater retention ponds and diversion systems.
Initial cost estimates of $82 million in 2019 had grown to $130 million four years later due to costs of expanding the project — most notably the north tunnel project — and  “external economic factors,” including inflation. But the project also grew more expensive as officials widened the diameter by 20% and more than tripled its length to a mile.
FEMA cancels $1 billion for flood prevention projects in Chesapeake Bay region

Money for the project comes from a revolving loan fund created in 2021.
“Even as we were fighting for Ellicott City, we realized that this was a bigger problem than this one town and the rest of the state could learn from us,” said Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), who sponsored the Resilient Maryland Revolving Loan Fund and who was at Wednesday’s event.
She said the Northeast has seen “a 70% increase in extreme rainfall since the 1950s and the Chesapeake Bay could rise by five feet, by 2050. I’ve seen some horrible projections where we’re looking at $19 billion worth of damage if we do not invest. But that is not what we’re doing, because we are being proactive.”
The $10 million in loans for the Ellicott City project are about half the state’s revolving account. Strickland said so far there has been little competition for the money.
Jurisdictions that use the money agree to pay it back over time. Strickland said a repayment agreement with Howard County has not been finalized.
Del. Courtney Watson (D-Howard) said Wednesday the projects in Ellicott City could be a model for other parts of the state.
“We were lucky enough to be the first to be able to put these policies in place, to be able to figure it out, to do something that’s never been done before, to solve a tedious, complex public infrastructure project and puzzle for threats that didn’t exist 20 years ago,” Watson said.
“We hope to model and assist other jurisdictions who are facing the same type of problems, such as Westernport,” she said.
More than 5 inches of rain fell in Allegany and Garrett Counties on May 14, triggering flash floods that overwhelmed roads, schools and homes, and damaged utilities. Areas including Westernport and Lonaconing were some of the hardest hit. Moore declared a state of emergency in the region — an early step toward seeking aid from FEMA.
Strickland said initial damage estimates could be completed as early as next week. The threshold for seeking federal aid comes in at around $12 million, he said.
“I think we’re going to meet that,” Strickland said.
Strickland said he’s “cautiously optimistic” that federal aid will still come through, but is also looking at contingency plans. One such plan would use money from the state’s disaster recovery fund as well as a catastrophic event fund.
When asked if the funds could cover the potential $12 million in damages, Strickland said: “I think it would be very close.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)President Donald Trump recently signed a resolution expanding motorized access to remote regions surrounding Lake Powell. 
The resolution — sponsored by Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy — overturns a policy from the National Park Service that limits where off-road vehicles can drive in parts of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. 
Under the rule, which was implemented during the Biden administration, conventional vehicles were still allowed to travel existing routes within the recreation area. But about 25 roads amounting to roughly 26 miles were closed to specialized off-road vehicles, like dirtbikes, ATVs or side-by-sides. 
Maloy and other members of Utah’s congressional delegation say the resolution allows for greater recreation opportunities in the area, and criticized the Biden-era rule for going against the will of locals. Opponents to the resolution, which included Democrats in Congress and a number of environmental groups, argue that expanding vehicle access could cause severe damage to the region’s most sensitive and pristine environments.
“Orange Cliffs, Gunsight Butte, and Canyonlands National Park’s Maze District will be impaired by noisy, destructive off-highway vehicles. It’s a dark day for all who love Southern Utah and Glen Canyon’s wild places.’’ said Hanna Larsen, a staff attorney for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, in a statement last month.

The resolution, which passed the House in April, the Senate in May and was signed by Trump on May 23, invokes the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to review and overturn federal rules.
It’s the latest in nearly two decades of political back-and-forth over motorized recreation in Glen Canyon. 
For years, environmental groups criticized the National Park Service for its loose regulation of off-road vehicles around the recreation area. In 2005, groups sued over the lack of enforcement. In  2008, the service settled and agreed to create an off-road vehicle management plan. 
Then in 2021, the first Trump administration released a new plan that opened up much of the recreation area to all kinds of motorized use. 
The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance sued two years later, arguing the administration’s plan failed to take all of the environmental impacts into consideration. The National Park Service settled again, agreeing to close the Lake Powell shoreline to motorized use, unless water levels were “sustainable.” It also put restrictions on ATV and side-by-side use in certain areas.
In January, the park service rule officially went into effect. Maloy said in a statement Tuesday that her resolution was a result of constituent concerns over the rule’s “nonsensical restrictions on motorized access.”
“We took legislative action and, through this (Congressional Review Act), reversed a rule pushed through by the previous administration. Utahns shouldn’t be shut out of decisions that affect their own backyard. Now we can continue to recreate in the National Recreation Area. Thank you to our Senators for working with me to get this done for Utah,” Maloy said.

Utah’s two Republican senators, Mike Lee and John Curtis, also celebrated the resolution becoming law. Curtis called it an “an important step to ensure our public lands remain open to the people.” Lee said it makes it clear that “environmental groups don’t get to dictate our National Recreation Areas through backroom deals.” 
“This was a classic case of sue-and-settle policymaking where bureaucrats caved to activists and cut Americans out of the process. That’s not how representation is supposed to work,” Lee said in a statement. “I’m proud President Trump signed this CRA into law.” 
Managed by the National Park Service, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was formed in 1972 and borders several national parks and monuments, like Bears Ears, Capitol Reef and Canyonlands. It covers Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir in the country, which attracts millions of visitors each year. In 2023, the service recorded more than 4.7 million visits.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020225_Lake-Powell_16-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 08:09:34.853824

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Employees’ Insurance Board (SEIB) has narrowed its search for a CEO to three finalists from an initial pool of 49 individuals.
Members of the SEIB executive committee on Wednesday laid out a timeline for the final selection process, which started after William Ashmore, the board’s outgoing CEO of SEIB, which oversees health insurance for state employees, announced his retirement in March. The three remaining candidates were selected after initial screenings and interviews conducted by ITAC Solutions, a Birmingham-based recruiting firm, based on criteria established by the board, including leadership and industry experience.
“I believe that the list does reflect a strong group of individuals who will align competencies,” said Charles Baughman, a consultant with ITAC Solutions, which conducted the candidate search for the board.

After the meeting, Ashmore said that “as far as (he knows),” Sally Corley, chief operating officer of the board, was one of the three candidates selected to interview for the position. Corley has worked for the board since 2013 and was the board director of government affairs before becoming COO.
“With her 12 years of experience (with SEIB), she was one of the most qualified internal candidates we had,” Ashmore said after the meeting, adding that she expressed interest in the position.
Corley would be the first woman to lead the board. Prior to Ashmore’s tenure as CEO, which started in 1988, the board was under the Retirement Systems of Alabama and led by CEO David Bronner.
Corley said in a text message that she applied for the position but still did not know if she was a finalist.
The selection process will proceed as follows:

Finalist information will be presented to the board chair for distribution to the full board, allowing members to review the materials and prepare questions.
The executive committee will interview the candidates in an open meeting on June 16, using questions submitted in advance by the full board.
At the end of the June 16 meeting, the executive committee will vote to select their preferred candidate and present that recommendation to the full board.
The full board will convene on June 18 to hold a final vote on whether to accept or reject the executive committee’s recommendation.

Ashmore said during the meeting that his timeline for retirement is flexible to allow a smooth transition. A new hire could potentially start as soon as July 1, but the board agreed that an external candidate, especially one from out of state, may need at least a month after being hired.
“If the need is not there, then I’ll go ahead and retire on July 1,” Ashmore said.

,California,2025-06-05 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"California’s deficit dilemma: Cut spending, borrow money or raise taxes?",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/california-budget-deficit-dilemma/,"Gov. Gavin Newsom estimated there's a nearly $20 billion hole in the budget, but if lawmakers restore his Medi-Cal cuts the hole could grow $10 billion larger.","The California Legislature has just a few days to pass a 2025-26 state budget to meet the state constitution’s June 15 deadline.
The deadline will be met, if for no other reason than legislators would, at least theoretically, have their salaries suspended were they to miss it.
However, the budget they enact may bear only a passing resemblance to what will eventually, perhaps many months later, become a complete fiscal plan.
The revised budget that Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a month ago projects that general fund tax revenues for the year would be about $20 billion short of covering the spending that he has proposed — and that’s after counting the billions of dollars in reductions, primarily in health care and other services for the poor, he’s asked the Legislature to swallow. 
Newsom would roll back expansions that he and legislators happily enacted when they erroneously believed the state had a huge surplus. Newsom now says the cuts are necessary to balance the budget — although it would still have, by his own numbers, the $20 billion gap between income and outgo that he would cover with temporary fixes, such as on- and off-the-books borrowing, tapping emergency reserves and accounting gimmicks. He plans to tap $7.1 billion from the budget rainy day fund, bringing the shortage closer to $12 billion. 
So that’s the dilemma. Newsom and legislators are getting very heavy pressure from advocates for the endangered services, such as Medi-Cal coverage for undocumented immigrants, to back off. However, restoring them in the budget would cost about $10 billion, thus increasing the state’s chronic deficit and requiring either reductions in other spending categories or more short-term patches.
The dilemma’s large amounts of money, uncertainty about the effects of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and proposed federal spending reductions — and ideological divisions among Capitol Democrats over what to do — all point to the passage of a paper budget to meet the constitutional deadline while debate and negotiations continue indefinitely.
Underlining the situation is an acknowledgement by the administration, backed up by the Legislature’s budget analyst, Gabe Petek, that the hole in the budget is what’s called a “structural deficit,” meaning that spending now on the books is $10 to $20 billion a year higher than expected revenues.
Petek’s office has calculated that since Newsom became governor in 2019, spending has risen by an average of 9% a year while revenues have increased by just 6% a year, and if the gap continues, the state’s debt from borrowing could reach $42 billion within a few years.
The bottom line of all these numbers is that no matter what they do on this budget, it will continue to leak red ink until there is a day of reckoning.
There is another way out of the conundrum if the Capitol’s politicians want to take it — raise taxes.
Labor unions, advocates of health care and social programs and the most left-leaning members of the Legislature want to do it. Various taxation schemes are floating around the Capitol, mostly suggesting raising taxes on corporations to avoid directly taxing voters.
In its recent review of the state’s budget situation, Petek’s office raises the tax increase alternative, saying it “ultimately is a difficult judgment call for the Legislature” with political consequences as well as financial ones.
Newsom — who’s clearly looking ahead to what he’ll do after his governorship ends 19 months hence — has repeatedly rejected tax increases, preferring to get through each year with short-term fixes.
Moreover, increasing corporate taxes would amplify the state’s image as having an extraordinarily difficult and expensive business climate.
Will Democrats, who have complete control over the state finances, bite the bullet by either rolling back spending or increasing taxes, or will they, as former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was fond of saying, merely “kick the can down the road?”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121923_MediCal-Expansion_LJ_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 08:09:34.853824

A message seeking comment from Shaw was left Wednesday morning.
Dunham and her husband had their daughter Aria through in-vitro fertilization (IVF), which they had to seek outside of Alabama. The Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February 2024 that frozen embryos outside the womb are “children,” which caused fertility clinics in the state to close.
“No family should have to leave their home state to pursue the dream of parenthood,” she said. “I know what it means to desperately want a child, to fight for that chance, and to finally hold that miracle in your arms. That empathy drives my career, my faith and my life, and it’s why I’m stepping up now.”
Associate Justice Jay Mitchell, who wrote the majority opinion in the ruling, is running for Alabama attorney general in 2026.
Lawmakers quickly passed a bill in March 2024 intended to provide the clinics immunity, and most services resumed. The bill did not address the court ruling that frozen embryos were unborn children.
Dunham is currently a referee in Jefferson County’s Juvenile Court and an attorney at Magic City Fertility Law, helping couples navigate the legal complexities of assisted reproduction, according to the release. As a referee, Dunham conducts hearings and makes findings like a judge would, but her decisions are not final.

After a pandemic-era pause, repayments on defaulted student loans restarted last month, and many borrowers are running into barriers. (Photo by Seth Wenig/The Associated Press)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of information about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
Universities try 3-year degrees to save students time, money

When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults. After 90 days without a payment, the delinquency will be reported to credit bureaus. For two types of loans, they go into default after 270 days —about nine months — without a payment.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to cancel or reduce $400 billion worth of debt for 43 million Americans. His administration did, however, forgive loans for millions under other programs.
That includes nearly 48,000 South Carolinians who got their debts reduced or wiped out, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Biden’s already reduced SC student loans by $2.6B. Clyburn hopes newest plan secures more votes.

But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.
Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
 ‘Can’t wait for Washington’

Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
These South Carolinians owed more than $120,000 in student loans. Now their debt is forgiven.

Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
 Repayment

Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
Scholarship program that enables debt-free college now available in 13 SC counties

“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
 ‘Incentive to hike prices’

Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

Melanie Scheible took the lead on negotiating with Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo's office on his crime bill. (Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)In the end, Gov. Joe Lombardo’s wide-ranging crime bill to stiffen penalties for DUI offenses, retail theft, and crimes on the Las Vegas Strip died because the Nevada State Legislature simply ran out of time.
In the final hours of the session, the state Senate and Assembly passed slightly different versions of Senate Bill 457 with overwhelming bipartisan support, but the Senate was forced to adjourn before it could take a second vote to approve the last-minute amendments added by the Assembly.
Its death underscores the risk of rushing complex public policy through the legislative process at the last minute.
The bill was first introduced in early April, but it was only in the final five days of the session that the policy was publicly debated, amended, amended again, and voted on. As it raced toward the finish line, there were myriad unanswered questions around the fiscal cost of implementing the bill, as well as the interpretation of last-minute amendments.
At one point, hours before the Legislature’s midnight deadline, ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah told lawmakers the bill, and the process for passing it, was plagued with red flags.
“It is a joke that this body, this committee is forced to hear this at 5 p.m. on sine die,” Haseebullah said, referring to the term used to mark the end of a legislative session. “We are now here being told this is what needs to be passed because, what? Democrats need to seem tough on crime. This is not tough on crime. It’s stupid and reckless. It’s totally unacceptable. You should not have been put in this position. It’s an embarrassment.”
Hours later, Haseebullah and other opponents of AB457 would find an unexpected ally in state Sen. Ira Hansen and the rest of the Senate Republicans. The caucus, angry about an unrelated resolution, began a series of parliamentary motions to slow down voting. The crime bill was incidentally one of the victims.
While opponents of the crime bill were relieved at the end result, the process has left a bad taste.
Haseebullah noted the bill was changing frequently in its final hours that the lawmakers “couldn’t possibly have fully read within a 2-hour window” before voting on it.
“The fact that the bill didn’t receive a vote after this much backdoor dealing is probably karmic,” he said in a statement. “I almost feel bad for the Governor at this point because he went from purporting to address theft issues to having his bill turned into a nefarious attempt to bolster the power of the resorts and to allow warrantless wiretapping of Nevadans. You almost can’t make this up.”
‘Nobody gets what they want’
Lombardo’s bill “Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act” was introduced April 7, the 64th day of the 120-day session.
Since its first hearing May 28, the bill received persistent criticism from groups not involved with drafting the bill language. Public defenders, the ACLU and criminal reform advocates argued that the bill lacked any input from opponents.
John Piro with the Clark County Public Defender’s office added the bill also lacked any data to support proponents’ claims that it was needed to address safety issues. 
Washoe County District Attorneys took the lead on the bill presentation, which also received proposed amendments by the Nevada Resorts Association.
The versions of the bill lawmakers voted on Monday sought harsher penalties for people who destroy property while committing theft, stronger punishment for children who assault teachers, and enhanced penalties for people who assault hospitality workers. The Assembly version also would have enabled Clark County to re-establish a court specific to prosecuting crimes within the Las Vegas Strip resort corridor.
The Senate passed the bill 20-1 at 2:12 p.m. Monday Democratic state Sen. James Ohrenschall cast the lone dissenting vote. 
The Assembly voted 36-6 to pass an amended version of the bill at 11:15 p.m. Democratic Assemblymembers Venicia Considine, Tanya Flannagan, Jovan Jackson, Selena La Rue Hatch, Cinthia Zermeño Moore, and Erica Roth opposed.
What made it to – but not over –  the finish line was markedly different from what Lombardo originally proposed. 
While campaigning for governor, Lombardo, then Clark County sheriff, pledged to roll back modest criminal justice reforms passed in 2019 that lowered penalties for non-violent theft and drug crimes and increased access to diversion programs.
SB 457’s initial version proposed reducing the felony threshold for theft from $1,200 to $750 and changing the state’s bail process by excluding holidays from the 48-hour mandatory hearing provisions. 
These provisions were stripped from the bill.
What remained in the bill through several revisions was harsher punishments for people charged with repeated felony DUIs, stalking and possession of child pornography.
It also stricter punishment for youth who commit repeated crimes against teachers or social service workers, while also limiting eligibility for diversion programs for those convicted of felony abuse, neglect or exploitation of children or the elderly.
During the Senate vote, Democratic state Sen. Melanie Scheible encouraged lawmakers to vote for the legislation, saying it focused on “smash and grab crimes” and improved DUI statutes.
“SB 457 is a comprehensive public safety bill that ensures we have safety for people who work in our schools, shop at our businesses and people who drive on our roads,” Scheible said. “SB 457 has been a collaborative effort between stakeholders, primarily between myself and the governor’s office.”
After the bill passed the Senate, it was heard by the Assembly Judiciary Committee at 4 p.m. Monday. At that meeting, the Nevada Resort Association emerged to pitch its own proposed amendments. The Nevada Independent around that time reported that the amendment was being pushed by the NRA and the Culinary Union.
The provisions of the bill added behind the scenes by the NRA requires Clark County to adopt ordinance that “designates the geographic boundaries of one or more corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to public safety and the economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration of tourists at the resort association’s request.”
The bill would prohibit anyone who violates the ordinance from entering the resort corridor for at least a year. 
Nevada Resort Association lobbyist Matt Griffin said the group first submitted the amendment to the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Scheible, several weeks ago. 
Haseebullah told lawmakers that if it was submitted three weeks ago and the ACLU and public defenders only learned about it Monday, that in itself is a red flag. 
“It is totally unprofessional beyond measure,” he said during the hearing. “I don’t know if that lies at the governor’s steps or at Chair Scheible’s steps.”
In a statement to the Current, a spokesperson for the Nevada Senate Democratic Caucus wrote that Scheible did incorporate concerns for a variety of people, adding, “just like with any piece of legislation, nobody gets everything they want.”

Thomas Sheng/U.S. Marine Corps)The University of Maryland Global Campus should pay out $69 million to run out the contracts of two independent businesses it created that came under sharp criticism from legislators and legislative auditors last year.
That was the recommendation of the University System of Maryland’s Board of Regents Finance Committee, which quickly voted Wednesday to extend the $46 million-a-year contract for UMGC Ventures for another 18 months, while the online university works to pull it and another spun-off unit back in-house.
Ventures handles the online UMGC’s information technology services, and the university is “not currently positioned to perform these functions in-house,” the resolution said as justification for the extension.
The resolution notes that it does not increase the current contract with Ventures, which handles UMGC’s information technology services, but merely extends it a current rates. The contract will start July 1 and run through Dec. 31, 2026, the length of time UMCG officials said it will take reintegrate Ventures and the other independent unit called AccelerEd, a subsidiary of Ventures.
“The requested contract extension does not increase the annual contract from the current value of fiscal year 25,” UMGC President Gregory Fowler told the committee via Zoom. “But it does provide us with a necessary runway to implement the reintegration services without disruption of these, which are critical IT services as we are trying to move forward.”
Fowler said a consulting firm had been hired to craft a reintegration plan and assess the university’s relationship with the two units.
“I just want to say thank you for dealing with a difficult situation, and for your summary that you sent out,” committee member William T. “Bill” Wood said during the brief discussion on the issue. “That was really helpful to read that and understand,. And congratulations on almost getting through the whole thing.”
“Thank you, Regent Wood,” Fowler said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The move to reintegrate offices came after a critical August 2024 audit completed by the state Office of Legislative Audits (OLA), which stated the online university’s creation of AccelerEd and Ventures cost too much money and appeared to skirt normal university procedures.
UMGC created the two companies under a University System of Maryland policy called the High Impact Economic Development Activities program. Under HIEDA, campuses in the system are allowed to give preferential treatment to businesses they spin off, under specific circumstances.
According to the audit, the campus created Ventures in 2016 as a tax-exempt holding company for UMGC businesses that the university seeded with $15 million. A year later, UMGC spun off its information technology office into AccelerEd.
Ventures had $215.3 million in revenues from fiscal years 2017 to 2022, the audit said, but about $198.1 million of that came from UMGC. And of the $198.1 million, about $184 million of those service agreements were made without competitive bids and with little oversight afterward, the audit said.
While HIEDA policy doesn’t require institutions to seek competitive bids, the audit noted that “the law does not mandate exclusive use of these entities.”
University officials defended the arrangement in the audit, and when they appeared before the joint committee nearly three months later, in a November hearing, they said they still stood by “the intent” of the program, even if there were issues in how that intent was executed.
The university hired Attain Partners of McLean, Virginia, to study the companies, with a plan focused on seven areas that included governance and leadership alignment, communication and change management, finance and budgeting and technology.
According to an executive summary Attain presented in May, Ventures and AccelerEd helped create 174 jobs , supported St. Mary’s College of Maryland and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, provided $1.5 million in scholarships and established three technology programs.
The summary also highlighted legal advice offered by Florida-based Holland & Knight, which has a Washington, D.C., office. It said Ventures met its IRS designations and complied with UMGC rules by conducting business “on an arm’s length basis.”
Some members of Ventures’ board of directors were not appointed by the university, governor or executive authority, so its board didn’t require a quorum, and the university “has no veto power or ability to reverse decisions,” the consultant’s report said.
“It does not appear that Ventures would be subject to audit by UMGC or the University System of Maryland without either volunteering to do so or judicial deliberation,” according to the summary.
Among Attain’s recommendations was to develop “a 12–18-month implementation plan to incorporate the necessary frameworks, mechanisms, and structures within Ventures to support the commercialization lifecycle,” and it said that if UMGC absorbed AccelerEd’s staff and services back into the university, it “addresses the majority of OLA audit concerns.”
The Finance Committee’s recommendation will be presented to the full Board of Regents, which is scheduled June 13 at 8 a.m. at the University System of Maryland at Hagerstown.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7759030-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 08:09:34.853824

(Getty Images)Indiana education officials presented the first draft of a sweeping new school accountability framework Wednesday, marking a major step toward replacing the state’s previous A-F grading system with a model that instead “values the unique skills and strengths of each student.”
The proposal, shared at the Indiana State Board of Education’s June meeting, outlines a point-based system designed to measure a broader range of student outcomes — from academic proficiency to work-based learning and attendance, as well as soft skills like communication and collaboration. 
The school performance model is still in development and must undergo a months-long rulemaking process that includes multiple rounds of public comment and revisions. 










The model no longer evaluates schools based on how well all of their students do on a single assessment.


– Ron Sandlin, Indiana Department of Education’s chief innovation officer


A final version is expected to be adopted by the state board by December. State law now requires the first round of school grades under the new system to be issued in fall 2026.
“This model is intentionally designed to encourage schools to support and nurture the unique skills and strengths of each student,” said Ron Sandlin, Indiana Department of Education’s (IDOE) chief innovation officer, who co-presented the draft. “The model no longer evaluates schools based on how well all of their students do on a single assessment. Rather, it shifts, and it evaluates schools on their ability to help individual students be on track for postsecondary success.”
What the new model could include
The shift is part of a broader effort mandated by House Enrolled Act 1498, signed into law earlier this year. The legislation, authored by Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, requires the state education board to adopt a new school accountability model by December 2025, with implementation beginning in the 2026–27 school year. 
The move follows a years-long push to update Indiana’s previous A-F grading system, which has been effectively suspended since 2018 amid transitions in state testing and COVID-related disruptions. 
During the pause, schools instead received performance report cards posted online. The cards offered data on test scores, graduation rates, attendance, and postsecondary readiness, but stopped short of assigning a single letter grade.
Story continues below.
6.4.25-June-SBOE_Accountability_FINAL-1
 
Supporters of a revamped system, including Republican Gov. Mike Braun and key GOP lawmakers, maintain that it provides needed clarity and transparency for parents. But critics, including some Democrats and educators, have warned against oversimplifying complex school dynamics when evaluating overall performance.
The new system, as proposed, aligns closely with Indiana’s recently redesigned high school diploma and the state’s “Graduates Prepared to Succeed” (GPS) characteristics — a set of five competencies state leaders say matter most to lifelong success: academic mastery, work ethic, communication and collaboration, civic and digital literacy, and career readiness.
Under the draft framework, schools would earn points based on student outcomes at four key checkpoints.
Each student’s “score” combines academic mastery — such as ILEARN or SAT performance — with additional indicators including regular attendance, completion of college-level coursework, progress in English language acquisition, and participation in work-based learning or credential programs.

For example, a hypothetical third-grade student who scores just below proficiency in math but passes the IREAD reading exam and maintains high attendance would earn 90 points under the proposed model — compared to zero points under the current A–F system.
“That student is on track,” Sandlin said. “We want to support and cultivate their interests and strengths, and this model values that.”
In third grade, evaluations would specifically assess “essential” math and literacy using ILEARN standardized test scores. Third grade reading proficiency and “regular attendance” rates would be factored in, too.
ILEARN scores would also be used to determine academic mastery for students in grades 4–8. But other points could be earned for good attendance rates, for high percentages of students proficient in science and social studies, and for “advanced” students who take accelerated coursework before high school. 
By the end of ninth grade, students should have earned at least 10 high school credits. Evaluations for high schools would also factor in student participation in college and career ready coursework; proficiency on a biology-specific standardized test; PSAT scores; school attendance; and English language learner progress. 
Accountability points for 12th grade could additionally be earned based on SAT proficiency, and if students complete any of the following: a new diploma “seal,” work-based learning, or a credential of value. Like at other checkpoints, school attendance and English language learner advances would also qualify for points.
Positive feedback so far — and more to come
Board members and school leaders largely praised the more “student-centered approach” at Wednesday’s meeting.
“I think our new accountability model completes the story for students,” said board member Byron Ernest. “We are creating, now, an environment where we can finally tell that story, and  just applaud that and encourage us to keep that. … This makes our accountability truly student-driven. It’s not about the school. It’s about the student.”
The draft rule proposes awarding maximum points to high school students who graduate with an “honors plus” diploma seal. 
Indiana Education Secretary Katie Jenner emphasized that those credentials now carry “real currency” in Indiana and can lead to automatic admission at public universities, guaranteed interviews with major employers, or advancement opportunities in the military.
Indiana education officials green-light high school diploma overhaul

IDOE’s Chief Strategy Officer Jacqueline Kronk noted that the model was shaped by more than a year of stakeholder feedback, including input from educators, parents, industry leaders and community members.
“This hasn’t been altered or updated in over 10 years, and so obviously we need to think through the additive process and the change management,” she said.
A 30-day public comment period will begin later this summer once the draft rule is officially published. A second round of revisions is expected before the board votes on a final version in December.
“We have zero intention or plan (to adjust) those cut scores to make it easier on schools and kids. We want to keep that rigor and that standard high in Indiana and be very honest about where we are,” Jenner said. “But we want to see the full picture of each child, because so often, when you just do pass or fail … you sometimes lose students in those models.”
“We want to hear from Indiana to get this landed in the best possible spot in December,” she continued. “And we know … we’ll get to the best spot by humbly listening and refining.”
Feedback can be submitted via a QR code or online portal once the rule is published. Department officials will also host additional focus groups and public hearings this fall.
“This is a really good rough draft,” said board member B.J. Watts. “And I think, as we’ve shown before with the diploma work, this board listens.”

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tim Maciel: Consolidation is not the answer.","This commentary is by Tim Maciel of Brattleboro. He is a director on the Windham Southeast School District board and a member of the Rural School and Community Alliance.The narrative that began with Gov. Phil Scott’s education transformation bill, H.454, continues to echo across Vermont, from legislative halls to local school board meetings: our education system — with its high per-pupil spending and low student-to-staff ratios — is unsustainable and in urgent need of dramatic restructuring. I reject that narrative.As a director on the Windham Southeast School District board and a member of the Rural School and Community Alliance, I offer a different perspective — one grounded in equity, community voice and whole-child education.Yes, Vermont ranks near the top nationally in per-pupil spending. But this is not a symptom of inefficiency. It reflects our rural geography, aging infrastructure and our commitment to personalized learning.This point has been raised repeatedly — in legislative testimony, public forums, and op-eds — by superintendents, teachers, parents, and education advocates (see, for example, David F. Kelly’s May 30 commentary in VTDigger). In fact, education spending as a percentage of total state spending has stayed the same for two decades. Yet these facts continue to fall on deaf ears in Montpelier.READ MORE
We are a rural state. Many of our schools are small because they must be. Consolidation would mean unacceptably long commutes for students, loss of community identity and weakened ties between families and schools — and it would discourage young families from moving there. The fixed costs of education — heating, transportation, staffing — do not scale down when districts merge.This isn’t a matter of opinion. Research shows that school consolidation rarely delivers promised savings and often harms students and communities (see “Consolidation of Schools and Districts: What the Research Says and What it Means”).Critics also point to Vermont’s slipping test scores. But standardized test results don’t tell the full story of educational success — especially in communities like ours, where we prioritize curiosity, civic engagement, emotional well-being and environmental stewardship alongside academic achievement in basic skills. We know that test scores correlate more with out-of-school factors — poverty, housing instability, trauma — than with teacher quality or school size.Even if we wanted to improve test scores alone, would any teacher argue that the way to do it is by increasing class sizes, reducing mental health staff or putting kids on buses for an extra hour each day? It just does not make good sense.We’ve seen what works. Just this year, Putney Central and Guilford Elementary — along with the Compass School in Westminster — were three of only 15 schools nationally recognized for exemplary “whole child” education. They were praised for fostering school-wide climates of nurturance, community involvement and integrated social-emotional learning.Would this be possible in a 400-student mega-school with fewer adults per child?Yes, Vermont has the lowest student-to-staff ratio in the country. That’s not a flaw — it’s a quality of our educational system. It allows our schools to nurture individual learners, build strong relationships and intervene early when students need support.While Brattleboro Union High School’s graduation rates have lagged slightly behind the state average (a challenge our district is actively addressing), Vermont as a whole continues to boast one of the highest graduation rates in the nation. More tellingly, Vermont students are far more likely than their peers nationally to complete college within four years — a clear sign that our graduates are well prepared for life after high school.If we’re serious about solutions, let’s stop repeating false claims of consolidation. Instead, let’s invest in ideas that reflect Vermont’s values and realities. We could:Update the funding formula to account for real cost drivers like rising health insurance premiums;
Support the development of regional boards of cooperative educational services to share specialized services like transportation and special education;
Expand our commitment to community schools — schools that also serve as hubs for health care, social services and family support.Change is needed — but it must be smart, equitable and rooted in the strengths of our communities, not a misguided obsession with economies of scale.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tim Maciel: Consolidation is not the answer.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-06-05 07:02:20.155822

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)Every four months, Philippe Knab, the reentry and eviction defense program director for Washington’s Office of Civil Legal Aid, compiles a report on eviction trends across the state. Since 2021, each review has painted a worse picture than before – especially the most recent one. 
“The number of people being displaced right now is at a historic high in Washington state,” said Knab. “January 2025 was the single highest month we’ve ever seen seasonally. February and March were just a hair under that.”
In King County alone, eviction filings in January 2025 were 66% higher than pre-pandemic levels.
“It’s pretty mind-boggling,” he said.
Evictions in Washington have been steadily increasing over the last few years, with no signs of slowing. The spike stems from rising rents coupled with stagnant wages, lack of affordable housing and the expiration of pandemic-era eviction protections such as increased rental assistance. Filings statewide reached an all-time high in 2024, having increased by 53% since 2019. And fiscal year 2025 is on pace to surpass those numbers. 
The increase in evictions is stretching Washington’s Right to Counsel program thin. The statewide program began in 2021 as the first of its kind in the nation, and it’s meant to ensure that low-income tenants have access to legal representation while navigating the eviction process, which greatly increases a person’s likelihood of winning their case and accessing housing resources.
“Until about six months ago, I used to start every presentation on this topic by saying, ‘We’ve represented every single low-income tenant who’s eligible since 2021,’” said Knab, who oversees the state’s Right to Counsel program. “We can’t say that anymore, because we finally got to a point in King County where we couldn’t keep up.”

The uptick in evictions is happening amid a record-setting homelessness crisis, with proposed cuts on the horizon to federally funded safety net programs that help low-income households stay afloat. As of late May, the Trump administration plans to cut the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s rent assistance program for low-income households by around 40%. And a proposal moving through Congress seeks to cut roughly $700 billion from Medicaid, which provides free or reduced health care to those with limited incomes. The cut would impact more than 600,000 Washington residents throughout the state. 
“People can’t afford the rent, and it’s gonna get worse as the federal government cuts Medicaid and other critical safety net services,” said Michele Thomas, the director of policy and advocacy with the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance. 
Housing advocates in Washington hope a newly signed law limiting how much a landlord can increase rent each year will help prevent evictions by ensuring renters aren’t priced out of their units. Washington is the third state to implement rent stabilization statewide, following Oregon and California.
The bill, signed into law by Gov. Bob Ferguson in May, caps yearly rent increases to 7% plus inflation, or 10% – whichever is lower. For mobile home park residents, rent is not allowed to increase more than 5% in a year. Under the new law, which went into effect immediately, landlords are required to provide tenants with 90 days’ notice before raising rent. 
While housing advocates are celebrating the win, Thomas stressed there’s still a long way to go to address the state’s housing affordability crisis.
“It’s not going to keep rents affordable, it’s just going to keep tenants from being (price) gouged,” she said. “There will be tenants who will get rent increases that they can’t afford, and that sets them up for eviction because there’s no place else affordable to move.”
Right to Counsel program strained
The state saw a lull in eviction filings during the height of the pandemic due to local and federal eviction moratoriums and an increase in the availability of rental assistance, according to state data. But as those protections have wound down, evictions have skyrocketed. 
State data shows that eviction filings in 2024 were the highest on record, increasing by nearly 41% from 2023. Eviction filings so far this fiscal year are on pace to once again break that record. 
In places like Clark County, which has the highest eviction rate per capita in the state, nearly 1 in every 300 residents has gone through an eviction proceeding. 
“I think people are unfortunately feeling pretty comfortable with it, and what that means is that the numbers are continuing to go up,” Knab said. 
“Over 30% of the folks that come through eviction court identify as having a disability,” he added. “Over 40% are people of color.”
Some counties, such as King and Kitsap, saw the number of evictions filed more than double from fiscal year 2023 to 2024. Other counties that have seen large percent increases year over year include Douglas, Whatcom, Skagit and Snohomish, according to data from the Office of Civil Legal Aid.
Knab said before the Right to Counsel law was passed in 2021, less than 10% of tenants were represented by a lawyer during an eviction proceeding. Up until recently, they were able to represent nearly all of those eligible. 

While eviction filings continue to increase, outcomes for renters have improved in part due to the program, according to Knab. Since the program began in 2021, 56% of people facing an eviction were allowed to remain in their housing, with the case either being dismissed or resolved through an agreement between the tenant and landlord. His office doesn’t have access to reliable data from before the program was implemented, but he said he’s seen how the program has fundamentally changed the dynamics unfolding in courtrooms across the state.
“The idea of this program, and what it’s been able to do in five years, I think is pretty astounding,” he said.
Sean Flynn, the president and executive director of the Rental Housing Association of Washington, said the Right to Counsel law has extended the time it takes to conduct an eviction, costing property owners more money because of increased legal fees and missed rent payments. The influential advocacy organization lobbies on a local and state level on behalf of property owners, managers and investors.
Before the Right to Counsel program was implemented, evictions were more of a “business transaction” that moved quickly, he said, because many of the cases ended in a default ruling on behalf of the property owner if a person missed their court date. Now, each case is getting “dragged through the courts.”
“Why would you want to keep a tenant in a unit that they can’t afford to pay the rent?” he said. “Nine times out of ten, they don’t have the money, and it’s due to lack of resources. We need better subsidies for the tenants. Keeping someone housed who can’t afford it doesn’t solve the underlying problem.”
Knab pushes back against the narrative he often hears from landlords and lawyers who represent them that the eviction process is too slow and that the Right to Counsel program is to blame. “They will say, ‘You used to be able to give a five-minute pitch and get your writ,’” he said, referring to the formal name of an eviction notice. “And it’s like, well, that’s not how courts are supposed to work.
“If you look at consumer credit or foreclosures, you’re talking years here,” said Knab, who previously worked as a public defender and spent nearly a decade representing low-income tenants in New York City before moving to the Pacific Northwest. “We’re talking not even months, we’re talking weeks (for evictions).”
Early in 2025, Knab’s office started having to triage cases in King County because his office couldn’t keep up with the flood of evictions being filed by landlords. Each eviction filing represents a household, so it can include multiple people.
Priority was given to cases involving disabled tenants, those with language access issues or households with children. “Everyone still got to talk to a lawyer, but the numbers just got too high,” Knab said. “We’re hoping to get back to a place where we can represent everyone.”
He said the long eviction timelines in King County, which at times were as long as 40 weeks, were unacceptable, but he said the flood of eviction filings was to blame, not the Right to Counsel program.
To try to address landlords’ concerns, Knab’s office worked with King County to create an expedited docket for cases where landlords believe tenants pose a health and safety concern. But the “flood of cases” that was alluded to never materialized. Fewer than 10 cases have been expedited under those conditions, he added.
Flynn said the small number of health and safety cases is not because they don’t exist, but because the definition for those cases is too narrow. “We’d like to see that expanded,” he said.
Eviction crisis felt around the state
Hannah Swensen, the managing attorney for the Spokane Housing Justice Project, said the two small firms that represent tenants who qualify for the Right to Counsel program have been able to serve everyone there who’s eligible so far. But it’s become more challenging. 
Spokane County saw a 30% increase in eviction filings from fiscal 2023 to 2024, with 1,544 evictions being filed in the first nine months of this fiscal year. The county has the fourth-highest number of eviction filings in the state, behind King, Pierce and Snohomish counties. 
Last year, Swensen’s team of four full-time lawyers represented 590 eviction-related cases, often hearing between 12-30 cases a day, four days a week. 
To resolve more issues before they land in the courts, they opened an eviction prevention clinic out of the downtown Spokane library.
Twice a month, a tenant can come and get legal advice regarding their housing and learn about the resources that could help stave off an eviction notice, such as disability support or rental assistance. 
An eviction filing, even if a person wins their case, still shows up on a person’s rental history and makes it harder to find housing in the future. The experience can be life-altering, especially for low-income households that receive support from the federal Housing Choice Voucher Program, formerly known as Section 8, Swensen said. Getting an eviction boots them from the program and can make them ineligible for the benefits in the future.
In Washington, 21% of renters are considered extremely low income, with the number of available rental units for this income bracket falling short by 166,912 homes, according to data from the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Renée Rooker, the executive director of the Walla Walla Housing Authority for 33 years, said evictions increased after pandemic-era eviction protections expired and property managers were able to “get rid of the bad actors who just wouldn’t behave and wouldn’t go to the resources in the community that could help them with the rent,” Rooker said. 
The Walla Walla Housing Authority recently stopped taking applications for its Housing Choice Voucher Program for low-income renters because the waitlist was too long. In 2024, only a “handful” of families were pulled off the waitlist, according to Rooker. “We already have a waitlist of 1,200, and when we can’t get to you for three, four or five years, to me, that’s unfair,” she said.
Rooker, whose organization provides housing to around 2,000 households through various subsidized housing programs, said that since the onset of the pandemic, tenants have continued to struggle paying their rent. 
“I don’t know if it’s a mentality of ‘We don’t have to pay the rent or someone will bail us out, or we can live here long enough and we get to live rent free,’” said Rooker, noting that a few local nonprofits offer rental assistance, but there isn’t enough to meet the need. “I don’t know the rationale, but it’s not that they don’t have the income or we wouldn’t have housed them.”
Swensen said she’s never come across a case where a tenant simply didn’t want to pay the rent. It’s one of the many misconceptions she often hears that is far from her typical client.
“It’s vets with disabilities who struggle to get in touch with the resources they need. It’s single moms with kids who have missed only one or two months of rent cause they didn’t get their child support or because of an injury,” Swensen said. “It’s elderly residents who can’t keep up with rent increases because it’s more than their social security can handle.”
“These are the faces of eviction,” she said. 
New rent stabilization law
Deb Wilson, the president of the Leisure Manor Tenants Association, was part of a group of mobile home residents that helped push for passage of the rent stabilization bill. 
For years, the owner of the mobile home park in Aberdeen had been increasing the rent and pricing residents out, often referred to as an “economic eviction.” At one point, residents at the mobile home park were faced with a 55% rent increase. 
“We had several people, probably six or seven, that left within a few months of getting that first rent increase,” recalled Wilson, who has lived in the park since 2015. “They just couldn’t afford it.”
Wilson and her neighbors started meeting regularly in February 2022 to push back against their landlord, ultimately filing hundreds of complaints with the state Attorney General’s Office. Their efforts led to the Attorney General’s Office requiring the owner of the park, Hurst & Son, to reimburse tenants $5.5 million, following a yearslong investigation from Cascade PBS. The results helped inform the rent stabilization bill that lawmakers passed this year, which was hotly debated and ultimately whittled down.
The law includes a handful of situations where a landlord is exempt, including in owner-occupied housing situations, where the owner lives on-site; if the unit is already subsidized as affordable housing through a state or federal program; or if the apartment was recently built. (The unit remains exempt for 12 years.)
“We needed stability, because older folks, especially on fixed income, or young families on fixed incomes, you can’t live day by day, going, ‘Oh my gosh, what is the next rent increase going to be?’” Wilson said. 
Since the bill passed, Wilson and her husband have decided to get a dog. They lost theirs in 2016. “Now we know how much the rent might increase every year, we think we can make it work,” she said.
She said it seems like a small thing, but those things add up. 
“It’s the difference between being able to buy one more medication that you were supposed to be taking, but you couldn’t because you couldn’t afford it,” she said. “It’s going to make a huge difference.”
Flynn, who lobbied against the rent stabilization bill, fears the new law will have unintended consequences for property owners and the overall housing market, leading to a “slow bleed” of small to medium-sized landlords getting out of the rental business because it’s no longer as profitable. 
He also believes the new law will drive down housing quality because landlords will be less able to keep up with maintenance costs if they aren’t able to increase rents by more than 10% each year. The law might also disincentivize developers from building if the profit margins are decreased too low while expenses, including insurance and construction costs, continue to increase. 
Jeffrey Gustaveson, a staff member with the Aberdeen-based nonprofit Firelands Workers United, is grateful the rent stabilization bill passed, but he says even the 7% rent increase plus inflation allowed under the cap would be crippling for a family living paycheck to paycheck.
“That can be a couple thousand dollars a year for a family living on the edge,” Gustaveson said, whose organization focuses on improving access to health care, affordable housing, child care and good-paying jobs in Grays Harbor and Pacific counties. 
“The drum I’m beating right now is that these rent caps are a serious win and will actually prevent eviction, which was the whole point of the policy,” he said. “It’s not a perfect policy, and no one at any point said that it was going to be the solution to the housing crisis.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25108837654542-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 08:09:34.853824

(Photo via Florida Sugar Growers Co-op)In 1960, the TV show “The Twilight Zone” aired an irony-soaked episode called “Eye of the Beholder” that played around with the axiom about where beauty truly lies. In it, a bunch of grotesque doctors try to make a gorgeous woman (played by Donna Douglas from “The Beverly Hillbillies”) look like them, because conformity matters more than anything to their grotesque leader.
I was reminded of this episode last week while reading up on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Congress has been debating.
In case you haven’t heard about OBBBA and how controversial it is, consider this: Despite being strongly endorsed by our own grotesque leader, the bill squeaked through the House of Representatives by a single vote. Now it goes over to the Senate, where it’s liable to face even more opposition. I sure hope it does, anyway.
This “beautiful” bill contains a lot of ugliness. It will add trillions to the federal deficit, news that led to none other than Elon Musk calling it an abomination. It slashes food stamps for seniors to give billionaires a tax cut. And it makes such drastic changes to Medicaid that it’s led to a dispute in Iowa over how many people will die.
But what grabbed my attention is the really big favor it includes for Florida’s Big Sugar.
The feds already prop up our sugar industry with expensive government subsidies. This bill boosts that subsidy even higher, from 19.75 cents per pound to 24 cents per pound.
Bear in mind that the sugar industry produces about 8 trillion tons of sugar every year. A hike of a nickel on a pound of sugar equals an awful lot of dough.
  Eve Samples via Friends of the Everglades
“It’s egregious that this polluting industry — which Florida taxpayers have paid well over $2 billion to clean up after — is poised to reap even more profits if this budget bill passes the U.S. Senate,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades.
Samples questioned how boosting the profits of the sugar industry fits in with the goals of an administration that says it’s going to “Make America Healthy Again.”
Maybe in this case the slogan should be altered to “Make Big Sugar’s Profits Healthy.”
 Protected at every level
The sugar industry may be headquartered in South Florida, but it’s long been king in both Tallahassee and Washington.
“This industry is protected at every level,” Samples said.
For instance, take its horrible air pollution.
From October to May every year, Florida’s sugar companies burn their 400,000 acres of fields to prepare for harvest, thus getting rid of the outer leaves of the cane stalks.
It’s an old-fashioned practice that other countries have banned. So much burning sends billows of thick smoke floating across the little towns by Lake Okeechobee, showering down what residents refer to as “black snow” that coats their houses and cars and the lungs of the unlucky.
Four years ago, the Florida Legislature passed a bill — with support from both parties — that makes it much harder for anyone harmed by all this soot to sue the sugar industry.
Gov. Ron DeSantis, when he was a congressman, repeatedly voted against federal price supports for the sugar industry. When he moved into the governor’s mansion in 2019, he called for all the members of the South Florida Water Management District board to resign for being too pro-sugar.
But when the Legislature handed DeSantis its bill to protect the sugar industry against suits over its burning practices, he signed it into law without a word of protest.
Or take water pollution. Twenty years ago, the industry deployed 40 lobbyists — picture an army marching in bespoke suits and Italian loafers — to persuade lawmakers to extend the deadline for cleaning up Everglades pollution from 2006 to 2026.
The bill sailed through, and then-Gov. Jeb “Punctuation Marks Are Cool!” Bush — a self-described Everglades advocate — signed it behind closed doors.
The industry controls these politicians so utterly that if sugar executives demanded they line up and start dancing to the old Archies hit “Sugar Sugar,” they’d say, “Sweet!”
 Money makes the world go ’round
The main reason Big Sugar always gets what it wants is that it’s ready to spend Big Bucks to get it. As the song from “Cabaret” put it so well, “Money makes the world go around!”
According to the Dirty Money Project database created by the folks at the Vote Water environmental group, between 2018 and 2024 Florida’s sugar industry spent $36 million on Florida political contributions.
  Alfonso Fanjul and Jose Francisco “Pepe” Fanjul via the Florida Agricultural Hall of Fame)
In the past year alone, Big Sugar gave more than $5.2 million to Florida politicians, including $3.1 million donated by U.S. Sugar, $2.1 million donated by Florida Crystals, and just over $43,000 by the Sugar Co-op.
Acting like an always-available ATM has its advantages. Access, for example.
On Presidents’ Day in 1996, Bill Clinton was busy breaking up with Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office when the phone rang. The caller: Sugar magnate Alfonso Fanjul Jr., of Florida Crystals.
Clinton spent 20 minutes on the phone with him, listening to Fanjul complaining. The sugar baron was upset about Vice President Al Gore’s proposal of a penny-a-pound tax on Florida sugar growers to pay for cleaning up the Everglades. After that phone call, Clinton shelved the plan.
Incidentally, the Dirty Money website shows that the company Fanjul runs with his brother Pepe, Florida Crystals, donated $1 million last year to the super-PAC known as Make America Great Again Inc. You can probably guess which grotesque presidential candidate it supported.
The industry has already seen a benefit, Patrick Ferguson of the Sierra Club told me. Three years ago, former President Joe Biden banned imports from a sugar company based in the Dominican Republic named Central Romana over evidence the company used forced labor, i.e. slaves.
Central Romana is run by the Fanjuls, and in March the current administration quietly removed the Biden ban. Maybe they count “being concerned about slavery” as being in favor of DEI. Can’t have that!
It’s not just politicians who reap the benefits of sugar’s bucks. In the 1960s, the sugar industry paid Harvard scientists to produce research that played down the connection between sugar and heart disease. Instead, they shifted the blame to saturated fat.
One of the scientists paid by the sugar industry went on to become head of nutrition at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He helped draft the forerunner to the federal government’s dietary guidelines.
That’s why environmental advocates weren’t at all surprised to see Big Sugar included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“Big Sugar is once again getting gifts they really don’t deserve,” Ferguson said.
 Up goes the price
Sugar has been getting special treatment from the federal government since the days when Alexander Hamilton was a real guy and not a smash Broadway show.
In 1789, Congress imposed a tariff on imported sugar to raise revenue for the struggling young nation. It was the first substantive legislation passed by the young nation, and it was signed into law by the first president, George Washington.
Despite that connection to our Founding Fathers, you know who’s been the most critical of federal policy on propping up Big Sugar? Right-wing think tanks like the Cato Institute. Eight years ago, Cato published a paper titled, “Candy-Coasted Cartel: Time to Kill the U.S. Sugar Program.”
When I talked to him this week, the author of that Cato paper, Colin Grabow, pointed out something about the OBBBA’s nickel-per-pound boost for Big Sugar that hadn’t occurred to me:
“This is basically raising the cost of sugar in the United States,” he said. “We just had an election where people were complaining about the cost of things.”
Yeah, I told him, I recall a lot of people fussing over the price of eggs before going to the polls in November.
“Now, instead of reforming the system,” Grabow said, “we’re just going to hand them more money and make sugar more expensive.”
I heard similar points from Vincent Smith of the equally right-wing American Enterprise Institute. The boost called for by the bill is “a pretty dramatic increase,” he said.
That will make all the goods that contain sugar — soft drinks, cookies, cake, applesauce, cereal, you name it — cost more as well. As an avid consumer of Publix sweet tea, hearing this made me do a classic spit-take.
Smith joked that making sugar and its related products so much more expensive may be good news for dentists but not for family pocketbooks.
  Colin Grabow via the Cato Institute
Grabow pointed out, “You can bet that the language related to sugar in the bill is directly due to lobbyists.’
 What do the senators say?
I tried contacting officials from the sugar companies about all this, but I just couldn’t sweet-talk them into speaking with me.
The closest I got to a quote was this statement from Ryan Duffy, senior director of corporate communications for U.S. Sugar, who told me via email, “We typically don’t comment on pending legislation.”
Of course, the more important folks to talk to would be our two senators. Everyone wants to find out where they stand on the Big Bad Wolf — er, I mean, One Big Beautiful Bill. But they didn’t respond to my requests for comment either.
Our senior senator, Rick Scott, has a long history of being tucked in Big Sugar’s hip pocket. Last year, when he was running for re-election, the sugar companies made big donations to his campaign’s super-PAC.
In his story on those donations, my colleague Mitch Perry pointed out the hypocrisy of Scott’s pro-sugar stance. When he first ran for governor 15 years ago, he blasted his GOP primary opponent, Bill McCollum, for accepting contributions from Big Sugar.
“He’s owned by U.S. Sugar,” the Orlando Sentinel quoted Scott saying of McCollum. “They’ve given him nearly a million dollars for his campaign. And it’s disgusting.”
Scott apparently thought it was a lot less disgusting when Big Sugar’s big payouts were going into his coffers, not McCollum’s. He hasn’t turned down a dime from them since.
In fact, as governor, Scott was one of quite a few Republican officials who accepted hunting trips to Texas from a sugar company, then declined to answer reporters’ questions about it.
Yet Scott says he has serious qualms about the One Big Beautiful Etc. He doesn’t believe it cuts enough federal fat, so he says he’s inclined to reject it.
  U.S. Sen. Rick Scott (photo via the Scott campaign)
“I think there’s plenty of us would not vote for it in the Senate,” he said, according to CBS News.
Then we come to Florida’s newest senator, the recently appointed Ashley Moody. When she was Florida’s elected attorney general, the former Plant City Strawberry Festival queen was no friend to the environment. She also fought several absurd legal battles on the behalf of Mr. Grotesque. So far, she hasn’t indicated whether she’s in the same position as Scott or not.
If you’re inclined to bang your head against the wall, I’d encourage you to call or email these two and demand they stop this giveaway to a polluting industry. But bear in mind, they may not listen to you.
After all, the more money the sugar companies rake in, the more they can give away to our elected officials. That’s right — by boosting their profits, we’re enabling the sugar companies to continue to spend so freely on buying the favors of our politicians.
But I do have suggestion. If Scott and Moody say, “The heck with my constituents!” and vote to pass this bill for Big Sugar, I think every single one of us should send them our grocery bills, demanding a refund.
A tsunami of grocery store receipts inundating the senators’ offices would be, I think, a beautiful thing to behold.

Mike Braun speaks to a crowd at Moontown Brewing Company in Whitesville after nabbing the Republican nomination for governor on May 7, 2024. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The principal campaign committee that supported Indiana Gov. Mike Braun through his U.S. Senate tenure has recast itself into a “nonconnected” political action committee (PAC).
That means it supports or opposes more than one federal candidate and isn’t a separate segregated fund or party committee.
Braun’s campaign arm declined to answer questions on why the changes were made or how the PAC plans to spend its money. Kevin Broghamer, who was listed as the entity’s treasurer and designated agent, did not reply to a request for comment.
In the amended statement of organization filed May 12, Mike Braun for Indiana renamed itself the Freedom and Opportunity Fund.

Such a conversion “is not uncommon,” per Brendan Glavin of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that tracks and analyzes campaign finance and lobbying data.
Glavin, a director of insights, noted President Donald Trump did the same with his principal campaign committees after the 2020 and 2024 elections.
“The (federal) Braun campaign had no money left over, and there is no issue with coordination since the (federal) campaign no longer exists,” he said. The entity ended March with about $11,000 cash on hand, according to a quarterly filing dated April 15. 
It’s an alternative to simply terminating old committees, according to Federal Election Commission guidance for conversions to multicandidate committees. Both Glavin and FEC spokesman Myles Martin directed the Capital Chronicle to it.
The Freedom and Opportunity Fund is listed as a nonqualified PAC, not a multicandidate committee.
Those must have been registered with the FEC for at least six months, received contributions from at least 51 entities and contributed to at least five federal candidates, according to the agency. Multicandidate committees can contribute up to $5,000 per candidate per election.
Looking back — and ahead
Mike Braun for Indiana, the principal campaign committee, popped into existence in August 2017, according to an FEC filing — about three months before its namesake resigned from the Indiana General Assembly to run for U.S. Senate.
It supported Braun during his bid, which he won in 2018, and throughout his six-year tenure in Washington, D.C.
But almost five months ago, when his U.S. Senate term ended and he took office as Indiana’s leader, the committee became obsolete.
To convert itself, a committee must amend its statements of organization to change its title — candidate names aren’t allowed — and change the committee type, according to the FEC.
In the filing, Braun’s committee became the Freedom and Opportunity Fund, with the box for a nonconnected PAC also ticked. Braun has used the “freedom and opportunity” tagline throughout his speeches as governor and used it to title his first-term agenda.

Other information that has changed must also be updated. For example, the PAC swapped out treasurers, changed its physical and digital addresses and ditched a longstanding collection of affiliated entities that were listed in past statements of organization.
“After the conversion, the committee remains responsible for resolving any outstanding obligations, such as debts and unrefunded impermissible contributions,” the FEC continued.
The PAC still owes nearly $500,000 from loans Braun made to his federal campaigns in 2018 and 2024, according to the first quarter filing.
It also ended the previous year with a balance in the red by nearly $2,000, but in a May 5 filing, former Treasurer Thomas Datwyler assured the FEC that several uncleared checks meant the bank account never went negative or was overdrawn.

Despite the rhetoric from both Democrats and Republicans, the people who keep freight moving – the engineers, conductors, car inspectors, and signal maintainers, were left standing at the station once again.
Assembly Bill 446, a bill shaped by rail labor and safety experts, should have sailed through. It proposed common-sense measures: limits on train length, minimum crew requirements, better lighting in railyards, oversight of contract carriers, and functional defect detectors. These were not radical demands. They were safeguards forged from decades of experience and, in many cases, tragedy. But instead of passing legislation to protect workers and communities, lawmakers threw up roadblocks. A fiscal note from the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada didn’t clarify cost, it inflated it. It was less about what AB446 would require, and more about what the agency wanted to avoid.
We have heard all the excuses before. But this time, it was not just Republican opposition. It was Democrats too. The same ones who have claimed to champion labor, who have stood on union stages during campaign season and nodded along while we talked about precision scheduled railroading (PSR), fatigue, and unsafe practices. They nodded, then turned around and did nothing. Again.
If this feels familiar, it is because it is. It was only a few years ago that President Biden and Congress imposed a contract on railroad workers, denying them the right to strike after years of being overworked and under-protected. It was the so-called “most pro-labor administration in history.” But when push came to shove, labor was shoved aside.
Now, in Nevada, a state where rail labor has long played a role in shaping public policy, those same patterns are emerging. Lawmakers, many of whom we have supported cycle after cycle, abandoned us when it counted. And I do not want to be the one to say “we told you so,” but at some point, it becomes impossible not to.
There is a bigger story here than a single bill. This is about the slow erosion of labor’s power in Nevada. While unions fight to hold the line, corporate lobbyists wine, dine, and whisper their way into influence. Big business does not just want a seat at the table anymore. They want the table, the chairs, and the menu. If labor does not start pushing back, and soon, we will be on the outside looking in for good.
This moment should be a wake-up call. It is not enough to endorse candidates and hope they do the right thing. Labor in Nevada needs to remember its muscle. We need to show up louder, smarter, and more unified. We need to stop handing over endorsements and donations without demands. And we need to hold every lawmaker accountable, regardless of party, who sides with corporate interests over worker safety.
To be clear, some lawmakers did express support. A few backed the bill and spoke up, even as the rail lobby quietly moved behind the scenes. But good intentions were drowned out by indifference, misinformation, and political convenience. And in the end, those who supported the bill were left holding the bag.
This is not just about rail labor. It is about emergency vehicles stuck at blocked crossings. It is about toxic chemicals rolling through our communities on nearly three-mile-long freight trains with no crew oversight. It is about rail yards so poorly lit that workers have tripped and been injured just doing their jobs. What protects us protects you too. And when lawmakers choose silence over safety, we all pay the price.
Rail labor will keep fighting. We do not have the luxury of giving up. But we are not going to keep playing nice while lawmakers play political games with our lives. We are organizing.

Some members of the Lapeer District Library Board have also been working to craft a policy to keep certain materials out of children’s hands without running afoul of the law.
The effort stretches back several years to 2023, as community members sought to have several books pulled from library shelves.
Susan Hough, a member of the steering committee of Fight 4 the First, which advocates against censorship within the library district, said many of the books challenged deal with gender or LGBTQ issues.
Among those books was the award-winning “Gender Queer: A Memoir,” a frequently challenged graphic novel which details author Maia Kobabe’s coming of age tale as a person who identifies as nonbinary and asexual.
The source of the challenge stems from its inclusion of some drawings depicting nude characters and sexual scenarios, prompting opponents to label it pornographic.
Lapeer County Prosecutor John Miller suggested he might file criminal charges against employees or library officials if the book was not pulled from shelves. However, Amy Churchill, who was serving as the director of the library at the time, retained the ACLU of Michigan as legal counsel. The organization sent Miller a letter warning that taking action would threaten First Amendment freedoms, and violate his ethical duties as a prosecutor. When the challenge against the book was rejected, Miller took no action. 
In the years since that incident, candidates with a conservative ideology have come to hold a majority of seats on the nonpartisan board, with some new members carrying ties to the initial book challenges.
In February, Hough said members of Fight 4 the First Lapeer uncovered a memo while reviewing the board’s public records responding to a request for an opinion on policies to restrict access to certain books, including proposals to move certain children’s books to an adult section, or putting certain books behind glass or the circulation desk, requiring a patron to ask for access.
20FEB2025 Legal Memo Regarding Book Restrictions
Anne Seurynk, an attorney with the Foster Swift law firm who the board had retained as counsel, warned that adopting any of the proposals would place the library on “at best, shaky Constitutional ground” and would put the library at risk of being sued and losing. That could saddle the district with the cost of its own attorneys fees and the fees of their legal challenger.
Seurynk also served as corporate counsel for the Cromaine District Library, providing them with a similar notice regarding its own efforts to sequester controversial materials.
 During a meeting of the Lapeer Tea Party in March, the board’s Vice Chair John DeAngelis and Secretary Peggy Brotzke discussed efforts to limit the materials children can access.
DeAngelis was unable to offer details on what these restrictions would look like, but told attendees that the board would be consulting with its attorney on the issue. He later offered a rough timeline of six months for presenting potential options.
“We don’t want to get sued. We don’t want to burn up our funds in attorney fees,” DeAngelis said.“We want to do it the right way, so it will take some time. It won’t happen overnight.”
DeAngelis and Brotzke did not respond to a request for an interview prior to publication, nor did board Chair Kari Kohlman.
DeAngelis during the Board’s March meeting put forward a motion to replace Foster Swift with a local firm, Rickard, Denney, Leichliter, Childers & Bosch, with DeAngelis saying he would like to use local counsel to keep the board’s money within the community. The motion passed with support from Kohlman, DeAngelis, Brotzke and Trustee Carol Brown, despite protest from former board chair Bill Marquardt and treasurer Perry Valle.
On its website, Rickard, Denney, Leichliter, Childers & Bosch describes its legal practice as “advising and assisting individuals, churches, and other religious organizations in defending and taking full advantage of their religious freedom under federal and state law.” Other areas of practice include general civil litigation, representing individuals with small to medium-sized businesses, estate planning, real estate matters, zoning issues and other issues of land use.
Based on Brotzke’s information request for the library’s collections policy during her first board meeting in February, Hough expects to see proposals to amend the district’s collection policy soon. The board’s next meeting is set for June 19, with Fight 4 the First Lapeer planning to hold a “Read-In for Freedom” at DeAngeli Library the same day. 
The group held a similar rally in mid-May prior to a board meeting that ended up being canceled due to a lack of a quorum.

Although Brotzke and DeAngelis focused their concerns on protecting children and ensuring they are unable to access inappropriate materials, Hough said the question of what is appropriate varies from person to person.
“That’s why we have library professionals who have been highly trained in child development and in literacy and in book selection, who use many tools, including professional reviews, publisher’s reviews, etc., as well as their own personal knowledge to select books and place them in – what are considered by a professional – an appropriate place in the library,” Hough said.
When it comes to determining whether a book belongs in a library, Hough said she preferred to trust the professionals.
“I don’t know about you, but I prefer to let my medical doctor guide me in medical decisions, and I prefer to let my attorney guide me in legal decisions. And I believe library professionals have the training and the expertise to guide us in what’s appropriate,” Hough said. 
Hough further noted that libraries legally cannot have obscene materials on their shelves.
While the Foster Swift memo makes clear that placing restrictions on materials could violate the U.S. Constitution, there’s no such thing as First Amendment police, Hough said. That means there’s no defense against these types of policies unless community members and free speech organizations are watching and willing to respond.
Should the board move forward with the policies and face legal consequences, Hough raised concerns about how that could impact funding for Lapeer libraries.
“That’s money that should be used to provide materials for our community, provide services, because it’s way beyond books” Hough said, pointing to  other benefits like internet access and community programs.“There’s just so much in our library that enriches the community, and all of these attacks are going to end up having fiscal outcomes.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.I’ve been a Minnesota sports fan my whole life, so I know false hope. Every year, at least one of our teams shows signs of championship form, only to see that promise wiped out in some new, heartbreaking fashion. (Thank goodness for the Frost and Lynx.) 
Unfortunately, I worry Minnesota workers are now in a similarly tenuous position — on the brink of meaningful progress, but susceptible to a sudden loss.
That’s the conclusion reached in the latest State of Working Minnesota, an annual look at the status of working people in the North Star State. Over the past year, working families have made significant strides, including record-high job numbers and a record-low uninsured rate. But like a Minnesota team on the precipice of glory, there are reasons to worry. Federal policies advanced by the Trump administration, Elon Musk and congressional Republicans could undo years of growth for working Minnesotans.
Let’s start with the good news. In 2024, Minnesota added more than 40,000 jobs, outpacing gains from the previous year. Construction, education, health services and government jobs led the way —sectors that are vital to both our economy and our communities. 

The state’s unemployment rate remained low, while labor force participation rates stayed high, indicating a relatively large portion of the state is trying to work and finding work. Gains have been particularly strong for certain groups. In a dramatic turnaround, Minnesota now boasts the lowest Black unemployment rate in the Midwest after having the region’s highest rate during the Great Recession. Among prime working-age adults (25 to 54), Minnesota has the second-highest labor force participation rate in the nation.

At the same time, the North Star State made real headway in tackling economic inequality. In 2024, the gap between high and low earners fell to a 25-year low. We’ve enjoyed a 56% decline in the share of Minnesota workers earning poverty-level wages over the past ten years. More than half of Latino workers took home wages that put them below the poverty line in 2014, whereas today it is just 16%.  

One explanation for these gains: Organized labor is showing signs of resurgence in Minnesota. Countering a decades-long decline, union membership jumped nearly 7% in 2024. Women led the way, with unionization among female workers rising 20%. The state’s workers are also demonstrating an increased interest in unions. The past two years saw the most union elections in nearly two decades, and these elections had a higher success rate than at any point since 2000. These wins are more than symbolic: Union workers in Minnesota now earn a median wage 20% higher than their non-union peers.

Minnesotans are finding family-sustaining jobs, and they are safer while working. In 2024, Minnesota posted the lowest rate of workplace fatalities in the Midwest. Outside of the workplace, our uninsured rate hit a historic low of 4%, the fourth lowest in the nation, and a 52% decline since 2013. A big part of this drop can be attributed to the rising number of Minnesotans getting health coverage through Medical Assistance, which is what we call our Medicaid program. Contrary to the stereotype of this care going to people who are not working, working families have come to increasingly rely on Medical Assistance.

To be sure, there are plenty of areas where more work is needed. Minnesota’s gender wage gap grew in 2024, with Minnesota women making approximately 81 cents on the male dollar. While the state can claim one of the highest rates of employer-provided health coverage in the country, we also suffer  the nation’s largest level of racial inequality in this coverage. 

Ultimately, the gains made for Minnesota’s workers indicate a state moving in the right direction, as well as the need for further investments to address these outstanding issues. 
By contrast, federal policy changes portend a full-scale reversal to benefit the rich at the expense of working Minnesotans. 
Republican plans to cut Medicaid to partially pay for tax cuts for the wealthy would decimate health care for working people, with particularly strong impacts in communities of color and rural areas. Federal cuts promoted by the richest man in the history of the world have targeted key areas of job growth in Minnesota: education, health, and construction jobs to build a green future. And, the Trump administration has made no secret of its desire to weaken unions, undermining one of the most effective tools workers have for raising wages and protecting benefits.
As Minnesota sports fans, we’re used to heartbreak we don’t control. We can’t make the kick go through the uprights or hit the game-winning three. 
But when it comes to public policy, we’re not just spectators. Lawmakers — and the public who hold them accountable — have a real say in what happens next. 
The progress made by Minnesota workers in 2024 didn’t happen by chance; it was the result of deliberate policy choices, robust public investments, and strong labor protections. 
We may not be able to change the score on the field, but we can still fight for a future where that kind of progress isn’t easily undone.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/P1024031-1024x683-1.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 07:02:20.155822

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Six years ago, New Jersey legislators expanded the statute of limitations for survivors of sexual assault, responding to a wave of victims looking for justice years or even decades after abuse at the hands of predatory clergy, Boy Scout leaders, and others entrusted to care for children.
But the state has found itself increasingly in victims’ crosshairs as they seek justice for sexual abuse they suffered in the government’s custody, from foster care to state-run homes.
Officials paid more than $23 million to settle over a dozen of these complaints last year. They were among 332 payouts, totaling almost $178 million, that the state made in 2024 to resolve legal claims involving state employees, agencies, and property, according to records the New Jersey Monitor obtained under the Open Public Records Act.
Two of the largest payments in 2024 — $12 million and $6.8 million — went to women for sexual abuse they endured in foster placements, one dating back to 1987 and the other to 1963. The women said they reported the abuse while still in the care of their molesters, but child welfare workers did little to investigate and just moved them to other foster homes where they encountered new abusers.
Spokespeople from the state Department of Children and Families did not respond to a request for comment.
Several men received settlements for sexual abuse they endured while in state-run homes decades ago.
One said four male employees and two male residents at the New Lisbon Developmental Center, a state-run home in Burlington County for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, sexually assaulted him starting in 1950, when he was 8 years old, until he aged out of the system at 18. He received a $3.5 million payout. Another man who alleged he was abused at New Lisbon, where he was placed in 1987 at age 8, received $99,000 to settle his lawsuit.
Abuse also occurred at the now-shuttered Arthur Brisbane Child Treatment Center in Monmouth County, according to a man who said he was 13 in 1983 when an employee there began molesting him. That employee, Thomas Grisard, was later convicted, and the state paid the victim $750,000 last year to resolve his lawsuit.
Beyond those cases, public transit continued to fuel the most lawsuits against the state, with complaints lodged about passengers injured in bus and rail accidents, workers hurt on the job, and pedestrians and bicyclists injured or killed by NJ Transit buses. People also sued over medical malpractice at public hospitals, faulty roads and bridges, workplace discrimination and harassment, mistreatment by police and prison guards, and civil rights violations.
The $177.9 million the state paid to settle lawsuits last year was $56 million more than it paid in 2023 to resolve 364 claims and the highest since 2021, when 287 lawsuits cost the state $196 million.
Thirty-five cases cost the state $1 million or more, representing 73% of the total disbursed. The largest payout — $12.5 million — went to Shelley Pritchett, a former correctional officer for the Juvenile Justice Commission who said her bosses forced her to resign after she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
Plenty of people settled for peanuts, too, with the smallest payout, $150, going to an East Orange man who said he was hurt when another car hit the NJ Transit bus in which he was riding.
Cases that resulted in payouts last year include:

Dion Miller, who spent 20 years in prison for an elderly neighbor’s murder. Miller maintained his innocence and was exonerated in 2023. The state paid him $995,000 to settle his lawsuit.
Scott Lupia was a locomotive engineer who alerted his supervisors to a broken air conditioner in his cab one sultry day in July 2020. His bosses ordered him to continue working even though temperatures hit 114 degrees in his cab, according to his suit. He passed out at the controls 40 minutes after leaving Penn Station, hitting his head and suffering career-ending injuries, the suit says. The state paid him almost $12.4 million after he won his case at trial.
Zenaida Gonzalez received $4 million after child welfare workers took her baby because she was struggling with an abusive partner and mental health challenges. The baby, Alison Chavez, was 16 months old when she died in 2012 of head trauma while in a foster home.
Donald Turner Jr., a public works employee in Hawthorne, got $3.9 million after a pedestrian bridge where he was clearing snow in March 2019 collapsed onto the roadway below, and he was seriously injured.
Two women who reached out to a state-run crime victim compensation office for help filed lawsuits after an employee sexually harassed them. The state paid one $424,000 and another $400,000 over their claims that Guilherme Jamarino, an employee who was later criminally charged, sent them sexually explicit pictures and videos of himself.
Jasmine Roach received $500,000 for the 2014 sexual assault and murder of her 9-year-old daughter at the hands of a paroled sex offender.
Muhammad Muslih and his family got $3.5 million after computers, cash, jewelry, and more that Montclair police seized from their home during a 2019 search went missing when the family tried to retrieve it after resolving the accusations against them.

 The state made money too

While millions flowed out in lawsuit payouts, almost $430 million went back into state coffers due to the civil enforcement work of the state’s attorneys.
Attorney General Matt Platkin said successful settlements involved environmental cases, consumer issues, taxation matters, and debt recovery actions.
“We’ve stopped scams, halted questionable business practices, and made polluters pay—and in the process we’ve returned hundreds of millions of dollars back to the State and our residents,” Platkin said in a statement. “These results translate into a better quality of life for all New Jerseyans. I will always fight to make sure that costly and damaging misconduct is corrected, whether that stems from polluters, consumer fraud, or others who engage in unlawful business practices.”
The amount recovered last year fell from 2023, when Platkin’s office recouped nearly $600 million. Among 2024’s largest recoveries:

The chemical company Solvay Specialty Polymers USA paid $179.8 million for remediation and natural resource damages stemming from contamination at its Gloucester County facility.
The state received $125 million from Orsted after the wind energy company abandoned plans to build two offshore wind projects in New Jersey’s coastal waters.
New Jersey will get more than $30 million as part of a $700 million nationwide settlement with Johnson & Johnson to resolve complaints stemming from its marketing of talc-based baby powder.
The state received $18.5 million in compensation for groundwater contaminated by the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerNational anti-abortion advocates and two Vermont-based crisis pregnancy centers have dropped a 2023 federal lawsuit against the state over a law passed the same year that made the centers, specifically, subject to existing state laws targeting false and misleading advertising. The two centers, and others like them around the country, provide counseling and some basic obstetrics from an anti-abortion perspective.The end of the case came just two weeks after lawmakers made substantial changes to the legal language that prompted the suit in the first place. Gov. Phil Scott signed the changes into law on May 13 as part of a broader package that supporters say will bolster protections for reproductive and gender-affirming health care in the state.The legal group spearheading the suit, Alliance Defending Freedom, claimed in a press release last week that lawmakers amended the 2023 measure — which passed with overwhelming House and Senate support — “as a result” of the group’s litigation. But in interviews this week, legislative leaders said that framing wasn’t accurate.The lawsuit’s plaintiffs included Aspire Now, a pregnancy center in Williston; Branches Pregnancy Resource Center, another in Brattleboro; and National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a nationwide anti-abortion advocacy nonprofit. Lawyers for the plaintiffs described the 2023 law as “viewpoint discrimination” against the centers. They argued it ran afoul of protections granted by the First Amendment and impinged on the centers’ ability to effectively serve people seeking their support.House Majority Leader Rep. Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction, seen on the opening day of the Legislature at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Jan. 8, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerPro-abortion rights advocates, including backers of the 2023 law, have accused crisis pregnancy centers of advertising in a misleading way that lures in patients considering an abortion in hopes of persuading them to change course once they’re in the door.Some of what the plaintiffs took issue with in the 2023 law came in several pages of legislative “findings,” including the assertion that some crisis pregnancy centers “have promoted patently false or biased medical claims about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, and reproductive health care providers.” The law went on to state that a crisis pregnancy center whose advertising was “untrue or clearly designed to mislead the public about the nature of services provided” would be liable for committing “an unfair and deceptive act and practice in commerce.”But the measure enacted last month stripped from state law the specific references to crisis pregnancy centers added two years ago. It also nixed lawmakers’ findings that the centers sometimes provide misleading or outright inaccurate information.Attorney General Charity Clark discusses a settlement between Vermont and 42 other states with Johnson & Johnson, a company that made baby powder with talc in it, during a press conference in Montpelier on June 11, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerInstead, the new law replaced references to the pregnancy centers with more general language stating “any person” who makes false or misleading claims about health care services they provide is subject to the existing laws designed to protect consumers.While lawyers for the centers said the changes were prompted by their lawsuit, Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast — who co-sponsored this year’s law and chairs the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, which reviewed it — disputed that.Lyons said in an interview Tuesday that she thought it was a good idea to broaden the language passed in 2023 to encompass more health care providers than just crisis pregnancy centers — but that idea had nothing to do with the legal challenge. She said she had concerns that preceded the lawsuit with how the language approved in 2023 singled out one type of health care provider. “I’m very glad that we did it. But it was not in response to a lawsuit,” said Lyons, who also helmed the same committee in 2023, speaking about the changes in this year’s law, S.28. “We want to ensure that anyone who is working in this arena has high ethical standards — and adheres to those ethical standards.”She also noted crisis pregnancy centers would still be subject to false and misleading advertising statutes under the latest law, even though they aren’t named explicitly.Vermont House Majority Leader Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction, who chaired the House Health Care Committee in 2023 and still sits on the panel this year, also pushed back against the characterization that the changes were prompted by the lawsuit, saying, “I do not agree with it at all.”Houghton added that legislators heard testimony from a number of different witnesses about the changes — some for, and others against — before approving them. Supporters included Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, which wrote in a late March memo to the House committee that it was “pleased to see these standards elevated for all medical professionals.”The majority leader noted, though, she was “personally disappointed” that some of the legislative “findings” about crisis pregnancy centers were removed from the law this year. Alliance Defending Freedom did not respond to a request for comment this week about its decision to drop the lawsuit. The conservative, Christian legal group is based in Arizona and played a key role in the successful effort to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. Crisis pregnancy centers have expanded their reach in recent years as abortion clinics have been shuttering at the same time. The centers ramped up activity after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. Without a nationwide right to an abortion and with dozens of states outlawing or restricting access to the procedure, the centers have proliferated to fill the void. With that expanded reach, though, has come intensifying scrutiny of the facilities, particularly for their advertising strategies. There are seven such facilities in Vermont, according to the Crisis Pregnancy Center Map, a project of the University of Georgia.Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark’s office had been defending the state in the lawsuit. Clark wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday she was “pleased” the suit had been pulled.She also signalled support for the changes enacted this month, saying that when she testified to legislators as the 2023 law was being written, she supported “a broader bill that more closely aligns with the changes” legislators made recently.“I will always support strong consumer protection laws that prohibit lying, misrepresentation, and obfuscation across all sectors of Vermont’s economy,” Clark wrote.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Anti-abortion advocates drop federal lawsuit against Vermont after lawmakers nix language targeting crisis pregnancy centers.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ginny-lyons-1-20250416-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-05 07:02:20.155822

Tony Vargas has endorsed nonprofit co-founder and business owner Denise Powell in her bid for Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.
The endorsement comes a day after Omaha State Sen. John Cavanaugh declared his candidacy for the seat on Wednesday, the same day Powell hosted a campaign kick-off event.

The Vargas endorsement also followed Cavanaugh saying he has a “stronger record of being a leader in the Legislature” than Vargas. 
Vargas, a Democrat who represented South Omaha in the Legislature and on the Omaha Public Schools board, narrowly lost twice to U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., with the 2024 margin being less than two percentage points.  
“Denise’s leadership and proven record of bringing people together to solve our toughest problems is why I’m proud to support her campaign for Congress,” Vargas said. 
Powell said she wants to build on the energy and enthusiasm Vargas brought to his House races.
“It is a tremendous honor to have the support of a dedicated public servant, leader and friend like Tony Vargas,” Powell said. 
Powell already has secured endorsements from some Cavanaugh colleagues in the Legislature from Omaha’s State Sens. Margo Juarez and Dunixi Guereca, and other elected officials in the district, which includes all of Douglas and Saunders Counties and parts of suburban Sarpy County. Cavanaugh’s new campaign has yet to announce any endorsements.

Powell and Cavanaugh are the two highest-profile Democratic candidates in the race so far. Also running are Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis.
Powell is running as an outsider, but she has the support of some top local Democratic donors from her time leading the nonpartisan nonprofit Women Who Run, a group that encouraged more women to consider running for office and equipped them with the tools to do so.
Cavanaugh is part of a local political dynasty, seeking to follow his father into the same 2nd District seat he held in the late 1970s. His sister, State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh, serves in the Legislature alongside him.
In her statement responding to Cavanaugh’s announcement, Powell didn’t mention the senator by name but said, “Nebraskans deserve better than lip service from career politicians.”
“I’m running to bring courage and common sense back to DC,” Powell said in the statement. 
She also received the endorsement from Square One Politics, a group focused on recruiting and discovering young, diverse, progressive candidates. Vargas became the group’s executive director earlier this year.

Whoever emerges from the 2026 Democratic primary will have to navigate Nebraska’s most politically divided and diverse district, with a slight GOP tilt. 
National and state Democrats have been using the recent Omaha mayoral race as evidence of growing voter “energy” against President Donald Trump and political fuel for the congressional midterms.
Bacon has said both Democrats are too progressive to represent a purple district. Republicans are waiting on Bacon to decide whether to run again. Bacon has said he would announce this summer whether he would retire from Congress.

Kurtis Gregory of Marshall is sponsoring the bill to set aside state tax money to finance new and renovated stadiums for Kansas City sports teams (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe expanded the agenda of the special session Wednesday enough to win Missouri Senate passage of bills with money for disaster recovery in St. Louis, changes to property taxes policies and tax incentives to finance new or improved stadiums in Kansas City. 
Initially scheduled to go in at 10 a.m., the Senate finally convened about seven hours later. Talks over what sweeteners Kehoe needed to get his key objective — tax incentives to finance new or renovated stadiums for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals —- culminated in his revised agenda.
“After productive conversations with members of the Missouri General Assembly this week, we are amending our special session call to allow for additional legislation in the areas of disaster relief, tax policy, and budget investments,” Kehoe said in a news release. “We appreciate legislators working together to use this as an opportunity to show up for our communities by acting swiftly to help those in crisis, while also making smart decisions that secure opportunity for the future.”
Under the constitutional limits on a special session, the governor must “state specifically each matter on which action is deemed necessary.” Any attempt to address an issue not listed in the call for the session can be ruled out of order.
The special session began Monday and can continue for up to 60 days. Kehoe is seeking quick action because both teams have offers from Kansas to relocate.
The spending bill passed 23-10 in the early morning on Thursday, winning with a coalition of Democrats and Republicans with only Republicans opposed. The bill to finance the stadiums went to the House on a 19-13 vote, with three Democrats joining 10 Republicans in opposition.  
For several hours the chamber stalled on the stadium bill, working late into the night. The bill includes all the tax provisions necessary to finance the stadiums, plus disaster relief provisions and an expansion of a tax credit program supporting amateur sporting events.

Shortly before 1 a.m., the impasse cleared and bill sponsored by state Sen. Kurtis Gregory was given initial approval. Within a few hours, the final votes were held and the Senate adjourned until June 16.
For several hours, debate focused on a proposal from state Sen. Joe Nicola, a Republican from Independence, to freeze the maximum increase in annual property tax bills at 5% in some counties.
  State Sen. Tracy McCreery, a Democrat from Olivette, took a vocal stand Wednesday night opposing state funding for stadiums in Kansas City and St. Louis. She is show during the May 14 session when Republicans used a procedural move to shut down debate on a constitutional amendment to ban abortion (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Then state Sen. Tracy McCreery, a Democrat from Olivette, said she had heard enough.
“This discussion that we’ve had the last several hours is just an effort for the governor to try to get a couple of votes out of the Freedom Caucus for the stadium funding scheme,” McCreery said.
She said Kehoe agreed to Nicola’s amendment and added it to the call to wear down opposition. Then she blamed Kehoe and Republicans for using a procedural move to shut down debate during the regular session on an abortion ban and repeal of the sick leave law approved by voters in November.
Kehoe could have had the stadium plan passed if the procedural move was not used, McCreery said. 
“Here we are tonight, masquerading that we care about people and the amount of money that they’re paying for things,” McCreery said. 
Democrats don’t trust Republicans, she said, and the Senate should not trust the House. Until the appropriation bill, which totals $361 million including $175 million in general revenue, passes the House.
The House refused to pass a bill with $235 million of the same projects and $282 million of additional spending during the session. House Republican leaders waited for the Senate to adjourn on the last day for passing appropriations before revealing that the bill would be spiked. 
“We should not be doing anything until (the spending bill is passed) and over the House, and then the House has to have it on its way to the governor before we should be taking any action on anything else,” McCreery said.
The stadium funding plan would allocate state taxes collected from economic activity at Arrowhead and Kauffman to bond payments for renovations at Arrowhead and a new stadium for the Royals in Jackson or Clay counties.
The cost is estimated at close to $1.5 billion over 30 years.
State Sen. Kurtis Gregory, a Republican from Marshall and sponsor of the stadium bill, said the public support for keeping the Chiefs and Royals in Missouri was both a good economic investment and a good investment in the state’s image.
“What’s at stake if those teams go across the state line is over $2 billion of economic activity inside of the state of Missouri, over 13,000 jobs, and we just let the state of Kansas poach the pride and joy of the western side of the state,” Gregory said.
The teams must give Kansas an answer by June 30 on an offer to pay 70% of the cost of new stadiums. Missouri’s offer is to cover about half the cost.
Some senators have grumbled that the teams should make a commitment to stay in Missouri if the bill is passed. Gregory said their desire to stay should be apparent.
“I also contend that the teams want to stay in Missouri, because if they wanted to go to Kansas, I believe they would have already signed on the dotted line to move those teams,” Gregory said.
The spending bill was increased because of demands from St. Louis Democrats that Kehoe address the uncertainty over when or whether President Donald Trump will declare a federal disaster for the May 16 St. Louis tornado.
That brought a new $100 million appropriation for storm victims in the city of St. Louis. Previously, the disaster provisions in the call — $25 million for the Missouri Housing Trust Fund to be distributed by the Missouri Housing Development Commission and a tax credit for amounts paid as insurance deductibles — were all applied equally to counties included in disaster requests. Kehoe has submitted four storm events this spring, with damage in 37 counties, to Trump for disaster requests. Two have been granted.
The magnitude of the St. Louis tornado — a 22-mile path of destruction that cost five Missouri lives and damaged an estimated $1.6 billion in property damage — surpasses all other damage so far in the state.
Damage to public property in the two disasters that have been declared is estimated at $52 million.
The other new money added to the spending bill settled an issue for state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Democrat from Columbia. A state contribution to the new research reactor at the University of Missouri, which Kehoe cut from $50 million to $25 million to find money for disaster aid, was returned to $50 million.
  Sen. Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, speaks in defense of Freedom Caucus members during a May 14, 2024, debate. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The only opposition to the spending bill on the floor came from state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, who said the university should tap its $1.4 billion endowment to pay for the reactor. 
And Moon said he didn’t like the disaster relief funds.
“The money that is going to be received by those who were hurt is nowhere near the amount that’s going to cause them to be compensated and fully restored,” Moon said.
If the state starts paying to repair property after storms, he said, people will not buy insurance.
“I don’t think some of this is the proper function of government,” Moon said. “Compassion, certainly. But unless people take personal responsibility and do the things they should be doing so that we don’t have to, when is this going to end?”
The tax change Nicola is trying to enact would cap increases in real property tax bills at 5% every two years, corresponding to the reassessment cycle. Officials in 34 counties would have the option of putting the cap in place through a ballot measure.
The proposal is a response to rapid increases in property values and the resulting increase in tax bills. There was no estimate available of the potential cost to local governments. Nicola said there were enough protections to make sure all current revenue is maintained and new voter-approved levies are paid.
“Our property tax system in this state, in my opinion, is a disaster,” Nicola said.
The amendment is the price of his vote, he told the Senate.
“I am a hard no on the stadium tax bill unless we get some solid property tax relief for my people in Jackson County,” Nicola said. “I told the governor of this on Monday I can count on one hand how many of my constituents want me to vote for the stadium.”

The vending machines are part of an effort to see “less people losing their lives from substance use,” the executive director of Addison County’s Turning Point Center said.

Turning Point is a nonprofit organization with 12 satellite locations around the state that focuses on helping people through addiction recovery.The dispensers will also provide fentanyl and xylazine test strips, educational harm reduction kits, first aid kits and hygiene supplies such as socks, toothbrush, toothpaste, sunscreen, bug spray and hand sanitizer, Wallace said.The two vending machines in Middlebury and Bristol, both in Addison County, are funded through a $100,000 grant from the Vermont Department of Health. The Turning Point Center determined which supplies to offer after assessing the highest needs of the community and will continue to rotate supplies as needs change, Stephanie Busch, injury prevention program director at the Vermont Health Department, said in a statement to VTDigger. An external disposal container for sharp items is available alongside the vending machine, she said.“Placement of these vending machines ensures more flexible and responsive access to supplies and treatment services information to better serve the whole community,” Busch said.While people struggle with addiction across the state, Wallace said resources are often sent to Vermont’s more densely populated areas. “In rural communities, resources are always lacking,” she said. The vending machines will complement the Turning Point of Addison County’s other addiction recovery related-work, such as the recovery coaching program and a street outreach program, which primarily serves the region’s unhoused population, Wallace said. Overall opioid-related deaths fell in the state in 2024, but xylazine-related deaths rose 10%, from 32% in 2023 to 42% in 2024, according to a Vermont Department of Health report. Efforts to offer free and readily available overdose prevention resources are important to continue to reduce drug-related deaths, save lives and help people on the path to addiction recovery, Wallace said.“I think that education, advocacy and access to resources is a huge piece of what’s driving this reduction in overdose deaths,” Wallace said. “This is our effort and strategy to continue that reduction and to continue seeing less people losing their lives from substance use.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Free, 24-hour naloxone vending machine opens in Middlebury, Bristol to come.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Narcan-Naloxone-Opioids-Nasal-Spray-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 07:02:20.155822

The nonprofit, which serves 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa, is concerned about the impacts of potential cuts to federal food assistance, particularly in rural areas (Photo courtesy of Food Bank for the Heartland).People in Marsha Keene’s community are already struggling to cover the basics.
Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.
Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.
In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
 ‘I’d probably close the doors’

The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.
But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.
Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.
In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
 ‘It’s time to sound the alarm’

Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.
Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

A new report puts us among the top 10 states for tech manufacturing growth. But proposed federal budget changes could undercut our economic competitiveness by weakening one of our most important tools for ensuring we have the talent to remain competitive: the federal Pell Grant.
More than 92,000 Missourians used the Pell Grant last year to pursue a postsecondary degree or credential, from recent high school graduates to working adults seeking new skills or career changes. The Pell Grant, the foundation of need-based federal student aid, helps cover tuition at public and private institutions for low- and moderate-income students. Most recipients come from families earning less than $40,000 a year, and many juggle jobs, caregiving responsibilities and coursework to pursue their education.
Congress is currently negotiating the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a budget package that includes income tax cut extensions and significant reductions in federal education funding. The U.S. House’s proposal, which advanced in May, includes Pell Grant eligibility restrictions that could cut access to this critical source of aid for 66,960 Missouri students. An estimated 21,050 Missouri students would lose their Pell Grant entirely, threatening their ability to pursue and complete their education and training.
The U.S. Senate is actively working to finalize these cuts. If the changes proposed in the House bill are enacted, students would be required to take 30 credit hours per semester to receive a full Pell award, up from the current 24.
While that may seem like a relatively small change, it’s a huge deal for students working while in school, those with family responsibilities, and those who can’t afford to take a fifth class. For them, this is a $1,500 annual cut.
If Missouri is committed to business growth, we must also invest in the talent pipeline to drive that growth. Each additional postsecondary graduate generates 5.6 additional support jobs and contributes roughly $111,832 to Missouri’s GDP. We all benefit when everyone has access to training and education to pursue their choice of a rewarding career. For many students, the Pell Grant is what makes these pathways possible.
Missouri’s students shouldn’t have to take on a mountain of debt to build skills for in-demand, high-wage jobs. The Pell Grant puts education within reach. Cutting it now would slow our progress and threaten our economic success. Congress should protect and strengthen the Pell Grant, not cut it.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/student-loan-debt.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 07:02:20.155822

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Less than 24 hours after Aisha Braveboy declared victory in the special election for Prince George’s County executive, the Democrat and current county state’s attorney is already making moves.
Braveboy announced Wednesday that Maxene Bardwell will serve as chief administrative officer and second-in-command for the county. Bardwell, a Prince George’s resident, currently works as an internal audit manager in the Montgomery County Executive’s office.
“I consider this offer to be just an example of forward thinking by County Executive-elect Braveboy to make sure that she has best-in-class skill and experience in her administration working for the people of Prince George’s County,” Bardwell said in a statement.
Braveboy’s will not be official until next week, as election officials are still counting and certifying votes. But in election night returns, the latest posted by county officials, she had just over 89% of the vote over Republican challenger Jonathan White.
But event before Tuesday’s election, after surviving a nine-candidate Democratic primary in March, Braveboy had pulled together a preliminary transition team comprised of some top elected officials and business and community leaders.
The team included transition co-chairs include Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) and Bowie State University President Aminta Breaux, Capitol Connections President Michael Arrington and High-Quality Care Nursing CEO Joy Davis.  About a dozen people are on an executive committee that includes state Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) and Erek Barron, former U.S. Attorney for Maryland.
Braveboy’s transition team also notes various committee co-chairs, including At-Large Councilmember Calvin Hawkins (D) to serve on a group dealing with Corrections and Returning Citizens Services, and former county executive County Executive Rushern L. Baker III, co-chair of a committee to assess the county’s finances, government structure and operational efficiency. Both Hawkins and Baker ran against Braveboy in the March primary.
State Sen. Ron Watson (D-Prince George’s) will co-chair a committee focused on education, employment and workforce development.
If her victory is confirmed, Braveboy would be sworn in on June 19, the Juneteenth holiday.
Shoemaker shuffles off
When Carroll County voters go to elect a state’s attorney in 2026, current State’s Attorney Haven Shoemaker Jr. will not be an option. Shoemaker, a Republican, announced Monday that he will not seek reelection after serving one term as the county’s top prosecutor.
In a statement released by his office, Shoemaker said that serving as state’s attorney “has been the honor of a lifetime,” but added that “at this point in my life, it’s time to let someone else have a try.”

“By the time I leave office, I will have been an attorney for 34 years and will have held political office for 30,” his statement said. “It is time for me to spend some quality time with my wife, Patty, at long last. She has made tremendous sacrifices as I pursued careers in both the law and politics, and without her support, I would not have accomplished anything.”
Shoemaker was born in Baltimore but moved with his family to North East where he attended high school before earning a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, in 1987. After two years in the Army National Guard, he attended Widener University School of Law, graduating with honors in 1992, and opened his own law practice in Hampstead in 1994.
His political career began with election to the Hampstead Town Council 1997, followed by election as major in 2003, a job he held until 2010, when he was elected to the Carroll County Commission. Shoemaker was elected to the House of Delegates in 2014 and served from 2015 to 2023, serving as minority whip in 2022. He was elected to his current position in 2022.
“I still have a year and a half left of my term. I will continue to work diligently for you during this time as I have over the last 30 plus years,” his statement said. “The people of Carroll County deserve nothing less.”
Brown adds Maryland to more lawsuits
Has Maryland moved from friend of the court to best friend of the court?
Attorney General Anthony Brown said Wednesday that Maryland has signed on to friend of the court briefs in two separate federal lawsuits in as many days.
Maryland was one of 19 states and the District of Columbia that filed an amicus curiae — friend of the court — brief on Tuesday urging the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold Michigan’s ban on “conversion therapy,” the medically discredited therapy that claims to convert the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ individuals. A federal district court upheld Michigan’s law restricting the therapy, but that ruling was appealed by the therapist and the Catholic Charities group in southeastern Michigan that sued to overturn the law.
Maryland banned the use of conversion therapy on minors in 2018, one of 25 states with laws on the books — Arizona and Pennsylvania have prohibitions issued through executive orders — restricting such therapy.
The Michigan brief said all the states “have strong interests in regulating the practice of health care, including care relating to mental health, within their boundaries to protect public health and safety. Amici States additionally share compelling interests in protecting the health, safety, and well-being of children and youth, and in affirming the dignity and equal worth and treatment of LGBTQI+ minors.”
Maryland, other states, take more legal actions against Trump administration

And Maryland was one 18 states and the District that filed an amicus brief Wednesday urging the full 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider a ruling by a three-judge panel of the court in a Voting Rights Act case brought by a tribe in North Dakota.
The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians sued the state of North Dakota in 2021, claiming that the state’s redistricting plan illegally diluted Native American voting strength in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. A federal district judge agreed and ordered the state to redraw its districts, and when it did not, the judge imposed the tribe’s recommended redistricting plan.
But on appeal, a panel of the circuit court overturned that ruling, finding that Section 2 applies to states and other governments, but does not confer a right on private individuals to bring a legal challenge.
The Turtle Mountain brief argues that not only does Section 2 allow private actions in voting rights cases, but participation by private groups is critical to protecting those rights.
“Private parties are instrumental in identifying voting-related issues, and for decades, private actions have been a welcome and necessary supplement to state efforts to ensure legal compliance,” the brief said, supplementing federal prosecutors and state officials who may not have the resources to pursue voting rights cases. “Private parties are typically best equipped to identify and pursue violations. They have extensive on-the-ground knowledge and develop the necessary connections with stakeholders and community members to build cases.”
Annapolis mayoral hopefuls to debate
With Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley term-limited after serving two four-year terms, voters may be starting to think about the next mayor, who will be chosen this fall. Residents have a chance to hear the two announced candidates so far at a mayoral debate next week.
The June 10 debate between two Democrats, Alderwoman Rhonda Pindell Charles and former Alderman Jared Littmann, is being hosted by the Caucus of African American Leaders at the Wiley H. Bates Legacy Center.
Carl Snowden, convener of the caucus, wrote in email Monday that topics up for discussion include affordable housing, DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs and other matters affecting the city. Another topic could be sanctuary cities: Annapolis was one of 10 municipalities in Maryland identified by the Trump administration last month as sanctuary jurisdictions, along with eight counties and the state itself. The administration has threatened federal funding for the more than 500 jurisdictions it identified nationwide.
Snowden said his group will have a monthly meeting one hour before the debate scheduled to start at 6 p.m.

(Photo by Seth Wenig/The Associated Press)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.
Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
‘Can’t wait for Washington’ 
Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
Repayment
Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
‘Incentive to hike prices’
Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
 The ‘balance sheet’

In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.

Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”

Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.

But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.

 Housing and development arguments

The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”

Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.

 The costs of public lands management

In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

Sides level charges at one another as society seeks “diversified fundraising” and other changes.
The post Wyoming Historical Society divorces, fights with fundraising partner appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Historical Society has divorced itself from its longtime fundraising partner, the Wyoming Historical Foundation, saying the breakup is necessary for “diversified funding” and other changes.
The two nonprofits have been closely associated for about 30 years; the society collecting and preserving Wyoming history since 1953 with the foundation raising money and supporting an endowment to promote those efforts.
Now the two entities are at war.
The Historical Society, which publishes the highly regarded Annals of Wyoming, says membership has lagged and that the old organizational structure hamstrings it in supporting all Wyoming organizations interested in preserving and interpreting the state’s history. The foundation contends the new leadership is ripping the nonprofit away from its grassroots base that’s centered on individual county historical groups. At least two of those have reportedly cancelled summer events over the spat.
The fundraising foundation heard complaints from the society’s member chapters — which represent various counties — that the society’s executive director was unresponsive and delinquent in her tasks, Historical Foundation President Ann Chambers Noble of Cora said. The Historical Society hired executive director Alexandra “Aley” Philp a year and a half ago after Executive Secretary Linda Fabian retired.
“Many of the members were disenfranchised.” Ann Chambers Noble
The transition hasn’t worked, Noble said.
“Members would send in a check for their dues, and the check wouldn’t be canceled for six or seven months,” Noble said. “Phone calls would go unanswered. The chapters did not get their tax documents.”
The new Historical Society director Philp said any delays were due to changes the society made as it found itself facing a funding crisis, including sending her out of the office to raise money. To set a new course, the Historical Society is changing from a member- and chapter-based organization, that once included chapters from 22 Wyoming counties, to a donor-based group.
“It was only sustainable for another 3-5 years,” Philp said of the organization’s structure and budget. “Something had to change.”
“Hijacked!”
A bruising battle is ongoing, with Historical Foundation supporters launching a Facebook page that proclaims Philp has “hijacked” the organization. Critics of the Historical Society say that the group’s board, reconstituted after resignations, has broken bylaws as it changed them to allow the society to ditch its membership structure and raise funds independently.
For its part, the Historical Society has distributed emails and statements blasting the critics. The Historical Society and its board members, Philp said, have been subject to resistance, hostility and threats.
Historical Foundation supporters “have expressed their dissatisfaction to change in a very negative manner,” she said.
Depending on who you ask, the spat began last fall either because of Historical Foundation complaints over Philp’s performance or Historical Society efforts to redirect the Historical Foundation’s annual $30,000-$50,000 in donations. That money had been aimed toward savings or an endowment, but the Historical Society wanted to use the funds for other things, Philp said.

Amid the turmoil, the fundraising foundation proposed an audit. The Historical Society said it couldn’t afford one.
The proposed change in use of Historical Foundation funds “was met with a lot of resistance and eventual hostility that led to the attacks on the way we needed to move forward,” Philp said.
In February, the troubles hit the Historical Society executive board as the board passed a no-confidence vote against board president Jessica Flock. The Albany County business owner, educator and historian then resigned. Other board members quickly followed, Philp said.
Those remaining on the Historical Society board began to fill the vacancies, as advised by an attorney, Philp said. On March 12, the society announced its separation from the foundation.
The Historical Society sought to change its bylaws to enable its new course, asking members to vote for the change from a membership organization to a donor-based one. Noble said she and others didn’t get an invitation to vote and called foul.
“Apparently, it was set up on some kind of Google document,” Noble said. “If you don’t have a Google email address, you couldn’t vote.
“Let’s be real,” Noble said. “A lot of our members are elderly. We have members that don’t even have computers.
“It was deeply frustrating for me that we were having this major, major vote which was against the bylaws,” Noble said. “Many of the members were disenfranchised.”
90-year-olds voted
“It’s unfortunate if they could not figure it out,” Philp said. She was available to help anybody with problems and did so the four or five times she got calls asking for assistance, she said.
“We had members in their 90s who were able to vote,” Philp said. It was accessible to anyone with an email address.”
The vote for new bylaws passed with 589 in favor, Philp said.
Meantime, at the urging of the fundraising Historical Foundation, 146 Historical Society members signed a statement of no confidence against society leadership and Philp, according to documents Noble provided. The statement alleged an illegal process to change bylaws, “secret meetings, and systematic retaliation against concerned members.”
That “retaliation” includes about a dozen cease and desist letters, Noble said, including one to her.

Noble and others “have been led astray with a misinformation campaign, inflammatory remarks, erroneous accusations, and inaccurate claims regarding our Executive Director Aley Philp and other members of the Executive Committee,” the March 11 letter from the executive committee reads. “We wish to remind you that any actions taken to libel, defame, slander, or retaliate against current or former board members, staff, or volunteers of the Wyoming Historical Society will not be tolerated.”
The Historical Foundation said the bylaw change should be nullified. It’s also girding for more conflict and passed its no-confidence statement criticizing the Historical Society on to the foundation’s own attorney.

(Screenshot from National Archives film)The liberation of Gathemo, France, won’t be found in many history books about the Second World War.
After all, it was one town among hundreds on a map that needed to be taken from the occupying Germans in the slow, methodical, grinding Battle of Normandy that began on D-Day: June 6, 1944. That’s when the Allies landed soldiers on five beaches and airborne troops dropped behind enemy lines as part of the war to wrest Europe from Nazi Germany.
Public perception may condense what happened after the invasion into simple terms: The Allies landed, established a beachhead and the fight was over. Tragically, it did not all end in a matter of days and the cost was steep – nearly 210,000 Allied casualties, and around 400,000 German losses.

Throughout the summer, the Allies pushed the German Army back through tiny villages, cities, farmland, hedgerows and plains in a war of attrition. U.S., British, Canadian, and other allied forces gained ground – sometimes only in mere yards — each day.
By August, the Germans were retreating and desperately attempting to avoid becoming encircled. Gathemo soon found itself in the midst of the maelstrom.
For the first time in the war, Pennsylvania’s own 28th Infantry Division was leading the way to try to liberate the town, flanked by the veteran 4th and 29th divisions.

The men and women of Gathemo have never forgotten the men who wore the red keystone patch – dubbed the “bloody bucket” by the Germans – on their shoulders.
Nearly 81 years later, the community will show its gratitude on Saturday by unveiling a memorial honoring nine men from the 28th who gave their lives so Gathemo could be free and  are renaming a street after the division.
At a time when international relations are tense and some American leaders are questioning alliances in Europe, the gesture is a reminder of how deep the bond runs between the French and their liberators. And the commemoration that will take place Saturday began because one man wondered what happened to his great-uncle in the war.
He could never have imagined where his search would lead.
 ‘Filling in the blanks’

Fifty-year-old Shaun Nadolny doesn’t have any ties to Pennsylvania.
The assistant airport operations manager for Milwaukee County in Wisconsin is a self-described history lover, whose grandfather Leo Nadolny fought in the Pacific Theater with the Marines against the Japanese.
Shaun Nadolny’s dad, born four years after the war ended in 1949, was named after Leo’s brother Jerome Francis, who was one of nine men killed in Gathemo. The two brothers never knew each other’s whereabouts while in combat, so Leo didn’t learn about Jerome’s death for nearly a year.
Letters from his parents informing him about the loss weren’t reaching him, so tragically, he kept asking about his brother when writing home.

Like most families at the time, the Nadolnys didn’t know much about Jerome’s service, except that he died in France. A family member has the Purple Heart that was issued posthumously.
“I’ve learned a lot about my grandpa, Leo, because in about 2001, I sent a letter to the government saying, ‘As part of the Freedom of Information Act, I was wondering if you could share his military file.’ And they did,” he said.
The packet arrived about 18 months later and provided him with a window into his grandfather’s wartime experiences – where he fought, the battles he survived and even the ships he was transported on in the Pacific.
“It kind of led me down this path about his brother Jerome, that we knew nothing about. We just literally had a picture of his cross on his grave over in Brittany (France), and a picture of him. That’s all my dad ever had,” he said. “He just knew that, ‘Hey, I was named after my uncle who I never met who was killed over in France.’”
About a decade ago, he wrote the government again with a request for Jerome’s military file. He wasn’t as fortunate this time around. The records were believed to have been destroyed in a fire at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis in 1973. It was one of up to 18 million service members’ files lost.
He did receive some basic information: Jerome’s draft enrollment card and where he was originally buried in France before his remains were repatriated in the Brittany American Cemetery.
Another key detail came from a picture of Jerome’s grave marker. He served in the 109th Infantry Regiment, as part of the 28th Infantry Division. Prior to the war, the 28th was a Pennsylvania National Guard unit based at Fort Indiantown Gap in Lebanon County. It was nationalized by the federal government in February 1941.
“I just started kind of looking into that unit in that division,” Nadolny said. “A friend said, ‘Hey man, you’re kind of at a dead end with this research on your great uncle. You should look at a 28th Infantry Facebook group or a family group, because you’re not going to get anything more from the government.’”

So in the group, he ended up in touch with a Frenchman, Christophe Clement, who works in logistics. But, his real passion is World War II history. When he was 15 or 16, he would ride his bike from cemetery to cemetery to make sure the graves of Allied soldiers were well kept. He’s studied in Canada to be a historical adviser and volunteers with the Mike Pride Mobile Museum. Clement’s Facebook page is filled with pictures and videos – historical and current – of his efforts to keep the memory of Allied soldiers alive.
But, he has always felt a connection to the men wearing the keystone symbol on their uniforms and helmets. His hometown of Senlis was liberated by the division. During WWI, a soldier from the 28th died there and another five were killed in the same area during the second worldwide conflict.
Clement connected Nadolny with a retired lieutenant colonel from the 28th – Corey Angell, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and who has a passion for documenting the history of his beloved unit.
Angell soon was able to add a few more pieces to the puzzle for Nadolny – Jerome’s company, his death from a gunshot wound and how he was identified by his paybook.
“So, they kind of started filling in just some of the blanks,” Nadolny said. “And all I ever was doing for the last 15 years was just learning a little bit more about my family history.”
 ‘Just another guy’

Clement had an idea after corresponding with Angell and Nadolny – to build a memorial to the 28th’s fallen in the nondescript town of Gathemo in Normandy. The idea blew Nadolny’s mind. He figured his great-uncle was just a typical grunt doing his job. After all, he wasn’t part of the D-Day landings or some super soldier that earned a chestful of medals.

“He’s just another guy. He came after the invasion, and was killed very early in – Aug. 12,” he said. “Nothing heroic about it.”
Nadolny didn’t want his relative to be singled out, so Clement did some digging and learned the names of eight other members of the 28th who were killed in the fight to liberate the townspeople from four years of German occupation.
“When you search for information about soldiers or about combat actions or whatever, it really is like a police inquiry,” Clement said, speaking through a translator.
Clement is an old pro at working to honor the memory of Allied soldiers who paid the ultimate price on French soil. About a dozen years ago, he started working to create monuments to members of the 28th around his part of France.
He will turn 40 on Saturday, the same day as the ceremony, which will have special significance because Clement says it will be the last monument he helps build. Organizing the tributes is becoming increasingly complicated, said Clement, who has worked to preserve the memory of 15 members of the Bloody Bucket who were killed in France during the world wars and an estimated 400 other Allied soldiers.
 The Battle

The 28th Infantry Division didn’t enter the conflict until about a month-and-half after D-Day – July 22, 1944 – and landed at Omaha Beach. At that point, the Allies were building  momentum toward a breakout inland.
The division found itself in hedgerow country (known to the French as “bocage”).
The fighting across the terrain  – made up of farm fields broken up by a series of overgrown hedges and trees that towered above walls of dirt that could reach up to six feet in height— was slow, brutal and hindered any sustained advance.
Six days after arriving on French soil, the 28th suffered its first casualty when an officer was seriously wounded.
But its biggest test to come was in Gathemo, beginning on Aug. 7.
“The 28th Division troops got their first experience in hedgerow warfare during the fighting at Percy and Hill 210, but they faced a far more intense test a week later at Gathemo and Hill 288, just outside the town,” said Walter Zapotoczny an author, Army veteran, former command historian of the 28th Infantry Division and president of the 28th Infantry Division Association.

Jerome Nadolny and his fellow soldiers in the 109th regiment were among the first American troops moving toward the town around 6:30 a.m. Waiting for them, according to Zapotoczny, was at least half of the German 84th Infantry Division, an 88-mm anti-tank battalion, the 84th Division artillery and other enemy forces.
After hours of heaving fighting and nightfall approaching, three battalions of the 28th dug in – without much forward progress. But, the Germans weren’t done. As the Allies had learned through Africa, Sicily, and Italy, their enemy utilized the counterattack as a favored tactic.
Major Paul F. Gaynor, who was commanding the regimental anti-tank company described what happened next:

Three German tanks accompanied by more than 100 infantrymen came out of Gathemo. The tanks were equipped with searchlights which were used to illuminate the area where the men were digging in. Direct fire from the tanks’ guns and machine guns at ranges of 60 to 75 yards caused heavy casualties. The accompanying infantrymen, who were equipped with a large number of automatic weapons, took advantage of the confusion. 
Bazookas were quickly brought into action (by U.S, troops)….the tanks and their infantry support withdrew to Gathemo upon meeting this resistance.”

The next day didn’t yield much gain in ground. The 28th advanced another 300 to 400 yards. The Germans may have been in retreat, but continued to fight tenaciously. It wouldn’t be until the morning of Aug. 10 that American troops entered the town, and by the afternoon Gathemo was liberated.
“The battle of Gathemo caused the greatest losses and the most resistance up to that point in the 28th Division’s experience,” Zapotoczny added,  “It was at Gathemo that the 28th Division endured its most brutal battle of the Northern France campaign.”
The cost in and around Gathemo was the lives of nine members of the 28th, including three from Pennsylvania:
An estimated 235 men were wounded.
On Aug. 19, the 77-day Battle of Normandy came to an end with the Germans in full retreat and tens of thousands captured when the Falaise pocket was closed by Allied troops.
“Although not directly involved in the fiercest fighting at Chambois, where Polish and Canadian forces sealed the pocket, the 28th Division’s aggressive advance helped prevent German units from escaping to the east or regrouping, effectively pressing the western and southern flanks of the pocket,” Zapotoczny said.
A mere 10 days after the German defense of Normandy collapsed, the men of the Bloody Bucket were taking part in the liberation day parade throughout Paris.

 Tracking down the relatives

As plans for the dedication ceremony took shape, Cory Angell, the retired 28th Division officer, continued to try to reach as many families of the nine soldiers killed in Gathemo as possible to give them a chance to attend in-person or watch it online.
He spends his spare time researching photos and videos throughout history of the men and women who served in the country’s oldest Army division.
“We’re kind of a small group, right? A lot of people just retire and move on. There’s some of us that are just diehards and I’m one of them,” Angell said. “I’m an old soldier, retired from the division which I grew up with. Really, the beginning and end of my career was in the division wearing the keystone patch.”
Since Pvt. Irwin S. Fox was from Pittsburgh, he turned his attention to trying to find his relatives.
Military records show Fox enlisted in the Army on Jan. 9, 1944, just months before the invasion. He was assigned to the 110th Infantry Regiment with the 28th Division.
Angell started by Googling the names of the nine soldiers. With Fox, he was able to make a connection to Pittsburgh. He then reached out to the Heinz History Center, who put him in touch with the Pittsburgh Jewish Genealogy Society.
“The guy said, ‘Last I can tell, that family moved to Columbus, Ohio. Let me put you in touch with a guy for Jewish history in Columbus, Ohio.’ And that’s how they go, ‘Yeah, we got him. Here’s her phone number.’”
Soon, he was on the phone with Evelyn Fox Weiner, Irwin’s 89-year-old niece.
“What was a real joy to me and I hope that all those that are involved can really appreciate it when we do find the family members, the three that we found have been amazed and thrilled,” Angell said. “People are like, ‘What? You’re kidding me.’”
 ‘My grandmother became a Gold Star mother’

Fox was a first-generation American. His grandfather was from Ukraine and his grandmother grew up in Latvia. He graduated from Schenley High School in Pittsburgh’s North Oakland neighborhood. His mom, dad, sister and brother eventually moved to Squirrel Hill. He was married to Josephine Greenberg. A picture from 1944 shows a striking couple – Josephine sporting a knee-length skirt and a clean-shaven Irwin in uniform with his right arm casually, but firmly around her hip.
He was 29 when he died in combat.
“He was very loving and nice,” said Weiner. “He was revered enough that my family had another son who was named after him.”
His namesake, Irwin S. Fox, is 77-years-old and lives in Phoenix, Arizona, with his wife.
He didn’t know much about his uncle until about 1964, when he came across some old photos.
“All I knew was that he was killed shortly after D-Day. I didn’t know any of the details until I saw the gravestone,” Fox said. The headstone is marked with his uncle’s date of death, Aug. 13, 1944. “I just knew from history that he was in hedgerow country in France.”

Irwin Fox and his wife recorded a message on a record to his parents, after Passover in the spring of 1944. The audio and photos were provided to the Capital-Star by his namesake, Irwin S. Fox. (Audio slideshow produced by Tim Lambert)
Fox’s death in Gathemo hit the family hard and Weiner isn’t sure her grandmother ever recovered from the loss of her youngest child.
“I remember the Blue Star in the window in their apartment and their home at that time, if you had somebody in the service, it was a small banner,” said Weiner, who still has the telegram from the War Department informing the family of his death. “Then my grandmother became a Gold Star mother after he was killed.”
When the war was over, families had to decide whether to bring the remains of their loved ones home or whether they would remain buried in Europe. Fox’s mother chose to have his body returned to the U.S.
In March 1949, he was buried at Shaare Torah Cemetery in Whitehall in Allegheny County.
A family photo dated Sept. 15, 1964, shows his mother standing in front of his grave marked by an American flag. Her graying hair peeks out from her yellow headscarf and she’s wearing a long, black coat. Her hands are clasped and her face is grief-stricken.
“I think that’s the most poignant picture I have,” Irwin Fox said.

The family is grateful to have learned a little bit more about Irwin’s short time in France, but will not be able to make the ceremony.
“It meant enough, and Irwin was revered enough, then when we found out about it, which was only two weeks ago, that there were 15 members of our family that were ready to go to France, really, to be there at that dedication, that’s how quickly we all wanted to be there to honor and to share what we could with him,” Weiner said. “Due to logistics and complications due to travel, it’s not happening. We all revered Irwin’s service to the United States and what he did and the sacrifice that he made. It totally changed several generations.”
She and Irwin are touched by the gesture of the people of Gathemo.
“The people actually cared what Americans did and the sacrifice they made (It) had an effect on the world. That is wonderful,” Irwin said. “It kind of renews in me to want to make a difference in the world.”
Weiner said it’s gratifying that the town is remembering the soldiers who died to liberate it from the Germans.
“It never replaces a life, but does it give hope or meaning or set something up for generations to come,” she said.
  ‘Such a rewarding feeling’

The next puzzle piece was tracking down another fallen soldier with Pennsylvania connections.
Not much is known about Pfc. Merritt Boyle’s military service. He was from Chinchilla, Lackawanna County, and served in the 109th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Infantry Division.
He’s buried at the Shady Lane Cemetery in Dixon City.

Angell had a lead on another namesake – 53-year-old Merrit Boyle of Old Forge,, who trains athletes, owns a gym and does life coaching.
It turns out, though, that Merrit doesn’t really answer his phone.
So Angell reached out to the 109th Infantry Regiment Association in Scranton and one of their members just showed up at Boyle’s doorstep.
“I came back from walking my dogs and I locked both doors and I’m setting up my schedule for the day and I heard a banging on the back door. I’m like, ‘Who the hell is banging on my back door?’” he said. So, I’m looking at him and he said, ‘Are you Merrit?’”
The two talked for about 90 minutes about the division, about where Merritt was killed and the upcoming ceremony. The talk started to fill in some blanks for the younger Boyle.
He had heard some stories about the man he was named after – like how he loved his country and was only in France a short time before his death.
Like, how his grandmother, Marjorie, who was Merritt’s mother, asked her daughter, Mary, to name one of her children after her fallen son.
“They weren’t planning on having another kid. I’m the youngest by six years, so I was kind of like a surprise,” he said. “Marjorie went to my mom and said, ‘Look, it would mean a lot for me to keep his legacy alive,’ because Merritt was a very special person to her. You could tell just from talking to her, telling me stories, and I remember sleeping over at her house and she’d be telling me great stories on how he was always into trouble.

The twist is they spelled his name wrong on his birth certificate. As his namesake, he has one “T” in his name.
“I love that I have that legacy. I’ve always felt a connection to him when I pray at night, I always have that connection that there’s someone watching me,” Boyle said. “That’s why it was such a rewarding experience to find out a little bit more of his history and I learned a lot from talking to many people that were very helpful and getting me up to pace with some of the details of where he was and what happened.”
Boyle said his uncle didn’t get a chance to live his life.
“I feel him live through me in many regards. …  That I was named after him and (in) his honor and that just hearing how they spoke of him, it made me want to do better,” he said. Merrit does have a wooden carving Boyle made when he was in service and the flag that was put over his coffin when his remains were returned to Pennsylvania.
He is grateful to know his uncle’s memory will live on in the land where he fell.
“We kind of sometimes today get caught up in the politics and the cynicism a lot of times of Republican or Democrat, all this kind of stuff. To see 80 years later that there’s still appreciation for what those great men did gives such a rewarding feeling,” he said.

Between 2019 and 2024, patients in rural Tennessee lost access to 362 independent doctors and 344 independent medical practices, the report commissioned by the Physicians Advocacy Institute found. 
Some of those doctors simply ceased practicing in rural areas, while others became employees of larger healthcare systems. 
Tennessee, like other states, has seen consolidation of hospital systems that out-compete or buy out independent physician practices — a marked trend particularly in the state’s northeast region, where Ballad Health now operates as a virtual hospital monopoly for more than a million people with no other alternative for inpatient healthcare. Ballad has also bought out or folded in previously independent physician practices. 
Such consolidations raise important policy questions, the report’s authors note. They include the “erosion of physician autonomy,” and “higher healthcare costs and potential declines in quality.”
A renegotiation of a deal between Tennessee officials and Ballad that has allowed the hospital system to operate despite anti-monopoly rules has since lowered the previous quality of care standards the state once held system responsible for meeting.  
“Consolidation of physician services under hospitals and corporate entities in rural areas raise concerns about reduced access, rising costs and potential declines in care quality,” the report said.

June 4, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz VelizThe email raised concerns among members of Michigan State University’s international community.
On Thursday afternoon, international students at MSU received an email from the Office for International Students and Scholars, or OISS, “strongly” recommending them not to leave the United States, among other recommendations.
The email, signed by Krista McCallum, director of OISS, was delivered independently to foreign students, but with the same content: An important update in response to recent federal government actions affecting the international academic community, both those already legally in the country and those still in process to enter.
By the end of May, a cable signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press stated that the U.S. government decided to halt new student visa interviews for foreign applicants to U.S. colleges, where they plan to use the review of social media activity as a filter to vet foreign applicants.
Additionally, the U.S. Department of State released a press statement in which Rubio specified that “under President Trump’s leadership,” Chinese students’ visas will be “aggressively” revoked, including those “with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.”
“Our current understanding is that previously scheduled visa interview appointments will proceed as planned. However, most embassies and consulates have suspended scheduling new appointments,” the message said.
McCallum advised those students who are still in the U.S. not to leave the country.
“For students and scholars inside the U.S.: We strongly advise that you do not travel outside the United States,” McCallum said in the communication.
For those currently outside the country who require a visa to return, McCallum recommended staying in close contact with the U.S. embassy or consulate in their area. Additionally, for those unsure about the validity of their visas, the email included a link where students could check their current visa stamp.
MSU spokesperson Amber McCann reiterated one more time that the international community on campus is essential to the university’s academic and professional development, adding that “The university is closely monitoring recent federal policy changes and updates concerning international students and scholars.”

“We will continue to advocate for policies that enable us to welcome international students and scholars from around the world and promote global engagement,” McCann concluded.”
As it is happening across the country, within MSU’s international community, concerns about not returning home over the summer due to the severity of recent policy changes had already become a recurring topic, while those who traveled expressed concerns about their return. Many students had already decided not to travel back to their home countries, fearing potential issues with immigration when attempting to re-enter the U.S.
“It’s no longer just about having your paperwork in order; now it feels like crossing the border comes with a real risk of running into trouble,” said Diego Granados, an MSU PhD student in biochemistry who is from Mexico. “The atmosphere has changed. Every time you see another international student, you ask them if they’re traveling this summer, because of the political climate.”
At the end of the email, McCallum expressed her support and concern for the international community and reiterated, as in previous communications stated by MSU, the university’s commitment to international students, who have increasingly become targets of federal government policies nationwide.
“I understand that this news and the uncertainty surrounding it may be frustrating. Please know that MSU remains strongly committed to our international Spartan community. We will continue to welcome students and scholars from around the world, and we will advocate for policies that support your presence and success,” the email said.
MSU students had already protested what they considered to be the lack of action by MSU officials regarding the protection of the international community. And after only receiving statements and emails, they considered the university to be taking an insufficient stance.

“I think they just want to play it safe and make sure we don’t leave,” said Granados. “Honestly, it just feels awful. It’s like this message is formalizing that feeling we already had, that even if you have legal status and you’re pursuing a degree, going back home is now something risky. It might go wrong. You might not be able to come back.”
Luis Torres, an MSU PhD student in Kinesiology who is from Puerto Rico, highlighted the targeting of the immigrant community in general and how it escalated to academic fields.
“The pattern is evident: the criminalization of undocumented immigrants was amplified, university students who protested were stigmatized, and now the focus shifts to the entire international student community,” said Torres.
“A state that restricts access to education under current pretexts can justify future encroachments on fundamental rights, eroding democracy for the benefit of a privileged minority,” he finished.
Additionally, among foreign students, the protection of their identity or hiding their opinions have increasingly become a concern, showing a decline in freedom of speech within the community.
“It makes you feel trapped. Like, I’m here, and I can’t cross the border or talk openly about it because they check my phone, don’t like something, and I’m not allowed to reenter to finish my studies. That’s really how it feels,” finished Granados.

Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.

Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
 The ‘balance sheet’

In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.










Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They're certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.


– Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity



Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.


The federal government controls 24.1 million acres in Colorado, or 36% of the state.


“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”

Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison (to sell off public land). It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
 Housing arguments

The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“(The amendment) is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. “It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”

Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
 The costs of management

In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

He acknowledges the challenges about running in an electoral landscape that hasn’t elected any Democrat to a statewide office since 2018, but says the environment is ripe for that to change in 2026.
“We will be in every community, building trust and building relationships and building a coalition that will ultimately and successfully win an election where a Democrat hasn’t won in 30 years and where the voter registration rolls are against us,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix on Wednesday.
“In Florida we are in the midst of a generational affordability crisis,” he added. “Everybody feels it. I mean this has been affirmed everywhere I’ve gone, every group I’ve sat with. The affordability crisis is number one on the minds of every Floridian. Wherever you live, whatever your socioeconomic status – whatever your party registration – the affordability crisis is number one. I would make the case that Republicans in Tallahassee have contributed to it, and will continue it. They won’t do anything about it, and we will. I will.”
The 52-year-old Pinellas County resident is the first major Democratic candidate to enter the race for governor in a seat that will be vacated next year by a term-limited Ron DeSantis. It’s been quite the evolution for man who previously described himself as a “George H.W. Bush Republican” for much of his adult life before leaving the GOP in 2018 to become a political independent, and then only officially joining the Democratic Party six weeks ago.
Florida hasn’t had a Democrat occupying the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee since Buddy MacKay finished out Lawton Chiles’ second term in office in January of 1999. Since then there has been eight years of Jeb Bush, four years with (then Republican) Charlie Crist, eight years with Rick Scott, and so far nearly six-and-a-half years of the DeSantis revolution.
Jolly’s previous elected experience in office is limited – he defeated Democrat Alex Sink in a special congressional election in early 2014 following the death of venerable Republican lawmaker C.W. Bill Young. After coasting to re-election that fall, Florida’s 13th Congressional District was redrawn and became friendlier for a Democratic pick-up, which is what happened when Crist defeated him in the fall of 2016.
Jolly was an early member of the GOP “Never Trumper” caucus, and his critiques of Donald Trump in his first term in the White House catapulted him into a political analysis spot for MSNBC (his contact has been paused since he began exploring a gubernatorial run, an MSNBC source told the Phoenix in April).
The independent spirit
Jolly officially left the GOP in 2018 and became a political independent, where he actively worked on efforts to provide an alternative to the two-party political system. First with the Serve America Movement (SAM) in 2021 where he served as the executive chairman, and then later with Andrew Yang and Christine Todd Whitman with the Forward Party in 2022.  
It was during his period with SAM that he actively discussed the possibility four years ago as running as a political independent candidate for governor in Florida for 2022, but ultimately decided not to.
Currently the Republican front-runner for the GOP nomination for governor next year is U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds. But there’s also likely to be at least one independent candidate in the race with state Sen. Jason Pizzo saying he’s likely to join the campaign for governor this fall.
“We won’t know who qualifies for the governor’s race until next June, and that’s very important,” Jolly says. “Because our job between now and next June is to build a campaign that appeals to independents. As you know I helped mobilize the independent space for six years, and I would beg the parties that we are available to you. Speak to us, reach us, don’t ignore us. Don’t slap us down. And so Jason Pizzo’s right that the independent voter has been ignored by the major parties for too long. The answer to that is not to argue with Jason, it’s to build the Democratic Party that reaches out to independents. And if I do that, then we’ll build a coalition that Jason Pizzo or John Morgan can look at and say,’Wow. I like what I see over there.’”
The Trump Factor
Jolly’s opposition to Trump has been a central part of his brand over the years, but he tells the Phoenix that the 2026 election is about the people of Florida, not the current president of the United States.
“I believe the president has taken us in the wrong direction, just as I believe Gov. DeSantis has, but this race is not about Donald Trump,” he says. “Not for one moment is this race about Donald Trump. This race is about the affordability crisis in the state of Florida. Republicans will try to make this race about Donald Trump. They will try to make it about division, not unity. My job every day on behalf of this coalition, is to keep us focused on the affordability crisis. Investing in public schools. Providing for safe communities. Restoring dignity to people across the state of Florida. This is an open seat governorship race. I stand by my view of the president, but this race is not about the president.”
While the Florida Legislature is currently working overtime to get a budget passed, GOP lawmakers and Gov. DeSantis have talked about delivering property tax relief to Florida homeowners, most likely via a constitutional amendment that the voters would have to approve in the fall of next year. Jolly says his biggest concern about the discussion in Tallahassee on the issue so far is that the GOP has “no plan for where the revenue comes from to provide for safe communities and good schools, and they just want to chase the property tax cuts.”
He says the state needs to look at a “broad based property tax reform package” that maintains the Save Our Homes amendment that limits annual property tax increases to 3% while also providing “dramatic relief” for first-time home buyers.
University of North Florida political science professor Michael Binder says that the obvious parallel in assessing Jolly’s candidacy is with Crist, who left the Republican Party to become an independent during his last year as governor in 2010, ultimately losing a Senate bid to Marco Rubio. He officially became a Democrat in 2012 and lost two bids for governor: In 2014 by one point to Rick Scott, and in 2022 to DeSantis by 19 points (in between he served in what had been Jolly’s congressional seat for six years).
“Charlie Crist was unable to connect with base Democrats and get them to the polls,” Binder says of the 2022 contest. “If Jolly can do that, and that’s going to be a challenge being a former Republican, then maybe you might have a race that was closer. You might get a race that’s in the single digits. But if this is a similar circumstance where Democrats are not motivated, if Jolly cannot connect with the base of the Democratic Party, then there’s absolutely no chance.”
Binder adds that Pizzo’s likely entry as an independent means that both he and Jolly would be taking up what he calls a “moderate, non-MAGA type with maybe some Republican leanings” that are occupying the same ideological lane.
So far, the Florida GOP doesn’t seem too concerned.
“David Jolly has lost before, and he will lose again,” said Republican Party of Florida Chairman Evan Power in a statement issued earlier this week. “Floridians won’t trust a slick opportunist who simply can’t be trusted. Jolly has no platform, no base, and no chance in Florida.”
Jolly says while Trump’s actions in the White House will dominate the news headlines over the next year and-a-half, his campaign will be about making Florida better for everyone.
“It’s about responsibly delivering government and providing for safe communities and good schools and a property insurance and property tax construct that actually works … If that’s what we’re talking about for the next 16 months? Then we become a coalition for change and Republicans are offering more of the same, and we win the race.”

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Who knew there were this many things that had to be fixed?
The legislative sessions in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Washington are over. Depending on your political perspective, the benefits — or damages — will be felt for years to come.
One thing that isn’t in dispute? Lawmakers couldn’t help but introduce a record number of bills in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. Washington may also be added to that list, depending on what happens in the second part of its biennium.
More pieces of legislation were prepared for Idaho’s 2025 session than in the last 30 years

In Idaho, lawmakers introduced nearly 800 pieces of legislation — the highest mark going back at least 16 years. Less than 50% of the legislation actually made it across the finish line.
Higher numbers are expected in Idaho, as lawmakers now individually introduce and approve every state department budget, rather than just one large state budget.
Still, the numbers are staggering, not only for lawmakers who work at the state capitol, but also for citizens who try to follow the session and be involved in the process. Making it more challenging in Idaho is the sometimes minimal lack of notice regarding hearings for bills that have been introduced. We’ve recommended that lawmakers commit to a Rule of Three to allow citizens more time to be engaged.
In Montana, lawmakers also hit a record of 1,761 bills introduced, with a little more than half being signed into law by Gov. Greg Gianforte.
Montana’s joint Rule 40-40 “allows members of the Montana Legislature to request an unlimited number of bill or resolution drafts before December 5. After that date, a member may request the Legislative Council to prepare no more than seven bills or resolutions. Unused requests by one member may be granted to another member. The limits do not apply to code commissioner bills or committee bills.”
In Wyoming, which divides sessions among general session years and budget years, lawmakers also hit a record of 556 bills introduced. But only 31% became law.
Washington state lawmakers were by far the least productive, passing only 19.5% of the more than 2,000 bills they introduced. And they’re not done yet, as Washington works on a biennium and lawmakers will return next January to continue increasing the number.
Passing legislation certainly isn’t a contest. And this column is in no way an encouragement to increase the across-the-finish-line percentages.
But it is worth pointing out that introducing legislation takes time and resources — resources that are provided by taxpayers (so perhaps a new state rock shouldn’t be high on a lawmaker’s list). More bill introductions also make tracking your elected official’s work more difficult.
Some states, including Arizona, California, New Jersey, Colorado, North Carolina, Florida, North Dakota, Indiana, Louisiana and Montana have sought to restrict how many bills a legislator can introduce each session.
Do all states need a rule that limits a lawmaker’s appetite for more and more legislation? Maybe. But we’d rather see a self-imposed diet.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Thirteen of Tennessee’s 33 senators declared a conflict of interest before voting on a $1.9 billion business tax break in 2024, including one whose companies reaped the benefits of the cut and a prior state grant.
Two years before winning the seat in 2018, Republican Sen. Shane Reeves of Murfreesboro received a million-dollar FastTrack grant from the state Department of Economic and Community Development when he opened TwelveStone Health Partners in Rutherford County in 2016. The company invested nearly $15 million to create 200 jobs for the packaged medication, healthcare services and medication equipment company. 
A pharmacist by trade, Reeves started the business after he and his former business partner, Rick Sain, sold Reeves-Sain Drugstore and EnTrustRx, a specialty pharmacy business, to Fred’s Inc. for $66 million. TwelveStone has expanded several times over nine years, opening infusion centers in multiple locations, including Virginia and Georgia.



Senators declaring a conflict of interest with tax rebate bill:

Paul Bailey, R-Sparta
Ferrell Haile, R-Gallatin
Joey Hensley, R-Hohenwald
Jack Johnson, R-Franklin
Adam Lowe, R-Calhoun
Jon Lundberg, R-Bristol (no longer in office)
Bill Powers, R-Clarksville
Kerry Roberts, R-Springfield
Paul Rose, R-Covington
John Stevens, R-Huntingdon
Page Walley, R-Savannah
Bo Watson, R-Hixson
Dawn White, R-Murfreesboro
Ken Yager, R-Kingston



Nearly a decade later, TwelveStone Health Partners and TwelveStone Holdings are two of 16,000 Tennessee businesses receiving a franchise tax refund of more than $10,000 after Republican lawmakers pushed the measure backed by Gov. Bill Lee through the legislature last year.
Reeves told the Lookout this week that TwelveStone met all requirements for receiving the 2016 grant and now employs nearly 300 people. Asked whether he’s concerned about the appearance of double-dipping, Reeves described himself as a “part-time citizen legislator” the first four months of the year and chief executive officer of TwelveStone the rest of the time.
“My job is to do what’s best for our company. I would never expect any more or less for my business than anyone else’s,” Reeves said in a text statement.
Chairman of the Senate Energy, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, Reeves said he is “comfortable” with the reporting ranges in the refund law, calling them a “fair compromise” for transparency. 
Listings on the state Department of Revenue website show categories for companies receiving refunds up to $750, between $750 and $10,000 and more than $10,000. The lists totaling 60,000 companies were posted May 31 and are to remain available to the public for 30 days.
Senators were reluctant to publicize any of the companies when they took up the bill last year, passing it 25-6, with former Sen. Art Swann of Maryville the only Republican to vote in opposition. Two members did not vote.
But the House demanded some form of transparency, though Democrats and public records advocates say the ranges aren’t specific enough considering the amount of money rebated to some of the world’s largest companies, including FedEx and 13 subsidiaries, Ford Motor Co. and AT&T. The House passed the measure 69-23, largely along party lines.
The Tennessee Senate uses a policy called Rule 13 as part of its code of ethics that allows senators to declare a conflict of interest, without giving details, but allowing them to vote based on their conscience and obligation to constituents. The House has no rule requiring members to state a conflict of interest before votes that could affect them or their businesses financially.
In addition to Reeves, Democratic Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville, who voted against the tax cut and refund, declared Rule 13 before last year’s vote. 
World’s top businesses, Lee Company receive biggest Tennessee tax rebates

Yarbro told the Lookout this week he pulled out of the partnership track at Bass, Berry & Sims law firm so he wouldn’t be part of its financial decisions.
“I’m not opposed to any business or citizen taking a refund from the government. Who wouldn’t? If I qualified for a refund, I’d take it. But I still think it’s bad public policy,” Yarbro said in a statement to the Lookout.
Yarbro added that, while he felt the bill ran contrary to public interest, he understood it would benefit many businesses in his Senate district, including the firm where he works, thus he declared the potential conflict of interest before the vote. 
Yarbro and state Rep. John Ray Clemmons of Nashville also proposed a bill they said would enable the state’s franchise tax law to withstand constitutional muster without making rebates. Republican leaders declined to consider it.
When the matter arose last year, the Department of Revenue told lawmakers it received a challenge to the state’s franchise tax on business property, leading most to say the tax cut and refund was justified in averting an expensive legal fight. Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti also advised lawmakers to avoid litigation.
Other key legislators such as House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland said the reductions were simply good tax policy and not necessarily based on concern about a legal threat. No lawsuit was filed against the state in advance of the vote.
Republican Sen. Brent Taylor, former owner of Brentwood Funeral Services in Shelby County, voted for the measure last year after declaring Rule 13 but didn’t apply for the tax refund.
“I just didn’t think it was appropriate for me to have voted for the franchise tax cut and then go out and benefit from it, because I knew I’d have reporters … calling and wanting to know if I thought it was appropriate to take the refund and also vote for it,” Taylor said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shane-Reeves001-copy-1024x706.jpg,,,2025-06-05 06:03:40.764489

They did not choose their parents. They did not choose to be born into poverty. They do not get to choose if a parent is addicted to drugs or alcohol.

Wisconsin is one of only six states that doesn't put any money into early childhood education. (Photo by Kate Rindy)Children are born into this world innocent. They did not choose their parents. They did not choose to be born into poverty. They do not get to choose if a parent is addicted to drugs or alcohol. Children do not get a choice to be born into an environment of neglect. Children do not choose to grow up in a home with violence. Children do not get a choice to be abused or assaulted. Children do not choose to be born with a disability. Children do not get to choose if they can access medical care. Children do not get a choice on whether they are even wanted or loved. 
Adults do have choices. In Wisconsin, we  have chosen to have a state where children are the largest demographic living in poverty. We have chosen to allow some children to live with constant hunger. We have chosen not to support children with disabilities. We are still choosing not  to create systems to support children who have experienced adversity like abuse and neglect. We made the choice to create an education system based on the income of the people living in the community. We choose to allow children to be uncared for. We as a community have made these choices deliberately and without shame. 
Consequently, we have chosen for those children to be  less likely to graduate from high school, more likely to fail at a job, have poor health (which is connected to stress in the early years) and to be statistically more likely to be placed in the prison system. 
We, as a state, have chosen to prioritize funding for  prisons and spend nothing on early care and education, one of only six states that don’t invest a penny in early childhood programs, even though we know that when children have access to quality early education that they are more likely to graduate high school, have higher incomes, be healthier, and are less likely to enter the prison system. We have chosen to remove health care options for children by not expanding Badgercare. We are soon to be the only state that does not provide postpartum Medicaid, risking the lives of new mothers and  increasing the likelihood that children will have to grow up without them. We have decided that children with disabilities will receive services not based on their actual needs, but based on the budget  for special education, which our state keeps at the barest minimum. 
We have chosen to make the word “welfare” into a bad word. Welfare by definition is the health, happiness and fortunes of a person or group. And we have chosen to deny the health, happiness and fortune of children in our state. Referring to a bipartisan push for Medicaid expansion to cover postpartum care, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos has said he  “cannot imagine supporting an expansion of welfare.” Why is providing welfare to support the health and wellbeing of children or anyone for that matter a negative concept? Why are we so afraid that if we support people in need  that it somehow takes away from us? For example, why would providing children with free lunches at school be a bad thing to do? Why would ensuring that children have access to medical care regardless of whether their parents can afford it or not be bad to do? Why would ensuring that children have access to quality care and education in their early years, regardless of their parents’ income, be a bad thing? Why would ensuring that children with disabilities have access to the services they need be bad? Why is it wrong  to have systems in our state that ensure we are doing everything we can to give all children the best opportunities to grow, thrive and become productive members of our communities? 
Rep. Vos and Joint Finance Committee co-chairs Sen.Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), and Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) all disagree with creating and funding policies that support our children. Time and time again, they have voted down policies that would have provided support to children. They have continued to forgo our future by not investing in our children. Instead,  they invest in the wealthiest in our state and invest in our punitive prison systems. They invest in large businesses with expensive lobbyists who demand tax breaks and deregulation. They invest in those most likely to donate to their campaigns. These grown-up white men cannot stand the idea of anyone, even a child, getting help from the state. If they had to pay for school lunch, they figure, so should  everyone else. If they had to pay for their child’s medical visit, then so should everyone else. If they had to pay for child care, then so should everyone else. They are incapable of seeing past their privileges. They cannot appreciate what it is like to be a child born into an environment that causes  harm and the trajectory that puts the child on. However, they will certainly be there when that child becomes an adult and enters the prison system. They are more than willing to pay for incarceration and punishment. 
That’s not just financially irresponsible — we spend about four times as much to keep someone in prison as we spend on education —  it’s inhumane, and it impoverishes our state and condemns children to unnecessary suffering and a bleak future.

By a 4-3 majority, the court awarded attorney fees to the plaintiffs in Montana Environmental Information Center and Earthworks vs. Office of the Governor. This is certainly not an unheard-of occurrence; other cases have reached the same conclusion. 
In reaching this conclusion, the majority reversed the district court’s denial of attorney fees.  That’s not unusual either. 
Here’s what distinguishes this case in the eyes of the dissenting justices: The majority had the temerity to offer guidance in what has been a confusing and inconsistent area of the law. 
Here’s the skinny: The plaintiffs asked the governor for copies of a wide range of documents. After about five months of dilly-dallying, the governor denied the request. The plaintiffs sued,  relying on the right-to-know provision of the Montana constitution (Article II, Section 9). They  won. 
When the plaintiffs filed to recover attorney fees for their litigation, district court denied the  request. In the view of the district judge, the governor’s Office “did not act out of bad faith,  indolence, or unreasonable delay.” This denial was at issue before the Supreme Court. 
In the 61 pages of ensuing verbiage, one nugget shines. It’s a simple, single-sentence statute: 	
    

 
2-3-221. Costs to prevailing party in certain actions to enforce constitutional right to know. A  person alleging a deprivation of rights who prevails in an action brought in district court to  enforce the person’s rights under Article II, section 9, of the Montana constitution may be  awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees.
 

In statutory interpretation, the word “may” carries clear meaning: The district court has discretion  to decide whether to award the costs and fees. In order to reverse that decision, the Supreme  Court must determine that district court abused its discretion. 
At the onset of the majority opinion, Justice Laurie McKinnon wrote, “When a party succeeds in  litigation based on a right to know request, it has performed a public service in ensuring that  Montana’s government is appropriately transparent and accountable to the people.” 
This statement follows precedent in at least two other cases (Bozeman Daily Chronicle v. City of  Bozeman Police Department (1993), Associated Press, et al. v. Montana Department of Revenue  (2000)). So far, so good.
On this basis, the majority took the next step: “A presumption towards awarding fees when a  plaintiff vindicates their constitutional right to know follows naturally in the context of the  right.” 
This is what set the dissenters’ teeth on edge. Justice Jim Rice’s dissent said the majority “abandons actual law and backfills the vacuum with its own creation made of whole cloth.” 
I don’t see it. In fact, Justice James Jeremiah Shea pointed out that “both this Court and the United States Supreme Court have long recognized, on a number of occasions, the necessity of creating  frameworks to guide the discretion of lower courts in applying statutory awards of attorney  fees.” 
Well, reasonable people can (and should) disagree. What puzzles me was Justice Rice’s swerve into accusing the majority of bias against a Republican administration and partisan weaponizing of the law. Where did that come from? 
When Justice McKinnon took the unusual step of responding to Rice’s “highly inappropriate  and unprofessional attack,” Chief Justice Cory Swanson weighed in. His self-proclaimed in-depth  reading of Shea’s dissent found “nothing offensive or personal in his criticism.” 
I find that artificially ingenuous and doubly repugnant. 
McKinnon wrote a well reasoned majority opinion that furthers our understanding of the right to know. It deserves respect rather than ridicule.

Patrick Morrisey held a ceremonial bill signing for Senate Bill 765, which establishes a Troops to Teachers program on Wednesday, May 21, 2025 at Hedgesville Middle School in Hedgesville, W.Va. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)As a former educator at the high school and college levels, my interest in public and private and collegiate avenues of acquiring knowledge through education remains steadfast, even though I no longer teach; instead, I write books and commentaries that I hope will not only resonate with my readers but make a difference (however slight) in the way they see the world around them, asking, “What can I do? What will my contribution be to minimizing the escalating concerns that plague educational institutions and the teachers who deliver that knowledge?”
And if all we do is look at the overwhelming task, we’ve already been defeated in answering those questions. Yes, the issues are countless and to tackle any single one of them is a monumental task. Still, we can take that thousand piece puzzle and break it down, one piece at a time or better still, put it together one piece at a time.
As I read of education’s global concerns, I also make certain to read of what is happening in my own backyard, from what the new administration didn’t do this past legislative session for students and schools and teachers to what they did do: school vaccines, for instance. 
The powers that be continue to push aside the very real teacher vacancies that continue to escalate. Recently, Amelia Ferrell Knisely reported that Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill creating “Troops to Teachers,” in an attempt to address West Virginia’s teacher shortage, a program that aims to put veterans in the classroom. He called the program a “common sense solution.”
Let’s remind ourselves that one reason for the teacher shortage in West Virginia is low teacher pay, compared to surrounding states. Until that discrepancy is remedied, the exodus of teachers in West Virginia will continue to rise. And the multi-leveled, arduous journey for these veterans to become certified teachers might reach beyond common sense. In fact, there’s a bit more to it than that.
George Bernard Shaw is credited with the phrase, “Those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” In fact though, it was Aristotle who first said, “Those that can, do; those that understand, teach.” There’s a world of difference between the two sentiments. Shaw suggests that teachers are those who don’t know or haven’t learned their discipline. It’s absurd, and my suggestion would be to not repeat those words to an educator. Let’s be clear: teachers are highly skilled and experienced in their fields, with strong communication, interpersonal and pedagogical skills. The profession involves planning, delivering lessons and assessing student learning. It’s a teacher’s ability to articulate and explain complex concepts clearly, not simply perform a task, that educates and enlightens.  And if we, as students, are very fortunate, it is those very teachers who choose that profession in order to share their knowledge and passion with us that catapult us to our highest heights, giving us every possible opportunity to excel and succeed. 
I’m often asked why, in my commentaries, do I never offer a solution to a problem. Why do I focus only on the human factor? My answer never changes. I hone in on the human factor because I’m a humanist, because if I didn’t stay true to my core, then I would in fact be doing a disservice to those high school and college and graduate school professors who made certain that my liberal arts education was as well-rounded as they could impart. And until each and every one of us recognizes and prioritizes this undeniable truth, we cannot begin the journey to heal the wounds that scar each of us. Too, I will not disrespect my teachers or myself by even putting forth a viable solution to problems for which I’m not qualified. Are you following me? 
I know that Harvard University is under the spotlight right now, but I’ve always maintained that my West Virginia education could stand with pride alongside any other respected institution of higher learning. There are countless individuals (particularly those occupying offices of power) who can and must implement programs and support educators to make certain that not only I can continue to speak those words of praise but that every learned student to follow me can say them with pride as well.
There’s a great line from the movie “Cold Mountain,” when an aged woman who lives isolated in the mountains kills a goat in order to help an escaped soldier heal: “Bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed, [expels] the seed out, plant grows. Bird’s got a job, [seed’s] got a job. And you’ve got a job.” Can we please — each of us — do our job, rather than being so self-absorbed and concerned with who gets credit for what. As elementary as it may sound, let’s work together. It’s the only way progress moves forward.  Who cares who gets credit? Shouldn’t the only thing that matters be that the job got done?

(Capital-Star file)Pennsylvania schools would be required to integrate child abuse awareness and prevention into their curriculum under a bill being proposed in the state House of Representatives.
“We need to educate (children) when they are young. Sometimes by second grade, it’s already too late. They’ve already been abused. But at least if they hear the program and they get it, we can then provide them with help,” said Abbie Newman, CEO of global and external affairs at Mission Kids Child Advocacy Center in Norristown.
Newman testified Tuesday at a hearing for the legislation before the House Children and Youth Committee.
No votes happened. Just an informational hearing with expert testimony. That’s the furthest the measure has gone, though, with versions introduced during every legislative session since 2019.
More than half of states already require schools to teach child abuse awareness and prevention, according to the bill’s sponsor state Rep. Mary Jo Daley (D-Montgomery).
The Department of Education would jointly develop the age-appropriate curriculum for students in kindergarten through high school with another state agency (likely Human Services) under the current version of House Bill 460, according to legislative researcher Ryan Kline.
“We want to make sure we get this right,” he said, noting the legislation probably will change.
Proponents emphasized the need to engage experts — such as local child advocacy centers certified to provide preventative education — to help develop and deliver the curriculum. That could mitigate unintended consequences like traumatizing students and adding to the already overwhelming workload of public school teachers and faculty, they said. 
They also advised modeling evidence-based programs such as the Safe and Health Communities Initiative recently highlighted in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Researchers found rates of both substantiated and unsubstantiated child sexual abuse reports dropped after they’d implemented a three-pronged intervention in schools and surrounding communities across five counties in Pennsylvania. They reached nearly 15,000 second graders in the classroom and more than 14,000 adults through a combination of formal training and public education campaigns during 2018 through 2020.
Asked how to improve the bill, one expert said a two-year launch seemed rushed.
“This is too important an issue,” said Benjamin Levi, a professor in the departments of humanities and pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine. “As a pediatrician, I’ve dealt with both reporting [and] the long-term consequences. As a researcher, I’ve looked at these issues. As someone who’s developed educational programs, I know how hard it is to implement this. So I just want to caution that as we move forward, we need to be careful, deliberate, and evidence-based.”
Levi noted, for example, the potential for reporting to increase. That could overwhelm the state’s ChildLine reporting conduit if it remains resourced as is. He pointed out that ChildLine has about half the staff of its counterparts in Illinois and Michigan, which have comparable populations.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/state-capitol-harrisburg-copy-1024x460.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 06:03:40.764489

(Stock photo by Matt Gush/Getty Images)The North Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee voted in favor of a bill Wednesday that would expand state requirements for sheriffs to detain undocumented immigrants for retrieval by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The bill, known as House Bill 318 or “the Criminal Illegal Alien Enforcement Act,” passed the North Carolina House in April and is now set for a vote by the Senate Rules Committee Thursday morning. It represents a continuation of the detention requirements passed in November under House Bill 10.
Rep. Carson Smith (R-Pender), a former sheriff, described the bill as an attempt to “clarify and make a few changes” to the law after seeing it in effect. HB 318 would expand the requirement for verifying immigration status from a specific set of felonies to all felonies as well as any impaired driving offenses. It also modifies the requirements for releasing individuals in custody under ICE detention orders.
Under the proposed law, a judge or magistrate would inquire into the immigration status of any defendant charged with a felony or impaired driving offense at their pretrial release hearing. If their status cannot be determined, they would be held for an additional two hours after an inquiry to ICE on whether they are subject to any detention orders.
“If an ICE detainer and warrant is received, they’re taken to the judicial official, probably the magistrate, to determine that they are the person that is subject to that detainer and that administrative warrant,” Smith said. “If they are, they will be held up to 48 hours after whatever point they would otherwise be released for ICE to come pick them up.”
Democrats and members of the public spoke out against the bill, arguing that it damages rather than furthers public safety. Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) said she believes the requirements violate the U.S. Constitution, given that they would require sheriffs to carry out the ICE hold even when the individual in question has been exonerated or had their charges dismissed.
“We’re talking about keeping people where the state has no constitutional interest in holding them,” Grafstein said.
Under the terms of the existing law, sheriffs must only hold individuals in custody for 48 hours after the ICE detention order is received. The new proposal would require a 48-hour hold beginning when they would otherwise be released from custody.
Sen. Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said the proposal also violates the rights of crime victims, preventing them from getting justice if the offender is subject to deportation.
“As a victim myself, I wanted my day in court to testify against my offender, which I had the ability to do,” Batch said. “This new change would mean that if he were here and there was an ICE detainer, he would then be deported prior to the time of which I would have my day in court.”
Mary Ross, an activist with Democracy Out Loud who spoke during the public comment period, said deporting someone based only on allegations of a crime is “a really cruel way to treat people.”
“They’re people who are our neighbors, and most of whom are working hard, doing great work with us,” Ross said. “I just object to, essentially, judge and jury — the police officer arrests somebody and, boom, they’re a convicted criminal and a prisoner and they’re gone.”
The bill passed the Judiciary Committee hours before another bill on immigration, Senate Bill 153, passed the House. That measure, the “North Carolina Border Protection Act,” now heads to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk for his consideration.

At the heart of the push is Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, a biofuel derived from sources like corn grain, municipal solid waste, wet waste, and agricultural residues. Though not yet widely used, SAF is gaining traction thanks to its lower emissions and growing interest from regional policymakers.
The aviation industry has yet to fully embrace the alternative fuel, largely due to the high cost of production and limited infrastructure for storage costs. But with international interest rising and U.S. climate policies shifting, local leaders remain hopeful that a wider transition is on the horizon.
In the first three quarters of 2024, U.S. production of SAF reached 30 million gallons — a sharp increase of just five million in 2021, according to recent data collected by the U.S. Department of Energy.
“I’m very optimistic about its ability to survive because it goes straight to the farmers, and it is really about American-made products,” said Ed Hubbard, general counsel and vice president of governmental affairs for the Renewable Fuels Association. “If you can fall within the framework of ‘American energy, greatness and dominance,’ I think that those are the aspects that survive throughout the process.”
Hubbard warned that if the Trump administration withdraws incentives for SAF, it would contradict its own America First Investment Policy — a doctrine designed to pressure companies into manufacturing domestically instead of overseas.
On Tuesday, Hubbard joined a panel discussion in Washington, D.C., focused on raising awareness about SAF. The event highlighted the formation of a working group, a directory of aviation-related associations, and plans for a traveling presentation aimed at engaging government and aviation leaders.

The panel was hosted by the Greater Washington Region Clean Cities Coalition (GWRCCC), which works to promote affordable, local transportation fuels, energy-efficient mobility systems, and other fuel-saving practices. 
The federal government developed a strategy to encourage the commercial-scale production of SAF through a plan called the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge.
Under President Joe Biden’s administration, the initiative set primary goals to reduce costs, bolster energy security, and significantly increase the production and use of SAF. Key targets include achieving a 50% reduction in life cycle emissions compared to traditional fuels and meeting production milestones of three billion gallons annually by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050 — enough to meet all domestic demand.
Given the significant impact of jet travel on the environment, advocates hope SAF can help mitigate the pollution it causes. In 2022, aviation accounted for 2% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and that share is expected to grow. The agency noted that aviation has experienced faster growth in recent decades than rail, road, and shipping.
“They pollute the environment, and the closer you live to those environments, the more negative it is on public health,” said Antoine Thompson, CEO and executive director for GWRCCC.
Data provided by GWRCCC at Tuesday’s meeting showed a combined 622 private and public airports between Maryland and Virginia.
Virginia began considering sustainability strategies at its airports earlier than other states. The commonwealth has a total of 406 public and private airports, 400 of which are privately owned.
In July 2016, the Virginia Department of Aviation (VDOA) commissioned the Virginia Airports Sustainability Management Plan — a voluntary guide for Virginia’s public airports to define their own sustainability priorities and needs.
Rusty Harrington, chief planner with VDOA, was one of the contributors to the plan. 
“We have so many people that are working in parallel, and (the meeting) has been an opportunity for us to see what everyone else is working on and find some mutual common ground opportunities,” Harrington said.
Beyond SAF, Harrington noted that researchers also exploring advancements in engine technology, as well as the use of using electrification and hydrogen resources.
As for Virginia’s role in environmental stewardship, Harrington said the commonwealth is taking it very seriously.
“We want to protect the resources that we have, and we want to lessen our impacts in almost every activity we do — from design, construction, operation, maintenance of our airports — with the goal of securing and balancing the economic, the environmental and the social impacts of any of our actions,” Harrington said. “We like to think we’re doing a very good job of that because it’s inherent in whatever we do in airport development.”
The coalition has not yet set a date for a future meeting.

New legislation proposed by Virginia’s Capitol Hill lawmakers and their colleagues could prevent cost-sharing for prenatal, childbirth, neonatal, perinatal and postpartum care, keeping families from being saddled with big bills after birth. 
U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, remembers the stress and fear of dealing with placenta previa, a life-threatening maternal condition, when carrying her second child, Samantha. Her placenta wasn’t in the right position, placing her and her fetus at risk and spurring a cesarean section birth and neonatal intensive care unit stay for the baby once it was born. She also remembers the extra medical costs that were associated with managing the condition to keep both herself and her daughter alive. 
The condition is rare but tricky if it develops later in pregnancy as McClellan’s did, and exemplifies how costly maternal care can be, especially if there are complications or emergencies. Bipartisan and bicameral legislation she helped create would provide birth-related benefits similar to the ones offered by Medicaid to Americans who are covered by private health insurance.
Reducing out-of-pocket costs like copays can help more families stay on top of monitoring conditions to prevent crises and be better able to respond when they do arise, McClellan said.
“The idea here is this will help get more people in for prenatal and preventative care so that hopefully you will have fewer emergencies,” McClellan explained. 
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, said if the measure becomes law, it would represent a big shift in maternal health care for the country. 
“Childbirth should be free in the United States, and that’s a big idea,” Kaine said , who is a co-patron of the Senate version of the bill. 
That’s already the case in some countries, while in others like Finland, France and Great Britain, costs are curbed for expecting families and efforts to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates have proven successful.
Applying the concept to America is something that Vice President J.D. Vance (who also serves as president of the Senate) has previously been on board with, Kaine said. 
Last year, Kaine workshopped the idea with then-Sen. Vance before he was tapped to be President Donald Trump’s running mate. Kaine then connected with Sens. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Mississippi, Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, to introduce the bill this year. 
“Bringing a child into the world is costly enough without piling on cost-share fees that saddle many mothers and families with debt,” Hyde-Smith said in a statement announcing the legislation. “By relieving financial stresses associated with pregnancy and childbirth, hopefully more families will be encouraged to embrace the beautiful gift and responsibility of parenthood.” 
The House and Senate versions of the bill can unify the “left and the right, the ‘pro-choice’ and the ‘pro-life,’” Kaine said, adding that the measures could fare well in the nation’s legislative branch and end up on Trump’s desk.

Getty Images.The Ohio Senate’s version of the state’s two-year budget would reduce the number of students who would be eligible to receive the Governor’s Merit Scholarship and it would come with strings attached. 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship currently awards the top 5% of each high school graduating class a $5,000 scholarship each year to attend an Ohio college or university. The Senate’s version of the budget would reduce it to the top 2% of each high school starting with the 2027 fiscal year.

The Senate also added a provision requiring students who receive the scholarship to stay in Ohio for three years immediately after graduation. Students attending graduate school would be an exception, but the expectation would remain that they would come back to Ohio for three years after graduate school, said Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon.
“Part of the reasoning for that is we want to keep our best and brightest in Ohio,” McColley said. “It stands to reason that if we want to keep them in Ohio, we should actually require them to stay in Ohio post-graduation.”
If a student who received the Governor’s Merit Scholarship moved out of the state within those three years after graduating, they would have to pay back a portion of the aid they received, McColley said.
“We do want some teeth to that,” he said.
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said the three-year requirement would be almost impossible to implement. 
“I think it would be extraordinarily difficult to police saying you must stay in Ohio for three years,” Huffman said. “I suppose we can try to penalize them and all that.”
Todd Jones, president and general counsel of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Ohio (AICUO), said he is open to the state’s three year retention after graduation. 
“We’re very sympathetic to the need of the state to help retain people in Ohio who are getting financial assistance,” he said. “We wouldn’t oppose it not being there, but it’s certainly a judgment call for the legislature to make on that, and we’re sympathetic to their desire to keep folks in Ohio.”
The Senate’s version of the budget eliminated provisions the Ohio House added regarding additional requirements for private colleges to continue to participate in the Governor’s Merit Scholarship. 
The House had added language to the budget that would have required private colleges to comply with parts of Senate Bill 1 — Ohio’s new higher education law that bans diversity and inclusion efforts and regulates classroom discussion, among other things. 
Jones was happy that was nixed from the budget. 
“It’s important that we retain students in Ohio and keep our best and brightest here,” Jones said. 
The Senate decided to take that language out of the budget after hearing concerns from many private universities, McColley said. 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship was enacted through the last state budget two years ago and 76% of the state’s 6,250 eligible students from the class of 2024 accepted the scholarship. Eighty-seven percent of Ohio students accepted the scholarship in its second year and 11 rural counties had a 100% acceptance rate. 
The Senate’s version of the budget trims how much money is allocated to the scholarships. It keeps it at $47 million for fiscal year 2026, but reduces it to $56.4 million in fiscal year 2027. Gov. Mike DeWine’s and the House’s version of the budget allocated $70 million for fiscal year 2027. 
Senate Bill 1 compliance
The Senate’s version of the budget ties a portion of the State Share of Instruction to compliance with Senate Bill 1. 
“We wanted to make sure that everybody at the university level was following through with the conditions and regulations in Senate Bill 1,” said Ohio Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland. “We have the ability to decide how we’re going to fund things. … If they are viewed as in compliance, nothing will be withheld from their SSI share, which would be their normal proportion of the SSI dollars.”
Huffman said he supports tying a portion of the State Share of Instruction to compliance with S.B. 1. 
“If the universities aren’t going to apply state law then there needs to be some incentive to make sure that they do,” he said. 
House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, is against tying State Share of Instruction to compliance with S.B. 1. 
“I firmly oppose S.B. 1, so tying more compliance to S.B. 1, which I think is an extremely flawed piece of legislation, obviously we oppose that portion,” she said. 
Senate Minority Leader Nickie J. Antonio, D-Lakewood, said she thinks the provision is outrageous. 
“It’s also following the pattern that we’re seeing at the national level of intimidation and bullying, frankly, telling people that if you don’t comply with what we say, then we’ll just punish you and we’ll withhold money,” she said.

After a pandemic-era pause, repayments on defaulted student loans restarted last month, and many borrowers are running into barriers. (Photo by Seth Wenig/The Associated Press)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
Universities try 3-year degrees to save students time, money

When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.











These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.


– Celina Damian, California student loan servicing ombudsperson



Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
‘Can’t wait for Washington’
Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
More public colleges admit high schoolers even before they’ve applied

Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
Repayment
Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
Transparency bills seek to reveal the true costs of college

“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
‘Incentive to hike prices’
Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

(Photo: Greg Childress) The state Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved legislation meant to help the state’s struggling child care industry. 
House Bill 412 would allow larger class sizes in child care centers if the staff-to-child ratio stays the same.  
Child care center employees would be able qualify as lead teachers if they have five years of teaching experience as an alternative to a North Carolina Early Childhood Credential. 
The bill would also set up a workgroup on developing group liability insurance plans for child care providers. 
“A lot of child care centers are having trouble finding and keeping insurance,” said Sen. Jim Burgin (R-Harnett).
Child care businesses tend to operate on thin profit margins. At the same time, child care is unaffordable for many families. 
Child care centers face staff shortages that force them to limit enrollment. Wages are low and many workers do not have health insurance through their employers. 
The median wage for child care workers in the state was $11.69 in 2022, according to a report last year from the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment. More than 40% of early childhood educator households participated in safety net programs the report said.  
Legislators are focused on child care this year, with lawmakers considering increases in child care subsidies, and with an active task force Gov. Josh Stein assembled looking at questions of child care financing and funding, child care for the public sector workforce, and child care worker compensation.
Wide swaths of the state are considered child care deserts. Rural families are more likely to use home-based child care or have friends and family watch their children, according to the NC Early Childhood Foundation. 
House Bill 309, which makes it clear that for building-code purposes, home-based child care should be treated as a residence and not commercial building, also passed the Senate unanimously.

If you get a chance, check out a recent essay authored by retired Legislative Fiscal Analyst Richard Bostic. It was posted by Raleigh’s News & Observer.
In it, Bostic, who spent 31 years advising state legislative leaders, issues a loud and clear warning about the fiscal cliff toward which our state is speeding.
His simple and straightforward message: it’s imperative that GOP lawmakers rethink their massive, planned cuts to corporate and personal income taxes.
And his reasoning is equally straightforward.
Several core public structures and services – schools, state employee pay and retiree benefits, infrastructure – are already inadequate even as our population is growing and aging.
Now add the looming threats of climate change, federal funding cuts and an economic downturn and the picture grows even more ominous.
The bottom line: As Bostic observes, delaying or repealing planned tax cuts isn’t just about balancing a spreadsheet — it’s about protecting our schools, our infrastructure and our people. State lawmakers should heed this insightful warning.

Photo: Morgan Trau, WEWSOhio Republican senators have proposed a flat income tax for the state’s top earners, which would result in a projected $1 billion loss in the general revenue fund.
Bailey Williams is like the average Ohioan — earning less than six figures a year. According to census data, the median income in the state is about $68,000. He’s worried about the Senate’s newly proposed state budget.
“The services that made me who I am today, public education made me who I am today. I worry about those opportunities being there for my younger siblings,” Williams said.
He is also a researcher with the nonpartisan organization Policy Matters Ohio and is evaluating a budget provision — one that creates a flat income tax of 2.75%.
There are three income tax brackets in Ohio. Those making up to $26,000 do not need to pay state income tax. Ohioans earning between $26,000 and $100,000 pay a tax of 2.75%. Those making more than $100,000 have to pay 3.5%.
Senate President Rob McColley (R-Napoleon) said that the highest earners in the state will have their income tax payment reduced to 2.75%.
“Every tax cut we do in the future will involve every single person equally, on a percentage basis,” McColley said.
State data reveals that this could result in a loss of about $1.1 billion in the General Revenue Fund.
How would Ohio make up the deficit from the tax?
“One of two ways,” Williams said. “We’re going to see increases in regressive taxes, most likely the sales tax, or we have to make do with less — less government services.”
Many cuts for programs that benefit lower-income families have already been proposed in the budget. Funding for schools, Medicaid, libraries, lead abatement, food banks and child care face funding decreases from the current status or from the governor’s budget.
When McColley was asked how he defends cuts to Medicaid, lead poisoning prevention and child care while allowing a lower tax rate for wealthier Ohioans, he said the “growth in Medicaid spending has been exponential.”
According to the Legislative Service Commission, a nonpartisan agency that works with the legislature, the proposed budget would result in a 4% decrease in spending, with billions of dollars in cuts.
He said that there was already an “awful lot” of lead program funding and said that they were keeping child care the same as before. However, the budget would cut the governor’s proposal of offering Publicly Funded Child Care to families earning up to 160% of the federal poverty level, keeping it at the current 145% threshold.
“No multimillionaire needs a $10,000 tax cut bankrolled by cutting lead abatement or Medicaid,” Williams said.
McColley said the elimination of 11% of the state’s income tax revenue would not actually impact funding because he predicts companies will move to Ohio to take advantage of that lower tax rate.
“A lower tax burden has had a positive economic development and brought more jobs to the state,” McColley said. “It’s brought more investment in the state.”
The budget will continue to be heard, and a final version will need to be agreed upon by the Senate and House by the end of June.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Following retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter’s passing last month, commentators memorialized the justice with appreciations of his analytical acumen and commitment to the role of neutral arbiter. 
Steven Vladeck, for instance, praised Souter for “just how seriously he took his job as a justice — and a judge.” At the same time, however, as longtime Supreme Court observer Linda Greenhouse noted in The New York Times, Souter’s “name was on so few significant opinions and his profile at the court was so low that after his first few years, legal academia essentially stopped paying attention to him.”
Not all of legal academia. 
Among scholars who study state courts and state constitutions, Souter was notable for the experience at the state level that he brought with him to the Supreme Court. During his tenure as a member of New Hampshire’s highest court, that court contributed to the development of state constitutional law in significant ways. The Granite State stood at the forefront of the jurisprudential phenomenon known as the “new judicial federalism” — the practice of state courts interpreting the individual rights provisions of their own constitutions independently of the Supreme Court’s rulings on the parallel protections contained in the federal Bill of Rights.
The new judicial federalism was inspired, in large part, by an essay published in the Harvard Law Review in 1977. Alarmed by the extent to which the Supreme Court was retreating from the robust protection of individual rights under the federal constitution, Supreme Court Justice William Brennan reminded readers that “State constitutions, too, are a font of individual liberties, their protections often extending beyond those required by the Supreme Court’s interpretation of federal law.” 
In other words, individuals and advocates should consider, in appropriate cases, the depth and reach of state constitutional individual rights provisions.
The New Hampshire Supreme Court heard Brennan’s call. In its 1983 decision in State v. Ball, the high court held that, when state constitutional issues are properly raised, the state courts have “a responsibility to make an independent determination of the protections afforded in the New Hampshire Constitution.” To ignore this obligation, the court continued, would be to fail in the duty to defend the state constitution, which in turn would undermine “the federalism that must be so carefully safeguarded by our people.”
A commitment to the independent interpretation of the state constitution necessarily entails the development of approaches and modes of analysis suited to that particular constitutional context, which Justice Souter recognized in a 1986 case, State v. Bradberry. Souter had been appointed to the high court when the court issued its opinion in Ball, but he did not participate in the decision. Bradberry thus presented an opportunity for him to explain the stakes for state constitutional law in individual rights cases: “If we place too much reliance on federal precedent,” he wrote, “we will render the State rules a mere row of shadows; if we place too little, we will render State practice incoherent. If we are going to steer between these extremes, we will have to insist on developed advocacy from those who bring the cases before us.”
Justice Souter’s plea for support from the bar in state constitutional cases continues to resonate. In our treatise on state constitutional law, “The Law of American State Constitutions,” my co-author Bob Williams and I referred to Souter’s opinion in Bradberry as a definitive statement on the matter. In the book, we echoed the perspective articulated in his opinion: State courts that rely wholly on federal law in interpreting their state constitutional rights protections risk diminishing those protections, while too little respect for federal precedent risks isolating a state’s law from the larger, national discourse about the meaning of common individual rights provisions.
His experience with state constitutional law and the new judicial federalism distinguished Justice Souter’s career from that of most of his fellow U.S. Supreme Court justices, and the New Hampshire Supreme Court’s commitment to fostering independent state constitutional interpretation in State v. Ball has distinguished it from other state courts. 
In Bradberry, Justice Souter maintained that the commitment represents but an initial step toward reckoning with state constitutional text. In ascertaining the meaning of the state’s charter, Souter advised, the state’s courts should expect to rely on counsel representing each side of a case to illuminate the text. 
Such advocacy allows judges to consider the full range of interpretive possibilities that may lie in particular provisions of the New Hampshire Constitution — and creates an alternative to relying exclusively on the views of nine judges in Washington, D.C., who are tasked with construing a similar but fundamentally different constitution",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/souterlegacy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 05:04:33.221669

Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, and Ohio Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced the Senate’s version of the budget Tuesday and it took out language the Ohio House added that would have changed the Housing Trust Fund, created in 1991 and administered by the Ohio Department of Development.

The Housing Trust Fund is funded by a portion of the fees collected by county recorders, with half of the fees staying with the county and the other half going back to the fund — which requires at least 50% of the funds be spent in non-urban areas. The House budget would have removed the requirement for county recorders to send the state Department of Development money to reallocate the funds, making it less effective across the state.
“We are incredibly thankful to our champions in the Senate who understand that the Ohio Housing Trust Fund is the state’s most powerful tool for fighting homelessness and expanding affordable housing,” Amy Riegel, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio, said in a statement. 
The Housing Trust Fund provided emergency shelter for more than 27,000 Ohioans last year, she said. 
The Senate added $100 million worth of housing provisions in the budget that will create two programs — the Residential Economic Development District grants and Residential Development Revolving Loan Program. 
The Residential Economic Development District is a $10 million program. 
“(This program) is aimed at going to areas where there is an awful lot of anticipated housing growth, particularly areas around major economic development projects, and incentivizing local governments around those areas to streamline their zoning codes, to put zoning codes in place, in some cases, that will allow for these housing projects to move forward more efficiently,” McColley said. 
The Residential Development Revolving Loan Program would support building new, single-family residential homes in rural parts of the state. The Senate’s budget would direct $90 million into a revolving loan fund for local governments to finance the program. 
“What we’re seeing in many rural parts of the state are areas where it is simply uneconomical for home developers to come in and build in many of our rural communities because of the fact that the cost of infrastructure is so onerous in those areas that the amount of homes they would need to build just to break even is simply way more than that local market can absorb,” McColley said.  
The Senate’s version of the budget would also move the Ohio Housing Finance Agency to under the Department of Development.
The budget now goes to a conference committee, where Senate and House leaders have closed-door negotiations to come up with a final budget. Both chambers have to pass the bill and it will then be sent to Gov. Mike DeWine, who must sign the budget by the end of the month.

(Getty Images)LGBTQ+ Pride Month in a red state tends to have a certain edge. Even the most earnest celebration of freedom and belonging can feel like one of those disposable plastic ponchos, quickly unwrapped to keep off the rain. You appreciate it, you value it, but it can’t last forever.
Yet us gay people persist in living across all 50 states, and in every country around the globe besides. We’re most definitely here in Kansas.
You can make a joke or two about the Wizard of Oz (heck, I even wrote a column about it), but we’re still here, we’re still queer, and we’re still asking everyone to get used to it. Rather than opine about the meaning of the exercise, I thought I’d kick off the month by highlighting eight LGBTQ+ Kansans. (A hat tip to our friends over at the Manhattan Mercury, who published a similar list last year.)
If I left off important folks, please let me know. We have a lot of June left!
 
Melissa Etheridge
The Leavenworth-born singer-songwriter rocketed to fame in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A husky-voiced rocker, she blazed trails by coming out publicly all the way back in 1992. She’s since recorded a live album at the Topeka Correctional Facility.


 
William S. Burroughs
Beat-adjacent writer Burroughs was born in St. Louis and notably lived in Tangiers and New York. He relocated to Lawrence in 1991, however, and lived there until his death in 1997. The city’s Burroughs Creek Trail now bears his name.


 
Rep. Sharice Davids
The state’s Democratic representative for the 3rd District made history in 2018 as the first LGBTQ+ and Native American member. She has now been re-elected three times, which perhaps should raise some eyebrows among national Dems.


 
Cassandra Peterson (Elvira)
Any child of the 1980s (and I was one) knows the vampy Elivira on sight. The woman below the wig was Manhattan-born Cassandra Peterson, who revealed her two-decade relationship with a woman in her 2021 memoir.


 
Janelle Monae
This Kansas City, Kansas, native first caught my husband’s eye through her 2010 album, “The ArchAndroid.” She has since recorded more albums, acted in movies and now identifies as nonbinary, using she/her or they/them pronouns.


 
Gilbert Baker
Born in Chanute and graduating from Parsons High School, Baker created the iconic rainbow pride flag in 1978. Queer icon Harvey Milk, the San Francisco politician and activist, asked him to do so. As an unwelcome note, the Trump administration plans to remove Milk’s name from a Navy ship. Just to show that Making America Great Again includes insulting a slain veteran.


 
Stephanie Byers
Former State Rep. Stephanie Byers of Wichita was elected in 2020 as the state’s first transgender lawmaker.  Suffice to say, she put up with an awful lot during her term in office. However, I found her grit and vibrant personality a constant inspiration.


 
Matthew Vines
The Wichita native Vines attended Harvard and caused a sensation by arguing that Christianity doesn’t condemn same-sex marriage or relationships. He founded the nonprofit Reformation Project and wrote the book “God and the Gay Christian.”


 
Bonus: your Kansas Reflector opinion editors
This might sound like a bit of a cheat, but so be it. Both founding Reflector opinion C.J. Janovy and yours truly have written about our community many times. Janovy even published a book on the subject. Listen, living here might not always be easy. But there’s still a heck of a lot to celebrate.
I plan to spend at least a bit of time doing just that.

Susan Collins (R-ME) delivers election night remarks to supporters and staff on Nov. 3, 2020 in Bangor, Maine. (Scott Eisen/Getty Images)Editor’s Note: This story is part of a series about U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ role during the second Trump presidency. 
The first time Biddeford resident Anthony Burgess could vote in 2014, he cast his ballot for Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. A registered Democrat, he wanted to contribute to the Pine Tree State’s reputation as independent, he said, and he thought Collins embodied that. But he never voted for her again.
Several Mainers who regularly gather to protest the senior senator in the York County town similarly said that at some point during Collins’ decades-long career, they too voted for her. For most, their view of her shifted during Donald Trump’s first presidency and has solidified during his second. 
But Collins won in 2020 without the support of people like Burgess. Last time Collins was up for reelection, her Democratic opponent Sara Gideon, then the Speaker of the Maine House, focused her campaign on whether Collins had “changed” since she was first elected to the Senate in 1996.
”She tried to make the election about Sen. Collins,” said state Sen. Rick Bennett, a moderate Republican representing Oxford, “and it didn’t work.” 
The November 2026 midterm election, when Collins will be up for re-election, will be something of a referendum on Trump, Bennett said. However, he added that it also matters who Collins’ opponent is. A year and a half out from Election Day, some have already started to make themselves known.
Collins told Maine Morning Star she intends to run for reelection in 2026 and highlighted her record of delivering for Maine, primarily financially, as why she feels she remains the best person to represent the state. 
That focus of hers has previously helped unify a winning coalition of supporters. However, with the increasing demands for loyalty to Trump, slim Republican majorities in Congress and Collins’ race seen as an opportunity for Democrats to gain seats in the Senate, legal scholars, her critics on both sides of the aisle and polling signal the tightrope she has been walking is thinning. 
Known opponents 
Collins will face at least two primary challengers: Carmen Calabrese of Kennebunkport and Daniel Smeriglio of Frenchville have filed to run as Republicans. Calabrese, who moved to Maine five years ago from Florida, is a driver for Walmart and former small business owner. Smeriglio runs the rightwing Voice of the People USA radio and activist group. 
An independent has also entered the race: Phillip Rench of Waterboro, who sits on the board for the Maine Space Corporation and owns Ossipee Hill Farm and Observatory. He was a former senior engineer at Elon Musk’s SpaceX, though he said he has no association with Musk or the company now aside from stocks he was awarded as an employee. 
Two Democrats are also vying for Maine’s U.S. Senate seat so far. 
Jordan Wood of Bristol, originally from Lewiston, spent about a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C., including as chief of staff to former Democratic U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of California.
Natasha Alcala of Madawaska is currently a fashion designer who moved to Maine from California a little over four years ago. She has degrees in international relations and criminal justice and is a U.S. Navy veteran. Alcala previously filed to run against U.S. Sen. Angus King in 2024 but withdrew before the primary. 
A focus on money, in many respects 
Last election cycle, Collins’ pitch to Mainers focused on her ability to secure federal funding for the state through her then-expected ascent to chair one of the chamber’s most powerful committees, a position she now holds and emphasized when asked why she believes she’s still best poised to represent Maine.   
Susan Collins has reached a pinnacle of authority. How will she use it?

“By climbing that ladder in the last three years I have been able to secure more than a billion dollars for hundreds of projects in communities across our state,” Collins said, “That would not have happened without the seniority that I have.”
Collins highlighted earmarks she’s secured for investments throughout each of Maine’s 16 counties as well as legislation that will impact Mainers more broadly, specifically co-authoring the Social Security Fairness Act, which was signed into law under former President Joe Biden earlier this year and restored full benefits for millions of public sector workers.
Calabrese acknowledged that Collins’ role as top appropriator is a strength. “You can’t argue with that,” he said, “but I look at it as well, I thank you for bringing it, but you’re also spending my money. It’s my tax dollars.” 
And Calabrese thinks those tax dollars would go farther if Collins sided with Trump more often. 
“If you agree more with some of the stances that he has, maybe you’ll do better,” Calabrese said. 
Rench said he doesn’t think Collins’ continued pitch that she is best equipped to deliver financially for the state is a valid point. 
“What we need to do as a state is become less dependent on federal dollars,” he said. 
Rench said he would do this by building a stronger economic foundation for Maine families, including by addressing what he sees as “brain drain” in the state by overhauling the school system to have both college and trade school tracks. As someone who left the state after college to pursue opportunities in the space industry and then returned, he said he understands why young people leave and wants to change it. 
He is also proposing reinventing industries, such as creating a federal reserve of dimensional lumber, growing Maine’s food production and processing capabilities to serve the country and positioning Maine as a leader in the space industry.
Wood previously helped lead End Citizens United, a political action committee working to reverse the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Campaign Act, which deregulated restrictions on independent political spending by corporations and unions.
Some of his top priorities will be anti-corruption reform and getting big money out of politics. He said he plans to lead by example with his own campaign by not taking any money from corporate PACs or lobbyists. He is also committed to not becoming a lobbyist after serving in office, refuses to engage in selling individual stocks and will prohibit his family members and those of his staff from lobbying his office for issues. 
In light of Trump slashing federal funding, Alcala said she would propose Maine partner with other states that have large gross domestic products, such as California, to ensure federal funding inconsistency doesn’t prevent people from having their basic needs met, such as by accessing low-income food assistance or making higher education free. 
“With our combined GDP, we can definitely make it so that we can help those that need the extra funding,” Alcala said. 
Smeriglio did not respond to interview requests.
Accessibility 
Constituents who have reached out to Collins — including Cape Elizabeth resident Jerry Kaufman, an independent who said he emails Collins nearly every day, and Cokie Giles, a registered nurse at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor who regularly attends federal lobby days — argue they don’t feel heard. 
A common critique these two Mainers and others have is that Collins hasn’t hosted a town hall in at least 25 years.
Collins deferred to her press secretary Blake Kernen when asked about constituent requests for town halls. 
“She prefers smaller group meetings or Zooms, rather than holding town halls where very few people get to speak, and the level of civility is often not that high,” the spokesperson said. “These forums were also difficult for people who were more reserved or less comfortable speaking in public.”

Kernan also said Collins individually meets with thousands of Mainers every year in her office and during events across the state.
These frustrations about accessibility are not unique to the Republican senator. Mainers have started to hold town halls to air their concerns, whether their current members of Congress agree to attend or not. In Maine, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree is an outlier, as she held in-person town halls in early April, her first since 2017.
In public events so far, some of Collins’ opponents have deliberately focused on personal appeals to voters to set themselves apart. 
Wood has held two town halls since he launched his campaign over a month ago. He said he will hold a town hall in each of Maine’s 16 counties during the race and, if elected, once a quarter. Wood also plans, if elected, to make his calendar public every month so his constituents can see who he is spending time with, he said.  
Rench opened up his observatory this spring to meet constituents and intends to travel around the state with his mobile telescope to continue one-on-one discussions. 
Alcala said she plans to start a YouTube channel to offer a more candid perspective into herself and her views for voters. 
Calabrese is starting with speaking at county Republican meetings and trying to engage with people at events such as upcoming county fairs.
Lessons learned from elections past
Some of those challenging Collins are actively trying not to make the mistakes they think Gideon made last election cycle. 
Rench made a list of criticisms he heard about Gideon, down to her wearing clothing from Patagonia, an L.L. Bean rival. But the one that is guiding him most is focusing on what he could bring to the Senate, not what he thinks Collins lacks.
“I don’t think people want to hear critiques of Collins,” Rench said. “They know who she is.”
In Rench’s view, neither of the major parties adequately represent the working class, which is why he chose to run as an independent. In particular, he said, “I still think the Democratic Party is stuck in grief.”
Nationally, Senate Democrats have previewed their campaign messaging, already targeting Collins in particular. 
The campaign arm of Senate Democrats began running digital ads in April against Collins and Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina that highlight the Trump administration’s plans to cut phone services for Social Security, though the agency has not followed through on that plan. In response to this, Collins highlighted her work passing the Social Security Fairness Act. 
Wood, who is running as a Democrat, is bringing lessons learned from the presidential election, particularly his party’s estrangement with working-class and young voters, into how he’s shaping his campaign. 
“It’s our responsibility as candidates and as a political party to prove to that voter that we are the party that they should see as the side fighting for them,” Wood said. “I will spend as much time as I can in these communities, telling them about my vision for the future and the policies that I’ll champion to make their lives better.” 
The average age of Congress has been a concern raised in elections past. 
Collins is 72 years old and will be running for her sixth term as senator. Wood, Wrench and Alcala emphasized that they want to offer a younger perspective to Congress than Collins.
Calabrese is more so focused on the length of time Collins has held office. He said he’d only serve up to two terms if elected. 
“I think it’s time for some people — I mean we’re not Middle America but Middle America-thinking people — who understand what’s going on boots on the ground to get involved,” he said.

Can Collins continue to tow the line? 
Both parties have grown more ideologically cohesive creating a political environment that’s less hospitable for lawmakers who straddle the center — now a rarity in Congress. 
Collins became a more reliable vote for her party during Trump’s last presidency compared to her track record before. In 2017, 87% of her votes were party-line. This was a shift, as Congressional Quarterly found between 1997 and 2016 that she voted with her party on party-line votes only 59% of the time. 
But last year, she bucked her party the most out of all senators. An analysis from Roll Call found Collins sided with Republicans 47.8% of the time in 2024, although largely because of her votes in favor of President Joe Biden’s nominees. Her level of bipartisanship fluctuates depending on the measure, but she remains a rarity in the Trump era, neither endorsing the president nor fully turning her back on him. 
“I don’t want to say she’s on the outside of her own party, but to a certain extent she is,” said Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine. 
Fewer people are running, and succeeding, with bipartisan campaigns. However, the success of Collins, the only senator from her party representing a state Trump lost in 2024, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden in the second district — which also went for Trump — exemplifies that Maine is still holding onto that tradition, Brewer said. Bennett’s career as a prominent bipartisan voice is another example, Brewer added. 
Those running against Collins have taken more pointed stances, both for and against Trump. 
Wood said he spent the January 6 attack barricaded in Porter’s office, after which he co-founded democracyFIRST, a pro-democracy organization dedicated to combating growing threats to the free and fair elections.
“I think [Collins] had ample opportunity to be courageous to stand up to Donald Trump and her own party and she has failed to do so,” Wood said. 
Calling Trump a “wanna-be dictator, authoritarian that is trying to centralize all power and authority in himself,” he said if Democrats are able to secure a Senate majority in the 2026 election that will provide a better opportunity to oppose the president during the remaining two years of his term.
As Trump slashes federal spending, Collins’ promise to deliver for Maine is tested

Alcala is also pitching herself as a candidate who will stand up to Trump. “We’re in a coup d’etat by Trump and Elon Musk,” she said. “The fact that Trump is taking money away from Mainers, whether they’re Republican, liberal, what have you, the fact that he’s doing that means that we can’t rely on the current government that we have.” 
On the other hand, Calabrese said if elected he would help codify many of Trump’s executive orders into law. He commended Trump’s approach to immigration policy. “All this illegal immigration that’s one thing that I totally agree with him on,” he said. 
He also supports Trump’s push to make the U.S. a global leader in Artificial Intelligence and the cuts made by his Department of Government Efficacy. 
Calabrese said, “the President is not a king,” noting that he’d try to tow the line between helping the president follow through with his plans while still respecting the balance of power. 
However, Calabrese said, “If he needs to take his executive orders to the Supreme Court, well that’s the checks and balances.”
When it comes to the Supreme Court, Rench was also motivated to run because of Collins’ pivotal vote that helped seat Justice Brett Kavanaugh. 
“I have a nine year old daughter and after Sen. Collins, in my opinion, enabled the reversal of Roe vs. Wade,” Rench said, “I no longer trust her with my daughter’s future.”
Collins voted for Kavanaugh after she said he gave her private assurances he wasn’t a threat to the landmark abortion ruling that he later voted to overturn. 
Early surveys show the senator with much lower favorability than ever before. 
A poll from Morning Consult found that since last quarter, Collins’ net approval declined by 12 percentage points — more than that of any other senator. According to the poll, 51% of Maine voters disapprove of Collins, down from 47% at the end of last year.










A big part of Collins’ problem is that when it comes to Trump her approach is just antagonizing everyone.


– Public Policy Polling


Another poll commissioned by a top Democratic super PAC shows Collins is being pinched on both sides. 
“A big part of Collins’ problem is that when it comes to Trump her approach is just antagonizing everyone,” the pollster wrote in a memo. 
The survey of 569 registered Maine voters showed 81% of voters who supported Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris think the senator votes with Trump too often and 73% of Trump voters think she doesn’t vote with Trump often enough. Only 10% think she’s striking the right balance.
But on Monday, Pan Atlantic Research released its latest independent Omnibus Poll capturing the opinions of 840 likely voters and found close to an even split between those who find Collins favorable or unfavorable, similar to its polling in September. 
“A year and a half out from Election Day, it’s far too early to poll right now,” Kernan, Collins’ spokesperson, said. 
Pollsters have gotten Collins wrong before. The day before the election in 2020, Maine Senate polls showed Collins’ Democratic opponent Gideon ahead by six points. Collins went on to win by almost 9%. 
Some speculate she appealed to undecided voters in the end and that pollsters underestimated that Mainers would split tickets. 
Wood noted that Collins voted against Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett right before the 2020 election.  
“It was a reminder that she has a tendency to be independent sometimes and there was a hope that she could be a catalyst in some way for a post-Trump Republican Party, that was the Republican Party they grew up with,” Wood said of voters. “That did not come to fruition. I think that voters now have a much clearer understanding of the threat in front of us.”
But beyond this race, pollsters across the country failed in 2020, as well as in 2016, to accurately capture the zeitgeist, particularly for working class voters in rural areas.
When it comes to Collins’ continued independent, deliver-for-Maine pitch, Brewer said, “I think it’s going to be harder for her to do that, to run that kind of campaign. It doesn’t mean that she can’t pull it off.”

Utah is among several Western states seeking to reduce federal land ownership. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
 The ‘balance sheet’

In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.













Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They're certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.


– Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity





Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”
Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
 Housing arguments

The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”
Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
 The costs of management

In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

If you know anyone who works in the service industry, you should be very familiar with the problem of hour volatility. When work hours aren’t set, worker schedules can vary greatly from week to week and from month to month. This can make a steady stream of income difficult to achieve for service workers. It can also affect eligibility for public benefits.
The Ohio Department of Medicaid is currently working with the federal government to implement work requirements for Ohio’s “Medicaid expansion” population–the 760,000 Ohio residents who receive health insurance through the Kasich Administration-era expansion of Medicaid. These work requirements would apply to households at 138% of the federal poverty level and below.
Low-income households tend to be headed by people who work in the service industry. My colleague Michael Hartnett estimates that cooks and waiters are the second- and fifth-most common jobs among people in the bottom 20% of income in Ohio.
A new analysis by Brookings Institution researchers looks at how the volatility of hours for service workers will impact eligibility for benefits like Medicaid and SNAP.
One of the things they look at is the mental model that undergirds the current work requirement system. In 1976, only 26% of low-income employees worked in the service sector. By 2024, that number had risen to 38%. This means that 50 years ago, the contours of an unsteady sector had less of an impact on month-to-month hours than it does today.
These researchers used data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to estimate that 64% of service workers worked less than 80 hours in at least one month in 2022. A third (34%) of workers who work an average of 80 hours a month had at least one month that year that they worked less than 80 hours. That means that a monthly work requirement of 80 hours would have disqualified a third of service workers at some point during 2022 from benefits like Medicaid or SNAP.
The researchers also find these volatile work hours are largely outside of the control of the workers. According to their analysis, three-quarters of service workers with irregular schedules say their schedules are at the request of their employers, not their own. This is also a high rate among non-service workers, where over 3 in 5 low-income workers with irregular schedules are conforming to employer requirements.
So what does this mean? It means tens of thousands of low-income workers in Ohio could lose their health insurance because of work hour volatility out of their control.
The labor market has changed a lot over the past fifty years, especially for low-income workers.
This has led to less certainty about hours, which makes thresholds like monthly hours not as effective for gauging whether people are participating in the labor force. There are a lot of reasons to be worried about work requirements. The fact that working people will lose health insurance because lack of control over work hours is just another one to add to the list.

And if you still believe the administration, they’re going to make those cuts without anyone losing benefits. As White House official Russell Vought put in last week, “This bill will preserve and protect the programs, the social safety net, but it will make it much more common sense. No one will lose coverage as a result.”
If your BS detector isn’t ringing by now, you need to take it in for repair.
Confronted with the absurdity of claiming that you can cut $800 billion without canceling health care coverage, Trump officials retreat to their fallback position. Yes, they admit, they’ll be cutting benefits, but only for those who don’t deserve it. 
“Medicaid does not belong to people who are here illegally, and it does not belong to capable and able-bodied men who refuse to work,” another White House official told Politico. “So no one is getting cut.”
Once again, though, your BS detector ought to be blaring. Under existing federal law, undocumented immigrants are already barred from getting Medicaid. They’re promising to cut benefits to people who are already not getting those benefits. So no savings there.
And the truth is, most of the able-bodied men who are too lazy to work are also too lazy to worry about jumping through the hoops needed to get Medicaid health-care coverage. Such men do exist, no doubt, but in numbers far too small to generate $800 billion in savings.
To get savings on that scale, you have to look elsewhere. And the truth is that millions of lower-income Americans, many of them working people, would be stripped of their health insurance if the bill becomes law. In Georgia alone, the projections are that as many as 200,000 people would lose coverage. And because Medicaid plays a larger health care role in rural communities, where the population is older and private sector jobs less likely to offer health insurance, the impact would be greater in those areas, putting additional financial strain on rural hospitals and health-care providers already struggling to stay open. 
(If Congress also refuses to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act later this year, as seems likely, the total number of Georgians who lose health insurance could top 700,000.)
And no, the money saved by such measures would not be used to reduce the nation’s deficit. It would instead be used to finance tax cuts, the overwhelming majority of which would benefit the wealthy.
A big chunk of the projected savings, an estimated $280 billion, would come from instituting work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The model for that nationwide requirement is supposedly the Pathways program instituted here in Georgia in 2020 by Gov. Brian Kemp.
By most measures, however, that program has proved a massive disappointment. According to the original projections by the Kemp administration, some 25,000 low-wage Georgians should have been enrolled in Medicaid through the program in its first year of operation.  
The actual number was 4,300.
By the end of its second year of operation, which comes next month, total enrollment was projected to be almost 50,000. As of April 25, it was 7,400, according to reporting by ProPublica and The Current. The monthly reporting requirements, record-keeping and bureaucratic red tape proved so discouraging that many Georgia applicants gave up in frustration, choosing instead to take the risk that they would not need coverage.
If it seems odd that such a program would be embraced as a model by the GOP, it might be a matter of perspective. It might be that your idea of a failure is somebody else’s idea of a success, because the two of you have different goals in mind. 
In this case, if your goal is to provide at least a bare-bones health insurance plan to lower-income Americans, then Georgia’s Pathways program has failed. However, if your goal is to discourage and obstruct as many Americans as possible from participating in that coverage, because you want to generate $800 billion in savings so the rich can get more tax cuts, then it starts to look a whole lot better.
Those yachts aren’t going to buy themselves.

But at least for now, bears need not worry. 
As this year’s General Assembly session drew to a close Wednesday, state lawmakers broke a years-long stalemate to give final approval to legislation allowing Sunday hunting. Meanwhile, a separate bill that would have allowed for a bear hunt fell victim to a late amendment and a dwindling clock.
Hunters have fought unsuccessfully for decades to overturn the state’s ban on Sunday hunting, which they have described as the last of Connecticut’s historic “blue laws.” In 2015, lawmakers partially repealed the ban for bow hunters.
Critics, however, argue that Sundays are a day of recreation by many non-hunters who would be disturbed — or potentially put in harms way — if hunters were allowed to shoot on Sundays.
As a compromise, lawmakers agreed to limit Sunday hunting to private property and prohibit any hunting within 40 yards of a blue-blazed or federally-designated hiking trail. The bill also prohibits the hunting of migratory birds on Sundays.
The resulting legislation, Senate Bill 7231, passed both chambers over the opposition of several Democrats. Gov. Ned Lamont said he plans to sign the bill into law. 
“It’s always seemed a little odd and unjust to us that we wouldn’t be able to use our own property for this purpose,” said Julie Cammarata, a lobbyist for Friends of Connecticut Sportsmen. “So obviously, they’re thrilled. They’re thrilled.”
Around the same time that the Senate took up the Sunday hunting bill Wednesday, House lawmakers moved to amend another bill, S.B. 1523, which was originally written to allow the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to establish a bear hunting season to manage Connecticut’s growing population of black bears.
Those hunting provisions were stripped from the bill in committee, only to be added back in on the Senate floor last month. In the House, members voted to change the bill again, this time directing DEEP to assess the state’s existing bear population and come up with management plan that includes non-lethal methods for reducing conflicts with humans. 
In addition, the plan will include “proposals for how a regulated bear hunt could be implemented.” Any future decision on a hunt would have to come back before lawmakers. 
“It is my belief that that’s not the right step for us right now,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, the co-chair of the Environment Committee who introduced the amendment.
“This is a challenge we’re facing, we’ve seen it again across farmers and livestock, and even in our front and back yards,” he added. “So we need to take some really proactive steps and what we’re asking the agency to do is to come back to us with their best ideas of what that might look like.” 
Bear hunt opponents, however, saw the bill as simply clearing the way to target bears in the future. Both Gov. Ned Lamont and DEEP officials, they noted, have already signaled their support for a lottery-based hunt.
“We can try to sugarcoat it by calling it a bear hunt,” said state Rep. Mike Demicco, D-Farmington. “It will be a bear execution.”
Hunting bears is allowed in New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey. It is not allowed in Rhode Island, which has a smaller population of bears.
While both hunting bills drew some amount of bipartisan support, they were of particular interest to many Republican lawmakers representing more rural districts. For that reason, the bills were viewed as potential trading chips by Democrats as the clock neared midnight on Wednesday, the final day of the legislative session.
Republicans generally gain leverage through their ability to filibuster legislation in the final days of the session, grinding work to a halt and stymying controversial bills. Democrats, however, can offer to run certain bills in exchange for Republicans agreeing to limit their debates.
That’s what happened in the case of the Sunday hunting bill, which was taken up immediately following climate-related legislation, H.B. 5004, which had been a priority for House Democrats.
“If 5004 ran, Sunday hunting would run,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “I was hoping a potential bear hunt would be part of a deal, but there wasn’t enough support in the House.”
Even without a bear hunt, S.B. 1523 contained other provisions clarifying the circumstances in which farmers may kill a bear that is damaging their crops or livestock. Harding, who represents many farmers in Litchfield County, said he was holding out hope to that language passed early Wednesday afternoon. 
But the House’s amendment forced the bill to go back before the upper chamber with just a few hours to spare Wednesday and dozens of bills left on the agenda.

Tony Evers and Republican lawmakers broke down on Wednesday. Evers delivers his 2025 state budget address. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Republican lawmakers are planning to move forward on writing the two-year state budget without input from across the aisle after negotiations with Gov. Tony Evers broke down on Wednesday. 
Senate and Assembly leaders and Evers each released statements on Wednesday in the early evening saying that while negotiations have been in good faith, they are ending for now after meetings late on Tuesday evening and on Wednesday morning. Evers said Republicans were walking away from the talks after being unwilling to compromise, while Republicans said Evers’ requests weren’t reasonable.
“Both sides of these negotiations worked to find compromise and do what is best for the state of Wisconsin,” Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) and Joint Finance Committee co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said in a statement. “However, we have reached a point where Governor Evers’ spending priorities have extended beyond what taxpayers can afford.” 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) left the possibility of future negotiations open in a separate statement.
“Assembly Republicans remain open to discussions with Governor Evers in hopes of finding areas of agreement, however after meeting until late last night and again this morning, it appears the two sides remain far apart,” the lawmakers said. 
Vos and Born said JFC will continue “using our long-established practices to craft a state budget that contains meaningful tax relief and responsible spending levels with the goal of finishing on time.” 
In previous sessions this has meant that the Republican committee throws out all of Evers’ proposals, writes the budget itself, passes it with minimal Democratic support and sends the bill to Evers — who has often signed it with many (sometimes controversial) partial vetoes. 
LeMahieu and Marklein noted that the Republican-led committee has created budgets in the last three legislative sessions that Evers has signed and they are “confident” lawmakers will pass a “responsible budget” this session that Evers will sign.
Lawmakers have less than a month before the state’s June 30 budget deadline. If a new budget isn’t approved and signed into law by then, the state will continue to operate under the current budget. 
Evers said in a statement that he is disappointed Republicans are deciding to write the budget without Democratic support.
“The concept of compromise is simple — everyone gets something they want, and no one gets everything they want,” Evers said. He added that he told lawmakers that he would support their half of priorities, including their top tax cut proposals, even though they were similar to ones he previously vetoed, but he wanted agreements from them as well.
“Unfortunately, Republicans couldn’t agree to support the top priorities in my half of the deal, which included meaningful investments for K-12 schools, to continue Child Care Counts to help lower the cost of child care for working families and to prevent further campus closures and layoffs at our UW System,” Evers said.  
“We’ve spent months trying to have real, productive conversations with Republican lawmakers in hopes of finding compromise and passing a state budget that everyone could support — and that, most importantly, delivers for the people of Wisconsin. I am admittedly disappointed that Republican lawmakers aren’t willing to reach consensus and common ground and have decided to move forward without bipartisan support instead.”
Democratic leaders said that Republicans are refusing to make investments in the areas that Wisconsinites want. 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said in a joint statement that it’s disappointing Republicans are walking away from negotiations. 
“The people of Wisconsin have a reasonable expectation that their elected leaders will work together to produce a state budget that prioritizes what matters most: lowering costs for families and investing in public education,” the lawmakers said. “This decision creates yet more uncertainty in a difficult time. Democrats will continue to stand up for all Wisconsinites and work to move Wisconsin forward through the budget process.”
Democrats on the budget committee accused Republicans of giving in to the “extremist wing of their party” by walking away from the negotiations and not committing to “fully funding our public schools, preventing the closure of child care centers, or meeting the healthcare needs of Wisconsinites.”

If signed into law, HB 5002 would require towns across the state, but especially in Fairfield County, to increase their housing supply in order to mitigate the cost-of-living crisis that has been pushing residents into poverty or to other states. 
The bill would shift many planning prerogatives long held by municipalities to the state government.
The proposed bill has received pushback from members of both parties. Critics argue that local planning decisions should remain in the hands of local officials; they fear the outcomes of developer-friendly incentives without resident input, and Soviet-style directives from callous Hartford lawmakers. I empathize with these concerns, but it must be stated bluntly: the local governments of Fairfield County are the authors of their current misfortune. 
HB 5002 was written because planning decisions have remained in the hands of local officials for decades, and these officials have failed to let housing supply grow in order to keep up with demand. Sentimental attachment to lot and unit size minimums, parking mandates, and fastidious micromanagement of developers’ plans has led to endless delays and sprawling development that consumes nearly all remaining green space. Moratoriums on multifamily units have exacerbated demand for missing-middle housing among seniors and young families. The multifamily structures that have been built are often squeezed in on the margins, on former industrial sites behind freeways. 
None of this should be taken to mean that I wholly disapprove of the leadership in many of these communities. I have closely followed the work of several planning and zoning commissioners in the region, and I greatly admire their efforts to accommodate two diametrically opposed interest groups: the state government that has pressured them to permit the housing stock that is desperately needed, and the restive, often explosive local opinion that greets development with hostility. Unfortunately, the center can no longer hold.
HB 5002 is a partisan bill, and the Democrats enjoy control of the state senate and the governorship. The bill will likely become state law. Municipal leaders in Fairfield County must accept this political fact and embrace a paradigm shift in community planning. For decades, many of these towns have tried to meet housing obligations while maintaining existing character, often by hiding development from view or slow-walking projects to avoid backlash. This will no longer be sufficient. 
Fairfield County residents would do to see that car-centric suburban planning norms are anachronistic; the postwar ideal of a two story ranch on a pesticide-soaked lawn is no longer the universal American Dream. Instead of clinging to this outdated totem of social status, residents should embrace a new kind of lifestyle, one in which the divide between work, home, and recreation is less distinguished.
Change may be scary, but imagine the following scenarios: What if instead of driving an hour to your job in bumper-to-bumper traffic, you could walk downstairs and across the street? What if instead of laboriously coordinating with other parents to pick up and drop off your teenagers at the movie theater, your kid could simply take a bus? What if instead of being shunted off to a dark, understaffed nursing home, your aging relatives could rent an apartment down the road from you, situated above a coffee shop they frequent? 
This can be the vision of a new Connecticut, one that embraces change and shapes it to benefit existing residents and newcomers alike. The Nutmeg State can reject endless traffic and embrace multimodal transport, reject sprawl and embrace connectivity, reject reaction and embrace the future. To do so, it must reform zoning laws and rethink what truly makes the Land of Steady Habits such a pleasant place to live. It must allow more mixed-use development, relax parking mandates and height restrictions, and allow builders to build what the market demands and where it demands it. 
Monroe State Rep. Tony Scott spoke out against HB 5002, saying the mandated unit goals for his town were “comical.” With some resourcefulness, however, Monroe and towns like it can rise to the challenge of the seemingly absurd development goals. The Maybrook Line, a freight rail corridor running through Danbury, Monroe, and other towns, could be reactivated for passenger service. 
Rep. Scott should push for transit-oriented development along this route: new housing clustered around newly constructed train stations rather than sprawling across parks and open land. In this way, towns can reduce traffic, preserve green space, boost tax revenue, and still meet their share of the state’s housing needs.
This hypothetical illustrates how local leaders can accept the provisions of HB 5002 and make them work for their constituents in innovative, forward-thinking ways. If communities can break free from the ideological blinders that shackle them to outmoded planning norms, they can chart the way to solutions that benefit everybody. 
The way I see it, the local governments of Fairfield County, and Connecticut at large, have two paths before them. On the one hand, they can accept that some things must change, get creative, and work to ensure that those changes emphasize connection and sustainability. On the other hand, they can thrash vainly against the tide of history, and succeed only in sinking beneath its waves.

Joe Courtney,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/05/collective-bargaining-is-rebuilding-americas-defense-industrial-base/,Congress recognized that the 2025 wages for shipbuilding trades were failing to match the hiring and retention demand for the Navy’s growing fleet size.,"As the dust settles following the hard-fought, months-long negotiations between Electric Boat and the Marine Draftsmen Association Local 571, both sides deserve tremendous credit for reaching a record-setting agreement and finding a fair path forward for the next five years. 
Reaching the “sweet spot” of this historic contract for the members of MDA Local 571 required a lot of intense advocacy and dialogue between management and labor, as well as the roughly 2,500 members of this unique workforce that designs the most advanced, complex nuclear-powered submarines in the world.

A contract that boosts general wages by more than 30% over the course of the contract, while retaining superior health and retirement benefits, sends a strong signal that this workforce is respected and valued. The five-year term of the contract also highlights the workload of the designers will be enduring in the coming years, given the strong demand for submarines by the U.S. Navy and Congress.
A notable turning point in the contract negotiations came on April 30, just weeks before the agreement was finalized. That day, new funding approved by Congress in December 2024 was released to Electric Boat, specifically designated for wage improvement for the submarine industrial workforce. 
The impact of this funding surge transformed management’s offer of a 21.4% raise to the final 30% general wage increase agreement (over the course of the contract). The hourly wage improvement offer saw a significant boost, with a much larger increase in the first year and steady raises in the years that follow —well above what was initially proposed. 
Simultaneous with this upgrade, the Electric Boat Metal Trades Council and Carpenters Union 2023 labor contracts were reopened, and the machinists, boilermakers, electricians, and painters also received a comparable boost in hourly rates. It is unprecedented for Congress to single out one shipbuilding production enterprise in the entire Department of Defense for such a boost in salary. There was no “wage improvement” funding for aviation, munitions, space technology, or missiles in the December spending bill or any other spending bill in recent memory.
This extraordinary Congressional anomaly is a recognition that the existing 2025 labor wage rates for shipbuilding trades were failing to match the hiring and retention demand for the Navy’s growing fleet size —particularly the submarine fleet. 
Although Electric Boat has brought on record levels of new hires over the last three years and maintained a significantly higher retention rate compared to other shipyards, the “churning” of new workers hindered faster production goals for both Virginia and Columbia class submarines. It did not take much analysis by Congress, the Navy, or industry to recognize that wages —especially for entry-level trades— were no longer competitive with those in retail, hospitality, and transportation, to name a few. Compared to the Cold War era from the 1970s to 1990s —when Electric Boat’s workforce was at its peak—the pay gap between shipbuilding trades was significantly wider than other sectors, which helped drive greater workforce stability and higher employment levels in the shipyard back then.
The successful agreement reached last month is a clear example of how collective bargaining can effectively address one of the most pressing challenges in our national economy: rebuilding America’s manufacturing industrial base. Realigning wage rates is a significant step forward to achieve our goal. 
More work needs to be done, including sustaining job training programs like the Manufacturing Pipeline Initiative and Career and Technical Education. These programs should operate not only in technical high schools, but also in traditional comprehensive high schools, where their presence is steadily expanding across eastern Connecticut with each new school year. Such efforts benefit not just Electric Boat, but other supply chain and non-defense manufacturers. 
That is how to build a strong Navy and how to build a strong middle-class economy that’s here to stay.

Jan. 3, 2024. (Photo: Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers are divided on what to do with a proposal to modify the law born out of a 2021 referendum question requiring the Maine Legislature to approve any new high-impact transmission lines.
Although legislators who worked on the campaign saw it as an effort to clarify the law, LD 810 fell shy of passage in the House of Representatives on Tuesday with lawmakers voting 72-75 before ultimately killing the bill under the hammer. However, the Senate passed the bill 18-16 on Wednesday.
It is now up to the House to determine if it will hold its ground or join the Senate in supporting the bill. 
With papers shuffling between chambers this week, Maine Morning Star has compiled a slightly more pared down roundup for Wednesday, forgoing the list of all bills voted on and focusing on the biggest items of debates as well as legislation and issues that we’ve followed all session.
Here’s an overview of what happened Wednesday.  
Both chambers
The Maine House of Representatives and Senate have now backed LD 1668, which would change the voting requirements to extend the data of adjournment for the Legislature. Currently, a two-thirds vote in each chamber is needed to do so. The bill would change it to only an affirmative vote of a simple majority in both chambers. After the Senate voted 20-14 in favor of the bill on Monday, the House narrowly voted 72-71 in favor on Wednesday. 
Both chambers also passed a bill that would expand summer school programming, LD 1624, with the Senate approving it without a roll call after it passed the House with a 75-71 vote on Tuesday.
The Senate also followed the action taken by the House earlier this week to reject LD 1982, a late-session bill that wanted to change how perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, are defined in state law. (Read more on that proposal here.) 
After the House backed it, the Senate approved LD 1248, a bill proposing to loosen the restrictions on restraint and seclusion in schools. (Read more about restraint and seclusion here.) 
Both chambers have also now passed LD 437, which would develop a pilot program to place child care facilities in a few school districts statewide. 
Legislation (LD 10) that would add political affiliation as a protected class to the Maine Human Rights Act. The House voted against it on Wednesday, after the Senate did on Tuesday. (Read more about this bill here.) 
Non-concurrent matters
The chambers can’t agree on LD 1960, which would exempt electronic smoking devices or other tobacco products containing ingestible hemp from the tax imposed on tobacco products. The House voted against the bill on Wednesday after the Senate voted for it on Tuesday. 
The chambers also still can’t agree on a bill submitted by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (LD 402), which would move the Natural Areas Program from the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, among other technical tweaks. Earlier this week, the House passed the bill with one amendment, while the Senate passed it with another. On Wednesday, the House and Senate insisted on their positions, essentially killing the bill.  
On Wednesday, the House also insisted, 81-61, on its vote against LD 544, aimed to create parity in the taxation of medicine by exempting sales of cannabis for medical use. This position is counter to the committee recommendation and Senate vote in favor of passage. With the Senate insisting on its position Wednesday, this bill is also essentially dead.
With a narrow 72-71 vote, the House did change its position on LD 588. The bill seeks to grant agricultural workers the right to engage in concerted activity. After initially voting against its passage, the House on Wednesday receded and concurred with the Senate, which passed it. The bill now heads back to the Senate. 
Senate action
Though the Housing and Economic Development Committee was evenly split, the Senate passed a proposed pilot project that would allow 30 small businesses from the farming, fishing and logging industries to set aside up to $250,000 of revenue, sheltered from income tax, to use for capital expenses in the future. 
Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said he introduced this bill again this session because it could provide flexibility for the most critical components of Maine’s economy: its heritage industries. LD 195 includes a sunset date of 2029. 
Sen. Jeff Timberlake (R-Androscoggin),whose family has been farming in Maine since 1803, encouraged his colleagues to let the state try this out because it could help counter the year-to-year financial swings farms experience. 
The Senate voted 17-16 to reject a bill (LD 1535) that would require the Public Utilities Commission to gather a group of municipal, police and fire officials to discuss the high electricity usage related to illegal cannabis grows in the state. While Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) agreed the state should look into that issue, he said the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee is carrying over legislation into the next session that could provide a more comprehensive approach, including this sort of study. 
House action
The House passed a bill, LD 957, that would require Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to be included in the next review of content standards and performance indicators. (Read more about this bill here.) 
The House passed and enacted LD 1664, a proposal to amend the Dirigo Business Incentives program, which offers eligible businesses the opportunity to greatly reduce state taxes for up to five years. While the bill initially sought to repeal the program, the amended version passed would only change some program criteria.
LD 613, a bill supported by the Maine Medical Association that allows terminally ill patients to waive the current 17-day waiting period for access to life-ending medication, also the House 74-64 Wednesday. Several members shared stories about their loved ones’ end-of-life care. However, Rep. Kathy Irene Javner (R- Chester) argued the bill “removes the very pause that gives patients, families and physicians, the opportunity to reflect, to seek counsel to consider alternative palliative options.” 
After a lot of discussion, lawmakers voted 72-70 to pass LD 1036, which would prohibit landlords from refusing to rent to tenants solely because they rely on programs such as General Assistance or housing vouchers. 
Some lawmakers objected to the restrictions the bill would put on landlords, but others, including bill co-sponsor Rep. Cheryl Golek (D-Harpswell) said many residents relying on General Assistance are rejected from renting because of stigma, which the bill aims to address. (Read more about the proposal here).
“We as a state can only create fair housing once we take the steps to remove the discrimination within the housing opportunities,” Golek said. “Protection from source-of-income discrimination, protection is one significant way we can apply and protect this to people.”
The House also passed an amended version of LD 396 that would establish a grant program to encourage schools to adopt start times at 8:30 a.m. or later. 
A heavily amended version of LD 1787, passed the House. The bill initially sought to allow candidates for district attorney, sheriff and county commissioner to participate in the Maine Clean Election Act, but the version now being considered was amended to increase the contribution limits for gubernatorial seed money donations. (Read more about other proposals related to changing Maine’s clean elections here.) 
The House also passed an amended version of LD 1726, which seeks to improve planning for the future of the energy grid, with a 75-69 vote.
Legislation (LD 1900) to grant authority to certain Wabanaki Nations to develop tribal power districts and recognizes the authority for child support enforcement passed the HOuse 75-67.Finally, fter heated discussions about the effectiveness of masks in schools during which Rep. John Eder (R-Waterboro) asked Speaker Ryan Fecteau if he would like to apologize for mandating masks, the House voted 73-69 to reject a proposal (LD 1461) to prohibit school boards from instituting future mask mandates.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — From economic development to tax-increment financing, the streetcar, immigration arrests and staffing, Omaha Mayor-elect John Ewing Jr. on Wednesday talked more about how he plans to lead Nebraska’s largest city.
Ewing spoke to reporters at his first news conference since defeating three-term mayor, Jean Stothert. He moves into his office Monday.
As he departs his elected post as Douglas County treasurer, Ewing said his chief deputy for 4.5 years will serve as interim head until, as directed by law, the Douglas County Board names a replacement for the remaining 18 months of his county term.

That deputy, Jane Alexander, who was at the event, said she is not interested in the position permanently, and Ewing lauded her “steady hand” and partnership. He said he was proud of his team’s reorganization of the office for efficiency, customer service and improved accessibility through technology.
Several current and former officeholders have privately discussed the possibility of pursuing Ewing’s former job.
 Continuity

Turning to staffing as mayor, Ewing said he wants continuity. As he starts his four-year term, he said he would retain all of Stothert’s department heads and senior staff except for her deputy chief in charge of communications, who has announced her retirement.
Hired to replace her was Erin Grace, a former World-Herald columnist who most recently led communications for the National Counterterrorism, Innovation, Technology and Education Center based at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
As reported earlier by the Nebraska Examiner, Tom Warren will stay on as chief of staff. Ewing said the two have been friends since about 6 years old, and both served on the Omaha Police Department.
He said current city managers are capable, and he didn’t want to see an exodus from City Hall. He said he wanted to promote stability.
“What I’ve found in transitions is if you create fear, you lose the best people, because they have opportunities to go places,” Ewing said.
The mayor-elect made two promotions from within city government to focus on what he said was the No. 1 issue he spoke about while campaigning: “intentional economic development” — which he described as a “focused and inclusive strategy to grow our economy and uplift every part of our city.”

“Economic development to me looks like inclusion,” said Ewing. “It looks like expanding the urban core plan to North and South Omaha. It looks like creating job opportunities … It looks like having opportunities for people to be able to live, work and play in their neighborhoods.”
Since making history as the city’s first Black elected mayor and drawing national attention for upsetting a longtime Republican mayor in the city at the heart of the “blue dot,” Ewing said he has been contacted by businesses who are interested in relocating to Omaha. He wants to nurture those leads and said he values diversity. 
 TIF, streetcar, CWS

Among other topics touched upon by Ewing:
TIF: This public incentive, created by state law, became a divisive topic in the mayoral race. Ewing said one of the criticisms he had was that Omaha officials sometimes approved TIF financing for projects in areas that he does not consider blighted, one of the prerequisites. 
“So I am going to be looking at using TIF more strategically,” Ewing said.
He said he has a meeting planned with state lawmakers representing Omaha to talk about other incentives and ways to spur economic growth so that the city has a broader array of tools beyond TIF.
City streets: “We are going to develop a plan. We are going to tell you what that plan is and then we will be accountable for that plan.”
Streetcar: Ewing said he has recently learned more positive aspects of the modern streetcar project that was championed by the Stothert administration. The controversial initiative , a project with $389 million in city costs to be covered by TIF proceeds, became a contentious issue as well during the mayoral election.

Said Ewing: “My goal is to see how we can make it as successful as possible.”
College World Series: “My goal is to help lay the foundation so that Omaha can keep the College World Series for the next 75 years.” This is the 75th anniversary of the CWS in Omaha, he noted.
 ‘Have more decorum’

Immigration arrests: Ewing was asked about a video circulating on social media and reported by KETV, which showed a west Omaha restaurant server writhing on the ground and being handcuffed and taken out by immigration agents in tactical gear.
Ewing said someone sent him a text message Saturday about the arrest and he was still gathering facts. But he told reporters that his plan is to make Omaha a place all residents can feel welcome and safe.
He said the city would be reaching out to federal officials to see if there could be “at least some coordination” and awareness rather than a social media frenzy. 
“That’s not the way we want to do law enforcement in Omaha, Nebraska,” he said.
Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer, offering his input, said it is “pretty customary” that federal immigration agents do not inform OPD of individual arrests. He said local police likely would be notified of large-scale activities and might become involved if an undocumented person is wanted on a criminal warrant and considered dangerous.
”There’s no way to keep us apprised of individual agents out there doing one-on-one situations like you heard at the eating place,” said Schmaderer, who was next to Ewing during the news conference. 
Ewing added: “We certainly would like them to do things in a way that doesn’t have the people of our community feel as if they are in jeopardy. So that is something we will share, because the person that texted me had a great deal of fear when they saw weapons being drawn. So we will have that conversation.”
The mayor elect later told the Examiner: ”However you do it, you’ve got to have more decorum.”
According to the KETV report, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said special agents were looking for a “Guatemalan national with a final order of removal.” The agents saw someone matching the description and followed him to the Early Bird restaurant.
DHS said the man is a brother of the original target and closely resembled him. Federal officials contended that the man resisted arrest, and that allegations that he was “wrongfully taken” by the agents were false.
The restaurant on social media said, “We had no involvement or knowledge of this incident prior to living it alongside our guests and staff.”
Treasurer job: He said that during his 18-year tenure, the office added online services to register vehicles and an investment committee that, according to his website, generated millions of dollars for the county.
“As Douglas County Treasurer, I inherited a strong senior staff, and together we transformed that office. Nearly all those individuals are still serving today, and I am proud of what we accomplished. I bring the same mindset into this new role — investing in people, building strong teams, and delivering results.”

They divided the documents into sections and marshaled their staff lawyers to be ready with lawsuits.
So when Russell Vought and the Office of Management and Budget froze the distribution of certain federal funds — as outlined in Project 2025 — Ellison and other the Democratic AGs were ready.
They sued over the funding freeze the next day.
“They were not hiding the ball,” Ellison said in a wide-ranging interview with States Newsroom in Minneapolis Wednesday.
Ellison and his colleagues have engaged in more than two dozen lawsuits against Trump administration actions in the first five months of the president’s second term. The AGs have sued over cuts to federal agencies, tariffs, DOGE’s access to government data, attempts to end birthright citizenship, and more.
They’ve also toured blue states to tout their accomplishments and listen to voters’ concerns.
The stakes are high, Ellison said: the fate of multi-racial democracy.
Ellison, who served for a dozen years in Congress representing Minnesota’s Minneapolis-based 5th District, said the states are a sovereign bulwark against federal power grabs.
The Democratic attorneys general are not only fighting a Republican-controlled executive branch, but also a conservative majority on the U.S Supreme Court. In Ellison’s view, recent decisions by the Roberts court — particularly in 303 Creative v. Elenis, in which the court ruled that a business owner could not be obligated to serve a gay couple — signify that the country is moving towards legal segregation.
“We are a whisper away from Jim Crow,” Ellison said.
Still, Ellison was upbeat, celebrating the AGs string of victories and predicting that even conservative Supreme Court justices will resist the Trump administration’s attack on the rule of law and the institution of the court itself.
The Democratic AGs may benefit from a weakened Department of Justice under Trump, Ellison said. The agency that defends the federal government in court is hemorrhaging longtime staff attorneys, through both firings and resignations.
Ellison emphasized that many of the policies enacted by Trump in his first months in office would be legal if they were passed by Congress. Instead, the president is running the country through “edict” and “proclamation,” Ellison said.
“Our democracy is not perfect,” Ellison said, “but you will absolutely miss it when it’s gone, and Trump has given you a glimpse of that.”

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota tribal leaders highlighted uncertainty in federal funding, frustrations with the state Legislature and future economic development projects Wednesday during the state’s seventh annual Government-to-Government Conference.
The annual event brings leaders of the five tribal nations that share geography with North Dakota together with state officials to share updates, network and discuss common problems facing their communities. 
“We’re strong, strong people — and we’re getting back to that mindset of pridefulness,” Jamie Azure, tribal chair for the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, said during his address. Azure said development projects in the pipeline for Turtle Mountain involve a retail center, movie theater, bowling alley and more.
The conference was started by former Gov. Doug Burgum during his first term in office. Burgum is credited with improving relations between the tribes and the state government, which were at a low point when he took office in 2016.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who succeeded Burgum in December, called continuing the conference a “no brainer.”
“We need the collaboration of our tribal partners if we want North Dakota as a state to truly succeed,” Armstrong said.
Like Turtle Mountain, officials from the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate celebrated several new business opportunities coming to the Lake Traverse Reservation. Economic development is not about money, said Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate Tribal Secretary Curtis Bissonette.

“It’s about freedom, dignity and the ability to care for one another across generations,” he said. “We are not waiting on permission to act.”
Tribal leaders on Wednesday each expressed a degree of anxiety about federal programs. Native tribes receive services from the U.S. government in areas as wide-ranging as law enforcement, healthcare and land management. Native officials are worried about the impact of President Donald Trump’s sweeping cuts to federal spending. 
Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation Chairman Mark Fox said that if the federal government wants to stop funding tribes, it needs to help them maintain a “financial infrastructure” that allows them to  “to survive and thrive economically.”  
“If you take that away, then you’re going to cause dependency to exist for the next 100 to 1,000 years,” he said. 
During her address, Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire shared some of her tribe’s continuing efforts to collaborate with the federal government on land, energy and infrastructure issues.
She said after several years of negotiating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Standing Rock last year entered into a co-stewardship agreement for Dakota Prairie National Grasslands within the boundaries of the reservation, for example. 
“These milestones may seem small, but it gives our people the opportunity to participate and have a voice, when once our voice was taken,” Alkire said.
She said she is also serving on a tribal advisory committee for the U.S. Department of the Interior under Burgum’s leadership.
Standing Rock leaders also provided updates on a wind farm project to improve energy infrastructure in southern North Dakota. They hope to finance it in part from a loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, though they said federal staff cuts threaten the program. Alkire said she has asked Burgum if the program can be rehoused under the Department of the Interior.

Tribal leaders also had much to say about the state government.
Azure during his address played two video clips from this year’s legislative session of state lawmakers questioning the integrity of Turtle Mountain’s plans to build a casino and resort in Grand Forks. 
One was of Sen. Diane Larson, R-Bismarck, who during one floor session said the source of the tribe’s financing was murky and might come from cartels. (Larson apologized for her remarks later that floor session.) 
Azure also played a clip of Rep. Lawrence Klemin, R-Bismarck, who dismissed the project and compared it to a Chinese company’s failed plans to build a corn milling plant near the Air Force base in Grand Forks. Klemin said he no longer trusts economic development projects associated with Grand Forks. He later told The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead his comments weren’t directed to the tribe.
Azure said the comments were insulting to the tribe and called on the statehouse to do better.
“At the end of the day the mindset has to change, because we can’t go back here every two years and show videos like this,” he said.
Spirit Lake Nation Chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street urged the state to reinstate the motor vehicle excise tax exemption for tribal members living off reservation. Only tribal members who live on reservations receive the tax exemption under a law change adopted by the state Legislature in 2023.
Jackson-Street said a large portion of Spirit Lake members live outside the Spirit Lake Reservation due in part to the federal government’s illegal taking of tribal land under the Dawes Act of 1887, and now must pay thousands of dollars more in taxes on vehicle purchases.
She also said the tribe has continued to take a hit because of North Dakota’s burgeoning electronic pull tab industry, which has taken business away from the Spirit Lake Casino.
“We’re trying to establish new businesses within our community to supplement what our casino lost because of e-tabs,” she said.
During the North Dakota legislative session, Native lawmakers supported a bill that would have required the Legislature to consult tribes on policies that would affect their communities. Proponents of the bill, which failed in the Senate, noted that the statehouse passed laws that allowed for the proliferation of gambling without speaking with North Dakota tribes that rely on casino revenue.
“For the future, as a tribal leader and whoever may step into these shoes, it’s important you know that our government works with tribes on consultation,” Jackson-Street told the audience on Wednesday.

Armstrong in his speech Wednesday applauded the state Legislature for passing House Bill 1199, which requires the state to create a task force dedicated to reducing the number of missing or murdered Indigenous people in the state. 
Armstrong said while he was in Congress he worked on Savanna’s Act, which seeks to improve the federal response to the same issue. Armstrong said he thinks the Savanna’s Act is “good legislation” but that he thinks House Bill 1199 will be more impactful.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s state school board has postponed consideration of a rules change that could limit the amount of money that cities and boroughs are allowed to give their neighborhood school districts.
The board voted unanimously on Wednesday to open a 30-day public comment period on the rules change rather than to enact it immediately on an emergency basis, as the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development had proposed.
“I never want this board to (have) its integrity compromised by rash decisions,” said board chair James Fields. “Our intent is to just try to uphold the law and do what’s best for kids. And so I think giving it time (for) public comment is definitely what’s best for kids.”
Currently, state law limits the amount of money that municipalities may give to local schools. The department proposed adjusting the definition of the limit so that services provided by municipalities to the school district, such as parking lot plowing or the use of pools and libraries, also must be considered local contributions.
Cities and boroughs already at or near the contribution cap, such as Anchorage and Juneau, would be required to reduce their local funding in response.
The vote followed almost two hours of impassioned and unanimous public testimony against the idea.
Jason Weber, superintendent of Valdez City Schools, said adopting the state’s proposal “would lead to an immediate reduction in the funding for student meals at a time when many states are expanding access to student meals.”
“Alaska should not be taking food off of kids’ plates,” he said.
Weber wasn’t alone: School administrators, parents and elected officials testified against the change on Wednesday morning, urging the board to reject the proposal.
“The magnitude of this emergency regulation passing could result in tens of millions of fewer dollars for students across the state,” said Jharrett Bryantt, superintendent of the Anchorage School District, as he testified against the proposed change.
Bryantt said he and other officials did not receive adequate public notice about the proposed emergency regulation, something required by law.
“It is my counsel’s belief that this use of emergency regulations is unlawful at worst and unethical at best,” he said, referring to the advice of his attorney.
“We need a thorough, transparent process immediately, if there’s any hope of restoring trust, it is my duty to pursue legal action against the state to challenge this immediately, if this were to pass,” Bryantt said. 
Regulations similar to the one up for a vote Wednesday have been discussed by the state education department since late last year, but the timing of this particular proposal came as a surprise to many across the state.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, noted that when education commissioner Deena Bishop testified in the Alaska Legislature in mid-May, she did not say that the department was considering an emergency regulation.
“This will have a catastrophic impact on my constituents and people all across the state, students and parents alike. What this is is a pretext. It is, to be blunt, a ruse to undermine public education in the state of Alaska,” Wielechowski said on Wednesday.
Alaska is unique among U.S. states in that it substitutes federal “impact aid” — given to states to compensate for untaxable federal land — for some state public-school funding. All other states spend the federal money on top of their usual support.
To keep Alaska’s practice from running afoul of the U.S. Department of Education, the state must pass a pair of accounting tests intended to limit the financial gap between the state’s richest school districts and its poorest ones – called a federal equity test.
Alaska recently failed both tests, but rather than reduce the gap by increasing the amount of funding that goes to schools, the state proposed the opposite — limiting local governments’ ability to contribute. 
Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, advised the school board to wait for the state to appeal the feds’ finding of a failed test. A prior failure was reversed on appeal.
School districts operate on a fiscal year that ends June 30, and the proposed change would have been retroactive to the current fiscal year, even though most school districts have already finalized their budgets.
Budget officials, testifying Wednesday, said that a last-minute change could result in cuts to programs and services. Department of Education officials, speaking during a school board work session on Tuesday, said the timing was necessary to reduce the chances that the state will fail the accounting tests in 2027, when the current year’s audited financial statements will be examined.
The board could pass the department’s proposed regulations after the end of the 30-day public comment period, or those comments could lead to revisions that would themselves be subject to new public comment. The board could also vote down the proposal or not take it up at all.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/250417-Deena-Bishop-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 21:04:26.282383

At right is Rep. Cameron Cooper, R-Romance. (Screenshot/Arkansas Legislature)Arkansas lawmakers reviewed two rules Wednesday in response to a new law aimed at improving the state’s maternal health care landscape for low-income pregnant women.
The Joint Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee spent nearly an hour discussing Arkansas’ new policy of presumptive Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women, part of the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act that will go into effect in August.
Presumptive eligibility assumes 60 days of Medicaid eligibility and shortens the process of applying for coverage. The policy was among several recommendations to improve the state’s maternal health care landscape that a task force convened by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued in September 2024.
More than half of births in Arkansas are covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance system for low-income Americans. A federal budget bill moving through Congress would make deep cuts to Medicaid spending, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years.
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

Elizabeth Pitman, director of the Division of Medical Services for Arkansas Medicaid, said she anticipates the proposed cuts will affect the state’s Medicaid expansion population but not pregnant women on Medicaid.
Arkansas has among the nation’s highest maternal mortality and infant mortality rates. Rep. Jack Ladyman, R-Jonesboro, said he found this frustrating and considered presumptive Medicaid eligibility “a very good cornerstone” for improving these statistics.
Ladyman and Rep. Lee Johnson, R-Greenwood, asked Pitman and other Department of Human Services officials how they plan to ensure that pregnant Arkansans statewide have the information and resources they need to opt into presumptive Medicaid eligibility if applicable.
“I want to support this rule, but I also want to be realistic in what we expect the outcome of this rule to be,” said Johnson, an emergency medicine physician and the joint committee’s House chair. “If we pass this eligibility category and nobody’s applying for it any more often than they’re currently applying for Medicaid, then it’s not moving the needle.”
Pitman said DHS can address Johnson’s concerns about access to information in its focus groups with pregnant Arkansans. She also said the agency will work with community health workers, doulas and other local health care providers and community organizations to ensure the option of presumptive Medicaid eligibility is as widely known as possible.

Committee outlines recommendations, actions taken to improve maternal health in Arkansas


DHS learned during the three-year public health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic that spreading information about public health resources via social media, digital billboards and doctor’s offices successfully reaches the agency’s target audience, state Medicaid Director Janet Mann said.
In January, Arkansas received a 10-year, $17 million federal grant aimed at improving maternal health outcomes for Medicaid recipients. Applying for the grant was among the maternal health task force’s recommendations last year.
The grant includes payments to healthcare providers as incentives for improved data-sharing on maternal health outcomes, Pitman said.
In response to more questions from Johnson, Pitman said DHS does not have data on whether pregnant Arkansans’ first interactions with prenatal health care occur in primary care providers’ offices or emergency rooms.
Arkansas remains the only state that has taken no action to adopt the federal option of extending postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to 12 months after birth, according to KFF. The maternal health task force did not recommend this policy, and a bill to create it failed in a Senate committee in April after Pitman and Mann expressed DHS’ opposition to it.
Arkansas Senate committee rejects 12-month postpartum Medicaid coverage

The other rule the joint committee reviewed Wednesday was the “unbundling” of billing rates for labor and delivery, a policy also put forth by the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act.
The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services authorized a 70% increase in Arkansas’ maximum reimbursement rate for obstetrical care “to include prenatal, delivery and postpartum care,” according to the rule. All of these services will be billed separately in all cases, Pitman said.
CMS’ approval of such a stark increase was “very unusual,” but Arkansas’ shortage of maternal health care providers in rural areas, closure of seven labor and delivery units since 2019 and high maternal and infant mortality rates led the agency to grant DHS’ request without question, Pitman said.
Higher reimbursement rates should “improve Medicaid’s data collection on utilization of prenatal and postpartum services,” the rule states.
“We’re really hopeful that this will give us better data and insight into what is happening in the prenatal care space: when women are going [to the doctor], if it’s the first, second or third trimester, who are they seeing and what are their diagnoses,” Pitman said.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)A second company hoping to extract lithium in South Arkansas applied for a lithium royalty just days after officials approved the state’s first royalty rate. 
ExxonMobil’s Saltwerx submitted an application Friday for a lithium royalty identical to the one approved last Wednesday for the joint venture between Canada-based Standard Lithium and Equinor, a Norwegian energy company. 
The structure of its proposed royalty and the proposed 2.5% royalty rate is identical to what the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approved last week, and would apply to Saltwerx’s Pine Unit where it hopes to extract lithium from brine.
Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approves first lithium royalty rate

In its filing, Exxon’s Saltwerx cited the decision by the commission as a “consistent, fair, and equitable precedent.”
According to the AOGC’s website, a special commission hearing is scheduled for noon June 23 in Magnolia and its regular monthly meeting is June 24 in El Dorado.
Exxon, via its subsidiary, was also a party to the 2024 royalty proposal that was unanimously rejected by AOGC commissioners, as was Standard Lithium. The commission ruled during a two-day hearing in November that a royalty could only be applied to existing brine units that the AOGC had approved — something Exxon did not yet have — after attempts by applicants to have a royalty applied to both current and future brine units. 
Like the Standard Lithium-Equinor venture, Exxon received an approved unit called the Pine Unit earlier this year, resolving that issue. 
However, unlike the Standard Lithium-Equinor venture, which last week had to show both that their project could “profitably extract” and was “fair and equitable,” Exxon already has a determination from the commission that its project can “profitably extract.” It’s one of a number of requirements under state royalties law. Exxon received that determination at the AOGC’s April hearing.



Info to know:

The Arkansas Brine Conservation Act requires royalties to be paid to mineral rights owners, and says profitable extraction must be determined to occur or have the potential to occur before a royalty is set and paid.
Royalties on substances extracted from brine other than bromine must be “fair and equitable,” in accordance with the ABCA.
A royalty is determined on a “unit-by-unit” basis, meaning that a company has to get approval for its royalty payment for an individual brine unit, which is a specific geographic area approved by the commission for the extraction of brine, rather than for the company as a whole or a geographic area like a county.			




ExxonMobil did not make someone from Saltwerx available to discuss the application, but company spokesperson Margot Armentor wrote in an emailed statement that Exxon was “encouraged” by last week’s decision and believes maintaining the “established precedent” set by that decision is important.
“The goal is a clear, consistent, globally competitive royalty structure, which will be essential for the state’s emerging lithium industry,” the company’s statement reads. “Getting this right benefits everyone – a thriving lithium industry would benefit mineral owners, the state’s economy, the surrounding region, local communities and bring new jobs to Southwest Arkansas.”

But some who work in the field worry it could ultimately impact residents.,"The Pennsylvania Capitol on Monday, March 6, 2023. (Capital-Star file photo)On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania state Senate advanced a bill that would enhance sentences for certain drug crimes committed within 1,000 feet of a recovery home. The bill passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and had a first reading before the full Senate. 
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Wayne Langerholc (R-Clearfield), said it’s intended to deter drug dealers who target people in recovery. But some who work in the field worry it could ultimately impact people seeking treatment, and that increased incarceration has proven ineffective in stemming drug use.
“My initial thought is it could make things worse for the person who’s already struggling and trying to recover,” said Brady Maxton, who owns a treatment center and manages several recovery homes in Lemoyne. “I get the side of, I don’t want people selling drugs to the people at my recovery houses, but I worry. Is it going to help people get more treatment?”
Maxton has been around addiction and recovery his entire life. When he was seven, his parents, one of whom was an addict, opened the New Insights treatment center in Lemoyne. They opened their first recovery home roughly a decade later to provide a space for patients who may otherwise struggle to find stable housing. It’s a business that Maxton now runs.
“As much as I am very much about law and order, and recognize we have laws for a reason, I also grew up around this,” he said. “Just because somebody gets charged or gets a penalty and has to sit in jail for a period of time, that doesn’t mean they’ve had treatment. They just sat in jail, and got out, and can reoffend. It was just a pause in their substance use.”
Langerholc, however, said the law was designed to penalize drug dealers, not patients. He said the specific charges that would have enhanced sentences were based on the kinds of crimes he saw drug dealers charged with when he was an assistant district attorney in Cambria County. 
“We would see individuals trying to prey on people going through recovery. It’s absolutely tragic,” he told the Capital-Star. “There’s a big distinction between people who are dealing with addiction and people who are trafficking large amounts of controlled substances in our neighborhoods and communities and, specifically, near our recovery house.”
But Maxton said, at least at his facilities, that isn’t common.
“If the people in the recovery house are going after a drug, typically they’re talking to a coworker or bringing it in that way,” Maxton said. “In most cases when we talk to the people who get caught with this stuff, there’s a lot of shame to it.”
Anyone caught with drugs would almost certainly be evicted, he said, though he’d like to see them placed in another form of treatment, and not necessarily jail.
“To me, it gives the chance to get them in recovery again,” he said. “Yes, they should have some type of consequence, but I don’t think an enhanced consequence specifically for them would be good.”
Sarah Kawasaki, the chief of addiction medicine at Penn State Health and the head of an outpatient opioid treatment center where many patients live in recovery homes, worries that police will not always be able to tell who’s buying or selling.
“I don’t know how the police in real time are supposed to determine who’s living in the halfway house and who’s not, or who’s dealing and who’s buying,” Kawasaki said. “People are making mistakes all the time and the wrong people get put in jail.”
Moreover, she says that increased incarceration has been tried as a method to deal with drug users and dealers alike in the United States, and it’s failed to meaningfully stem drug use or overdose rates. Plus, at the end of the day, she doesn’t believe that anyone should make rules intended to keep recovery homes safer without consulting with professionals.
“I’m not sure that it’s the government’s place to decide what these programs need to help with their safety,” she said. “And I’m not sure that it’s gonna actually make the people living there and trying to do well less safe, versus getting them reincarcerated more easily.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_9969-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 20:06:11.008917

After creating a complicated web of residential property tax exemptions, lawmakers are now weighing whether to eliminate property taxes entirely. 
The post Wyoming Legislature to consider abolishing property taxes through constitutional amendment appeared first on WyoFile .","As Wyoming lawmakers sought to provide homeowners with property tax relief in the past few years, new laws created a complicated web of exemptions, leaving some taxpayers confused and frustrated. 
“Taxpayers often struggle to determine which exemptions they qualify for, when and how to apply and which forms are required,” Crook County Assessor Dan Thomas told a legislative committee Wednesday. 
“As a result, we see misapplications, missed deadlines and a rising frustration, both from taxpayers and from the county offices working hard to assist them,” he told the Joint Revenue Committee at its meeting in Gillette, where he represented the Wyoming County Assessors’ Association. 
“While each of these measures provides meaningful tax relief, taken together, they have introduced a significant level of confusion for taxpayers,” said Thomas, who asked for better communication in future decision-making. 
No committee members objected to Thomas’ characterization of the Legislature’s work product. In fact, several agreed. 
The committee’s solution to the property tax confusion the Legislature created? Abolish property taxes entirely. 
“We need to shift to a new system,” Casper Republican Sen. Bob Ide said before bringing a motion to draft a bill repealing most of Article 15 of the Wyoming Constitution. 
If passed by the Legislature and approved by voters, the proposal would eliminate all property taxes — residential, commercial, industrial and personal — which brought in $2 billion in revenue in the 2024 tax year. That’s more than any other tax stream in Wyoming. 
The committee voted 11-3 in support of the motion. Rep. Liz Storer, D-Jackson, and Sens. Cale Case, R-Lander, and Stephan Pappas, R-Cheyenne, were the three opposing votes. 
“A sales tax is the only way we’re going to muck out all of this layered minutia of property taxes,” Ide said. 
But such a sweeping change is how lawmakers got themselves in a pickle to begin with, Case told the committee.

“We’ve got complicated things on the books that we created — the people in this room created — and we’re mad about that. And that’s what happens when you throw bills out there, and vote on bills, and get the public behind them and then get them out and passed without really thinking of the ramifications,” Case said. “We need to study the topic first before we throw a resolution out to eliminate property taxes from the constitution.”
The committee also voted to modify two property tax exemptions already on the books, including repealing a sunset date for one and eliminating an owner-occupied requirement for another. 
Property taxes do not fund state government. Instead, they pay for local services like county fire departments, K-12 education and transportation, senior centers, hospitals, water and sewer, community colleges, law enforcement, libraries and the construction or maintenance of roads and sidewalks. 
As a result of recent property tax cuts, many local governments across the state are now facing revenue shortfalls. 
“We’re struggling right now with what services we can maintain, or where we’re going to have to start cutting,” Weston County Commissioner Ed Wagoner told the committee, pointing to a $220,000 revenue loss this year. 
Such a dip may be inconsequential to wealthier counties like Campbell, he said, but not Weston. 
“Every county is different,” he said. 
That type of unequal footing is reason enough to look at another system, Rep. Bob Wharff, R-Evanston, said. 
“I’m leaning towards this. I think it’s a novel idea, and I think it’s something we need to look at, because I don’t know how we take something that’s already unequal,” Wharff said. 
Relying more heavily on sales and use tax, Case said, won’t change the fact that there is simply an unequal distribution of where commerce occurs across the state. 
“You would still have a distributional problem with a consumption tax,” he said. “Take Niobrara County, for example, and say, ‘All right, people, your county is going to be funded by consumption, and it’s the consumption that occurs in the county. There’s nothing there. There’s very little exchange.” 
Storer also cautioned lawmakers that if the state shifts to sales and use, it would require quite a hike to make up the difference. 
“We’re only collecting about $1.4 billion in sales and use tax currently,” Storer said. “So if you just do some quick math there, that means we’d at least probably be doubling our sales tax.” 
Chairman Rep. Tony Locke, R-Casper, said he was uncertain where he stood on eliminating property taxes, but was interested in how it could ease the limitations of reforming property taxes within the confines of the state’s constitution. 
“We constantly see this, ‘it’s unconstitutional, it’s constitutional’ when we try to make a change. So from that perspective, I want to see what this looks like,” Locke said. 
The committee’s next meeting is Aug. 21 in Casper.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)A federal judge in Denver on Wednesday issued an order blocking the Trump administration from carrying out the immediate deportation of the family of the man accused of attacking more than a dozen people in Boulder on Sunday with incendiary devices.
The suspect in the attack, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is an Egyptian citizen and Colorado Springs resident who authorities say was living in the U.S. unlawfully. He faces charges including 16 counts of attempted murder and a federal hate crime. Soliman allegedly told police that he targeted a demonstration on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall held by Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, because he wanted to “kill all Zionist people.”
Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty’s office said the number of victims in the attack had risen to 15 people ranging in age from 25 to 88, along with one dog. No new information was released Wednesday about multiple victims who were hospitalized as a result of the attack, some with severe burns.

The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday announced that it had detained Soliman’s wife and five children and was “processing (them) for removal proceedings from the U.S.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem also said in a statement that the department was “investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack.”
Soliman told investigators that “no one knew about his plans and he never talked to his wife or family about it,” according to an arrest warrant. Federal law enforcement agents executed a search warrant at Soliman’s residence Sunday night, and his family members were described by FBI officials as cooperative.
In a temporary restraining order issued Wednesday afternoon, U.S. District Court Judge Gordon P. Gallagher blocked the Trump administration from removing Soliman’s wife, Hayam El Gamal, or his five children “from the District of Colorado or the United States.” He set a hearing in the case, which was filed as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, for June 13.
“The Court finds that deportation without process could work irreparable harm and an order must issue without notice due to the urgency this situation presents,” Gallagher wrote.
DHS officials have said that Soliman entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, and filed an asylum claim in September 2022. The department’s statement Tuesday identified his family members as Egyptian citizens but did not contain specific information about their immigration statuses.
The Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition in a Tuesday statement called the Boulder attack a “heinous act of antisemitism” but accused some of exploiting the tragedy to push an anti-immigrant agenda.
“Even as people mourn, some have chosen to weaponize the alleged immigration status of the attacker to stoke fear and division,” the coalition’s statement said. “Let us be clear: immigration status is not a cause of violence. Hate is. When we focus on whether someone is undocumented rather than the root causes of this attack — antisemitism, xenophobia, and bigotry — we risk fueling the same cycles of hate that lead to these tragedies in the first place.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis gathered with faith and community leaders near the scene of the attack on Pearl Street Wednesday to “stand against hate.”
“Violence in any form has no place in Colorado, and we know that to move forward we must join together in our common humanity to ensure peace in our communities, take care of one another, and emerge stronger,” Polis said. “My heart is with those impacted by this devastating event, and we are continuing to actively work with local and state law enforcement to protect our communities and keep people safe.”

Barron wrote in the panel’s opinion.“Given the extensive findings made by the District Court and the absence of any contrary evidence having been submitted by the appellants, we conclude that the appellants' stay motion does not warrant our interfering with the ordinary course of appellate adjudication in the face of what the record indicates would be the apparent consequences of our doing so,” Barron wrote.The Trump administration had immediately challenged an order in May from U.S. District Judge Myong J.

Free.,Judge orders Trump to facilitate due process for migrants removed under wartime law,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-orders-trump-facilitate-due-process-migrants-removed-under-wartime-law,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in the District of Columbia on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to allow Venezuelan men removed under an 18th-century wartime law and sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador to have their cases heard in court, though he conceded the logistics of the order would be challenging to sort out.In a 69-page order, Judge James Boasberg partially granted an injunction to require 137 Venezuelans be given due process. He ruled that they had no chance to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, or the accusation that they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang.The Trump administration will have until June 11 to put forth a plan for the men removed under the wartime law and sent to the mega-prison known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, to be afforded their due process rights.“The Government has violated the CECOT Class’s vested right to due process, an infringement that risks inflicting irreparable harm for which the public interest requires a remedy,” Boasberg said. “The question — simply asked but not so simply answered — thus becomes what relief they must obtain for that violation.”Boasberg said that the Trump administration “plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States — a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition.”He said that even if President Donald Trump lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act and if those subject to the proclamation are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, they must be given a chance to contest the charges.“This is the critical point —there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the Government’s say-so.”“Defendants instead spirited away planeloads of people before any such challenge could be made,” Boasberg continued. “And now, significant evidence has come to light indicating that many of those currently entombed in CECOT have no connection to the gang and thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations.”Order doesn’t require returnThe American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case, sought to require the Venezuelans be brought back to the U.S. from El Salvador to challenge their removals. But Boasberg rejected that argument.Boasberg determined that even though there is a financial agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador to detain the men, they are in the custody of the Salvadoran government.“While it is a close question, the current record does not support Plaintiffs’ assertion that they are in the constructive custody of the United States,” Boasberg said.“Even crediting the public statements characterizing the arrangement as outsourcing the U.S. prison system and acknowledging the President’s unofficial assertion of his power to request a release, such comments cannot overcome a sworn declaration from a knowledgeable government official attesting that the CECOT Class’s ongoing detention is a question of Salvadoran law.”Department of Justice attorneys have used the same reasoning in a separate case to resist the return of the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, despite a U.S. Supreme Court order to ""facilitate"" the Maryland man’s return to the U.S.ACLU will be allowed to have input to determine how due process can be afforded to the men at CECOT, Boasberg wrote.Wednesday's order is the latest in a months-long dispute between the Trump administration and Boasberg after three planes landed in El Salvador and roughly 300 men were sent to CECOT in mid-March, despite the judge’s temporary restraining order against using the Alien Enemies Act.Boasberg found probable cause to hold Trump officials in contempt for violating his temporary restraining order that ordered the deportation planes carrying men removed under the Alien Enemies Act to be returned to the U.S. over concerns they did not receive due process.",,,,2025-06-04 20:06:11.008917

NorthWestern Energy electric customers will pay another $17.07 a month on average on their electric bills compared to their current payments with a rate increase the utility instated without regulatory approval.
The increase is legal, but it’s also the first time the monopoly has taken advantage of a statute that allows it to impose a new rate after an application has been pending, said Public Service Commission President Brad Molnar.
“We’re not allowed to stop it,” Molnar said this week.
The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities, and in July 2024, NorthWestern Energy filed an application with the agency requesting rate increases. A hearing will start on Monday, June 9.
However, Molnar said a statute adopted nearly 50 years ago gives NorthWestern Energy the right to increase rates on its own after nine months have passed since applying for an increase, and a spokesperson for the utility said it has been transparent that it would move forward with the option if necessary.
The monopoly utility announced the 16.87% rate increase, an equivalent of $205 a year, in advance of the hearing this month on its upcoming rate case.
NorthWestern Energy blamed its decision on stalled action by the Public Service Commission, but Molnar said the utility set up an impossible schedule from the start, including rolling five separate issues into one application, and it should stop pointing fingers.
The Montana Free Press first reported the self-determined increase.
NorthWestern spokesperson Jo Dee Black said this week the higher rates are temporary until the PSC sets rates. In the meantime, she said NorthWestern needs to “shore up finances.”
“In this case, it’s better for customers, we believe, if the rate increases are gradual,” Black said.
Before it adopted its own increase, NorthWestern Energy had requested the PSC approve a smaller, interim increase, as part of a partial settlement. However, NorthWestern said it would move ahead with its original request if the PSC didn’t respond by May 1.
“As a result of the Commission’s failure to timely grant the unopposed motion, NorthWestern’s as-filed electric rates become effective as a matter of law on May 23, 2025,” the utility wrote in a memo.
Black said the PSC took 14 months to make a decision in two recent cases, and the national average is around nine months. She said the “prolonged” review is creating “significant financial challenges” for NorthWestern.
Molnar, though, said the utility needed multiple attempts to even file an application that met minimum standards, it hasn’t answered questions in a timely fashion, and it included multiple issues in one case.
He said that approach means more work for a small staff, more intervenors, and more questions.
“They are playing the victim,” Molnar said. “They are casting aspersions. They are being derogatory towards my staff.”
The Public Service Commission oversees monopoly utilities in Montana and is charged with ensuring just rates for consumers and a fair return for private companies.
Molnar said the rates are in place until the PSC makes a final ruling on the case after the upcoming hearing — which Black said may not be until the fall.
If the PSC finds that NorthWestern is taking too much money from customers, Molnar said it has to pay back the amount deemed an overage plus 10%, and he questioned why NorthWestern would take that risk if it was in such dire straits.
Black said it wasn’t an easy decision, but the financial health and “strain on cash flow” tipped the balance.
Molnar also questioned how the PSC could take action on the smaller interim rate NorthWestern had submitted since the facts in the case remain in dispute.
“It is time for them to grow up and quit playing the victim and actually take responsibility for their actions,” Molnar said.
Although Molnar had strong words for NorthWestern — and offered to debate their spokesperson and CEO Brian Bird on talk radio — he also said decisions about their case would be made based on the facts, not on emotion.
He also said his job is different than NorthWestern Energy’s.
“They have one legal obligation,” Molnar said. “And they have only one party to serve that, by law, is their investors. They owe nothing to the ratepayers. … The Public Service Commission is elected to represent the people of Montana, to represent all ratepayers, and to represent the utility, and to treat all fairly and without bias.”
The rate case is scheduled to be heard June 9 to 20, although Molnar said this week the time period could be extended based on witness availability.
However, Molnar said the increase will hit lower- to middle-income earners hard, such as people living in an older mobile home without modern insulation.
He said people who are all-electric going into the cooling season will see much higher increases than $20 or so a month.
“This will be crushing to many low-income people, many of whom are simply elderly, that are being handed their butts every day in property tax increases, in utilities, insurance for their houses, insurance for their cars. You name it,” Molnar said. “This is a very, very bad time to be a poor person, and this will make it worse.”
Black, though, said the PSC is hurting NorthWestern Energy by not approving the rate increases it needs. At the end of 2024, she said, the PSC lowered electric rates by 7.45% instead of temporarily increasing them 1.89% as the utility had requested in its original application.
“That interim rate decrease has put NorthWestern Energy’s financial health at risk,” Black said in an email.
In NorthWestern Energy’s most recent earnings call at the end of April, its leaders reported “a solid first quarter,” a “very, very attractive” dividend yield, and significant growth potential in the future.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1248907535-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 20:06:11.008917

A controversial proposal to mine gravel at the base of Casper Mountain would use a county road, raising community concerns. State land commissioners will consider the matter Thursday.
The post Amid gravel pit fight, Natrona County looks to limit heavy truck traffic in neighborhoods appeared first on WyoFile .","Natrona County commissioners advanced this week a new county-wide policy aimed at regulating heavy truck traffic on designated residential roads, including Coates Road, which would provide access to a contested gravel pit on Casper Mountain.
Gregg Werger, a Coates Road resident and vocal opponent of Prism Logistics’ attempt to build a nearby gravel pit, reminded commissioners there will be a State Board of Land Commissioners meeting Thursday to consider Prism’s lease renewal applications.
At Tuesday’s meeting in Casper, Werger told commissioners that it would be beneficial to inform the state board that Natrona County no longer permits extractive mining in the residential zone where seven of the eight leases sit.
The county has done just that, sending a letter dated May 27 to the Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments ahead of Thursday’s meeting. The letter also touches on concerns about impacts to county-maintained roads.
“While Natrona County has a long history of supporting economic development in our County, we Commissioners have deep and serious concerns about the impacts of gravel extraction at this specific location on the health, safety and welfare of Natrona County citizens and damage to property owned by Natrona County, including a public gravel road along which hundreds of residents and recreationalists travel weekly,” the letter states.
In addition to the letter, Casper residents are heading to Cheyenne.
“We have quite a contingent going over there this week,” Werger said.
Later in the meeting, during commissioner comments, Chairman Dave North also said he would be in Cheyenne for the state land board meeting.
“I believe there’s a lot of things that need to be said in front of the board,” North said.
The county’s letter points out that the state did not notify the county before granting the mine exploration leases in 2023 on several school trust sections adjacent to a rural housing area just west of Casper. The State Board of Land Commissioners, which made the decision, is made up of the governor, secretary of state, treasurer, auditor and superintendent of public instruction. The leases have since spawned two lawsuits.
Discussing safety on Coates Road, also mapped as County Road 503, Natrona County Road and Bridge Superintendent Mike Haigler said it’s 2.6 miles long with a speed limit of 35 mph. In the last one to two years, around $787,000 was spent on improvements, with contributions from the county, city and residents. A quarter-mile paved section within the Casper city limits was finished in 2021, funded by local property owners.
Haigler identified some safety issues on Coates Road, which is otherwise in good condition for homes. Issues include the need for yearly magnesium treatments to reduce dust, flying rocks from vehicles, and traffic coming from side roads that do not have stop signs.
During winter, strong winds and drifting snow can make the road slippery, especially near Highway 220, requiring a lot of plowing and sanding.
A school bus turnaround in the city requires the bus to make a full turn on the road.
The space for traffic at the CY Avenue stop sign is limited, with less than 160 feet, which could block driveways. Haigler also said the view toward Robertson Road is not very good.
The 24-foot-wide road is meant for residential traffic, with the paved part designed for vehicles weighing up to 16,000 pounds, but not for heavy loads over time. The gravel part has 6 inches of gravel, commissioners were told.
Coates Road is a dead-end road, requiring vehicles to turn on private property or off-road at the south end.
The area has seen free-range cattle in Section 16, and is used by people for recreational activities like riding horses, bicycles and jogging.
City of Casper Chief Operating Officer Tom Brauer said the city hasn’t taken a “hard position” regarding heavy truck traffic on Coates Road, opting instead to state facts. Commissioner Jim Milne encouraged the city to take a stance, saying the city is “trying to straddle a fence and let the county deal with it.”
North spoke about the county board’s responsibility to keep county roads safe for residents. He said the new policy on heavy vehicle traffic will apply to all county roads, not just Coates Road, to protect county assets and follow zoning rules about which industries and traffic are allowed. The County Attorney’s Office could manage permits for specific traffic requests.
The county commissioners approved Tuesday a resolution that will now undergo a 45-day public comment period. Milne suggested changes to make it clear that the elected commissioners, rather than just the Road and Bridge Department, will make final decisions on road restrictions or special permits. He also proposed adding an addendum to allow for changing the list of roads as necessary. While the resolution will be published in its current form at first, the suggestions will be considered for the final version.
During the public comment portion of the meeting, Coates Road resident Walter Merschat asked for clarification on the review process after the 45-day period. Commissioners assured him the resolution would be brought back for their vote, and all written comments would be considered before adoption.

Dan McKee to join the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s board of directors. (Courtesy photo)A Senate panel will give first vetting Thursday to a nominee who could bring racial diversity to the state’s quasi-public bus agency. 
Gov. Dan McKee on May 28 announced his nomination of Bernard Georges to serve on the Rhode Island Public Transportation Authority’s (RIPTA) board of directors, citing his professional experience and community ties leading New Bridges for Haitian Success, Inc, a nonprofit that assists Haitian immigrants. 
Not mentioned in McKee’s statement, but crucial to transit advocates and participants, is the diversity Georges’ would bring to the nine-member board.
“The board is now mostly, if not entirely, white men,” RI Transit Riders Co-Chair Amy Glidden said in an interview Wednesday.
Georges declined to comment on his nomination when reached by phone Wednesday.
If approved by the full Senate chamber, Georges would replace former state Sen. Robert Kells, a Providence Democrat who has served on RIPTA’s board of directors since 2019. Kells’ term expired April 1, 2025 — along with four other members, according to the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s website.
His nomination will be considered by the Committee on Housing & Municipal Government Thursday afternoon. Board members typically serve a three-year term, but Georges’ term would expire April 2027. McKee’s office acknowledged an inquiry on the reason for the shorter term but did not send a response as of Wednesday evening.
Glidden commended the governor for bringing diversity to the board, which she said has been lacking since the term of Marcy Reyes, who is Puerto Rican, ended April 2024. Heather Schey, who is white, remains the only woman on the board.
Nearly 60% of RIPTA riders identified as people of color, according to a 2021 survey of 3,565 bus users.
State law calls for “diverse membership,” but does not address racial or gender diversity outright. 
Even more important to Glidden than race was board representation of transit riders. State law mandates the board include at least one regular fixed-route rider and one person with a disability. Schey is a user of RIPTA’s paratransit service, while James Leach is a regular fixed-route rider.
Glidden also would have liked for the governor to give riders a say before making his nomination.
“There’s been no public input,” she said.
Georges immigrated to Rhode Island in 2000 at age 16 from Haiti, joining his father, who had already fled the island nation years earlier during the dictatorship of Jean-Claude “Baby Doc’’ Duvalier. 
He graduated from Central High School in Providence in 2004 and received an associate’s degree in law enforcement at the Community College of Rhode Island, along with a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice and a master’s degree in public administration from Roger Williams University.
In 2013, Georges founded New Bridges for Haitian Success, which supports immigrants through job training, case management, counseling, and obtaining health care. He also worked for the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth & Families as a residential counselor, according to the governor’s office.
“Bernard is a dedicated community leader who has spent his career helping others find pathways to a successful future,” McKee said in a statement.
RIPTA CEO Chirstopher Durand welcomed Georges’ addition to the board.
“His commitment to equity, experience supporting underserved communities, and proven ability to build bridges between people and resources make him an excellent addition,” Durand said in a statement.
Georges’ nomination comes as RIPTA faces an estimated $32.6 million shortfall heading into the fiscal year beginning July 1. McKee did not offer any state funds for the cash-strapped bus agency in his recommended budget, citing a not-yet-completed study into RIPTA’s operations.
RIPTA’s efficiency study is a third of the way there

An efficiency study was required by Gov. Dan McKee and the General Assembly as a condition in last year’s state budget to plug the agency’s deficit. The report was initially due March 1.
As of May 30, Canadian-headquartered engineering consulting firm WSP is two-thirds finished with the overdue assessment, publishing a 20-page draft report on RIPTA’s transit operations. The initial report found that routes with limited connections to dense neighborhoods tend to have lower ridership due to their lower demand.
Legislators have proposed their own measures to close RIPTA’s deficit. That includes legislation that would put a $100 million transit bond on the 2026 ballot and upping the agency’s share of the gas tax.
Sen. Meghan Kallman, a Pawtucket Democrat who sits on the eight-member Senate Committee on Housing & Municipal Government, proposed adding a new tax on Uber and Lyft rides to fund mass transit.
“The board deserves to manage an agency that is properly funded,” Kallman said.

(Photo courtesy of the Thurston County Sheriff's Office)An investigation into a two-year-long string of military equipment theft from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, turned up Nazi memorabilia, white supremacist literature and a cache of weapons in the suspects’ home in Lacey, according to charges filed in federal court Wednesday. 
Federal prosecutors charged Charles Fields and Levi Frakes with robbery, assault and theft of government property for allegedly stealing helmets, body armor and communications equipment from the Pierce County military base late Sunday. Both men “previously served” in the military, according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Tacoma. 
Just after 8 p.m. Sunday, the duo scanned their identification documents as they entered the base in a Toyota 4Runner, according to the charges. 
About an hour later, someone on the base entered a U.S. Army Ranger operations facility to find two masked men, later identified as Fields and Frakes, court papers say. Investigators believe the men used bolt cutters to get inside. 
The men later unmasked themselves before attacking the person with a hammer, federal prosecutors allege. The alleged victim was able to get control of the hammer, but surrendered when one of the suspects pulled out a knife. During the fight, one of the intruders dropped a hat with “FIELDS” handwritten on the inside. 
The pair reportedly then fled the Ranger compound with around $14,000 in government property. The man who was attacked was hit in the head with the hammer and was bruised and bloodied, according to court documents. He was taken to Madigan Army Medical Center.
Surveillance video shows the two men leaving with rucksacks, two of which they dropped while fleeing, according to the complaint. 
Army criminal investigators obtained a search warrant for a home in Lacey that both men used as an address. Late Monday night, they found 35 weapons, including rifles, pistols and a machine gun, along with silencers, prosecutors allege. 
Agents also reported seizing military property like night vision devices, flashbangs, smoke grenades and body armor. 
“Some of the military items agents recovered are unlawful to possess without unique permission from the (Department of Defense) and some of the items are so restricted that active duty military members are not permitted to have or store them in their personal residences,” special agent Christopher Raguse wrote in the complaint.
Each bedroom featured Nazi and white supremacist memorabilia, murals and literature, according to court papers. 
A photo included in the charging papers shows side-by-side flags in one room emblazoned with a Nazi swastika and SS Bolts referring to the Schutzstaffel police unit in Nazi Germany. Since World War II, neo-Nazis have adopted the symbol, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
“The suspects identified in this case were actively involved in Nazi White Nationalist efforts,” Thurston County Sheriff Derek Sanders wrote in a Facebook post announcing the arrests.  
One of the two men agreed to speak with investigators. The complaint doesn’t identify whether this was Fields or Frakes. The suspect acknowledged stealing military property from the Ranger compound to sell or trade for about two years, according to the charges.
It’s unclear if the men had any other plans with the stolen arsenal.
Law enforcement booked both men into the Thurston County Jail on separate state criminal allegations. A judge there set bail at $500,000 each. They remained in Thurston County custody Wednesday, said a spokesperson from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in western Washington. 
It’s unclear when they will be transferred to federal custody for their first appearance on the charges filed in Tacoma on Wednesday.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3456-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 19:10:10.297051

WILMINGTON — Delaware artist Jennifer Hintz Eggers brings an intimate and visually rich exploration of motherhood, nature, and spirituality to the Delaware Division of the Arts’ Mezzanine Gallery with her solo exhibition.
Named “Seeds of Life,” The show opens Friday, June 6, with a public reception from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., and will remain on view through July 25.
The exhibition features a series of collages and oil paintings that draw from Eggers’ personal experiences of early motherhood.
Her work fuses sacred geometry, branching organic lines, and floral forms inspired by the human body—what she calls “mammary flowers”—to reflect themes of growth, interconnectedness, and resilience.
Each piece is a “meditation” which involves layering translucent oil paints over intricate grids and interlocking circles.
These overlapping shapes—an ancient symbol of unity and continuity—guide viewers through an emotional and visual journey echoing natural cycles like cellular division and lunar phases.
A lifelong Delaware resident, Eggers earned her BFA in painting from the University of Delaware in 2008.
She is the founder of The Ladies’ Art House and maintains a studio at The Delaware Contemporary.
Her work has been exhibited at institutions including the Susquehanna Art Museum and the University of Mary Washington.

Alana DiMario of Narragansett and Rep. Michelle McGaw of Portsmouth are sponsoring not-quite-identical bills that would increase how much ADHD medication patients can receive at once. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Availability of tightly regulated ADHD medications could improve under a pair of bills that continue to move through the Rhode Island General Assembly following a Senate floor vote Tuesday night.
Bill S795 by Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, passed 36-0 and now joins the amended version of bill H5866 by Portsmouth Democratic Rep. Michelle McGaw, which passed the House 70-0 on April 22. Now each bill awaits a committee hearing in the opposite chamber. Both bills would allow for non-opioid Schedule II stimulants like Adderall, Ritalin, and Vyvanse, which are commonly used as ADHD treatments, to be prescribed and dispensed in larger amounts for doctor and patient convenience. 
Sen. Pam Lauria, a Barrington Democrat and nurse practitioner, stood to commend DiMario’s legislation on the Senate floor, calling it “an incredibly important bill, particularly as we are talking about the administrative burdens on primary care providers.”
“These are chronic medications that these people take every day, but every month, because of the very real safeguards for these medications, the extra time that it takes for primary care providers or psychiatrists… to do this work is cumbersome,” Lauria said.
The “cumbersome” refill schedule is exactly what DiMario’s legislation wants to fix. Under current federal rules, providers can write three separate 30-day prescriptions for a total 90-day supply. Some states have adopted revised rules that allow patients to pick up all 90 days’ worth at once, as Massachusetts did in 2024. 
In the Ocean State, however, patients still have to return to the pharmacy monthly and pick up the prescriptions one by one. Patients also have to contact their doctor to send in the second and third month’s prescriptions, piling onto providers’ workloads. 
Alas, there’s one important difference between the bills: DiMario’s version allows for patients to fill all 90 days at once, while McGaw’s amended version caps fills at 60 days.
DiMario said in a phone interview Wednesday that she believes the House and Senate will eventually agree on a version of the legislation as the state’s legislative session winds down in the following weeks.
“We really believe that 90 days provides the most meaningful kind of time burden relief for patients and providers,” DiMario said. “My position is that I’m strongly advocating for the 90 days, but I do believe that an agreement will be reached.”
Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, did not immediately have scheduling details for the bills Wednesday, and noted that the bills’ different time frames “will have to be addressed.”
McGaw agreed in a phone call Wednesday evening, saying that with the Senate’s OK of a 90-day supply, the legislation is “still sort of in limbo” until she can meet with the House committee chair and the senate’s policy team.
McGaw originally proposed a 90-day supply but reduced it to 60 days after feedback from some prescribers. She thinks a single version of the bill will eventually emerge after more conversations, acknowledging that edits to not-quite-identical legislation in both chambers is not uncommon as the legislative session nears its end.  
“I would be happy with either version, whether we decide on 60 or 90 days,” McGaw said. “In either case, it helps to reduce some of the administrative burdens for our physicians, and also helps parents or patients for whom it’s a challenge to go to the doctor every month and get a new prescription.” 
On the Senate floor, DiMario said the bill builds on successful legislation last year that authorized electronic transfers of ADHD prescriptions, pending state adoption of new federal standards. 
Both last year’s and this year’s ADHD drug bills are designed to alleviate headaches for patients and providers alike amid pill shortages ongoing since 2022, attributed to a number of factors, including a sharp increase in adult diagnoses. The Drug Enforcement Administration previously faced scrutiny for limiting production quotas of Schedule II drugs, but it increased some of those quotas in 2024.
An October 2024 edition of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report relayed that there were an estimated 15.5 million U.S. adults with an ADHD diagnosis in 2023; about half were diagnosed as adults. Roughly one-third of these adults take stimulant drugs for their condition, and shortages affected 71.5% of this population’s access to their medications.  
A 2025 article in the American Journal of Managed Care noted that stimulant prescriptions have almost doubled in the past 10 years. 
“There is only so much pharmaceutical companies can do when demand severely outweighs supply,” the authors wrote.

Phaneuf and Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-bond-package-local-aid-housing/,"The borrowing plan would finance aid for cities and towns, homelessness prevention and security at places of worship, among other areas.","The General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a $9.7 billion bond package Wednesday to finance school construction, transportation upgrades and other capital projects for the next two fiscal years.
The borrowing plan, which passed 35-1 in the Senate and 144-4 in the House, would expand non-education aid for cities and towns, increase affordable housing and combat homelessness, bolster security at places of worship and support construction and renovation of child care facilities.
It recommends new capital investments in higher education — including $5 million to advance the planned renovation of Gampel Pavilion at the University of Connecticut — and a new $60 million program to help K-12 school districts fund small-scale renovation projects.
Lawmakers negotiated the package with Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration, and the governor is expected to sign the measure.
“Today’s package continues to reduce the strains on cities and towns,” said Rep. Patricia Miller, D-Stamford, co-chairwoman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee’s bonding subcommittee, who called the measure “thoughtful and strategic.”
“These are funds that are so impactful for our communities and make such a positive difference,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
Legislators authorized $4.5 billion in borrowing next fiscal year and $5.1 billion in 2026-27. That action doesn’t guarantee financing for any program, and some authorizations won’t progress further than Wednesday’s votes. The State Bond Commission, a 10-member panel that includes Gov. Ned Lamont, other Executive Branch officials and legislators, also must grant approval before the state borrows any funds by selling bonds to Wall Street investors.
Boosting non-education aid for cities and towns
Connecticut traditionally dedicates most of its borrowing to finance municipal school construction, transportation infrastructure work and clean water projects. Almost half of the entire bond package — more than 60%, about $2.8 billion in each of the next two years — would be dedicated to these three areas.
Rather than borrowing, the state pays cash through its budget to fund most operating aid to cities and towns. Aid to schools — the single-largest expense municipalities face — captures the bulk of those funds.
But the two-year bond package seeks to boost non-education aid in several areas.
The Town Aid Road program, which pays for road repaving, other related maintenance and winter snow removal, would grow from $60 million to $80 million per year.
A second generic grant for projects and other expenses would climb from $91 million annually to $150 million.
Other financing for municipal aid included in the package includes:

$242 million over the next two years for the Community Investment Fund, which supports economic development initiatives and other projects in low-income cities and towns;


$14 million over the biennium to support economically distressed municipalities;


$10 million over two years to support school districts in large cities that appear before the state’s Municipal Finance Advisory Commission, which works to assist communities in poor fiscal condition;


And $15 million in the next fiscal year to support communities impacted by a catastrophic event.

But the head of Connecticut Conference of Municipalities said Wednesday that despite some “bright spots,” overall state aid to communities is disappointing.
“Once again, Connecticut’s cities and towns have been left behind by a state budget that fails to meet the moment,” Executive Director Joe DeLong wrote in a statement, adding that most increases in education and general government grants — whether included in the new state budget or the bond package — dedicate most additional dollars only to the poorest communities.
“That leaves most of Connecticut’s towns and cities scrambling to fill growing budget gaps with fewer resources, all while being handed new responsibilities,” DeLong said, adding that it happened while analysts projected a $2.4 billion budget surplus for this fiscal year and while the state enjoys a record-setting $4.1 billion emergency reserve.
CCM says communities lose more than $400 million annually because Connecticut’s statutory education grants — including general aid, special education and funds for charter and magnet schools — haven’t kept pace with inflation for years.
Education advocates praised a new item in the bond package authorizing $30 million in borrowing in each of the new two fiscal years to help local school districts with small-scale repairs and renovations.

The District Repair and Improvement Project, nicknamed DRIP, “is a practical-yet-transformative solution that will help school districts across the state have access to resources to ensure students and educators can learn and work in safe, healthy and up-to-date environments,” the School and State Finance Project wrote in a statement.
Fran Rabinowitz, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents, said the new program would make a major difference.
“I can think of so many times you needed a new window or smaller improvements in schools and there was just no place to go for [funding] other than our own capital budget,” said Rabinowitz, a former superintendent in Bridgeport and Hamden.
A strong focus on housing, combating homelessness
Lawmakers recommended slightly more than $1 billion in financing over the coming biennium to build more housing, increase homeownership and get people who are experiencing homelessness into housing.
In recent years, the governor and legislators have called for more investments in housing as rental costs have risen, which Lamont often says hinders Connecticut’s economic growth.
The package authorizes $200 million annually for “flexible housing,” which refers to affordable units typically built in mixed-income developments. It’s often meant to increase housing for the hourly-wage workforce such as those in the service industry or bus drivers.
It also approves $50 million annually for middle housing, which is typically lighter-density multifamily units. It can mean anything from duplexes and triplexes to cottage clusters and townhouses. 
Another $60 million over the biennium would be dedicated to the Time to Own program, which offers downpayment and closing cost assistance to first-time homebuyers. The program has opened and closed a handful of times since its creation in June 2022. In October, the state’s bond commission reopened the program with $40 million.
Lamont often touts the program, which helps people of color who were historically and systemically shut out of the home buying market for decades, purchase houses and build wealth. Through the program, first-time homebuyers get an average of about $30,000 toward a down payment.

Lawmakers earmarked $6 million in annual financing for rapid rehousing, which aims to quickly move people experiencing homelessness back into housing. People facing mental health, substance abuse or employment issues often find it easier to address these challenges when housed.
That principle has been the focus of the federal housing policy for years, beginning with former President Barack Obama’s administration.
Connecticut’s investment comes as the state has seen three years of increases in homelessness after years of declines. The latest count showed that there are nearly 6,000 people experiencing homelessness across the state.
State officials have intensified housing construction efforts in recent years, ordering major investments in these areas in 2023.
The General Assembly earlier this week enacted the most expansive housing legislation in recent history. That measure prioritizes municipalities for state infrastructure grants if they change zoning to facilitate multifamily housing construction.
Protecting places of worship and other initiatives
The bond package also includes $10 million in financing in each of the next two years for grants to synagogues, mosques, churches, other places of worship and to other nonprofits to enhance security.
Connecticut launched this assistance program three years ago, and Sen. Derek Slap said, “the need has not been satisfied.”
A West Hartford Democrat, Slap said he recently has driven past several synagogues in his town, and “every single one of them, there is an armed guard outside.”
Slap added that “Nobody should be afraid to pray and nobody should be afraid to worship at a place that is holy and special to them. And that is just a basic tenet of living in a society.”
The bill also includes $50 million in fiscal year 2026 to build a new Whiting Forensic Hospital, the state’s inpatient care setting for people with acute mental health needs who have been involved in crimes. Advocates for years have said conditions in the hospital are poor.
Other items in the biennial budget package include:

$25 million in each of the next two fiscal years to assist homeowners in eastern Connecticut struggling with crumbling house foundations;


$11.5 million in each of the next two years to support construction of early childhood education and child care facilities.


$68 million next fiscal year and $5 million in 2026-27 for capital improvements in the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system.


$36 million next fiscal year and $48 million in 2026-27 for capital improvements for the University of Connecticut. The second-year financing includes an additional $5 million in planned renovations to Gampel Pavilion and the field house on the main campus in Storrs.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0604_SR_SessionLastDay_088-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 19:10:10.297051

(Photo from Inciweb)With one fire blowing up over the weekend and an expected worse-than-average wildfire season across Montana, Gov. Greg Gianforte touted the efforts of the state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, saying they’ve been able to keep 95% of wildfire starts to 10 acres or less since 2021. 
During an annual state fire briefing on Monday, he also recognized the “proactive preparation, coordination and teamwork” he said was needed to keep people safe. The state has seen an early start to its fire season.
Department of Natural Resources and Conservation Director Amanda Kaster said her agency is “more prepared than ever” and thanked the legislature for the passage of wildfire bills during the session.
“The state of Montana and DNRC is prepared for the 2025 fire season, not only through our fire protection program, but through the work we do to reduce wildfire risk across Montana’s landscapes,” Kaster said.
The briefing also included a long-term weather forecast from Northern Rockies Coordination Center meteorologist Dan Borsum who said computer projections are calling for a dry and hot summer. He also said some weather patterns are similar to high fire danger years in the past – like 2000, 2002, 2006, 2017 and 2021.
There’s worry about drought impacting large portions of Montana and melted-out snowpack that places higher elevations at increased risk for fire, all of which could stretch resources.
“The multi-year deficits of moisture are starting to hurt us, the overall warm and dry summer forecast, and the fact that we may have fire on the landscape when the wind season approaches in September, because we didn’t get that monsoon infusion,” Borsum said during the briefing. “That has me very concerned that this fire season could be significant.”
According to WildfireRisk.org, Montana has a higher risk of wildfires than 74% of states in the U.S. Additionally, Wildfire Risk reports more than half of all homes in Montana are at high risk of “direct exposure,” which the organization defines as homes that “may be ignited by adjacent vegetation, flying embers, or nearby structures.”
A report in Government Technology this week also put Ravalli County among the highest risk for wildfire of any county in America. It said 99% of homes in the county are at “high risk of wildfire exposure.”
Fire experts say building homes out of nonflammable materials and designing them in ways that downgrade fire risk are critical to saving property. Additionally, land management practices like controlled burns, logging thinning operations and homeowners clearing brush from structures can prevent damage and make firefighters’ jobs a little easier.
Officials with the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, among other land management agencies, spoke at the briefing. Several agencies shared difficulties in hiring firefighting staff for the season, but highlighted their fuels and forest management programs aimed at limiting fuels for wildfires.
The Forest Service said they conducted hazardous fuels reduction work on 200,000 acres of Montana forest in 2024, the BLM conducted approximately 38,000 acres of prescribed burns last year, the Forest Service while Fish and Wildlife Service said they burned around 11,000 — an outsized number given the agency’s small land presence in the state.
Some fire scientists have said prescribed burns are ineffective because of their relatively small scale.
While fire prevention was part of the discussion, so was fighting fire — something being talked about at the national level, too. In Washington, D.C. this week, U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, R-Montana, helped push a bipartisan wildfire bill through Congress. 
The Aerial Firefighting Enhancement Act passed through both chambers and is headed to President Donald Trump’s desk. The bill reauthorizes the sale of both airplanes and parts from the Department of Defense for aerial firefighting efforts.
Sheehy founded a company that provides aerial firefighting services. 
“Eliminating bureaucratic obstacles to fight wildfires more quickly and aggressively is America First common sense, and I appreciate my colleagues in the House and Senate for their support,” Sheehy said in a press release. “I look forward to seeing this bipartisan bill cross the finish line so we can better support the brave first responders on the front lines fighting wildfires across the country.”
Banana Lake update
As of Wednesday, the Banana Lake fire near Plains was listed at 929 acres and 15% containment.
Nick Holloway with the Western Montana All Hazards Incident Management Team and spokesperson for efforts on the fire said that four structures had been protected. He also added crews were in the process of mop-up operations, though the situation has been complex.
Crews had to deal with seven spot fires on Tuesday, which Holloway said had been a “huge concern,” though firefighters had contained those blazes.
Additionally, the edge of the fire is a mix of burned and unburned materials, a situation they call a “dirty burn.” It means there’s more potential for spotting, which is the process in which sparks and embers get carried by the wind into unburned fuel.
“There could be a spark in one of those unburned pockets, and it’s close to the edge,” Holloway said. “And so during the mop-up efforts, they’re going through that, gridding the area to look for residual sources of heat and extinguish them. But it takes a lot longer when you have that dirty burn than when you have a nice, clean edge.”
Holloway said the Banana Fire represents a relatively early start to Montana’s fire season, and cautioned that the state could be in for a long year.
“Predictive Services has told us it’s going to be dry and warm, more so than normal,” Holloway said. “So that’s going to be problematic for this fire season.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WildlandFireTruck-1024x951.jpeg,,,2025-06-04 19:10:10.297051

The commission on Wednesday announced that it issued the complaint against Troy’s 52-4 District Court Judge Kristen Hartig, citing a refusal to provide a report of a personal psychological evaluation when the commission investigated allegations of misconduct and found that mental health was an issue.
Hartig was also alleged to have given false statements to the commission, mistreated or abused court employees and others, and had obstructed the administration of her court. The complaint goes on to accuse Hartig of the improper dismissal of criminal cases.
The commission said the next step is to give Hartig a chance to respond while the commission’s Disciplinary Counsel petitions the Michigan Supreme Court to appoint a special master, who will preside over a public hearing on the matter.
Hartig issued a statement on the situation through her spokesperson, Daniel Cherrin, who said the judge respected the role of the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission and was committed to fully participating in the process.
“After years of inquiry, the commission has produced a complaint based on disputed claims and a flawed process. Judge Hartig has waited patiently for the opportunity to address these allegations directly and looks forward to doing so,” Cherrin said. “The public deserves confidence in both the judiciary and its oversight. That confidence depends on transparency grounded in fact, not fiction. Judge Hartig has served the public and the bench for more than a decade with integrity, transparency, and a commitment to justice. The commission is expected to do the same.”
Meanwhile, 52nd District Court Chief Judge Travis Reeds in a statement said that Harting was being removed from her entire docket while the complaint process plays out.
Reeds had already removed Harting from hearing her felony docket, relegating her in May to hearing only civil, landlord/tenant and small claims cases. The felony cases in the jurisdiction, which covers Troy and Clawson, were to be heard by Judge Maureen McGinnis.
“The Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of our courts. While due process is vital, accountability helps preserve public trust in the judiciary,” Reeds said. “Based on the limited information available to me at the time, I removed Judge Hartig from the most serious cases within the authority I had as chief judge. Now that a formal complaint has been filed, further action may be appropriate. I believe temporarily removing her from her full docket would be in the best interest of the court and the communities we serve.”

And organizer Sam Bliss, wrote an op-ed stating that Food Not Cops makes downtown safer.After hours of deliberation, the City Council last week voted to direct the mayor to relocate the free lunch distribution program by July 14.Burlington resident Alex Olsen, 44, wasn’t hungry but came to meet his friends during Food Not Cops’ lunch hour in the Marketplace Garage in downtown Burlington on Wednesday, June 4. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerAs the debate continued in a City Council meeting Monday, Mulvaney-Stanak interrupted it and signed a resolution allocating $10,000 to support relocation of the effort “to a more accessible and better-resourced location.” That’s a significant increase from the $2,000 previously offered in the fiscal year 2025 budget.Signing the resolution after two weeks of divisiveness and contention on the issue “was the best path to move us forward,” she said at a press conference Tuesday.Mulvaney-Stanak said “mutual aid and food security is a critical need in our community. It has really grown in the last several years, and we as a community — I think everyone said this — value this.”The funding allocated was news to some of those who came to lunch Wednesday.Some said they use the wall of the garage off Cherry Street because there is no cleaner, safer place available, and because it allows for some privacy and protection from inclement weather. One volunteer wondered if a tent could be put up and a carpet put down for food distribution in the yard of the Ronald McDonald House across the street that provides shelter and food to families whose children are being treated at the hospital.The money could support a community partner willing to host the food distribution or support Food Not Cops with items related to the relocation, Joe Magee, the mayor’s spokesperson, wrote in an email Wednesday.“We are continuing to engage with members of the group, as well as community partners who have expressed a willingness to support efforts to find a suitable alternative location,” Magee wrote. “To my knowledge, the food distribution has not stopped, and it would be our hope to have the transition to a new location be as seamless as possible given the many folks in our community who rely on the consistency of the food distribution.”READ MORE
After multiple conversations with members of Food Not Cops in recent weeks, Mulvaney-Stanak said at Tuesday’s press conference that there are broad opinions about what should happen next.The main takeaway, she said, is that it is “incredibly important” for Burlington to have an easy-to-find, central location for a service that is “filling a real need.”“Having food is not only a basic need being met but it de-escalates a lot of the high-risk issues that people can face when they don’t have that particular need met,” she said.As city officials discuss the program’s fate, the volunteer-run effort continues to cook food nightly and distribute food daily from 1 to 2 p.m. from the red brick wall bordering the garage. They are welcoming residents who want to contribute time, supplies or money via their social media accounts on Instagram and Facebook, volunteers said.Food Not Cops volunteers cleaned up after serving lunch from 1-2 p.m. in the Marketplace Garage in downtown Burlington on Wednesday, June 4. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerVolunteers Wednesday served hot dogs, burgers, corn on the cob, apple sauce and roasted veggies, along with condiments, soda and water. They also distributed supplies like cleaning wipes, toothpaste, ibuprofen, bandages, lip balm, combs and playing cards, packed into plastic milk crates.The foil trays containing the burgers and hotdogs were emptied within 20 minutes, feeding about 30 people, volunteers estimated.But many of those served, like Alex Olsen, 44, came for the conversation and the camaraderie, rather than the food. He said he was unhoused for eight years, so he “completely respects” and loves “everything” about the Food Not Cops effort. He said he usually helps clean up after the meal.“The people here are my friends,” Olsen said. “Any time I come here, it’s open arms, no one judges me, and if I eat I eat, if I don’t, I don’t.”Olsen was one of the participants who attended the recent City Council meeting discussing the food service and spoke in favor of the program. “I feel it’s a staple in town and I don’t think there is any reason whatever for them to move,” he said Wednesday.Burlington resident and clinical social worker Gina Frattone-Johnson has been volunteering to serve food at the garage for a few years. She said she’s seen a few fights and arguments there, but nothing that couldn’t be “disengaged rather quickly.”“It’s an opportunity to engage in communal action. And I have a soft spot for people in my heart who are houseless,” she said.One man who came to lunch earlier this year, she recalled, was really cold. She said she found him a shirt, while another volunteer found him a jacket and told him he could have a tent and sleeping bag, too, because his belongings were stolen.“There aren’t many places people can go to eat, sleep and get community resources and maybe referrals,” Frattone-Johnson said.As she helped pack up the crates and wheel the dolly to a van, Frattone-Johnson stopped to chat with a law enforcement officer parked in his black SUV nearby.A woman with a walker stopped to ask if they had any money to spare, saying her son was sick and she needed bus fare to get to Rutland. Comiskey greeted her but said she didn’t have any money and asked the woman if she’d like some cold water.“A lot of people are asking for money today,” Comiskey said later. “You can kind of gauge what’s going on here by what people are asking for.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Burlington mayor allocates $10K to support, relocate local Food Not Cops free lunch downtown.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/food-not-cops-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 19:10:10.297051

Kristey Williams of Augusta, right, agreed Kansas ought to increase pressure on parents to encourage their children to repeat a grade level if confronted with fundamental academic deficiencies. Other members of the Kansas Legislature's school finance task force pushed back, saying repeating a grade carried unintended consequences for students. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Rep. Kristey Williams and Sen. Beverly Gossage landed on the same page Wednesday in terms of altering the state’s public education system to encourage students to address academic deficiencies by retaking a grade.
“Are we doing these children a favor by just moving them through the grades?” said Gossage, a Eudora Republican serving on the Kansas Legislature’s school finance task force. “We need to take a look at that at each grade level.”
Williams, an Augusta Republican on the task force, said Kansas ought to direct third-graders to summer school programs if those children weren’t academically prepared to enter fourth grade.
In Kansas, however, students couldn’t be compelled to attend summer school. The state’s public schools could mandate a student repeat a grade, Williams said.
“We’re going to have to be a little bit stronger and not just give in on the first whim, the first cry,” Williams said.
Task force member Jim Porter, who serves on the Kansas State Board of Education and couldn’t read when he left third-grade, urged the task force to be wary of unintended consequences tied to holding students back.
“I think the research indicates … that holding kids back one year increases the probability of dropping out. Holding a kid back two years almost guarantees that they will be a dropout,” Porter said.
Task force chairwoman Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican in the Kansas Senate, said students who couldn’t read by third grade were likely to face significant scholarly and behavioral challenges during the remainder of their school years.
“Those are students, in my experience, that become behavior problems in the classroom,” Erickson said. “They’d rather be a behavior problem than look stupid in front of their peers.”
The task force scheduled a series of meetings this summer and fall with the goal of developing by January a blueprint for reforming how the Legislature allocated state tax dollars to K-12 public school districts.
The current education finance system has been found by the Kansas Supreme Court to comply with the state Constitution, but many lawmakers bristle at the cost of public schools and the ability of the state to suitably educate students.
Rep. Susan Estes, a Wichita Republican whose spouse is U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, said the objective should be a formula that guaranteed accountability for spending and improved educational opportunities for students. She said her key priorities were to enhance teacher salaries and concentrate on K-3 student learning.
“It really does come down to being able to redirect money,” she said. “We are trying to put together a 1,000-piece puzzle.”
Democrat Sen. Pat Pettey, a Kansas City, Kansas, member of the task force, said Kansas ought to expand its commitment to preparing 3- and 4-year-old children for public school. She said 90% of brain development occurred before age 5, but Kansas assisted only 47% of families with pre-K programs.
Kansas provided support to at-risk preschoolers for a half-day program despite working parents’ need for a full day of care, said task force member Melissa Rooker, executive director of the Kansas Children’s Cabinet and Trust Fund.
“I would love to see us move from basically grant funding preschool offerings in Kansas to something more stable,” she said.
Rep. Nikki McDonald, an Olathe Democrat on the task force, said lawmakers should resist the temptation to micromanage school districts under the oversight of locally elected school boards and the elected state Board of Education.
The key measure of the state’s finance formula should be whether students sufficiently broadened their ability to process information, said Rep. Scott Hill, a task force member and Abilene Republican.
He said reading ability was a leading determinant of whether people were successful people were in life.
“Change for the sake of change is worse than no change,” he said. “Sometimes I think we want to not provide for the garden, but mow the weeds.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Gossage-and-Williams-task-force.png,,,2025-06-04 19:10:10.297051

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Nearly four months after Gov. Kelly Ayotte pitched a state budget to lawmakers with optimistic revenue projections and few cuts, the two-year spending proposal has seesawed dramatically.
The House, citing more dour economic predictions, pushed through $643 million in state spending cuts to Ayotte’s proposal, drawing her criticism. The Senate produced revenue projections that moved closer to Ayotte’s vision, but not all the way, further frustrating Ayotte.
On Thursday, the 24-member Senate will vote on its final proposal, setting up what will likely be a contentious stretch of negotiations with the House in the next two weeks before the budget bills, House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, must make their way to Ayotte’s desk. The Senate’s budget would spend $15.9 billion in state and federal funds over the next two years, compared to $15.5 billion in the House’s budget and $16 billion in Ayotte’s proposal.
The Senate’s budget proposal, finalized by the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, does not cut as deeply as the House’s proposal from April 10. But there are still reductions, and Senate Democrats are likely to oppose the final measure.
“Our job as legislators is to lower the cost of living for our constituents, improve access to health care and safe communities, strengthen kids’ and grandkids’ educational opportunities, create our thriving Main Street communities, and so unfortunately, this budget just doesn’t address those priorities,” said Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, the Senate minority leader and a Portsmouth Democrat, ahead of the Finance Committee vote Tuesday. 
Senate President Sharon Carson praised the final budget, stressing that it came amid a difficult economic reality for the state. 
“What I think a lot of people forget was, over the last two bienniums, we had a lot of money, and most of it was an infusion of cash from the federal government,” she said at the same committee meeting. “We spent that money, and we were very smart about how we spent that money, but it was gone.”
“… I look at this budget as a readjustment from having all that federal money to now we’re focused on what we have: How much money do we have? I think it keeps us on a path to prosperity.” 
Here’s what’s in the final package to be voted on by the full Senate Thursday. 
Senate partially restores funding to House cuts, makes reductions in other areas
In general, the Senate budget overturns many of the more drastic cuts made by the House in April, according to an analysis Wednesday by the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute. 
The Senate budget would restore a number of agencies and boards that were eliminated by the House — including the Office of the Child Advocate, the Housing Appeals Board, the Commission for Human Rights, and the State Commission on Aging — albeit with some modifications and staffing cuts for each entity. 
The Senate’s plan would also roll back the House’s deep cuts to the Department of Corrections. While the House had proposed 190 cuts to positions, the Senate winnowed that down to 60, with many of the proposed positions currently unfilled. 
The Senate’s proposal would increase the amount allotted to the settlement fund for the Youth Development Center lawsuits. The state is currently facing multiple lawsuits from people who allege they were abused by staff members at that center. The Senate budget would include $20 million in the first year and would plan for the state to raise $80 million by selling the Sununu Youth Services Center building in Manchester, all of which would be set aside to pay out any settlements.
But the Senate’s budget would make some deeper cuts compared to the House budget, such as a reduction in special education funding to public schools. The Senate budget would also impose $32 million in “back of the budget” cuts — undefined funding reductions that would require the Ayotte administration to find positions or programs to meet the cuts. 
Cuts to Medicaid providers reversed, but Medicaid premiums remain
In one of the biggest changes, the Senate reversed course on a controversial piece of the House’s budget: the 3% across-the-board rate cuts to Medicaid providers. The Senate bill includes $52.5 million in funding that the House had taken out and restores the funding.
The Senate budget also restores funding to developmental services and community mental health programs the House had cut. 
The Senate bill does keep in place Ayotte’s proposal to include premiums for beneficiaries of the Medicaid expansion program – known as the Granite Advantage Health Care Program. But where Ayotte proposed premiums determined by a percentage of recipients’ income, the Senate bill would make those premiums set amounts: $60 per month for a household of one increasing up to $100 for a household of four.
Democrats have objected to those premiums, calling them an “income tax.” And they have opposed the repeal of the Prescription Drug Affordability Board in the Senate’s budget. 
Housing advocates disappointed with funding levels
Affordable housing advocates and Democrats have raised objections to the lack of funding for affordable housing efforts in the final budget. 
In a press release Wednesday, Housing Action New Hampshire said the Senate’s budget “falls short in addressing our state’s housing shortage,” and noted that it did not include a proposal to double funding to the state’s Affordable Housing Fund and the Community Development Finance Authority Tax Credit. Democrats had proposed doubling both efforts from $5 million to $10 million a year. The Senate budget also adds no new funding to the Housing Champion Program, designed to give grants to towns that update their zoning codes to encourage development, though the Senate bills would extend the expiration date of the existing Housing Champion Program funds.
Senate Republicans argued deregulation, not funding, is most important to housing construction in the state. “I think we’re at a place where we recognize that the role of the state is to facilitate housing construction, maybe not to pay for it,” said Sen. Dan Innis, a Bradford Republican. 
And Sen. Tim Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, pointed to the $11.55 million allocation from the Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund toward local water infrastructure projections as an example of the state supporting housing development needs of communities.
 Renewable energy fund near depleted

The House’s budget had fully depleted the state’s Renewable Energy Fund, which is designed to provide grants to support clean energy projects in the state. The Senate’s budget would keep $2 million in the fund. Democrats raised concerns that that isn’t enough to make a meaningful difference. 
Higher education cuts reversed
The Senate’s budget rolls back a $50 million cut to the University System of New Hampshire included in the House budget. The final Senate budget would allocate $85 million per fiscal year to the university system, which is $67.5 million higher than the House’s numbers over two years, according to NHFPI. 
But Innis, a professor of marketing and hospitality management at the University of New Hampshire, said he wished that funding was higher, even as he praised the budget overall.
“We’re funding higher education in New Hampshire at half the rate we were 20 years ago. That’s embarrassing,” he said Tuesday. “It just is.”
Anti-diversity, equity, and inclusion language moves ahead
The Senate has preserved language added by the House that seeks to prevent any efforts at the state or local governmental levels to pursue “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies.
The language reads: “No public entity shall implement, promote, or otherwise engage in any DEI-related initiatives, programs, training, or policies. No state funds shall be expended for DEI-related activities, including but not limited to implicit bias training, DEI assessments, critical race theory, or race-based hiring, promotion, or contracting preferences.”
The move aligns with efforts by the Trump administration to withhold federal funding to public school districts that maintain such programs. 
Perkins Kwoka denounced the language, and predicted it would invite a lawsuit should it be passed in the budget. Last year, a federal court struck down a 2021 state law that prohibited advocacy on certain topics related to race and gender, after teachers unions sued arguing it was unconstitutionally vague; the state has appealed that ruling to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.
“It certainly harms our business environment to sort of be behind the curve on embracing an America that is truly inclusive,” Perkins Kwoka said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3911-Full-Senate-1024x736.jpg,,,2025-06-04 19:10:10.297051

Kevin Stitt said Wednesday he had apologized to a state senator after making disparaging remarks about him and his wife last week. 
Stitt also defended his choice for interim commissioner of the state mental health department, despite his lack of experience in mental health. 
Stitt drew the ire of lawmakers Thursday as they worked late into the night and into the early hours of Friday morning to overturn over 40 of his vetoes. 
He posted a video Thursday afternoon calling on voters to closely watch how lawmakers vote on veto overrides and said the bills he had vetoed were bad for Oklahoma. 
Later in the evening as lawmakers prepared a measure to fire mental health Commissioner Allie Friesen, the governor, who had appointed and ardently supported Friesen throughout the agency’s financial disarray, put out a statement that drew a senator’s wife into the mix.

Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, and Rep. Josh West, R-Grove, were the authors of the measure to fire Friesen. It said the Legislature had “lost confidence” in her ability to lead the state agency. 
Stitt called Friesen’s firing a “politically motivated witch hunt” and questioned if Rosino and West had something to gain by firing her. 
“Josh West and Paul Rosino need to first answer what they stand to gain from Allie Friesen being removed,” he said in his Thursday statement. “What are they trying to keep covered up? What conflicts of interest are they trying to hide? Is Senator Rosino trying to help his wife avoid responsibility for her role in the finance department there? Oklahomans deserve answers.”
Rosino, who chairs the Senate Health and Human Services Committee and co-chairs a select committee investigating the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ finances, said Thursday his wife works as a “low level, part-time” employee at the agency. 
Stitt’s statement, compounded with his video calling on Oklahomans to vote out lawmakers who voted to overturn his vetoes, led to dozens of lawmakers publicly calling Stitt out Thursday night.

House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said Friday morning the video Stitt had posted frustrated lawmakers and disrupted “good faith” negotiations between the Legislature and the Governor’s Office.
He also said it was “beneath the dignity of his office” to attack a senator’s wife. 
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said Friday he was disappointed by the governor’s comments. 
“You know, we all say things sometimes that we wish we could take back. But this wasn’t something that was said out of context,” Paxton said Friday. “It was something written down and approved that was put out. And in my nine years here, I’ve seen lots of things where there’s lots of criticism of members. I’ve never seen something like that on a member’s spouse.”
When discussing the measure to fire Friesen in the Senate, senators were unified in speaking against Stitt’s comments – all but one of the senators who rose to debate the measure spoke against the statement. The Senate voted 43-1 to fire Friesen and the House voted 81-5. 
But Wednesday afternoon, Stitt apologized and said “it was my fault” for letting emotions run high. 
“I do regret that. I called and apologized to him and his wife,” Stitt said. “I let the emotions get the better of me and I should not have done that. … I’m just trying to point out any kind of conflict. We have to make sure that, you know, if you’re in the pharmaceutical business, you shouldn’t be running pharmaceutical bills. If you’re in this industry, you shouldn’t be running this bill.”
Rosino could not be reached for comment, but a Senate spokesperson confirmed he and his wife had accepted Stitt’s apology. 
The Republican governor also defended Rear Admiral Gregory Slavonic as his choice to temporarily fill Friesen’s position as head of the mental health department. 
Slavonic has a long history working in government and previously ran the Oklahoma Department of Veteran Affairs, but has no experience in mental health. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“He’s not a mental health expert, he’s more of a business person,” Stitt said Wednesday. “He’s somebody that I think can do the job.”
The agency needed supplemental funding from the Legislature for this budget year and has been embroiled in investigations and audits following reports of financial disarray, including being unable to make payroll. 
Stitt took a victory lap as he celebrated successes from the legislative session. 
He said Oklahoma is now on the path to eliminating the income tax after the Legislature passed a .25% income tax cut, with further cuts when revenue reaches specified levels. 
Stitt also applauded legislation he said eliminated various fines, fees and court costs for people recently released from incarceration, a priority he mentioned during his State of the State address at the beginning of session. 
Expanding apprenticeship and internship programs in Oklahoma was another victory Stitt brought up Wednesday. 
“This was an amazing session,” he said. “I thought it was one of my best sessions we’ve ever had in seven years.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Despite an ongoing trade war and low profitability the past two years, pork industry leaders and producers at the World Pork Expo in Des Moines said Wednesday they are optimistic about the year. 
Lee Schulz, chief economist for Ever.Ag, said 2025 could be the “quickest turnaround in pork producer profitability ever” — but, he clarified, that statistic says more about “how bad the situation was” the past two years than it does about 2025. 
High input costs and decreased demand in 2023 caused what Schulz said was “the worst year in pork producer profitability to date.” That was followed by 2024, which Schulz called a “break-even year” which, while better than 2023, didn’t alleviate producers’ financial stress. 
Schulz’s modeling for 2025 profitability, based on USDA statistics, predict $15 per head profitability increases for producers and a return to break even, when accounting for 2020 and 2023 losses, by August. 
Schulz said despite continued challenges facing the industry such as increased input costs, labor, and processing and slaughtering costs, pork producers are more efficient each year. 
He said trends of increasing litter rates and carcass weight in the industry mean that even with a historically low-breeding herd in December, pork producers “are going to produce the most pork per breeding animal ever.” 
“The efficiency, the productivity of this industry, is tremendous, and that trend is continuing to increase over time — even through challenges like we’ve seen in 2020, and 2023,” Schulz said. 
Shulz also said the new sausage production facility slated to be built in Perry by JBS “speaks to the health of the industry.”
Not afraid of the tariffs
According to National Pork Producers Council,  the export market makes up more then 25% of U.S. pork production, and 55% of exported U.S. produced pork variety meats exports go to China.
In April, China posted reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods, which equated to a total tariff of 172% on U.S. pork entering the country. The two countries agreed to a 90-day reduction on the tariffs May 12, which resulted in a 57% tariff on U.S. pork imported to China, according to National Hog Farmer.
Joseph Kerns, a long term agricultural operations consultant now with AgRubicon, said pork producers should “be selfish” and take advantage of the current market volatility caused by tariffs and other factors. 
Small business owners urge Iowa’s congressional leaders to end the ‘chaotic’ tariffs

“You can either hyperventilate or you can do something,” Kerns said.
He advises producers to remove themselves from the risk profile by using futures and options contracts to lock in a price while it’s high. 
“It’s a marketing tool that every producer has at their avail and it is way cheaper than what it should be, in my opinion, and that’s to our advantage,” Kerns said. 
The World Pork Expo brought more than 10,000 pork-industry producers and professionals from around the world to the Iowa State Fairgrounds. 
Representatives from the Chinese livestock equipment company Kunlong International said around 40% of their clients are based in the U.S. and they usually add more to the profile at the expo. 
Lily Li of Kunlong International said the tariffs, as of yet, have not caused any changes in the company’s relationship with American customers. Li said the company hopes to “keep stable” from last year and maybe expand “a little” to other countries. 
Doug Gruver, an Iowa pork producer from the Sully area, said he did not feel any added pressure at the expo because of the tariffs, but said he felt more optimistic about the upcoming year than he has the past couple of years. 
“With the future prices the way they are, yes,” Gruver said. “But we’ll see what Q4 brings.” 
Kerns said the past couple of years the expo has seen evidence of hard times, adding that producers had seemed “depressed” with the situation. 
“This year, we’re going to make money, and you’re going to see more optimism,” he said of the 2025 expo.

(Tom Ross/Quentin Burdick Job Corps Center)Less than a week after receiving word that Job Corps centers across the country will pause operations by the end of June, students, faculty and administrative staff in Minot have already begun packing up for the inevitable move off campus.
On May 29, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the Quentin Burdick Job Corps Center in Minot, along with nearly 100 other contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide, will pause operations by June 30 because of operational deficits, low graduation rates and a high number of incident reports involving students.
“I was just saying goodbye to a gentleman today who was offered a job as a welder and before he came to Job Corps, probably 15-16 months ago, he had no idea what welding was,” Tom Ross, workforce development officer for the Burdick Job Corps Center, said Wednesday.
The Job Corps program has about 25,000 enrolled students nationwide between ages 16-24, many from low-income families. Ross said the Burdick Job Corps Center graduates 25 to 40 students every year and employs outreach staff who serve Fargo, Bismarck and Grand Forks.
Students take courses to get their GEDs and learn skills and certifications in the electrical, plumbing and construction trades, among others.
Ross said two other students recently went through the welding program and are living in Mississippi, welding ships for the U.S. Navy.
“For all of the bad news that’s out there, I can match it with a good news story of students who are just rocking it,” he said. “What I have seen every day since I’ve been here is a group of professionals that are focused on the success of students.”
It does not make sense to beat the “we need workforce” drum over and over again, and then close one of the leading workforce development sites in North Dakota, Ross said.
“To me, those two pieces of the puzzle will never fit together,” he said. 
Senators object to Trump push to ax Education Department programs for low-income students

In a statement from Sen. John Hoeven’s office, the Republican said he has always supported the mission of the Job Corps program and the Burdick Job Corps Center, but recent statistics have shown performance levels are not where Americans expect them to be. He added more data is needed to determine what reforms and changes are necessary.
North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer also raised concerns about the program costs.
“While I’m a big fan of Job Corps centers, the average cost per student each year is over $80,000 while only graduating 38%,” Cramer said in a text message. “We can’t ignore the broader fiscal reality and the need to set priorities. We have a $37 trillion debt and it’s headed for $50 trillion.”
The Job Corps program operated at a $140 million deficit in 2024 and the deficit was expected to increase to $213 million in 2025, according to Labor Department data. 
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education, training, and community,” said U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, in a statement. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve.”
Examples of incidents are drug use, violence, or an accident requiring a trip to the hospital. 
Trump-backed giant tax and spending bill bloats deficit by $2.4T, nonpartisan CBO says

Chavez-DeRemer said the department will be evaluating the long-term possibilities of the program and is committed to assisting students as they transition back into their communities.
The National Job Corps Association, a professional trade association comprised of business, labor, volunteer, advocacy, academic and community organizations, filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking a temporary restraining order against the Department of Labor in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to prevent the nationwide closures.
“Closing Job Corps campuses would not only jeopardize the lives and futures of tens of thousands of students currently in training, but it would also eliminate a workforce pipeline that many industries depend on, needlessly weakening our labor market and economy,” said Marty Walsh, former labor secretary under President Joe Biden, in a statement from the association.
Addie Nelson worked as an administrative assistant at the Burdick Job Corps Center for nearly 30 years. She said the program has always helped students find their futures and she worries there won’t be another place like the Job Corps program to help them along their career paths.
“It’s so rewarding to see them succeed when they didn’t think they were anybody,” Nelson said. “When they come and they think they are not worth anything and they start achieving these small little goals that they’ve set themselves. … They see results and I think that’s what hurts me the most is that I’ve seen so many kids come and see what a world of difference Burdick (Job Corps Center) did for them. It just gave them hope.”
She added that she had planned to retire in August to enjoy some early-morning cups of coffee on her front porch, but the pausing of the program sped up her timetable.
Ross said there are about 20 Job Corps centers across the country run by the Department of Labor that are not closing.
He said he’s hopeful the pause announced by the department will only be a pause and the skills-training program will restart in some form in the future.
“The Job Corps program is not a perfect program, but … show me a federal program that is perfect,” he said.

The […]","Residents at Clearence and Labadie Avenues assess the damage to their home after the May 16 tornado rolled through the Ville neighborhood of north St. Louis. (Wiley Price/ St. Louis American)When a tornado struck Joplin on May 22, 2011, killing 161 people and causing about $2 billion in damage, President Barack Obama issued a major disaster declaration the next day.
That action immediately made help available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, for people to pay for temporary housing and begin repairs. The declaration also made state and local governments, as well as some not-for-profit aid agencies, eligible for reimbursement of 75% of the cost of recovery and rebuilding.
By the time the books were closed, FEMA had distributed $37.1 million to individuals for recovery needs and provided $161.6 million for public recovery and rebuilding costs.
In St. Louis, a May 16 tornado cut a 22-mile path across the region, damaging or destroying 16,000 structures and killing five people. Damage is estimated at $1.6 billion, making it the biggest weather disaster for Missouri since the Joplin tornado.
Gov. Mike Kehoe made a formal request on May 26 for President Donald Trump to extend similar help. Nine days later, that request is still pending as Trump waits for the results of a formal assessment of damages.
It is part of a pattern in Trump’s second term of longer waits and, oftentimes, denials of state requests for disaster declarations. 
Kehoe on April 2 requested a declaration for help following severe storms and flooding in southeast Missouri. Trump issued the declaration May 21, 49 days later. A May 1 request, for storms and flooding from March 30 to April 8, was also approved May 21.
Another disaster declaration request from Missouri, submitted May 19, is also awaiting action by the president.
Both of the approved requests took longer than all but six of the 20 federal disaster requests submitted by Missouri governors from the start of 2010 through the end of 2024. The average wait during that period, from a governor’s request to a presidential declaration, was 16 days.
St. Louis area state lawmakers, called to Jefferson City for a special session, said the delay is adding to the hardship thousands face, with some people camping outside destroyed homes because they have no money for shelter.
“Some people are staying in homes that are completely unsafe to stay in after the storm has wiped out their entire neighborhood,” state Sen. Brian Williams, a Democrat from University City, said in an interview with The Independent. “It’s saddening, it’s disheartening, and I’m not interested in any conversation outside of ensuring that storm victims are taken care of.”
A federal disaster declaration can make help available for individuals and public needs, or it can be limited to assisting with public recovery costs. 
Nationally, over the last four years, FEMA has provided more than $12 billion to individuals and $133 billion to state and local governments, tribal nations, territories and some nonprofits to help in recovery efforts, Stateline reported in February.
When individual assistance is provided, victims can receive up to $770 for immediate emergency needs, plus up to $43,600 to assist with home repair costs and $43,600 for other recovery costs.
A federal disaster declaration also provides emergency SNAP and unemployment benefits.
The main purpose of the special session is to consider legislation offering tax incentives for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals to remain in Missouri. 
The bill providing stadium aid also includes a tax credit of up to $5,000 for payments against an insurance deductible in a disaster area. A spending bill requested by Kehoe includes $25 million, to be spent by the Missouri Housing Development Commission to assist in repairs.
But with 37 Missouri counties covered by disaster requests submitted this year, lawmakers from both St. Louis and rural areas say the money is inadequate.
State Sen. Jason Bean, a Republican from Holcomb, said the $25 million is “a drop in the bucket” for disaster needs. Bean represents 10 southeast Missouri counties that include the three with the highest poverty rates in the state.
Eight of the 10 counties in Bean’s district were included in Trump’s disaster declaration for storms and flooding on March 14 and 15. All 10 were included in the disaster declaration for the March 31 to April 8 storms and flooding.
The delay in receiving help is frustrating, Bean said during a hearing on the spending bill.
“We need to realize that people have been living in shelters,” Bean said. “They’ve been living in other homes for some time. So once again, the speed of our response, I think, is something we’ve just got to address.”
Massive, obvious disasters like Joplin no longer get quick responses from FEMA. Since taking office, Trump has tried to push more costs to state and local agencies, even suggesting that FEMA be abolished. 
Now, every disaster must go through the formal assessment process to determine if it meets the standards for federal assistance. 
FEMA uses cost per capita to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves, or if they’ll need federal help. Those thresholds currently stand at $4.72 per capita for counties and $1.89 per capita for states.
But just meeting those thresholds isn’t enough. Trump can accept or deny applications at his discretion.
“After a thorough assessment, FEMA will approve a disaster declaration request if the assessment shows the event’s damage exceeds the state, local governments, and voluntary organizations’ capacity to respond,” a FEMA spokesperson wrote in an email to The Independent. “Just like all declaration requests, this decision is based on policy, not politics.”
During testimony on the special session legislation, Casey Milburg, policy director for St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer, said Kehoe and the state’s congressional delegation have all been pushing for action on the disaster request.
“There’s certainly a tremendous amount of uncertainty in our minds,” she said. “We are certainly hopeful.”
The congressional delegation push began the day after Kehoe requested aid for tornado response.
“Missourians are still recovering from the recent tornado, and our communities are in desperate need of federal assistance,” U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, a Republican from St. Louis County, said in a news release May 27, the day after Kehoe made his request.
Wagner, five of Missouri’s eight U.S. House members and both U.S. Senators signed a letter to Trump on May 27 urging swift action.
“These resources are essential to stabilizing affected communities and safeguarding public health and safety,” the letter stated. “Given the scale of devastation and the urgent need for federal assistance, we respectfully request swift approval of Missouri’s disaster declaration. We appreciate your attention to this matter and stand ready to support efforts to ensure resources reach those who need them most.” 
During a hearing on the special session legislation, state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Democrat from Kansas City, asked budget director Dan Haug whether FEMA would approve the request to help St. Louis.
“Have we received notice that FEMA is going to help?” she said. “Because there are other states that have been denied assistance from FEMA, and so have we received any guarantee that we’re actually going to receive funding from FEMA to help?”
Haug said no assurances have been received.
“I think the governor’s office, in communication with our federal officials, feel confident in the result,” Haug said.
Williams, however, said the state shouldn’t count on it.
“I am not optimistic,” he said, “that FEMA is going to step in and do anything.”

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)The Judiciary Committee pushed off deciding on whether to ban local law enforcement agreements with federal immigration authorities until next year. But the majority of its members voted against a conflicting proposal that would make it illegal to restrict compliance with immigration enforcement.
These decisions were made on Wednesday as members ran back and forth between the committee room and their respective chambers amid a busy session day. 
The committee decided to carry over into next year LD 1259, which would explicitly prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities. 
On the other hand, a motion to pass LD 1656, which would prevent local agencies from adopting any policies that restrict them from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration law, failed 4-8, with two members absent. This bill is sponsored by Rep. Michael Soboleski of Phillips and co-sponsored by nine other Republicans.
However, the committee has yet to decide on LD 1971, which would place restrictions on enforcement activities absent formal agreements with federal authorities. 
The committee did discuss an amendment to clarify what would and would not be permitted under the bill as a means to address pushback from police groups. Auburn Police Chief Jason Moen, who is president of the Maine Chiefs of Police Association, raised concerns about the bill hindering federal task forces that are not primarily for immigration enforcement but sometimes touch on some immigration issues, such as drug enforcement partnerships. 
Moen said the proposed changes assuage those concerns “to some extent.” Another work session on LD 1971 is scheduled for Monday.
Immigration enforcement hearing highlights lack of protocol for local, federal collaboration

Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor), who sponsored LD 1259, requested that the bill be carried over to next year, telling her colleagues Wednesday that she believes it is necessary but would benefit from more time to allow for greater community engagement and to study its implications before lawmakers vote. 
Participation in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program has grown across the country after President Donald Trump revived it to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, an authority otherwise generally reserved to federal authorities. The program was discontinued in 2012 due to the discovery of discriminatory practices such as racial profiling.
Wells Police Department is the only Maine agency that has opted to join. However, Wells paused its agreement to see if the Legislature votes to ban such contracts. 
“Some law enforcement officials expressed concerns about the bill’s unintended impacts, which I take seriously,” Rana told Maine Morning Star after the vote. 
Noting that six states have laws or policies that prohibit participation, Rana said, “Additional time in our legislative process allows us to study the impacts in those states while individual communities continue to advocate for municipalities that stand for the safety of all residents.” 
Wells residents have been voicing both support and opposition to their local police force contracting with ICE at Select Board meetings. Those calling for the police force to terminate the contract have collected more than 350 signatures. 
Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities, also initially submitted an application to join the program but withdrew it after community pushback, with their Police Chief Paul Ferland citing the division it caused in the community as the main reason. 
“Carrying the bill over keeps it alive while we continue to build support across the state,” Rana said.

The patient came to the state to visit family on May 26 and 27, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release issued Wednesday. During the visit, the individual visited other unvaccinated people, was out in the community and may have infected others. 
“While the risk to the general population continues to be low, we want to make the public aware of the increased risk of measles in this region and the increasing number of cases in surrounding states,” the department said.

The potential exposure comes amid measles outbreaks in states across the U.S.
This year the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 1,088 measles cases nationwide in 33 states. About 96% of them were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. There were 11 cases in Colorado and 81 in New Mexico, according to an NBC News tracker. As of Wednesday, there aren’t any confirmed cases in Utah.
Measles outbreak hasn’t hit Utah yet, but health officials are bracing for when it does

About 88.8% of Utah kindergarteners were reported to be vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella in the 2023-2024 school year, lagging behind the national average of 92.7%. 
While there was a small bump in the state’s immunization registry for a couple of weeks, there’s still been a drop in the percentage of Utah children that received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine at 24 months old — from 94.5% of those born in 2019 to 89.8% of children born in 2021, according to state data.
That’s on pace with regional MMR vaccination rate trends, including in Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, Rich Lakin, immunization program manager at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, told Utah News Dispatch last week. The percentage in those states have decreased from 98.3% for children born in 2019 to 86.4% for those born in 2021. 
The country has seen a pattern of declining immunization rates as skepticism around science and public health was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.
After the death of two children in Texas, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who has expressed skepticism regarding vaccine safety and efficacy — endorsed the MMR vaccine, saying it is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the disease. However, he has also promoted unproven remedies for preventing and treating measles, sowing confusion.
Experts and research widely accept that the vaccine is safe and saves lives.



Let us know what you think...


 


While it has been difficult to encourage people to vaccinate their children, Lankin said health officials will continue to try to ensure Utahns get accurate information. 
“That’s what our continued message is — that vaccinations have been one of the greatest public health achievements we have seen, and we want to continue to keep people safe through vaccinations,” Lakin said last week.
The state still has limited details on who was exposed, but it is working on providing information and protection to those it can identify, according to the Wednesday release. 
In the meantime, the department advised anyone with measles-like symptoms to remain at home and away from others for at least four days after the start of the rash to avoid further spread. 
Those with symptoms — which include high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes, in addition to the characteristic rash — should contact medical facilities before visiting to confirm whether they can protect other patients from infections.

(Courtesy of Maine Paid Family Leave campaign)Following the Senate earlier this week, the House on Wednesday passed LD 894, which proposes a series of amendments to the state’s paid family and medical leave program to create certain enforcement mechanisms and penalties, as well as clarify intermittent leave. 
But the vote was not without significant debate. 
Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) introduced the bill on behalf of the Labor Department to make specific refinements to the policy that were noticed during the rulemaking process. 
However, during the House floor debate, Rep. Michael Soboleski (R-Phillips) called it “legislation that threatens the very foundation of Maine’s economic landscape.”
But underscoring the human rather than economic impacts, Rep. Valli Geiger (D-Rockland) said, “We are not just a series of businesses. We are not just a series of workers.”
She went on to say that “we thrive when there is a blend of work and life, and all of us age, all of us fall into illness, many of us have children, and when we do, it is part of our culture and a decent society to give us time to recover, to allow us to take care of our elderly, our frail, our beloved ones.” 
Though it isn’t expected to be available until May 2026, the paid family and medical leave program will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one or the birth of a new child. 
Others supportive of the overall program argued that LD 894 does not do enough to ensure it will be effective. “While LD 894 focuses on infrastructure, it leaves behind the operational reforms that matter most to the people on the ground,” said Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick). 
Rep. Nathan Carlow (R-Buxton) attempted two floor amendments to the bill, which both failed. 
One amendment sought to require an employee to be employed with an employer for a minimum of 120 days before being eligible for paid leave. Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) said the Department of Labor is opposed to any change that would delay the implementation of the program. Rep. Charles Skold (D-Portland) argued the amendment would prevent people from taking leave when they need it. A motion to indefinitely postpone the amendment narrowly prevailed, 72-70.  
Carlow then presented another floor amendment that would allow workers and businesses who have contributed to the state fund but choose to adopt a qualifying private plan before the start of 2026 to be eligible for a refund from the Department of Labor. A motion to indefinitely postpone also narrowly prevailed 71-70.  
The Senate had its own, albeit smaller, debate on paid family and medical leave Wednesday. Despite urging from Sen. Dick Bradstreet (R-Kennebec) to back LD 1712, which hopes to strike a better balance between employee and employer interests by modifying how much an employer is required to contribute, when an employee needs to apply for the benefit and how much is paid out. 
He described it as “a reasonable compromise and a responsible compromise,” the upper chamber voted against it 20-14. The House rejected the bill earlier this week, so it is now effectively killed.
That bill joined a series of other proposals to modify or repeal the program that were also rejected earlier this week, including LD 406, LD 1273, LD 1333, LD 952 and LD 1307.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Under settlement agreements reached earlier this year and announced by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez on Wednesday, two insulin manufacturers have committed to make the diabetes treatment cheaper for New Mexicans.
“These are huge wins for New Mexicans who have struggled with the outrageous cost of insulin,” Torrez said in a statement. “These agreements will help people stop rationing medication, avoid financial hardship, and focus on staying healthy. We are holding drug manufacturers accountable and making access to life-saving treatment more equitable.” 
New Mexico Department of Justice spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez told Source NM that the agreements provide insured patients who might have a high deductible or copay the option to pay cash instead of using their insurance, and to pay no more than $35 for a monthly supply of insulin, Rodriguez said.
The New Mexico state law enacted in 2020 that caps insulin costs at $25 remains in full force and is not preempted or replaced by the new settlements, Rodriguez said.
Instead, the agreements are “additive protections mainly aimed at helping cash-paying and uninsured patients, while deferring to state law when it offers better pricing,” she said.
As many as 207,600 adults in New Mexico, or approximately 11% of the state’s adult population, have diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.
Without the caps, patients in other states could pay $150 per month or more, especially if they require multiple variations of the drug, Stateline reports.
More states are doing what they can to cap insulin costs

High out-of-pocket costs have historically forced many patients to choose between buying insulin and meeting other basic needs, NMDOJ said in a news release. The settlements result from the agency’s independent investigations into insulin pricing practices, NMDOJ said.
The state’s agreement with Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, signed on April 18, requires the company to maintain its Insulins ValYou Savings Program, which allows patients who pay out-of-pocket to receive a month’s supply for $35.
The Sanofi settlement also requires it to maintain its Patient Connection Program, which allows uninsured patients who aren’t eligible for Medicaid and whose annual household income is at or below 400% of the federal poverty line to receive insulin for free.
Under the settlement, Sanofi must also provide patients live phone and translation support in Spanish, Hmong, Somali and Mandarin Chinese; and participating pharmacies will receive training to help patients enroll in affordability programs.
The settlement with Novo Nordisk Inc., signed on May 19, requires the company to maintain its MyInsulinRX Program, which offers diabetes patients the option to pay $35 or less for a monthly prescription. Under the agreement, Novo Nordisk must also continue its Patient Assistance Program, which offers insulin for free.
The settlement also requires Novo Nordisk to notify pharmacies about available discounts at the point of sale, help patients enroll on the spot and offer live phone and website chat support in Spanish.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders discusses an outdoor education pilot program during a press conference on June 4, 2025 in Little Rock. (Screenshot from livestream)The governor announced on Wednesday the creation of a new outdoor education pilot program that will accept up to 30 Arkansas school districts that apply to participate.
A partnership between the Arkansas Department of Education and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, the program will help equip students for a career in outdoor recreation, according to a press release from the governor’s office. 
During Wednesday’s announcement at AGFC’s Witt Stephens Jr. Central Arkansas Nature Center in Little Rock, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said if the pilot is successful, the program could be expanded to schools across the state and provide a model for the entire country. Getting kids outdoors will help improve their education, health and quality of life, Sanders said.
“Starting today, districts across our state can apply to be one of 30 schools to offer outdoor education built around the standards taught in core and elective content areas, experiences in outdoor learning engagement and projects that empower students to think critically and solve problems about the world around them,” she said. 
Doug Schoenrock, who was named AGFC’s 20th director in April, said the “truly unique” pilot program will bring the outdoors into the classroom and vice versa.
“And most importantly, this program will bring outdoors to the hearts and minds of our students, and build a connection with the Natural State, which we as Arkansans hold so dear,” Schoenrock said. 
The new initiative combines several of the governor’s priorities, including education, workforce development and outdoor recreation. The pilot program responds to a recommendation made by the Natural State Initiative Advisory Council in its 2023 report to expand outdoor recreation programs to schools. 
Sanders launched the Natural State Initiative in an effort to expand Arkansas’ outdoor economy, and its advisory council is chaired by her husband, Bryan. 
Tourism is the state’s second largest industry behind agriculture. In the most recent year for which data is available, Arkansas welcomed more than 50 million visitors who spent nearly $10 billion, much of which went to outdoor recreation, according to the press release. 
Applications for the outdoor education pilot program are available on AGFC’s website.

Free.,"U.S. House Democrats grill Education Secretary McMahon on proposed cuts, anti-diversity measures",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-democrats-grill-education-secretary-mcmahon-proposed-cuts-anti-diversity-measures,,"WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Linda McMahon took heat from Democrats on the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce on Wednesday over the Trump administration’s initiatives to dramatically overhaul the federal role in education and eliminate the Education Department.Lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request — which includes $12 billion in spending cuts — as well as efforts to dismantle the agency and threats to yank funds for schools that use race-conscious practices across aspects of student life.A department summary said the cut “reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down.”Chair Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican, praised McMahon’s efforts.“We believe in reducing bureaucracy, trusting our educators, trusting our state and local leaders and trusting the innovators who are pushing against the barriers thrown up by the bureaucracy,” he said. “And above all, we trust our parents — this is our vision, and thankfully, we finally have an administration in place that shares this vision.”But Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the panel, blasted the department’s priorities, including the budget proposal, which he said “would make it more difficult for students to enroll in and afford a college education by proposing reductions in funding to need-based grants such as Pell and work study.”“At the end of the day, it is the students of this nation who will suffer under this budget proposal,” the Virginia Democrat said. “Students from low-income families and students with disabilities, English learners, international students and students of color will face more hurdles accessing equal educational opportunity.”The budget calls for eliminating key programs administered by the Education Department for disadvantaged and low-income students, including Federal TRIO Programs and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, or GEAR UP.The budget request also proposes a $60 million increase to expand the number of charter schools in the country and lowering nearly $1,700 from the maximum amount a student can receive annually through the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college.A federal judge in Massachusetts in May dealt the administration a major setback to its education agenda, ordering the agency to reinstate the more than 1,300 employees gutted during a reduction in force effort, blocking the department from carrying out Trump’s order to close the department and barring the department from transferring the student loan portfolio and special education services to other federal agencies while the case challenging those policies is ongoing.A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld the trial judge’s order. DEI lesson plansDemocrats on Wednesday took aim at the administration’s efforts against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs. The administration had sought to bar schools from using DEI practices across aspects of student life to continue to receive federal funding, an effort that multiple federal judges have blocked.Rep. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania said the Trump administration “has undoubtedly revived the culture of racism we haven’t seen since the Jim Crow era,” adding that “they’ve made it clear that open attacks on Black and brown and other marginalized communities is not just tolerated, but it’s encouraged.”Asked by Lee whether a lesson plan on the Tulsa race massacre would be considered “illegal DEI,” McMahon replied: “I’d have to get back to you on that.”Lee then asked McMahon whether she knew what the Tulsa race massacre was, to which the secretary said: “I’d like to look into it more and get back to you on it.”McMahon was similarly noncommittal on a question about assigning school desegregation icon Ruby Bridges’ autobiography.State flexibilityThe budget proposal also calls for consolidating 18 grant programs for K-12 education and replacing them with a single formula grant program, which the administration says will give states spending flexibility.Democrats at Wednesday’s hearing blasted the administration’s push to return education “back to the states,” noting that some states have poor records on education.Rep. Yassamin Ansari said the education system is “absolutely failing” many students in the United States. The main cause of that, the Arizona Democrat said, was that many states have “woefully underfunded” their public education systems and not, as the administration has claimed, due to “too much” federal oversight or DEI policies.When asked by Ansari what risk McMahon weighed for public schools and universities if federal education funding is gutted or devolved to the states, the secretary said “federal education wouldn’t necessarily be gutted” and that “there would be more money to go to the states without the bureaucracy of the Department of Education.”Ansari rejected that claim, noting that some states, including hers, have an “abysmal track record of managing education.” She pointed to Arizona’s low rankings on public education, teacher salaries, test scores and the highest student-to-teacher ratio in the country.",,,,2025-06-04 18:11:20.722946

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)LEAVENWORTH — A Kansas district court barred CoreCivic Wednesday from reopening its shuttered prison until the company goes through Leavenworth’s development process to receive a special use permit. 
Judge John Bryant, Leavenworth County District Court, was unconvinced by arguments from CoreCivic attorneys that the company was grandfathered into the city’s zoning codes and did not need a special use permit to hold U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees. 
He ruled in favor of the city of Leavenworth, which had asked for a temporary restraining order to stop the reopening of CoreCivic’s prison, the Midwest Regional Reception Center. 
After nearly two hours of arguments in front of a courtroom packed with Leavenworth city officials and community activists, Bryant made an immediate ruling. He said his decision was not affected by CoreCivic’s history in the community, which has been openly criticized by former employees, inmates and residents, and in submitted court documents. 
The request for a restraining order was a procedural issue, he said. 
“The posture of this case is a little bit different in that the city has acted here because CoreCivic has stated its intent to ignore or not give any effect to the March ‘25 administrative decision,” Bryant said, referring to the city’s requirement that CoreCivic get a special use permit before reopening. 
Bryant said that if CoreCivic disagreed, company attorneys could have gone through the Kansas judicial review process to argue zoning decisions. Such a move needed to be made within 30 days, he said, and CoreCivic did not take that action. 
 
What’s next?
“We are reviewing the court’s decision and considering next steps,” said CoreCivic spokesman Steve Owen in response to emailed questions. “We maintain the position that our facility, which we’ve operated for almost 30 years, does not require a special use permit to care for detainees in partnership with ICE. We look forward to presenting our arguments to the court.”
He did not answer questions about whether the company is housing any ICE detainees in Leavenworth or what is happening at the facility, which had a parking lot full of cars on Wednesday.
Leavenworth city manager Scott Peterson was pleased with the court’s decision. Although CoreCivic could continue litigation on the issue, he said the company was welcome o go through the city’s planning and zoning process to get a special use permit. 
Joseph Hatley, attorney for Leavenworth, said the next step today would be writing the temporary restraining order and then circulating it to all parties. 
“If we have a disagreement about it, the judge can resolve the disagreement, but essentially it will say they cannot house detainees without a special use permit,” he said. 
 
Three months
The typical special use permit process in Leavenworth takes about three months, Peterson said, in part to allow time to set up public hearings to allow Leavenworth area residents to have input. 
In its motion to the court asking for the temporary restraining order, the city’s attorneys laid out significant issues they had when CoreCivic previously operated a prison in Leavenworth. The national private prison company operated the Leavenworth Detention Center from 1986 to 2021, when CoreCivic’s federal contract was not renewed. 
The city opened its petition with quotes from a 2021 court transcript. U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson called CoreCivic’s Leavenworth prison a “hell hole.” 
“All that’s going on there and causing trauma to everybody – guards are being traumatized. Guards have been almost killed. Detainees are being traumatized with assaults and batteries, and not long ago a detainee was killed. So I’m well aware of the situation at CoreCivic and very troubled by it as well,” Robinson said at the time.

In the petition, the city also noted the Leavenworth Police Department had issues with CoreCivic in the final years before the prison closed, citing roadblocks when investigating violent crimes within the facility, lack of planning for major crises such as riots or hostage situations and difficulty getting access. 
The city’s special use permitting process would allow the city to set guidelines that would address those situations, Peterson said.
“Cities generally have broad abilities to impose additional requirements on a special use permit, so long as they are applicable to the use that we’re discussing,” he said. “Obviously, property owners are protected in some regards in that we can’t make outlandish requirements.”
If CoreCivic would disagree with city requirements, Peterson added, they could then access the judicial review process to argue those points. 
CoreCivic had initially applied for a special use permit in March but withdrew that application. Peterson said the process had begun and CoreCivic and city officials were meeting. 
“I would note that with internal conversations the city was having with CoreCivic, we were in agreement with the things the city was going to propose in terms of protecting the city services moving forward,” he said. 
In the hearing, CoreCivic attorney Taylor Hausmann said the company withdrew from those proceedings because the city did not schedule a hearing within a 60-day period, as required. 
“It became clear to CoreCivic that there was not a cooperative relationship happening there, and thus CoreCivic fell back on its position that it was not required to have it (the special use permit), and that this was not going to work, to move together cooperatively.”
City officials are adamant that the city is not stalling the prison’s reopening.
“From the perspective of the city, this was never about stopping something from happening,” said David Waters, an attorney for the city. “This is about following the city’s rules and regulations and going through those processes, giving everybody the same fair hearing that we afford all special use permits.”
 
Community concerns
Esmie Tseng, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, attended the hearing. She was pleased the judge heard the city’s concerns but is worried about what will happen in the future. 
“I think that’s the core of the case,” she said. “There is a lot of distrust. And CoreCivic definitely hammered very hard on past conduct should not be an indicator of future conduct, but I don’t think we have to rely on past conduct. 
We have cases across the country of CoreCivic’s current conduct that sort of speak to concerns about local distress, about their business practices, about shortcuts,” Tseng said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/city-officials-attorneys-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-06-04 18:11:20.722946

Josh Shapiro announced his administration has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) over its cancellation of millions of dollars in federal funding to farmers who supply food banks throughout the state. (Commonwealth Media Services)PHILADELPHIA — Gov. Josh Shapiro announced his administration has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) over its cancellation of millions of dollars in federal funding to farmers who supply food banks throughout the state.
“I’m tired of waiting for someone to stand up for our farmers and our food banks. That task falls to us,” Shapiro said Wednesday in Philadelphia. “The USDA and the Trump administration ignored our farmers, and they ignored folks who are hungry here in Pennsylvania.”
Shapiro said his administration filed a lawsuit Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Harrisburg asking a judge to reverse the USDA’s decision to cancel its contract with the commonwealth.
The program, known as the Local Food Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA), was established by President Joe Biden’s administration in response to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic in 2021. In December, Biden’s administration renewed the contract with Pennsylvania for three years and $13 million. In March, the Trump administration announced that the program was ending.
“This lawsuit calls on the USDA to simply honor its commitment to our farmers, to honor its commitment to folks who are hungry and to simply follow the contract that they signed,” Shapiro said
In Pennsylvania, LFPA provides funding that supports 189 farms and 14 food banks. Shapiro said it represented between 10% and 15% of the annual market share for many of the farmers participating in the program.
The back-and-forth between Shapiro and the Trump administration over the matter has spanned multiple months. In March, Shapiro held a press conference at a food bank in Harrisburg sounding an alarm on the program’s cancellation. He said his administration appealed to get the money and wrote a letter to Trump’s administration in late March.
In April, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins made a trip to multiple central Pennsylvania farms where she claimed the money for food banks was, in fact, available. She said Shapiro and other officials either didn’t “have their facts right,” or were playing political “games.”
Shapiro disputed the claim at the time and re-upped his criticism of Rollins’ explanation Wednesday in Philadelphia.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The LFPA initiative works as a reimbursement program, Shapiro said, so the state doesn’t get the money until after it pays farmers and provides receipts.
A USDA spokesperson told the Capital-Star that they “do not comment on pending litigation,” and directed inquiries to the U.S. Department of Justice.
George Maysik, executive director of Share Food Program in Philadelphia, said the food bank serves more than 500,000 people per month in the greater Philadelphia area and demand has risen over 120% in the last three years.
“The LFPA program was designed to provide some level of relief for the 14 food banks like us across the commonwealth who are serving that rising need,” Maysik said.
He addressed Trump directly, criticizing his administration’s decision to cancel the program.
“You had a deal with food banks serving 67 counties trying to alleviate poverty,” Maysik said. “And above all, Mr. President, you had a deal with the American people and you broke your word.”
“The art of the deal,” he scoffed.
Julie McCabe, executive director of Pennypack Farm & Education Center, explained her 13 acre vegetable farm in Montgomery County participated in the LFPA program to provide products to local food banks.
“Our produce giving program has grown tremendously,” McCabe said. “From just over 8,000 pounds donated in 2017 to more than 26,000 pounds given in 2024.”
While Shapiro said his administration has increased investments to connect farmers with hungry people, he said the state doesn’t have the money to backfill the federal cuts, if the lawsuit is unsuccessful. 
Still, Shapiro said he has reasons to be optimistic that he would succeed.
“I’ve got a pretty good track record when I take Donald Trump to court,” said Shapiro, who served as the state’s attorney general during Trump’s first term. “We’re going to win this, and we’re going to get our money back for the good people of Pennsylvania.”

(Human World for Animals)A taxidermied giraffe head, cut from its body at the shoulders, was found on sale for $6,000 in a Luzerne County store. It is just one of hundreds of endangered animal parts being sold across the state uncovered through an investigation by a global nonprofit animal rights organization.  
State Rep. Leanne Krueger (D-Delaware) says Pennsylvania has a responsibility to fight illicit sales that fuel poaching of at-risk animals abroad. Her legislation, House Bill 994, would ban the sale of covered endangered animal parts within the state. 
“Iconic species of animals continue to face the threat of extinction due to the demand for their parts,” Krueger wrote in a memo seeking support for the bill. “While many of these species reside in countries or oceans thousands of miles away, we have a duty to ensure that the residents of our great Commonwealth are not supporting the poaching and trafficking that threaten these at-risk species of animals.”
Lawmakers gathered with Humane World for Animals representatives Wednesday to rally support for the legislation. 
Gabe Witgil, wildlife trafficking program director at Humane World for Animals, said states must close legal loopholes that allow illicit animal parts markets to thrive.
“Iconic species across the planet continue to face the threat of extinction due to demand for their body parts,” he said. “Each year, 10,000 to 15,000 elephants are killed in Africa to supply the global demand for their ivory.”
The group’s investigation team visited 31 Pennsylvania antique and vintage stores over a three week period in March and searched 31 online auctions between January and April, uncovering 383 pieces of ivory with a total retail value of $38,000. Bracelets, necklaces, figurines and even silverware were among the found ivory products taken from elephants, hippos, warthogs, walruses, mammoths and whales. 
“What we found was a gruesome amount of evidence that accelerates the call to action,” said Whitney Teamus, the organization’s senior director of investigations. “The number of ivory items identified exceeds what we’ve seen in our previous investigations over the last several years, including in Connecticut and Florida.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Of the stores and auctions investigated, 59% had endangered wildlife products for sale. 
A key problem, the investigators said, was a lack of documentation for many ivory products being sold, which makes it difficult to determine if the parts were illegally imported. Many ivory items were found to be mislabeled as bone or mammoth ivory, which is currently legal to sell. 
“The labeling of ivory was also disturbingly unreliable, with some vendors uncertain of the material they were selling, while others appeared to be intentionally mislabeling items,” Teamus said. “This is a misleading sales tactic we and others have witnessed in other investigations to obscure the trade of these items.”
Teamus told the Capital-Star that the number of endangered animal parts they found is likely miniscule compared to the total amount being sold in the state. 
“There’s tons more out there. Ivory is in your backyard, for sure,” she said. “You think elephants are thousands of miles away. You don’t think of them as being in your backyard.” 
What would H.B. 994 do if passed?  
The legislation would make the sale of ivory and other endangered animal parts illegal while expanding the list of protected animals that aren’t covered under the federal Endangered Species Act, such as giraffes. 
While federal law prohibits the importation of endangered species parts and the sale of these parts between states, it does not ban the sale within states. Pennsylvania law currently allows endangered animal parts to be sold only with a permit. 
Animals covered by the the bill are the baleen whale, bonobo, cheetah, chimpanzee, dolphin, elephant, giraffe, gorilla, hippopotamus, jaguar, leopard, lion, mammoth, mastodon, orangutan, panda, pangolin, polar bear, ray, rhinoceros, sea turtle, shark, tiger and walrus. 
If passed, civil penalties would be imposed upon violators based on the value of the illegal animal product. Thirteen states and Washington D.C. have passed similar legislation. 
The bill passed the House Judiciary Committee by a 25-1 vote on Monday and now awaits consideration on the House floor. 
“We expect the bill to be on the floor soon, and we’ll work hard to maintain the bipartisan vote that we earned in committee this week,” Krueger said. “I’m hopeful that we’re going to be able to send this bill to the Senate very soon, and am hopeful that our colleagues there will see the value of ending the demand for trafficked animal parts in Pennsylvania.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate) The Joint Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee on Wednesday reviewed amendments to Arkansas’ surface water quality standards rule, which is part of the state’s enforcement of the federal Clean Water Act.
As part of the Clean Water Act, the state is required to review — and if necessary, revise — the standards every three years.
The rule, currently called Rule 2, was pulled from last month’s committee agenda to give lawmakers more time to review the changes, which include the addition of five new health-based water quality standards for benzene, methylbenzene, xylene, toluene and phenol. 
The rule also amends existing criteria for ammonia and cadmium, which haven’t been updated in decades, to bring them in line with revisions made by the Environmental Protection Agency within the last 15 years.
Rule 2 standards apply to surface waters — such as rivers, creeks, lakes and wetlands — not to drinking water, which is governed by a separate federal law, the Safe Drinking Water Act. While the Division of Environmental Quality oversees Arkansas’ enforcement of the CWA, the Arkansas Department of Health enforces the SDWA in the state.
“It’s not a blanket effluent limit,” DEQ Director Bailey Taylor told committee members. The standards are for the “ambient” water quality, and permit limits for facilities like wastewater treatment plants and industrial plants that discharge waste into surface waters are backcalculated from the standards, she said.
Under the revised rule, the “primary contact season,” the period during which people are most likely to be recreating in the water by swimming, fishing or boating, would be extended by two months so it would now fall from April to October. 
Pressed by Greenwood Republican Rep. Lee Johnson for an explanation for the change, Taylor said standards during the primary contact season are tighter for some measures than outside of it to account for greater human contact with the water. Taylor singled out bacteria standards as one example. She said the change was made to account for water recreation that’s been happening in April and October.
Johnson said it was “interesting” that the division was moving to make the change now, and asked if DEQ believed Arkansans were swimming more in 2025 than they were in 2020 or in the 1980s.
“I just wonder why we’re deciding now to change the recreational season when it’s been in effect for a long time,” Johnson said.
Taylor said the division was trying to account for recreation that was happening outside of the traditional May to September season. Johnson countered by asking if DEQ had collected any data showing that more people were engaging in water recreation during the extended months. Taylor said the decision was based on “anecdotal stakeholder engagement.” 
The rule will next be considered by the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Administrative Rules Subcommittee.

Ashley Moody next year is ripping into the state party, accusing it of unfairly excluding her from the party’s upcoming annual fundraiser while at the same time opening the door to another potential Senate candidate.
The Florida Democratic Party strongly disputes the assertion made by Tamika Lyles that the party is violating its bylaws as well as “the basic principles of democracy.”
Here’s what we know: Lyles filed to run for the U.S. Senate on April 1. Josh Weil is a Democrat who raised a large amount of money in his unsuccessful bid to beat Republican Randy Fine in the special congressional election in District 6 in April. He too, is expected to announce his candidacy in the 2026 Senate race later this month.
The Lyles’ campaign raised objections when it learned that Weil would be given an opportunity to speak at the party’s Leadership Blue Weekend event, which includes a gala, being held at the Hard Rock in Hollywood June 20-22, believing it to be a slight since Weil has yet to announce his candidacy. 
Lyles’ campaign on Tuesday issued a lengthy statement expressing its anger.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But FDP officials say Lyles isn’t telling the whole story, and that the party isn’t supporting anybody in next year’s Senate primary. 
The FDP says that Weil is only getting an opportunity to speak at Leadership Blue Weekend because he paid $50,000 to become a “title sponsor” for the event. It’s the highest price point among the four different sponsorships that attendees can donate (the three other sponsorships range between $5,000 to $25,000.)
The $50,000 donation comes with perks, including four reception tickets, two seats at the head table for the event and a “speaking opportunity,” as listed in an FDP document.
The event is the biggest fundraiser of the year for the Democratic Party, with individual tickets going for $300.
Lyles said that she was informed by an FDP official that she too, could get a speaking slot similar to Weil’s if she would pay the $50,000 required to become a title sponsor. 
Unequal treatment and exclusion?
The Lyles campaign claims the party’s decision to not initially reach out to her highlights “a serious issue of unequal treatment and exclusion,” adding that “it is an act of discrimination, one that mirrors the ongoing marginalization of women, particularly Black women and grassroots candidates nationwide.” Lyles is Black.
The FDP says that’s not what happened here.
“Title sponsorships for our annual Leadership Blue Weekend are available to all candidates, and no title sponsorship opportunities have been ‘extended’ to any candidates,” said FDP spokesperson Matt Dailey. 
“However, as the information on how to sign up for a title sponsorship has been publicly available on our website for months, some candidates have reached out to us to sponsor the event. “
Lyles is a U.S. Air Force veteran based in Osceola County who is making her third run for public office. She briefly entered the Democratic primary for Senate in 2018 before withdrawing. In 2020 she finished third in a five-person Democratic primary for a Central Florida House seat.
“This is what voter suppression looks like inside the party,” she said in a written statement to the Florida Phoenix. “I have served this country in uniform, earned multiple degrees, led legal and advocacy efforts for over a decade, and built a campaign powered by people, not political insiders. Yet it still isn’t enough to be treated fairly or be given the same access as a man who hasn’t even entered the race.”
FDP officials say that the only people speaking at the Leadership Blue Gala on Saturday night, June 21, the signature event of the weekend, will be New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Chair Nikki Fried and sitting members of Congress. Weil will be given a speaking slot at some other time during the weekend event, which includes lots of panel discussions.
This isn’t the first time that there’s been an issue in regard to who gets to speak among Senate Democratic candidates at the Leadership Blue Weekend. At last year’s event held in Orlando, the eventual nominee, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, did speak during the evening event.
Her main opponent in the primary election last August, Black tech entrepreneur Stanley Campbell, said he was only invited to speak during a morning session in front of a much smaller group of people (an FDP official tells the Phoenix that they “believed” that both of those candidates paid to get the chance to address party members at last year’s event).
When asked if it wasn’t a bad look that only candidates who could offer to pay $50,000 could get a speaking slot sometime during the weekend, the FDP’s Matt Dailey said that raising money for the party is what the event is essentially all about.
“Above all, Leadership Blue is a fundraising event – our largest and most important of the year,” he said. “The practice of offering a spot in the weekend schedule to incentivize title sponsorship is a long-time and well-advertised practice of the party.”

The West Des Moines Democrat said she wanted to hold a town hall on the proposal because of the “dismissive statements” Iowa’s congressional delegation has made when talking about the impact of the Medicaid cuts — specifically referencing U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst’s town hall statement that “we all are going to die” after an attendee yelled that people will die because of the cuts.
Trone Garriott also criticized Nunn and other members of Iowa’s House delegation for not hosting public events on the issue.
“We have seen our congressmen not hold open town halls and not have conversations to hear these hard stories, and we need to be listening so we can do a better job for the people of our state,” she said.
The changes to Medicaid include work requirements with several exemptions, including for people with disabilities and complex medical conditions, minors and seniors as well as pregnant people and parents of dependent children.
Republicans have argued the proposed changes will not impact Medicaid coverage for people in need, such as those with disabilities, and will instead target waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicaid system. At an event last week, Nunn said public assistance programs like Medicaid, as well as Medicare and SNAP, help Americans, but “have to be used in a way to help Americans with a hand up, not a handout,” the Des Moines Register reported.
But Trone Garriott said she believed the work requirements will add new burdens on people with real health care needs, without necessarily addressing the actual problems in the system.
“They’re indiscriminate cuts,” Trone Garriott told reporters. “It’s not about addressing any kind of fraud — which is more an issue from providers and billing, so that’s not addressing that concern. And it’s already very stringent, very challenging to get on Medicaid. There’s a lot of people who should be on it who are not being served. So it’s actually the opposite problem we have … more people could be eligible, but the process is so challenging that they can’t get on and stay on Medicaid.”
Iowans at the roundtable event said the proposed Medicaid changes will make it more difficult for people with covered medical conditions to get the care they need.
Paula Connolly, the parent of an adult child with a rare disability, said that while she and her husband were raising their child as an infant, Medicaid — and later Medicare — were the only ways for her family to access the medicine and other specific items, such as specialized formula, needed for their son. Adding new barriers to Medicaid will not only make it harder for families like hers to access the support they need, Connolly said, but will also have a greater impact by decreasing the number of providers willing to provide services and health care through Medicaid.
She gave an example of Medicaid coverage for a wheelchair repair — an already months-long process that could stretch out longer if cuts to the program are made.
“If the person who fixes the wheelchair doesn’t get adequately compensated to run the business, then he can’t fix a wheelchair,” Connolly said. “Or if the part for the wheelchair takes a year to get, well, then you essentially don’t have that wheelchair. And that means as a family — because disability does not only impact the child, it impacts the family — that means we sit at home and we don’t get out. We’re not doing healthy things to destress with caregiving, we’re not going to church.”
Health care professionals echoed these concerns, saying the Medicaid cuts could put health care providers across the state either out of business or in a situation where they cannot treat all patients in need.
Ed Friedmann, a physician’s assistant who is the sole health care provider at the Redfield Rural Health Clinic, said Medicaid and health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act have helped keep the clinic in Redfield, a rural town in Dallas County, in business. Not having insurance does not stop hospitals and clinics from giving patients’ medical treatment, he said — but not having payment and reimbursement through public health programs for individuals who would otherwise be uninsured could lead to more rural health care providers shutting down.
“If Medicaid patients lose their insurance, there’ll be less income for the clinic, and less likely for the clinic to be able to continue going in a town like Redfield and towns throughout the United States,” Friedmann said.
Trone Garriott said having more uninsured people in the system will mean “health care providers have to shift costs when they can’t cover costs, which means raising costs on everyone.” If elected, she said she would support raising Medicaid reimbursement rates, tying them to economic indicators, as a way to help Iowa health care providers stay open.
“It’s already a narrow margin, as providers are trying to continue to serve Medicaid patients, and there are a lot of areas where they’re just not able to make that work,” Trone Garriott said. “So we’re seeing labor and delivery units close. We’re seeing dental care providers just unable to take Medicaid patients. We’re seeing more and more folks with Medicaid not being able to access care or waiting a long time to get it.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/tronegarriott6.4.25-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 18:11:20.722946

(Photo Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)In an early blow to groups attempting to get amendments on the ballot for the 2026 election, a federal judge declined on Wednesday to temporarily block most of the new restrictions on citizen-led initiatives.
Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker’s ruling allows Florida to proceed with enforcing most of HB 1205, one of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ top priorities for this year’s legislative session, while litigation brought by some of the groups sponsoring initiatives on the ballot on May 4 moves forward.
In the meantime, the state can enforce provisions requiring sponsors to turn in completed petitions within 10 days after the voter signs the form, enact stepped-up fines for providing pre-filled petitions, and collect fines and impose criminal penalties for filling out missing information and copying information from petitions. Sponsors, such as Florida Decides Healthcare and Smart & Safe Florida, claimed that HB 1205 would make it nearly impossible to get amendment initiatives on the ballot.
In court hearing, attorneys debate palatability of new restrictions on citizens’ initiatives

“Here, aside from demonstrating they have suffered an injury in fact, Plaintiffs’ record only goes so far to show that the process of gathering signed petitions has become more expensive and less efficient, not that these post-petition-gathering regulations have severely burdened Plaintiffs from speaking such that the challenged regulations must survive heightened scrutiny to pass constitutional muster,” Walker wrote in his order.
However, Walker agreed to temporarily halt a provision for one of the plaintiffs of the law that expanded the definition of racketeering to cover irregularities and fraud regarding the petition collection process, writing that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and allowed for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The block only applies to Jordan Simmons, a project director of the campaign to expand Medicaid.
“Mr. Simmons faces irreparable injury because the law forces him to choose between curtailing his First Amendment rights to engage in core political speech via petition circulation or risk arrest and prosecution for a felony charge that could result in up to thirty years in prison,” Walker wrote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Where are the petition-gathering operations?
Florida Decides Healthcare framed Walker’s order as a win in a press release despite his denial of most of their claims.
“While the Court did not grant every part of our motion for preliminary relief, this is far from the final word,” wrote its Executive Director Mitch Emerson. “This ruling was an early, extraordinary step in the legal process—and we are optimistic about what comes next, both for the remaining parts of HB 1205 that we’re challenging and for the future of citizen-led democracy in Florida.”
In a message to the group’s coalition partners after Walker issued the order, Ana-Christina Acosta, the organizing director, wrote that petition collection operations will continue regardless of what happens with the litigation.
So far, Florida Decides Healthcare has gathered 18,867 valid signatures and Smart & Safe Florida has gathered 379,345 valid signatures, enough to trigger the Florida Supreme Court’s review of the amendment summary that could appear on the ballot, according to the Florida Division of Elections.
Sponsors of citizen-led initiatives need to get approval from the Florida Supreme Court on the clarity of the amendment summary, gather 880,062 valid signatures from at least half of the state’s 28 congressional districts to appear on the ballot, and get at least 60% approval to pass.
Law followed failed amendments
While the majority of voters approved recreational marijuana and abortion-rights amendments, both failed to cross the 60% threshold after Gov. Ron DeSantis deployed state resources to campaign against the proposed measures.
Lawmakers passed HB 1205 this year, citing a need to eradicate fraud in the petition-gathering process in light of a January report published by the state’s Office of Election Crimes and Security claiming that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting enshrine abortion access in the Florida Constitution last year committed crimes related to gathering petitions. Floridians Protecting Freedom denied the claims in the report but ultimately dropped its challenge to the fine the state imposed.
Only Florida residents could gather petitions
Come July 1, the state will also require people collecting signatures and petitions to register with the Secretary of State. Under HB 1205, people convicted of felonies who haven’t had their voting rights restored, non-U.S. citizens, and non-Florida residents can’t collect signatures or petitions.
Plaintiffs filed a second motion asking Walker to temporarily block those provisions, with Smart & Safe Florida stating that it would face a fine of $23.7 million because 474 of its trained petition circulators aren’t Florida residents.

(Photo via Sen. Susan Collins/ Facebook)Editor’s Note: This story is part of a series about U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ role during the second Trump presidency. 
As Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins approaches three decades in Congress, the self-described moderate’s balancing act has meant she’s angered both the left and right. However, even Mainers otherwise critical of Collins commend her ability to secure federal funding for Maine.
“I think her big goal has been what it always has been and that’s delivering economically for the state,” said Jim Melcher, a professor of political science at University of Maine Farmington. “I think [that] really interests her a lot more than being an ideological vote, honestly, for anybody.”
Though, the bounds of that unifier are now being tested by the Trump administration.
Since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts that have been widely interpreted as retaliatory.
Some Mainers say these terminations underscore why Maine needs Collins, one of Congress’ most senior members and top appropriators. Others argue the executive’s actions reveal a crack in Collins’ power.
When asked whether she believes she can still ensure Maine receives both the funding it’s owed and continued appropriations for new initiatives, Collins did not hesitate to say, “I do.”
 Her record

Both Republican leaders of the Maine Legislature, Sen. Trey Stewart of Aroostook County and Rep. Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor, said, without a doubt, that Collins should not face a primary challenger. Why? Federal funding.
“I think it’s absolutely insane to vote out Susan Collins, who brings so much money into the state of Maine,” Faulkingham said.
In fiscal year 2022, Congress reinstated earmarks, formally referred to as Congressionally Directed Spending in the Senate, where individual members have the ability to request funds for specific projects in their home states. Collins has secured more than $1 billion for Maine using this method since.
Collins secured more than $200 million for 105 projects in fiscal year 2022, more than $308 million for 108 projects in fiscal year 2023, and more than $577 million for 231 projects in fiscal year 2024. Her 2024 total was the most secured by any senator that year.
Throughout the years, these have gone toward initiatives related to infrastructure, medical services and affordable housing, among others.
The University of Maine System received $125.45 million from Congressionally Directed Spending secured by Collins between fiscal year 2022 and 2024, according to Chief External and Governmental Affairs Officer Samantha Warren, who called the funding “transformational.”
Though, Warren added, these earmarks don’t reflect all of the funding that Collins has helped funnel to the system, both since the earmark process was restored and before, noting Collins’ longtime championing of investments for Maine’s public universities including through need-based federal Pell grants and TRIO programs.
Another key funding source outside the earmark process is defense spending, which Collins has helped secure for Maine-based contractors such as Bath Iron Works and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.
“Do you think we’re going to be building ships at Bath Iron Works if we have a freshman legislator in the Senate? No, I don’t think so,” Faulkingham said.

When asked whether the General Dynamics-owned contractor has any concerns about Collins being able to continue to deliver in light of other congressionally appropriated funds being rescinded, David Hench, communications principal for BIW, pointed to her track record.
“Senator Collins’ leadership as a member and now chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee has been invaluable in not only providing resources for our national defense, but in helping to address the transportation, housing and childcare needs of our state and workforce,” Hench said.
When asked the same, Kate Dufour, director of advocacy and communications for the Maine Municipal Association, a nonprofit state municipal league, described a similar working relationship between its members and the senator.
“Collins is a strong proponent of municipal government and has done much during her career to ensure that Maine has access to federal revenues, which reduce the burdens placed on the property taxpayers,” Dufour said.
Several other major benefactors of Collins’ earmarks declined to comment on her performance as a top appropriator, including Jackson Laboratory and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, or did not respond to requests for comment, including Maine Medical Center.
When asked about her record of delivering for the state, Collins also pointed to her ability to work with both parties to advance legislation that aids many Mainers, and Americans more broadly. For example, she pointed to her co-authoring of the Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law earlier this year under former President Joe Biden, which she said she spent more than two decades working toward. The Act restored full benefits for millions of public sector workers.
 A breakdown

The funding process has been upended during Trump’s second term, challenging Collins’ otherwise steadily growing appropriations power.
The continuing resolution from GOP leadership this winter cut earmarks for community projects. Collins had secured nearly $361 million in earmarks this year before they were removed from the resolution, which she said she ultimately supported to avoid a government shutdown.
While it appears earmarks will return in bills this year to fund projects for fiscal year 2026, Mark Brewer, chair of the political science at the University of Maine, said he doesn’t think anyone can actually say whether that will consistently be the case moving forward.
“Really, a lot of the things that we thought for years and years that had been norms for how things are done in Washington are not at the moment,” Brewer said.
How the White House implemented that stopgap bill demonstrated another breakdown of normal procedure, defying precedent in vetoing certain emergency spending allocations made by Congress. Collins warned the Trump administration in a letter then that the move could strain its working relationship with the Appropriations Committee.
State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, a moderate Republican who has crossed paths with Collins when she previously held state-level positions and on campaign trails, said the senior senator has long focused on being institutionally responsible, an objective he also shares.
On the state level, Bennett has argued the Legislature has ceded too much power to the governor and on the national level that Congress has ceded too much to the president. Calling Congress “barely functional on a good day,” Bennett said of Collins, “I think it’s difficult for her to find a normal process that is inclusive in this chaos.”
When asked whether Collins is charting the most effective path amid that chaos, Bennett said, “I think we’re going to find out. I don’t have any advice for her. I think you’d have to be sitting in her seat in order to see what avenues she has.”
Collins has touted her behind-the-scenes conversations with officials as the most effective means to restore funding so far. Maine has been subject to both the Trump administration’s across-the-board slashes as well as targeted terminations.
For example, in late February, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notified the University of Maine that it was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, which has helped finance statewide research, strengthen coastal communities and support thousands of jobs over more than five decades.
While one of 34 grants across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country, Maine’s grant was the only one terminated.
The funding cut came about a week after Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complied with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports. Since then, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts.
On March 4, independent U.S. Sen. Angus King and Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine sent a letter to Vice Admiral Nancy Hann demanding she immediately reverse the decision. But when Hann announced on March 5 that the grant would be renegotiated, she credited conversations with Collins and her staff. The University of Maine also credited the renegotiation decision to Collins.
“We are deeply appreciative of Senator Collins’ leadership and relentless advocacy on behalf of Maine Sea Grant and the hard-working Mainers it has long served,” UMaine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy said in a statement.

 Values versus funding 

Collins lost Saco resident Sandy Katz’s support on issues of principle, and while not enough to gain her vote, Katz said, “The funding is the one thing she does well.”
Values and funding, however, are becoming increasingly entwined, as exemplified by Trump’s attempt to force compliance with his executive order through cuts.
On principle, Collins is against transgender athletes playing in women’s sports, but when it comes to funding, she criticized the president’s attempts to rescind federal dollars for Maine schools.
Trying to find her balance between the two has also been challenged with her votes on Trump’s Cabinet picks. She voted for the vast majority of nominees, confirming 20 and voting against two: Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Kash Patel.
Regarding Hegseth, Collins said, “I think his difficulty in managing the department effectively has shown that my judgment was correct on that.” Since his confirmation, Hegseth has been involved in a spate of security scandals over his use of the open-source, encrypted messaging app Signal.
Regarding Patel, Collins said, “I felt particularly at this time, but at any time, we need an apolitical FBI director and I did not think that Kash Patel was based on his writings.” Patel has authored children’s books and been involved with projects that promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories.
Concerning the Cabinet picks Collins supported, one confirmation in particular stuck out to political scientist and writer Amy Fried: Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought.
Vought, an architect of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint to overhaul the federal government, has said he doesn’t believe Congress has the final say on federal spending.
When asked whether he would comply with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which clarifies that presidents don’t have the legal authority to ignore Congress on federal spending, Vought responded, “No, I don’t believe it’s constitutional. The president ran on that view. That’s his view, and I agree.”
Collins told Maine Morning Star she gives deference to presidential Cabinet picks regardless of party.
“Despite my disagreements with [Vought], which are pretty profound when it comes to the Impoundment Act, he is clearly well qualified for the position,” Collins said. “He previously served as both deputy director of OMB and as director of OMB. So when I’m evaluating Cabinet nominees, I, in general, base my decision on whether or not the person is qualified for the job, not on whether I agree with all of their positions.”
Fried argued Collins’ vote for Vought undermines her own power.
“Her big claim was ‘I will be able to help the state of Maine because someday I’m going to be chair of the Appropriations Committee,’” Fried said. “Well, if the Appropriations Committee isn’t deciding what money goes where, then that just renders that whole thing null and void.”

“The state of Oklahoma cannot fund that operation of our own accord,” Tim Gatz, Oklahoma Department of Transportation executive director, told his governing board Monday.
Gatz previously said the rail line would close as early as this month if Texas failed to fund it. 
He was not available for comment Tuesday and Wednesday.
Gov. Kevin Stitt said he was disappointed Texas did not provide the funds.
“We’re not going to pick up their end of that,” Stitt said Wednesday. “And so we’re not sure exactly what’s going to happen with that connection.”
The Heartland Flyer, an Amtrak route between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth, is a jointly funded partnership between Texas and Oklahoma City. Oklahoma’s portion for 2025 was $4.5 million.
The Texas Department of Transportation’s budget for fiscal year 2025 included $2.81 million for the Heartland Flyer, said Laura Butterbrodt, a spokeswoman. She referred additional questions to Texas lawmakers.
Oklahoma lawmakers last month passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 10 urging Texas legislators to continue funding the service.
The service was reestablished in 1999 after ending in 1979. 
“The Oklahoma State Legislature acknowledges the importance of the continued existence of passenger rail in Oklahoma, and understands that once removed, it would be extraordinarily challenging to restore this service and continue to provide an additional option for Oklahomans,” the SRJ said.
Nearly 82,000 rode it last year.
Officials were considering expanding it into Kansas allowing travelers to connect to other major routes.
“Kansas recently provided dedicated funding and authority for KDOT (Kansas Department of Transportation) to support passenger rail for the Heartland Flyer extension,” said Philip Harris, a spokesman. “If the project were to stall in the study phase, evaluating the future use of those funds could be needed.”
If the project continues, its targeted operational date is 2029, he said.
Amtrak did not respond to a request for comment.

,California,2025-06-04 21:32:58+00:00,CalMatters,Were cuts in rooftop solar payments legal? California Supreme Court hears arguments,Malena Carollo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/06/solar-net-metering-at-state-supreme-court/,"Environmental groups want to revive higher payments to panel owners. But the subsidies were unfair to non-solar ratepayers, regulators say.","In summary
Environmental groups want to revive higher payments to panel owners. But the subsidies were unfair to non-solar ratepayers, regulators say.


The California Supreme Court heard arguments today in a case that could be pivotal to the spread of rooftop solar panels in California.
Environmental and consumer advocacy groups are seeking to reverse a 2022 decision by state regulators to slash by around 75% the rates paid to compensate customers with solar installations for the excess energy they generate. The move, intended to shield non-solar customers from unfair cost burdens, sent solar hookups plummeting.
Three environmental groups bringing the case — the Center for Biological Diversity, The Protect our Communities Foundation, and the Environmental Working Group — argue that the California Public Utilities Commission didn’t properly consider benefits to customers and disadvantaged communities when it changed the program. The commission argued the policy strikes a balance between affordability for all customers and encouraging renewable energy choices.
The court’s decision is expected within about a month.
At the hearing, a representative of the three groups, Malinda Dickenson, said the commission “excludes reliability and resiliency benefits” in its decision, including  “millions of customer generation facilities providing power on hot summer days and preventing blackouts.”  
The compensation program, known as “net energy metering,” was meant to incentivize renewable energy in the state by offsetting the significant cost to install solar panels onto the roofs of homes. Under the program, solar customers served by the state’s three large investor-owned utilities — Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric — sell back energy they do not use, saving the utility from having to purchase that power elsewhere.   
At issue is how much these customers are paid for this excess energy. Prior versions of the program – “NEM 1.0” and “NEM 2.0” – allowed customers to receive the retail rate for the excess energy, which is the price the electric companies charge other customers when they go on to sell it. The current program, “NEM 3.0,” instead gives customers the “avoided cost,” which is how much the utility saved by not buying that energy somewhere else. 
The program was changed after utilities argued to regulators that it created a “cost shift,” causing customers without solar to pay an unfair share of maintenance costs for the electrical system. The utility commission’s decision to change the program currently only applies to customers who installed solar panels after mid-April 2023; customers who were connected under the two prior iterations will continue to receive the retail rate for the length of their 20-year contract. 
The change caused an uproar from the rooftop solar industry, ratepayers, and renewable energy groups. The groups bringing the lawsuit initially asked the utility commission to rehear the issue and were denied. A state appeals court then sided with the utilities commission, before the groups brought the case to the high court.
During court arguments, the environmental groups played down the concept of shifting costs, calling it a “red herring.” 
But the utility commission argued that the cost shift is real. And while the state statute enabling the net metering program requires a cost-benefit analysis, a specific methodology to do so isn’t laid out.
State data showed 82% fewer solar customers requesting connections in 2023 than the year prior.
“The commission made a factual finding in its proceedings that the former [net metering] system was unsustainable because of the burden that it was placing on customers without solar,” said attorney Mica Moore, who represented the utilities commission. “It’s hard to see what the commission could have done to address that issue if it had been required to compensate homeowners for every quantifiable benefit for solar.”
The current program has had a meaningful effect on the state’s rooftop solar sector. Industry groups anticipated about 17,000 job losses the first year. State data showed 82% fewer solar customers requesting connections in 2023 than the year prior. And recent industry reports show new rooftop solar installations have gone down by as much as 45% since April 2023. 
The decline in solar panel installations may make it harder for the state to achieve its mandated goal of using 100% carbon-free energy by 2045; solar is expected to account for more than half of that. 
In the background is another potential sea change for the program. The California Assembly this week passed a bill seeking to change existing contracts for solar customers in a way that would reduce the number of customers receiving old, higher rates for their surplus solar power. Under the current program, when customers install solar panels and participate in net metering, they are guaranteed the rate they sign up under (the so-called “avoided cost rate”) for about 20 years. Should the solar user sell their home, the new owner would continue to receive the rate the previous homeowner signed up for.
If passed in its current form, the bill would stop this, preventing anyone who buys a home that’s already part of the net metering program from keeping an older rate. This is meant to help control costs, according to the text of the bill, but advocates say the move will harm ratepayers.
“If lawmakers are serious about controlling energy costs, they should address the real problem: runaway utility spending,” Brad Heavner, executive director of the California Solar & Storage Association, said in a statement. “Instead they seem more interested in protecting utility profits and blaming solar users.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/072822_SolarPanels_LV_CM_024.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 18:11:20.722946

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)When President Donald Trump’s performance in the polls in 2024 signaled a possible re-election, Keith Ellison and fellow Democratic attorneys general read Project 2025 and started getting ready, especially when Trump hired the key author of the planning document after his election.
They divided the documents into sections and marshaled their staff lawyers to be ready with lawsuits.
So when Russell Vought and the Office of Management and Budget froze the distribution of certain federal funds — as outlined in Project 2025 — Ellison and other the Democratic AGs were ready.
They sued over the funding freeze the next day.
“They were not hiding the ball,” Ellison said in a wide-ranging interview with States Newsroom in Minneapolis Wednesday.
Ellison and his colleagues have engaged in more than two dozen lawsuits against Trump administration actions in the first five months of the president’s second term. The AGs have sued over cuts to federal agencies, tariffs, DOGE’s access to government data, attempts to end birthright citizenship, and more.
They’ve also toured blue states to tout their accomplishments and listen to voters’ concerns.
The stakes are high, Ellison said: the fate of multi-racial democracy.
Ellison, who served for a dozen years in Congress representing Minnesota’s Minneapolis-based 5th District, said the states are a sovereign bulwark against federal power grabs.
The Democratic attorneys general are not only fighting a Republican-controlled executive branch, but also a conservative majority on the U.S Supreme Court. In Ellison’s view, recent decisions by the Roberts court — particularly in 303 Creative v. Elenis, in which the court ruled that a business owner could not be obligated to serve a gay couple — signify that the country is moving towards legal segregation.
“We are a whisper away from Jim Crow,” Ellison said.
Still, Ellison was upbeat, celebrating the AGs string of victories and predicting that even conservative Supreme Court justices will resist the Trump administration’s attack on the rule of law and the institution of the court itself.
The Democratic AGs may benefit from a weakened Department of Justice under Trump, Ellison said. The agency that defends the federal government in court is hemorrhaging longtime staff attorneys, through both firings and resignations.
Ellison emphasized that many of the policies enacted by Trump in his first months in office would be legal if they were passed by Congress. Instead, the president is running the country through “edict” and “proclamation,” Ellison said.
“Our democracy is not perfect,” Ellison said, “but you will absolutely miss it when it’s gone, and Trump has given you a glimpse of that.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)Epic Charter Schools, one of Oklahoma’s largest school districts, announced mass layoffs Tuesday, resulting in 357 job losses.


In a move the district called in a statement, “significant streamlining measures,” Epic has not renewed contracts for 83 teachers and 274 administrators for the next school year. That accounts for about 6% of teachers and more than one-third of administrators.
It will also close its in-person learning centers in Tulsa and Oklahoma City and discontinue breakfast and lunch services.
Epic Superintendent Bart Banfield said in a statement the school was committed to “supporting those impacted with compassion and transparency.”
“We are grateful to every member of the Epic team for the passion and care they bring to our community,” Banfield said. “This transition is about preserving and strengthening our ability to serve students for years to come.”
In an email obtained by StateImpact, staff were told by Epic they would lose access to Epic systems and facilities “shortly,” and benefits, including healthcare, which will terminate at the end of the month. Staff are also required to return all Epic property before June 9.
In another staff email obtained by StateImpact, Epic said it would discontinue its Chinese and Latin course offerings and outsource and charge students $275 for German and French courses unless they have completed German I or French I during the previous school year.
Epic also announced in the email students will no longer have access to one free concurrent college course. Going forward, students must purchase all courses through the Learning Fund, which is a $1,000 allocation Epic provides for each student.
English language arts (ELA) and math are also affected. Epic’s ELA+ will be discontinued, and Math+ will only be offered to students in grades 6-12 rather than 3-12. The courses provide live, virtual instruction to students two to three times a week.
AP courses will also now be outsourced, and students’ Learning Fund will be charged $100 for “specialty” courses.
The move follows cuts in October of nearly 150 Epic employees. At the time, Epic said it had overestimated the number of students who would enroll by about 4,000.

Phil Murphy have capped out their matching primary funds, receiving $5.5 million each.","Four of the candidates hoping to succeed a term-limited Gov.

With less than a week left before the June 10 gubernatorial primaries, the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission has disbursed nearly $37.5 million in public matching dollars to eight of the 11 candidates, the agency said Wednesday.


Four of those hoping to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy — Democrats Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, plus Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli — have capped out their matching primary funds, receiving $5.5 million each.


Democrats Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and ex-state Sen. Steve Sweeney and Republicans Sen. Jon Bramnick and former radio host Bill Spadea have not raised enough to receive the maximum amount of matching primary funds, according to the election law commission.


Of those four, Sweeney has received the most public dollars, just under $5.3 million. Baraka’s matching funds total $4.2 million. Bramnick, the only sitting legislator in the race, has received about $3.2 million from the program, while Spadea has gotten roughly $2.8 million.


The gubernatorial public finance program offers candidates who meet fundraising and spending thresholds matching public dollars at a rate of 2-to-1 for every dollar candidates raise. In exchange, gubernatorial hopefuls agree to participate in debates hosted by the election law commission and observe spending limits.


This year, candidates who participate in the program can spend no more than $8.7 million on primaries and up to $18.5 million for the general election.
The amount of matching funds already disbursed this year exceeds all primary spending in 2017, New Jersey’s last gubernatorial election with no incumbent seeking reelection.
Then, all candidates across major and minor parties spent just under $34.5 million. Most of that spending came from Murphy, who did not participate in the public financing program during the 2017 primary and spent $22 million, including more than $16 million he loaned to his campaign.


Murphy, who participated in the gubernatorial fund match in 2017’s general election and through the entire 2021 cycle, is barred from seeking a third consecutive term.


Three candidates did not qualify for matching funds. Teachers union president Sean Spiller was the only Democrat who did not raise and spend the $580,000 needed to qualify by the March 24 deadline. Spiller’s candidacy is getting a major boost from an independent expenditure group with ties to his union that has spent $37.5 million so far urging voters to support Spiller in the primary.


On the Republican side, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac and contractor Justin Barbera did not qualify for matching funds.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)SEATTLE — Federal appeals court judges in Seattle on Wednesday questioned a Trump administration lawyer and Washington’s solicitor general over the president’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship.
The three-judge panel in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals appeared more open to the Trump administration’s arguments than a federal judge in Seattle who in January called the order “blatantly unconstitutional.” 
Perhaps the most pointed question came after a lengthy back-and-forth over what the writers of the 14th Amendment meant when they enshrined birthright citizenship into the U.S. Constitution. 
Hawkins asked Department of Justice attorney Eric McArthur, who clerked for conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, what the late Justice Antonin Scalia would think of his arguments. Scalia, an ardent originalist, anchored the Supreme Court’s conservative wing alongside Thomas.
“He was widely critical of looking at congressional history and statements of senators opposing or supporting a particular thing, and famously said ‘just the words,’” said Hawkins, a Clinton appointee. 
McArthur said he thought Scalia would have been “very open to looking at all of the historic evidence.”
After McCarthur’s arguments, Hawkins told the Justice Department attorney he did a “terrific job.”
Trump’s executive action, signed on the first day of his second term, aims to end birthright citizenship for babies born to a mother and father who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Since the aftermath of the Civil War, the country has automatically given citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil, no matter their immigration status.
Wednesday was the first time the merits of Trump’s order have come before a federal appeals court.
The arguments from Washington’s solicitor general, the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project and McArthur come a few weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court took up Washington’s case on birthright citizenship and others. 
The justices focused on whether preliminary injunctions, like the one from Judge John Coughenor in Seattle at the center of Wednesday’s hearing, should affect only the parties involved in a particular case or can be applied nationwide. The Trump administration contends such orders are judicial overreach.
The Supreme Court’s ruling-to-come could have implications far beyond the birthright citizenship case, potentially staunching the flow of temporary nationwide blocks that state attorneys general are relying on to stop what they see as the president’s unlawful actions.
In their May 15 hearing, the justices appeared wary of allowing different rules by state.
On Wednesday, state Solicitor General Noah Purcell called Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship “unconstitutional and unAmerican.” 
“President Trump seeks to turn citizenship into a political football, denying that precious right to hundreds of thousands of babies born in this country simply because their parents are here to work, to study or to escape persecution or violence,” said Purcell, who argued successfully against the president’s travel ban in court in 2017.
As is customary, the 9th Circuit judges didn’t rule from the bench Wednesday. They’ll issue a written ruling in the coming weeks or months. Both sides told the judges it may be prudent to first wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the nationwide injunction question.
Former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, appointed two of the three judges who oversaw Wednesday’s hearing. The other is a Trump appointee from the president’s first term.
Several other cases are currently awaiting similar appellate hearings after lower courts awarded preliminary injunctions. The Supreme Court will likely have the final say on the merits of Trump’s order.
Speaking to reporters after the Wednesday morning hearing, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said “the judges had a lot of pointed and difficult questions for both sides to grapple with.” 
Still, he said he is “really confident moving forward that this court, and ultimately the Supreme Court, will rule in the states’ favors.”
Longstanding precedent
The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution codified birthright citizenship in 1868.
The amendment begins: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”
Trump’s order, initially set to take effect Feb. 19, focused on the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” phrase.
“The Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States,” Trump’s executive order reads. “The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”
Legal precedent, including an 1898 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, has long upheld birthright citizenship. That case dealt with a man born in San Francisco to Chinese parents named Wong King Ark. The justices ruled he was a U.S. citizen.
The two sides interpret this case differently. Much of Wednesday’s arguments centered the Wong Kim Ark decision.
McArthur noted the Supreme Court ruled “every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the United States.” He focuses on the word “domiciled,” arguing those here temporarily or without legal status don’t fall under that umbrella.
Matt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, countered by reading further from the Supreme Court decision. 
“His allegiance to the United States is direct and immediate, and, although but local and temporary, continuing only so long as he remains within our territory,” the justices continued in their Wong Kim Ark ruling, arguing that he is “as much a citizen as the natural-born child of a citizen.”
Washington’s case against Trump’s birthright citizenship order, filed alongside Oregon, Arizona and Illinois, led to the second Trump administration’s first judicial rebuke. 
The Reagan-appointed judge, Coughenour, later agreed to indefinitely block Trump’s order while the case played out in court. Trump’s Department of Justice appealed, leading to Wednesday’s hearing.
Two pregnant noncitizen women joined the states’ litigation, fearful their children could be born stateless. One has since given birth to a baby born a U.S. citizen because of court action, said Matt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.
In 2022, about 153,000 babies across the country were born to two parents without legal immigration status, including 4,000 in Washington, according to the plaintiffs. The states have said they stand to lose federal funding through programs like Medicaid that otherwise could help these children if they were citizens.
Purcell told the judges that implementing the Trump administration’s vision would be difficult, leaving hospitals to ask about immigration status and how long parents plan to remain in the United States.
“Doesn’t that just show the injunction is premature?” asked Judge Patrick Bumatay, a Trump appointee. “We don’t know how unworkable it is because they were not given a chance to implement it.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota bond authority has backed a plan to issue up to $1 billion in bonds — the largest financing package in the authority’s history — for Sanford Health to support its recent merger with Marshfield Clinic Health System of Wisconsin.
The South Dakota Health and Educational Facilities Authority voted unanimously Wednesday to authorize the bond package, allowing Sanford to refinance existing debt, pay for previously completed projects, and complete construction at hospitals and clinics in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
The authority is governed by a seven-member board appointed by the governor. The state created the authority in 1972 to issue tax-exempt bonds that help nonprofit hospitals and public universities borrow money at lower cost. Investors buy the bonds and earn interest as the borrower pays back the debt. The aim is to give South Dakota residents greater access to education and health care.
The tax-exempt status means those investors don’t have to pay taxes on the interest their bonds earn. That makes the bonds more attractive, in this instance helping Sanford borrow the money at a lower interest rate than they’d get from a bank.
Many of Sanford’s bond-funded projects are outside South Dakota, but the board is allowed to approve multi-state financing if part of the funding is used in-state, explained Dustin Christopherson. He is the assistant director of the authority and responded to South Dakota Searchlight’s questions via email.
Christopherson said the bond approval does not involve public tax dollars, and the state has no financial responsibility for repaying the debt. The authority does not lend the state’s credit to borrowers. Instead, it acts as a conduit, allowing Sanford to access the lower, tax-exempt interest rates.
Sanford officials plan to return to the board later with a request for up to $2.1 billion in longer-term financing that would replace the initial bonds and potentially cover more projects.

The ruling reversed a lower court’s decision, with justices reasoning that towns and cities in Vermont can regulate both cannabis cultivation and farming practices by enforcing local zoning laws.

Struthers’ ducks and his cannabis growing operation have been the subject of controversy in his neighborhood. Photo by Charlotte Oliver/Community News ServiceFor years Jason Struthers has made a living growing vegetables, raising ducks and cultivating cannabis in his Essex Junction backyard, but not without controversy. Neighbors argued first to the city, then later in court, that his half-acre farm has no place in their residential neighborhood — and the Vermont Supreme Court recently ruled in agreement. The May 30 ruling reversed a lower court’s decision, with justices reasoning that towns and cities in Vermont can regulate both cannabis cultivation and farming practices by enforcing local zoning laws. It’s the latest development in a long controversy over state versus local authority, and a win for Stephen and Sharon Wille Padnos, who live next door to Struthers and have advocated against Struthers’ farm. “I will say we had a good weekend,” said Stephen Wille Padnos. He and his wife are celebrating the hard fought win and hoping the next legal processes aren’t drawn out, he said. Meanwhile, Struthers is “absolutely gobsmacked” and confused, he said. The attitude expressed in the ruling disrupts a tradition of supporting agriculture in Vermont, Struthers said. And he’s talking to his lawyers about ways to fight the decision every way he can, he said. Struthers has a state license to grow cannabis on his property and is recognized by the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets as a farm for his duck-raising and vegetable farming. But neighbors take issue with the smell of his plants and the sound of his ducks in their suburban neighborhood. The Wille Padnoses reason that he shouldn’t be able to run a farm or cultivate cannabis on their quiet cul-de-sac because they live within the city’s residential zone and within 500 feet of Essex High School property. In turn, Struthers argues that he’s exempt from the city’s regulations because he’s protected by state agriculture and cannabis laws. Some of Struthers’ ducks mingle in his Essex Junction backyard in fall 2023. File photo by Charlotte Oliver/Community News ServiceLegally, his farming practices and cannabis cultivation are two separate matters. But Struthers uses manure from his ducks to fertilize his cannabis plants. He sees any regulation of his ducks as de-facto regulation of his cultivation, he said. And many have tried to make sense of the legal ambiguities. Back in September 2023, the Essex Junction Developmental Review Board ruled that Struthers’ duck raising violated local zoning laws, while stating the city had little power to regulate or zone his cannabis cultivation. The decision raised frustration from both sides. Struthers appealed, arguing the city was out of line by trying to regulate his farming, according to court documents. The Wille Padnoses also appealed, but for the opposite reason. They argued the city wasn’t doing enough to regulate Struthers’ cannabis. READ MORE
At the next level of appeal, Thomas Walsh, a judge in the Environmental Division of Vermont Superior Court, ruled in Struthers’ favor on both matters in August. He said the regulation of farming and cultivation was out of the city’s hands. Then, last week the state Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the environmental court. In their ruling, justices wrote that the “landowner’s cannabis-cultivation operation is not exempt from all municipal regulation simply because he is a licensed outdoor cannabis cultivator.” In the same ruling, justices also said state law “does not prohibit all municipal regulation of farming.” Next, the case will be passed back down to the lower court, and Walsh can rule on the case again — this time bearing in mind the interpretation of the Supreme Court. After the ruling, city officials will decide what action they could take. “We will be carefully considering next steps to ensure we are consistent with this decision; this will likely include coordination with other regulatory authorities,” Regina Mahony, the city manager of Essex Junction, said in an email to VTDigger. Read the story on VTDigger here:  State Supreme Court rules against Essex Junction cannabis and ducks farmer.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jason-Struthers-EJ-1024x681.png,,,2025-06-04 18:11:20.722946

June 4, 2025.  (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen’s signature Wednesday was the final hurdle to legally requiring that all student-athletes competing in public K-12 or college sports this fall must do so on the team that matches their sex at birth.
Pillen’s approval of Legislative Bill 89, the “Stand With Women Act” from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, allows it to take effect Sept. 3. That’s three months after the Legislature adjourned Monday. 
  Gov. Jim Pillen presents a ceremoniously signed “Stand With Women Act,” which requires student-athletes wishing to play in competitive sports in Nebraska to play on teams matching their sex at birth, to Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer, that is based on a model policy pushed by an organization connected to Gaines. June 4, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Kauth, who joined Pillen for the bill signing, said schools and colleges have been anticipating the legislation. She hopes it won’t take that long for them to comply.
“The work is not done. We’re going to continue,” Kauth said at the Wednesday signing ceremony.
Kauth confirmed that she would try again in the 2026 legislative session to set similar sex-based legal restrictions on school bathrooms and locker rooms, which LB 89 originally sought.
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, one of the 33 Republicans to support LB 89, did so only after those provisions were taken out. 
He had said he did not want to be part of the “Nebraska State Potty Patrol.” Riepe previously said LB 89 took care of locker rooms indirectly and that he was against turning the Legislature into a “vehicle for fear, overreach and culture war crusades.”
“LB 89, as amended, respects that line,” Riepe said during the bill’s May 14 debate. “It focuses on competition, not surveillance. It protects sports, not panic.”
Kauth said she would continue working with Riepe on future legislation.
‘Fair playing ground’
Pillen, a defensive back for the Cornhuskers from 1975 to 1978, said sports are “Life 101,” helping someone learn to get up after getting knocked down, “dust ourselves off and keep going harder the next day.” Pillen said he remembers life before the landmark federal Title IX protections passed in 1972 and embraced women’s sports. He said LB 89 is a “fair playing ground.”

As he told the Nebraska Examiner in April, Pillen said Wednesday that he’s confident bathrooms will be addressed “in the meantime” before Kauth tries again in 2026.
“I have confidence that most of the young boys and men in Nebraska know right and wrong, and they’ll take care of whoever tries to go in the locker room or restroom [they’re not supposed to], because it is silly that we should be having these conversations,” Pillen said.
Asked by reporters what he meant, Pillen said it was “common sense” that men and boys don’t go into female restrooms or locker rooms. He declined to explain what he envisioned but said he was not suggesting violence.
“Never had a thought of promoting violence to any human being ever,” Pillen told reporters.
  State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha speaks on the floor of the Legislature. May 19, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner).
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, who led opposition to LB 89, said last week that such a position is calling for “outright physical violence” against transgender youth.
“If I said in the news that I’m going to ‘take care of’ the governor for doing something I don’t like, what do you think would happen? Would I get a visit?” Hunt posted on X, formerly Twitter.
Hunt during debate said the law signaled a willingness to “prioritize political theater over actual governance, that we are willing to criminalize difference, that we will twist Title IX, which was meant to expand opportunity for everybody, into a tool of exclusion.”
New law requirements
Under the “Stand With Women Act,” “sex” will be defined in state law as whether someone “naturally has, had, will or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports and utilizes” either eggs (female, woman or girl) or sperm (male, man or boy) for fertilization.
Public school competitive sports would be restricted to students’ sex at birth, for males or females only, unless the sport is coed/mixed. Exceptions will be made for sports with no female equivalent team, such as football.

Private schools would need to adopt a similar policy if student-athletes compete against public institutions.
A student-athlete would need to verify sex at birth with a doctor’s note before participating in single-sex sports. Kauth said she envisions such verification coming during a student’s physical exam, while opponents such as Hunt say it normalizes questioning someone’s appearance.
All 245 public school districts in the state, as well as community colleges, state colleges and the University of Nebraska, would need to adopt a policy complying with the new law. Enforcement of the new law would be left up to each school district. Pillen said there would be consequences if schools choose not to comply.
Following other states
Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer who pushed for similar laws in many states, joined the bill signing and thanked Pillen for his stewardship and Kauth for being relentless. Kauth first proposed the bill in 2023, when Pillen took office.
In August 2023, Gaines spoke to Nebraskans and urged support for Kauth’s legislation, calling it “spiritual warfare.”

Just three days after Gaines’ speech, Pillen signed a “Woman’s Bill of Rights” administratively defining “male” and “female” for state agencies. The executive order remains in effect until a law addressing private female spaces, such as the original LB 89, is passed.
“I don’t think there’s, truthfully, a more worthy cause than to be here in Lincoln today with you guys, watching as Nebraska becomes the 28th state to protect women’s sports,” Gaines said. “Congratulations to Nebraskans across the state, to women across the state.”
‘Trying to defend reality’
Also speaking Wednesday was former high school student-athlete Payton McNabb of North Carolina. She said she planned to play collegiately until a severe injury in her senior year, when a volleyball spiked by an opposing player who was trans hit McNabb’s face.

Gaines, in her previous Nebraska visit, spoke about the need for locker room protections after she saw male genitalia in a women’s locker room. McNabb said she was accused of sexual harassment by a man in a college women’s bathroom but was cleared of wrongdoing in January.
“Unfortunately, I’ve experienced this gender ideology push in more than one way, and it’s just not fair,” McNabb said. “No other girl should ever go through that.”
Local college athletes Jordy Bahl (Huskers softball) and Rebekah Allick (Huskers volleyball) also joined the signing. They were present when Kauth introduced the bill in January, which they said wasn’t about politics.
“We’re trying to defend reality, which is such a crazy fight that we have to fight, and though the opposition may not see it now, I think somewhere deep in their soul, they know,” Allick said, adding that later on, opponents will see the legislation was “in their best interest.”

A lead Nebraska opponent, executive director Abbi Swatsworth of the nonprofit OutNebraska, said she was disappointed Wednesday by the LB 89 signing. Swatsworth noted it comes as many families are celebrating Pride and “grappling with the reality of this harmful legislation.”
“Despite this harmful legislation, we stand together stronger this Pride. To the youth and their families who are struggling: We are with you. We will continue fighting this fight because you belong — yesterday, today and always,” Swatsworth said in a statement. “Trans people are brilliant, beautiful and resilient, and they belong here in our state.”
OutNebraska also shared support hotline numbers for the Trevor Project (1-866-488-7386), National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (988) and Trans Lifeline (877-565-8860).

Dan McKee has tapped two out-of-state political staffers to work for his 2026 reelection campaign. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Fresh off new, unfavorable polling numbers on his job performance, Gov. Dan McKee has tapped out-of-state talent to aid in his 2026 reelection campaign, including a former staffer to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.
Rob Silverstein, who most recently served as Hochul’s policy director, and before that, as her deputy campaign manager, will now manage McKee’s 2026 campaign. Neil Spencer will serve as his campaign finance director, following eight years with the Florida House Democratic Campaign Committee.
“I’m excited to have a strong team of talented operatives to run my re-election campaign,” McKee said in a statement. “Nobody will outwork us on the trail, and Rob and Neil embody that ethos. With their experiences on highly competitive races and excellent track records of success in state campaigns, I am confident that we are well-positioned to continue delivering results for Rhode Island for years to come.”
The sitting governor is the only candidate to confirm their intent to run in the 2026 gubernatorial race, with a two-minute spot released on March 3. His 2022 Democratic primary rival, Helena Buonanno Foulkes, appears to be readying for a comeback challenge against McKee, having already begun growing her campaign war chest.
Other rumored, but unconfirmed candidates include House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and 2022 Republican gubernatorial candidate Ashley Kalus, who bought a home in Providence this year, WPRI-TV 12 reported. 
McKee’s new campaign hires were announced Monday, four days after a University of New Hampshire poll in which McKee scored a 19% approval rating among a survey of 653 Rhode Island residents. The dismal view of his job performance was accompanied by weak support for his reelection bid; just 11% of those surveyed thought the four-year incumbent deserved to win the 2026 race, compared with 74% who thought he did not deserve to win re-election.
Even among his own party, fewer than one in five survey respondents supported McKee’s reelection campaign, according to the UNH poll. Meanwhile, 39% of Democrats surveyed expressed support for Foulkes to run, while 32% backed former Gov. Gina Raimondo, who left during her second term as governor to become U.S. Commerce Secretary. 
Since leaving the federal administration in January, Raimondo has joined the Council on Foreign Relations in D.C. as a distinguished fellow and co-chair of a task force on economic security. She also expressed interest in a 2028 presidential run during an interview with David Axelrod in Chicago in April. 
Silverstein declined to comment on the UNH poll results in a brief interview Wednesday, referring to the governor’s previous comments to other news outlets in which he shrugged off the survey as an “outlying poll.”
A New York native, Silverstein has nearly a decade of political experience in campaigns in local, state and federal races across the country. He earned high marks from Hochul for his work on her campaign and in elected office over the past four years.
“Rob Silverstein has been a key member of our team, bringing sharp political instincts, tireless commitment, and a deep understanding of what it takes to win tough races,” Hochul said in a statement. “Rob has been instrumental in building a stronger Democratic Party in New York and played a critical role in our success flipping key House seats last year. Governor McKee is gaining a skilled and strategic leader, and I’m proud to call Rob a trusted former member of my team.”
Like McKee, Hochul was thrust into the top state leadership role from lieutenant governor in 2021. Her ascension to the governor seat was prompted by the unexpected resignation of Andrew Cuomo.
Silverstein has a bachelor’s degree from Georgetown University and a master’s degree in public administration from Columbia University.
Spencer comes to Rhode Island from his native Florida, where he attended Florida State University for his bachelor’s degree and a master’s in the university’s Applied American Politics and Policy program. During his eight years working for Florida House Democrats, he set multiple fundraising records, including $5 million raised in 2022 and more than $9 million raised in 2024.
“The institutional knowledge Neil built up with the Florida House Democratic Campaign Committee allowed us to build momentum and set new fundraising records cycle after cycle, and Neil’s strategic vision and dedication have made him one of the most successful finance directors in Florida legislative politics,” Florida House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell said in a statement.

André Carson speaks at a rally on Oct. 26, 2024, in Indianapolis. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A Wednesday letter from Democrat U.S. Rep. André Carson to the federal Department of Homeland Security seeks answers about the possible use of Camp Atterbury in Indiana as an immigration detention facility.
The letter follows recent Indiana Capital Chronicle reporting that federal officials may be eyeing the southern Indiana base as a temporary site for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees. The federally owned facility is licensed to and operated by the Indiana National Guard.
A DHS spokesperson last week declined to confirm any plans but acknowledged the agency is exploring “flexible options” to respond to capacity issues in its nationwide detention network.
In his letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Carson said the prospect raises “serious questions” and flagged concerns about legal rights, humane treatment and national security. 
Feds could eye Indiana’s Camp Atterbury as potential site for ICE detainees amid capacity strain

“Camp Atterbury has historically served as a training base for the Indiana National Guard and has been a vital part of our state’s military infrastructure,” wrote Carson, who represents portions of Marion County. “The prospect of repurposing it for migrant detention raises significant issues that warrant thorough examination, including the negative impact this will have on our national security and military readiness.”
Carson’s letter comes as ICE detention has surged in recent months, approaching 50,000 people nationwide — far above the 41,500 beds funded by Congress — according to the latest federal numbers. 
That strain has reportedly prompted DHS to review underused military and federal facilities across the country, including Camp Atterbury, but no official decisions have been announced.
Carson, a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he’s especially troubled by reports of due process violations at other ICE detention sites.
“As a senior Member of the House Intel Committee, I am always thinking about keeping our state and our country safe,” Carson said in a statement. “Not only does the prospect of using Camp Atterbury raise concerns that our military readiness will be reduced, it also is deeply concerning given numerous reports that detainees across the United States have been denied legal due process.”
Camp Atterbury has previously been used to house Afghan evacuees and Ukrainian refugees, but not immigration detainees held under enforcement authority.
Carson asked DHS to respond to seven specific questions about the potential use of Camp Atterbury by June 13, including what laws and funding would govern its use of the national guard site, and how military operations might be affected.
DHS had not responded publicly to the letter as of Wednesday evening.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 20:58:58+00:00,CT Mirror,"After years of frustrations, climate advocates give tepid praise to CT lawmakers",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-climate-change-bills/,"Though tepid, this year’s reviews were an improvement over advocates’ criticisms following the demise of similar efforts in past years.","For the last two years, environmental advocates in Connecticut have made no secret about their frustrations with lawmakers in Hartford over a lack of major progress on climate legislation.
So the passage of two priority bills over the final weeks of this year’s legislative session — one promising to set Connecticut on a path to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, the other contemplating how to deal with the unavoidable aspects of climate change — was welcomed by advocates with a sigh of relief.
“Compared to recent sessions, it’s actual legislation that has passed,” said Christopher Phelps, the executive director of Environment Connecticut. “So that is forward progress.”
Christine Palm, a former state representative — and teacher — who championed many environmental bills during her tenure, graded her former colleagues C+ in their action on climate change this session. Since retiring from politics last year, Palm has founded The Active Voice, which is dedicated to training young environmental activists.
“We could do a whole lot better, way better, but it’s better than nothing,” Palm said Wednesday. “There were years when they did nothing…  I think what the history is, we do great bills about plants, animals, preservation of land, but addressing climate change, the big umbrella of climate change, very little has been done.”
While lukewarm, the reviews from advocates at the end of this year’s legislative session were an improvement over the criticisms heaped upon Democrats following the demise of past efforts to adopt stricter timelines for reducing carbon emissions, roll out electric vehicles or join with other states to purchase offshore wind power.
Several advocates specifically directed praise toward the new House chair of the Environment Committee, state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, who took the lead in drafting several priority bills with his co-chair, state Sen. Rick Lopes, D-New Britain. 
“I think it speaks to the ability of our committee to stay true to our priorities and also work with Republicans and the senate,” Parker said. “We put some good plans in place, and everyone stuck to their word and followed through. I feel good about it.”
Net-Zero Emissions
The final victory for advocates came with just a few hours to spare before Wednesday’s  midnight deadline to pass legislation. At around 2 p.m., the Senate voted to pass House Bill 5004, the net-zero emissions legislation that also included a hodgepodge of incentives for solar canopies, energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, green jobs and sustainability-focused businesses.
The bill was a priority of House Democrats, who passed it out of the lower chamber on May 1 — only to watch in linger in the Senate for weeks. 
For supporters, the wait was reminiscent of what happened last year when a similar bill, led by Palm, stalled and ultimately died in the Senate on the final day of the legislative session. 
“It’s just really concerning, that the most pressing environmental issue that we face is, for the third year in a row, kind of at this level of uncertainty,” Sierra Club Connecticut Executive Director Samantha Dynowski said as she waited for senators to take up the bill Tuesday evening. 
Opponents had dubbed last year’s effort the “Green Monster.” But a series of compromises, and agreements to study the most controversial components and their effects on businesses, largely blunted criticism of the bill this year.
“Is it achievable? I question all of it, but in the end of the day, that’s not something that we would spend our time opposing,” said Chris Herb, the president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association.

Lopes called the bill “aspirational” due to its lack of any enforcement mechanisms for lowering emissions. 
“They are goals, they are not mandates,” Lopes said. “They are setting the tone and direction for the industry in the state of Connecticut, of where we want to be, where we want to go, and hopefully we hit them. If we don’t hit them, there are not penalties.”
Still, Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, raised concerns that the bill could open to door for the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to impose regulations on the private sector if the state struggles to reach its net-zero target.
“I think these goals are important, and I think we should have these goals,” Harding said. “Where I get concerned is ambiguity in legislation. As a lawyer, lawyers make a living on ambiguity.”
One Republican, state Sen. Tony Hwang, R-Fairfield, broke with his party to vote in favor of the bill, calling it a “smaller and more incremental” compromise compared to last year’s effort. 
The Senate’s vote sent H.B. 5004 to Gov. Ned Lamont, who said he intends to sign it.
“Connecticut is proud to be a climate leader and this legislation helps keep our state on track to improve our air quality and meet our climate goals,” Lamont said in a statement. “Notably, it increases the tools available in our state that will attract business growth in the clean energy sector and the associated jobs that they support.”
Resiliency, and Pesticides
While the Senate waited to take action on H.B. 5004, House lawmakers gave final approval to a wide-ranging climate resiliency bill last week that also included provisions cracking down on the use of certain pesticides that can harm wildlife. 
The legislation, Senate Bill 9, was the upper chamber’s preeminent environmental measure for the 2025 legislative session. The majority of the bill, nearly 50 pages, focused on preparing for the impacts of climate change with updates to the state’s water plan, requiring towns to consider sea level rise when making zoning changes and mandating flood risk disclosures for home buyers and renters, among other provisions.
But it was two provisions near the end, restricting the use of rat poisons and a group of insecticides known as “neonicotinoids,” that attracted the most debate. 
In the Senate, those restrictions were eased somewhat to appease the concerns of the pest control industry, which sought to continue the use of covered pesticides by licensed professionals. As a result, a number of Republicans crossed the aisle to support the bill.

“I didn’t find any real big objection,” said state Rep. Pat Callahan, R-New Fairfield, the ranking member of the Environment Committee, during the House debate last month. 
But some Democrats in the House raised their own objections, arguing that restricting the use of rat poisons would make it costlier for homeowners to deal with infestations, especially if they are forced to hire licensed professionals. 
“If it’s that bad, no one should be using it,” said state Rep. Juan Candelaria, D-New Haven. 
Ultimately, the legislation passed the House by a relatively lopsided 115 to 33 vote. As of Wednesday, it was awaiting Gov. Ned Lamont’s signature.
Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney for Save the Sound, noted that S.B. 9 gained the support of more than two dozen Republicans in the House despite many having voted against previous climate-related measures.
“These initiatives should be bipartisan, because the impacts affect everybody, equally, across the political spectrum,” Rothenberger said. “So hopefully — maybe naively, but hopefully — what we saw last night, can provide a foundation for more cooperation on both sides of the aisle to address real solutions.”
With the passage of both bills through the House and Senate chambers on Wednesday afternoon, action began to flow in quick succession on a number of other measures dealing with agriculture, Sunday hunting and the management of Connecticut’s growing population of black bears.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0604_SR_SessionLastDay_049-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 17:10:49.354044

Steve Frisbie (R-Battle Creek) testifies before the House Energy Committee on June 3, 2025. | ScreenshotLocal control and energy choice issues were once again up for discussion in the Michigan Legislature this week as a Republican representative made his case on a proposal centered around natural gas-powered appliances.
The legislation came from Rep. Steve Frisbie (R-Battle Creek), who testified Tuesday before the House Energy Committee.
Frisbie’s House Bill 4486, he said, inspired by attempts to ban natural gas connections and appliances in new homes, pointing to a 2023 proposal in Ann Arbor urging city leaders to ban gas service in new housing builds with limited exceptions.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIn response, House Bill 4486 would prevent municipalities from adopting or enforcing ordinances, policies or resolutions that ban the use of natural gas in their locality, or block the installation of natural gas infrastructure, voiding any ordinance that violates this law.
“This legislation is a reflection of personal freedoms,” Frisbie said. “Who are we to tell a family how they can keep their families warm following an ice storm.” 
However, old arguments stemming from Republican’s opposition to legislative Democrat’s 2023 energy law changes quickly bubbled to the surface, as Rep. Julie Brixie (D-Meridian Township) asked Frisbie whether he believed in local control.
More than a year and a half ago, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer put her pen to legislation aimed at expanding clean energy in Michigan, with one set of bills granting the state’s energy regulator the authority to approve permits for large-scale renewable energy and battery storage projects, which was previously exclusive to local governments.
Republicans viewed the change as an incursion, ripping zoning control away from Michigan communities to force wind and solar on localities who had opposed those resources.
Earlier this year, members of the Republican-led House voted on party lines to repeal the change, with Senate Republicans unveiling their own effort to eliminate the law in late May. However, neither proposal is likely to make it through the Democratic-led Senate.
While multiple Democratic members of the House Energy Committee pressed Frisbie on how his bill would impact infrastructure and interact with farmland preservation ordinances, Frisbie said the policy “has nothing to do with gas infrastructure.”
“It has to do with appliances and a choice of being able to use gas versus electric as a user,” Frisbie said. “It has nothing to do with infrastructure.”
Courtney Brady, the Midwest deputy director for Evergreen Action, which advocates for Climate Action in several states, called the scope and the motivation of the bill confusing, telling Michigan Advance “the fact that the bill is so open ended is concerning.”
Although there are incentives in the state to help Michiganders upgrade to energy-efficient electrical appliances, Brady said Michigan localities aren’t looking to ban natural gas, calling the bill a “false solution in search of a problem.”
“These are messaging attempts,” she said. “They’re distractions.”
Prior to the introduction of Frisbie’s legislation, Sen. Joe Bellino (R-Monroe) introduced a nearly identical policy in the Democratic-led Senate, Senate Bill 275.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a set of dramatic changes to state ethics laws Wednesday that will make it much more difficult to charge elected officials and public employees with misconduct. 

House Bill 674 alters the process the state ethics board used to bring charges against Gov. Jeff Landry two years ago that are still pending.
Landry’s charges won’t be affected by the legislation, but he pushed for the bill and is expected to let it pass into law. The governor’s personal attorney, Stephen Gelé, helped craft the language contained in it.
Beyond making it harder to bring ethics charges, the legislation also loosens limits on elected officials’ and state employees’ state travel, weakens restrictions on government contracts with public servants and their families, and reduces requirements for elected officials and political candidates’ disclosure of financial interests.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, said it is a reaction to the ethics board’s overzealous enforcement that has frustrated officials in both parties. The anger toward the board was reflected in lawmakers’ overwhelming support of the bill. 

The Louisiana Senate and House voted 34-2 and 92-1, respectively, for the ethics overhaul this week. 
Yet ethics board members expressed concerns about the bill during its May meeting. Its top staff member, Ethics Administrator David Bordelon, described it as “skewing” the ethics investigation process in favor of the person accused of wrongdoing. 
The state’s preeminent government watchdog group, the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana (PAR), also vociferously opposed the legislation.

“This is designed to make sure we don’t have ethics investigations,” PAR President Steven Procopio told lawmakers at a hearing last week.

(Ormat press photo)Three proposed geothermal projects in Nevada will be among the first fast-tracked under the Trump administration’s new streamlined environmental review process, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced last week.
Under the new process hailed by Interior Secretary Doug Burhum in April, environmental assessments for small-scale projects will be limited to just 14 days — a sharp contrast to the typical year or more. Full environmental impact statements for more complex projects, which usually take up to 2 years, will now be finalized in just 28 days.
During his first month in office President Donald Trump proclaimed an “energy emergency” as grounds for fast-tracking lengthy environmental reviews and permitting processes for energy projects deemed critical to national security.
Conservation groups have blasted what they see as a circumvention of bedrock environmental laws on the basis of Trump decreeing an “emergency.”
But Burgum, in a statement, said  “by cutting red tape and advancing President Trump’s American Energy Dominance agenda, we’re fast-tracking reliable energy projects while strengthening national security and supporting American workers.”
Environmental assessments for the three Nevada projects — all proposed by Ormat Nevada — will be completed within a 14 day timeframe, according to Interior’s May 29 statement.
Feds green-light uranium mine in Utah, first project approved under Trump’s energy declaration

Those projects include the Diamond Flat Geothermal Project near Fallon; the McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project in Lander County; and the Pinto Geothermal Project along the Oregon-Nevada border.
Geothermal is one the few renewable energy sources the Trump administration is promoting as part of its “American Energy Dominance” plan.
U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the CEO of the oilfield services firm Liberty Energy, has called for expanding geothermal energy, citing its potential to enhance energy security and stabilize electricity prices.
During a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month, Wright told Nevada Rep. Susie Lee he is “bullish on the future of geothermal.”
“Permitting and a sober government is necessary to make that happen,” Wright said.
Under Wright’s leadership, Liberty Energy also invested millions in geothermal energy startup Fervo Energy. In 2023, Fervo Energy launched a geothermal pilot plant in Nevada in partnership with Google to power data centers.
Nevada generates is second only to California in geothermal electricity generation, , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Nevada produces about 26% of total geothermal energy in the nation, and has the potential to grow.
Last month, the U.S. Geological Survey released a report that said geothermal energy in the Great Basin — which covers most of Nevada — could produce electricity equivalent to 10% of the current U.S. power supply.
Geothermal currently accounts for less than 1% of U.S. electricity generation, according to the EIA.
In the last five years, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has put up more than 700,000 acres of land in Nevada to lease for geothermal.
In a press release, USGS said commercial-scale geothermal development will largely depend on the “successful application of evolving and emerging technologies.”
Geothermal and sage grouse
Conservation groups argued the announcement is the latest effort by the Trump administration to target the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires the federal government to conduct an indepth environmental review before moving forward with infrastructure projects.
“We support geothermal energy as a part of our clean energy mix, but like any projects on public lands these developments could cause environmental impacts,” said Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity in a statement. “Projects like these need full and complete environmental reviews to ensure they don’t unduly harm endangered species or public lands resources.”
While geothermal is a more environmentally sound alternative to traditional power sources like coal and natural gas, there are still environmental risks that require careful review.
A recent study published in the journal Biological Conservation found that the presence of geothermal plants “adversely affected” greater sage-grouse populations within sagebrush ecosystems. The study found that the presence of geothermal infrastructure near sage-grouse breeding grounds decreased nest survival.
The study specifically reviewed the impact of Nevada’s McGinness Hills Geothermal Development, the largest geothermal complex in Nevada and the fourth largest in the United States.
The first McGinness Hills geothermal plant was established in July, 2012 and has been producing renewable power since.
Throughout its construction and expansion, the McGinness Hills Geothermal Development has attracted pushback due to its impact on sage-grouse.
In 2017, the Nevada Department of Wildlife wrote a letter to the BLM after the agency documented the downward trend of seven of eleven breeding sites near the McGinness Hills Geothermal Development.
In the letter the agency accused Ormat of failing to monitor and mitigate the impact of the power plant on sage-grouse habitat, as required under the project approval.
If the McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project is approved under the new streamlined environmental review process, it would expand three geothermal power plants by adding new wells, heat exchangers, cooling fans, and a 15 megawatt solar photovoltaic field.
Other Ormat geothermal energy projects have faced controversy and pushback in Nevada.
In 2023, a planned geothermal project by Ormat was sent back to square one after federal land managers decided to reexamine the project’s approval following the listing of a small rare toad living in adjacent springs as endangered.
Another planned Ormat geothermal project near Gerlach, Nevada was thrown out by the Washoe County Board of County Commissioners in 2023 after locals fiercely opposed the project.

Ellison and his colleagues have engaged in more than two dozen lawsuits against Trump administration actions in the first five months of the president’s second term. The AGs, including Colorado’s Phil Weiser, have sued over cuts to federal agencies, tariffs, DOGE’s access to government data, attempts to end birthright citizenship, and more.
Here are the legal actions Colorado has taken against Trump administration

They’ve also toured blue states to tout their accomplishments and listen to voters’ concerns.
The stakes are high, Ellison said: the fate of multi-racial democracy.
Ellison, who served for a dozen years in Congress representing Minnesota’s Minneapolis-based 5th District, said the states are a sovereign bulwark against federal power grabs.
The Democratic attorneys general are not only fighting a Republican-controlled executive branch, but also a conservative majority on the U.S Supreme Court. In Ellison’s view, recent decisions by the Roberts court — particularly in 303 Creative v. Elenis, in which the court ruled that a Colorado business owner could not be obligated to serve a gay couple — signify that the country is moving towards legal segregation.
“We are a whisper away from Jim Crow,” Ellison said. He called the 303 Creative decision “Jim Crow for gay people.”
Still, Ellison was upbeat, celebrating the AGs string of victories and predicting that even conservative Supreme Court justices will resist the Trump administration’s attack on the rule of law and the institution of the court itself.
The Democratic AGs may benefit from a weakened Department of Justice under Trump, Ellison said. The agency that defends the federal government in court is hemorrhaging longtime staff attorneys, through both firings and resignations.
Ellison emphasized that many of the policies enacted by Trump in his first months in office would be legal if they were passed by Congress. Instead, the president is running the country through “edict” and “proclamation,” Ellison said.
“Our democracy is not perfect,” Ellison said, “but you will absolutely miss it when it’s gone, and Trump has given you a glimpse of that.”

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the House district maps created by the Republican-controlled state Legislature in 2020 are not illegal, despite allegations made by the cities of Dover and Rochester and a number of residents from throughout New Hampshire.
In 2022, Dover, Rochester, and 10 residents filed a lawsuit against the State of New Hampshire and Secretary of State David Scanlan alleging that the state’s maps violated the New Hampshire Constitution. They argued that the constitution requires Dover Ward 4, Rochester Ward 5, New Ipswich, Wilton, Hooksett, Lee, Barrington, and several other towns to have their own state House districts because their populations are large enough to warrant them. The maps currently in use do not give those wards and towns their own districts. They also alleged the map’s population configuration deviates more than 10%, which is a violation of the 14th Amendment’s one-person-one-vote requirement. They ask the court to forbid the state from using the maps and to ostensibly fix them. They provided a map they deemed to be more legal.
In 2024, a trial court in Strafford County ruled against Dover and Rochester, agreeing with the state and Scanlan that creating maps where every city, town, or ward with the necessary population had their own districts would be impossible to accomplish. It also ruled previous case law determined that presumptive violations of the one-person-one-vote requirement may be justified by efforts to make districts compact, respect municipal boundaries, preserve the cores of prior districts, and avoid contests between incumbent representatives. Citing a previous court decision, the court declared that “a legislatively enacted redistricting plan ‘is not unconstitutional simply because some ‘resourceful mind’ has come up with a better one.’”
Dover, Rochester, and the rest of the plaintiffs promptly appealed the ruling and the state Supreme Court considered the case. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that because they did not sufficiently show that the Legislature had “no rational or legitimate basis” to enact the map, they denied the appeal.
“We are pleased that the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the state’s redistricting plan for the State House of Representatives,” Attorney General John Formella, who represented the state, said in a statement Wednesday. “Today’s decision reaffirms the Court’s prior precedent recognizing the Legislature’s broad discretion in the area of redistricting and recognizes that the Legislature must balance complex constitutional requirements when determining the most appropriate map. We are delighted that the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court’s finding that the Legislature acted within its constitutional authority, and I thank our litigation and appeals teams for their excellent work in achieving this important outcome.”
Jennifer Perez, Dover’s deputy city attorney wrote in an email to the Bulletin, “We are disappointed in the result but respect the Court’s determination.” Officials from Rochester did not immediately respond to the Bulletin’s requests for comment.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Supreme-Court1-1024x646.jpeg,,,2025-06-04 17:10:49.354044

New Mexico State Police officers responded to the Northeastern New Mexico Correctional Facility in Clayton at 2 a.m. on May 14, according to a spokesperson for the agency.
A spokesperson for the New Mexico Corrections Department confirmed that a person incarcerated at the prison died that morning; a State Police spokesperson identified the deceased as Eduardo Merino.
Corrections Department spokesperson Brittany Roembach told Source NM in an email that NENMCF Warden John Beaird informed Merino’s family about his death at 3:11 a.m. on May 14. Roembach said the department is investigating the death.
Source NM has filed a public records request with the Office of the Medical Investigator for any reports on Merino’s death.
Merino’s cause of death remains unknown. According to his obituary, he died “unexpectedly.” The Atrisco High School graduate and father of one was 31 years old.
Through a lawyer, Merino’s fiance Nicole Yazzie on May 16 filed a petition in Second Judicial District Court in Albuquerque, asking the court to appoint her as the representative of his estate “for the purpose of investigating and potentially prosecuting a wrongful-death suit.”
The court assigned the case to Judge Nancy Franchini. There have been no developments in the case since then, court records show.
A voicemail and an email seeking comment from the lawyer representing Yazzie, Carter Harrison, were not returned as of Wednesday.

The day-to-day functions of municipal government often don’t involve partisan policy decisions. But local elections can gauge voters’ moods before congressional midterms next year and the 2027 statewide election for governor. 
The election results as of Wednesday afternoon are not official because local election workers will still process mail-in absentee votes for five business days after the election and process affidavit ballots.
The unofficial and incomplete results of some Mississippi mayoral races on Tuesday:
Gulfport 
In one of the most hotly contested municipal elections this year, Republican Hugh Keating defeated Democrat Sonya Williams Barnes. 
Keating, an attorney, led Barnes, a former state representative, by roughly 1,110 votes in a race that saw relatively high turnout, according to the Sun Herald. The election drew several prominent national figures to the coastal town, such as U.S. Sen. Tim Scott and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. 
Toward the end of the campaign, the two campaigns accused the other of skirting election laws. Republicans alleged that a group close to the Barnes campaign was offering meal vouchers to people who voted by absentee ballot, but Barnes denied any affiliation with the organization. 
Democrats then cried foul when Rick Carter, a managing partner of Island View Casino, distributed a letter to his employees encouraging them to vote for Keating. 
For years, Democratic candidates have attempted to make inroads to break up the GOP’s hold on the Gulf Coast. Polling leading up to the election showed the two candidates were close 
Despite Barnes’ loss, Cheikh Taylor, chairman of the state Democratic Party, praised the former legislator for proving Democrats can be competitive in south Mississippi. 
Jackson 
Longtime state Sen. John Horhn easily won the election to lead Mississippi’s capital city by defeating the Republican nominee and several independent candidates. 
Horhn’s general election victory was widely expected after he defeated incumbent Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba in the Democratic primary in April. The primary has historically decided who will go on to win the general election. 
Vicksburg 
George Flaggs Jr., a former state legislator who’s served as Vicksburg’s mayor for more than a decade, appears to have been defeated by Democrat Willis Thompson.  
Flaggs, an independent, trailed his Democratic opponent by 61 votes, according to the Vicksburg Post. 
Vicksburg City Clerk Deborah Kaiser-Nickson told the Vicksburg Post that results will remain unofficial until 111 affidavits are counted, along with any mail-in votes. 
Brookhaven 
Incumbent Brookhaven Mayor Joe Cox, a Republican, appears to have lost a close race to Democratic challenger Larry Jointer in Tuesday’s election, with Jointer claiming victory by a margin of 37 votes, according to the Daily Leader. 
Jointer would be the city’s first Black mayor. 
Greenwood 
Incumbent Independent Mayor Carolyn McAdams lost to Democrat Kenderick Cox, who garnered around 53 percent of the vote, according to the Greenwood Commonwealth. 
Clarksdale 
State Rep. Orlando Paden won the mayor’s race and will replace outgoing two-term Mayor Chuck Espy, who did not run for re-election. Paden defeated two independent candidates.
Horn Lake 
Democrat Jimmy Stokes defeated his Republican opponent, Danny Klein. The current mayor, Allen Latimer, did not run for reelection.
According to the Commercial Appeal, just one seat on the city’s Board of Aldermen is currently held by a Democrat. 
Now the Democrats flipped the script. A Democrat will take office as the new mayor, and Republicans secured just two seats on the board of aldermen. 
Meridian 
Former Mayor Percy Bland, a Democrat, will return to City Hall in Meridian after losing his re-election bid four years ago. 
Bland won back the mayor’s seat Tuesday over Independent candidate Jimmy Copeland by less than 100 votes, according to the Meridian Star.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/03125012/Voting-Tuesday-4.jpg,,,2025-06-04 17:10:49.354044

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster nixed only $10,000 of the state’s $14.7 billion state spending plan for 2025-26, marking the smallest sum a governor’s struck from the budget in over a quarter century.
“It’s a good budget,” McMaster told reporters Wednesday. “It’s one of the best. That’s why I’ve only got a handful of vetoes.”
Only one of McMaster’s 11 vetoes involved actual dollars.
The rest struck clauses directing what agencies can — or must — do with their allocations. That includes one that would have required reservations to visit a new state park and another that would have allowed the state’s poorest school districts to contract with private security in place of school-based officers employed by the local sheriff of police department.
Most of the clauses McMaster vetoed were unnecessary or duplicative, he wrote in a letter to legislators explaining his decisions.
The $10,000 he nixed would have gone toward reviewing the efficiency of certain state agencies, which McMaster wrote replicated existing programs meant to oversee agencies.
In previous years, McMaster’s budget vetoes focused primarily on so-called earmarks — spending on local projects requested by legislators rather than the agencies the money’s funneled through. But the chambers’ chief budget writers announced a moratorium this year on earmarks.
With so little removed, it’s unlikely legislators will return before the budget goes into effect July 1 to override any of the vetoes.
Instead of detailing the reasons for his few vetoes, McMaster praised legislators for including so many of his priorities in their spending plan, including raises in the minimum pay for teachers, funding an officer in every public school, another year of frozen college tuition, and workforce training programs.
All told, about 80% of McMaster’s recommendations ended up in the budget, he said.
That doesn’t mean legislators copied his recommended amounts. For example, he proposed a $3,000 boost in teachers’ minimum pay. The Legislature approved half that.
But the Republican governor has certainly had greater success with his budget recommendations than his predecessors, largely because McMaster meets with GOP leaders as his proposal’s being created.
McMaster said lawmakers in the meetings remain open-minded and communicative.
“It works,” McMaster said. “Works every time.”
Earmarks
Legislative budget writers emphasized repeatedly that this year’s budget includes no funding for pet projects in legislators’ districts.
To be sure of that, McMaster plans to issue an executive order requiring state agencies that receive vaguely worded directions on how to spend money to seek specifics before doling it out, he said.
For years, legislators hid earmarks in vaguely worded chunks of the budget. They would then direct state agencies to send the money where legislators wanted it. Three years ago, at McMaster’s request, legislators began disclosing where the money was going, including paperwork justifying the spending.
“The danger is just the secrecy,” McMaster said of earmarks. “It’s the taxpayers’ money, and the taxpayers need to be able to know where it’s going, why it’s going, who’s going to spend it, how much is going to be spent.”
If any agencies this year or in future budgets receive special instructions on how to spend money outside the norm, they must get a written request from a legislator verifying the recipient exists and is in good standing, what the money is for, why the money is needed, other funding for the project and whether the state has funded the same or similar projects in the past, McMaster wrote.
“As I have stated before, without sufficient context, description, justification and other relevant information regarding the project and how the recipient intends to spend the funds, the public cannot evaluate an appropriation’s merit,” McMaster wrote. “Clearly, no matter how meritorious an appropriation may be, the public has a right to know exactly how their money is being spent.”
Pine Island
Visitors to a new state park set to open this year won’t have to make reservations after McMaster vetoed that rule from the state budget this year.
When a new state park on Lexington County’s Pine Island opens this fall, a clause included in legislators’ budget proposal would have required visitors schedule appointments.
Neighbors who live near the 27-acre park-to-be have raised concerns about increased traffic on roads built when the island was still limited to Dominion Energy workers and their families. The state Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism has assured neighbors it will work with local law enforcement to control traffic.
Legislators don’t yet know that traffic will be enough of an issue to require dedicated appointments, McMaster wrote in his veto letter.
“In addition, this proviso may be interpreted as an effort to limit access to the lakefront amenities available for recreation at our state’s newest park,” the letter continued.
Some other state parks offer reservations for guaranteed parking spots during busy times, such as over the summer, on weekends or during holidays. Jones Gap State Park, for instance, requires online reservations for guaranteed entry during mornings on weekends and holidays, and Huntington Beach State Park offers online reservations between May and September.
Legislative pay raises
One controversial provision that McMaster allowed to remain was a pay increase for legislators.
Under a clause included in the budget, a monthly stipend meant to pay for costs incurred within a legislator’s district will go from $1,000 to $2,500. Because legislators aren’t required to report how the money is spent, that amounts to an $18,000 annual raise for each legislator.
Legislators also receive a $10,400 annual salary and a daily stipend of $240 meant to cover the cost of food and lodging while the Legislature’s in session.
With recent inflation, the $1,000 per month, put in place in 1995, was no longer enough to support the cost of traveling around the district and helping constituents, supporters of the raise said.
“I’m relying on the good faith of our Legislature,” McMaster said. “They say it’s going up that much. They are the ones that are trying to pay those expenses.”
Sen. Wes Climer, R-Rock Hill, threatened to sue if McMaster didn’t veto the measure. Dick Harpootlian, a former senator and Columbia attorney, offered his legal services in that case, and Columbia attorney John Crangle said in a letter urging McMaster to veto the law that he
“If there’s a legal challenge, then so be it,” McMaster said. “We’ll see if it works out.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2753-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-04 17:10:49.354044

U.S. authorities charged him with disclosing state secrets and demanded his extradition to the U.S. Assange took refuge inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London and spent a dozen years first inside the embassy and later jailed in the U.K.’s high security Belmarsh Prison. He was released last year after pleading guilty to a single charge under the Espionage Act and now lives in Australia.Last week, Julian Assange returned to the international stage, walking the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival alongside Vermont filmmaker Eugene Jarecki.

You can hear the full conversation at the audio link at the top of this article:David GoodmanYou are speaking to me from Berlin. Why are you there?Eugene Jarecki The story of why we are in Berlin is the story of our time. I came to Berlin some years ago to make this new film, and coming to Berlin is no small matter for me because my father fled Berlin in 1939 at the age of six at the last possible moment you could get out of Germany in the prelude to the Holocaust and World War II. My father fled to America to go to a freer country. And I often note what a tragic descent it represents in America for us to have gotten to a point where his son, in order to make a project which is rather politically sensitive, had to leave the country that he fled to — the supposedly freer America — to go back to modern day Germany. Why? Because the protections for journalists and truth seekers like myself, documentary makers and others who want the world to know what is happening to us all and what matters to us all, life here is protected for such people in a way that is no longer true in America. It’s a sad irony.David Goodman Let’s go into the subject of your film. Who is Julian Assange?Eugene Jarecki Julian Assange is a tall Australian albino-haired man, characterized on Saturday Night Live as Dr. Evil, because he was a computer visionary who at the dawn of the Internet age in the early 2000s saw something that no one else had seen. And out of that vision that he had he built something called WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks was a simple idea. Prior to WikiLeaks, people who wanted to tell the world what their organization was doing, a so-called whistleblower, had to take great risks to tell the world what their organization might have been doing, whether they were a polluter or a corrupt government, corrupting elections, or dirty little secrets about war and killing. What Julian Assange discovered was that the digital age, which was going to give enormous new powers to governments and corporations, also had a certain promise for individuals. All WikiLeaks was was an encrypted dropbox that would allow a whistleblower to tell the world the thing they needed to know and not have to risk life and limb for it. This quickly led to the most significant leak of military and diplomatic documents in US history, which came because of single Army private, Chelsea Manning, who came into possession of a vast amount of secret material which revealed war crimes committed by America. That immediately made Julian Assange and WikiLeaks public enemy number one for America for having given the whistleblower that protective space in which to release that material.David Goodman Your film includes some of what Chelsea Manning released. What did it show?Eugene Jarecki What Chelsea Manning shared with WikiLeaks and what WikiLeaks then released to the world came to be known as the Collateral Murder video. It showed US helicopters firing on Iraqi civilians and journalists. Two journalists from Reuters were killed when helicopters fired on a group of men chatting on a sidewalk in Baghdad. That extraordinary act of killing and brutality was suddenly on every television screen in the world, and it happened because a whistleblower shared it with an organization. It was at that moment that an international campaign run by the United States to destroy WikiLeaks and the person of Julian Assange began.David Goodman When did you meet Julian Assange?Eugene Jarecki It was about 10 days ago that Julian Assange suddenly joined us at the Cannes Film Festival, a free man walking the red carpet in Cannes having emerged triumphant over the US government despite their 15 year campaign to destroy him. And the story of how Julian Assange got free and won his battle against the US government in one of the most definitive episodes for the defense of press freedom in history is part of what we tell in the film. It’s also a story that everyone needs to know, because it’s true that fights for press freedom, fights for the human rights that we all hold dear, can be won. We live at a time where most fights look unwinnable, partly because those in power are in the business of scaring us. They’re in the business of showing us these dreadful ICE videos where the effectively SS that Trump has turned ICE into is grabbing people in broad daylight off the street, off of aircraft, out of their places of work, places of worship, places of education, and scaring us all into silence. The story of Julian Assange, who warned us that we were headed for that world and they then tried to destroy him, is a story of how what Margaret Mead said is true: “Never doubt that a small group of people properly organized can change the world. Indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.”Well Julian Assange and his team of young dreamer bandits, pirates working at WikiLeaks and wanting the public to know the truth, they won. The only charge left to which Mr. Assange had to plead guilty was journalism. The charge that Julian Assange had to admit he was guilty of was the act of doing something protected by the First Amendment. It shines an incredibly dark light on the way the US Espionage Act is being used to damage the US Constitution and to do things to people that the Constitution was created to protect them from having done to them.David Goodman Tell us the meaning of the title, “The Six Billion Dollar Man.” And by the way, I really love the takeoff on “The Six Million Dollar Man,” a TV series that I loved in the 1970s.Eugene Jarecki Me too. The movie is called “The Six Billion Dollar Man” because $6 billion is what the United States spent to bribe the country of Ecuador to torture Julian Assange. The goal was to make Ecuador, which had been giving Assange asylum, stop doing so, and make his life so miserable inside the embassy by shattering his human rights, safety and care inside the embassy that he would leave of his own volition so that US and British officials could apprehend him and put him on trial. For the richest country in the world to get one man, the bounty was $6 billion. And we and we have the receipts.David Goodman In 2016 Democrats accused Assange of aiding Donald Trump by being the conduit for Hillary Clinton’s hacked emails, which many people believe was part of a Russian operation. Democrats have vilified him. How do you respond to that?Eugene Jarecki I looked very closely at this because it troubled me as well, and I wanted to get at the heart of it. We found no evidence at all that links WikiLeaks with any kind of Russian operation. The only place we found that link is in the mouths of people in the Democratic Party, constantly saying it over and over again to explain away why they had lost an election. And what we did see was what WikiLeaks did release: evidence of what the Democratic National Committee was doing to destroy the candidacy of Bernie Sanders, who was ahead of Hillary Clinton in the polls. The stripping of democratic rights away from the supporters of Bernie Sanders is what WikiLeaks revealed, full stop. This was a very convenient smear campaign.David Goodman No link to Russia.Eugene Jarecki We found no evidence of any link. And by the way, no news organization has. Everybody in the world tried to find evidence that would link WikiLeaks to Russia, and none has come. Our movie also reveals is that though the US government for years said that WikiLeaks had “blood on its hands” for having released military and diplomatic documents that Chelsea Manning had provided to WikiLeaks, the US government conceded that no single person on the planet was found by them to have been hurt in any way in connection with any WikiLeaks release.David Goodman Why is this movie important now?Eugene Jarecki We’re living at a time with fascism on the rise all over the world, a crackdown on truth telling by those in power who do not find the truth convenient. They want to destroy the world all around us for profit and have us not know what’s happening. And Mr. Assange was the sort of canary in the coal mine of all this. These are people who don’t believe in democracy. And by these are people, I mean successive administrations of US policy makers. What they fear most is an informed public. Because what they’re doing behind the scenes, the dirty little business of how politics and corporate power intersect at the expense of all of us, they don’t want us to know. And so when someone comes along who threatens to expose that as Julian Assange, we see the clampdown. We saw it against Mr. Assange. We saw it in the killing of the journalists in the video that Mr. Assange released. We saw it throughout the diplomatic cables, in the manipulation of affairs of state all over the world, America doing business with dictatorships, America propping up human rights-abusing regimes. We saw so much crime and then we saw the US try to shoot the messenger. The fact that they failed and that he’s still walking is really a burnt stick in their eye.We now have to understand that the game is on, because they are ratcheting up that use of force against all of us even higher than in the days of Mr. Assange. They’re cracking down on journalists in a way that he was just the precedent for. But his victory tells us that it can be fought by small groups of people working together to not allow these kind of trespasses to happen. When you see people on the street crowding around the people who are being abducted, kidnapped, illegally taken by the SS that Mr. Trump has created known as ICE, you’re watching community effort at work. It might not work the first time or the second time, but it grows. And before long, they are at war with the people themselves, and that’s ultimately a winning game for the people. The people win when they organize against the abuse of few.David Goodman You have made films about Ronald Reagan, Henry Kissinger, exploring why we fight, Elvis Presley, and now Julian Assange. What is the through line that connects your work?Eugene Jarecki I’m a true believer in what they told me America was about. It’s the most it’s the most important social experiment in the last half millennium. My parents fled persecution in Europe to come to that promise in America. When I grew up to see that promise violated successively and the way that industrial capitalism has hijacked the American dream, it became the cause of my life to protect democracy from capitalism. I think Julian Assange was a glimmer of hope for whistleblowers and for all of us in the public who have the right to know what’s happening in our world, and the clamp down on him has exploded to be a clamp down on all information available to the public and on all truth seeking. And as such, he has more to say to our time than anyone I can imagine. That truth is that democratic glimmer that I care about and that I was taught to care about as a child, and I’ll fight for that glimmer till I’m dead.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Conversation: Award-winning filmmaker Eugene Jarecki on Julian Assange, WikiLeaks and the global crackdown on truth.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Eugene-Jarecki-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 17:10:49.354044

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)When President Donald Trump’s performance in the polls in 2024 signaled a possible re-election, Keith Ellison and fellow Democratic attorneys general read Project 2025 and started getting ready, especially when Trump hired the key author of the planning document after his election.
They divided the documents into sections and marshaled their staff lawyers to be ready with lawsuits.
So when Russell Vought and the Office of Management and Budget and froze the distribution of certain federal funds — as outlined in Project 2025 — Ellison and other the Democratic AGs were ready.
They sued over the funding freeze the next day.
“They were not hiding the ball,” Ellison said in a wide-ranging interview with States Newsroom in Minneapolis Wednesday.
Ellison and his colleagues have engaged in more than two dozen lawsuits against Trump administration actions in the first five months of the president’s second term. The AGs have sued over cuts to federal agencies, tariffs, DOGE’s access to government data, attempts to end birthright citizenship, and more.

They’ve also toured blue states to tout their accomplishments and listen to voters’ concerns.
The stakes are high, Ellison said: the fate of multi-racial democracy.
Ellison, who served for a dozen years in Congress representing Minnesota’s Minneapolis-based 5th District, said the states are a sovereign bulwark against federal power grabs.
The Democratic attorneys general are not only fighting a Republican-controlled executive branch, but also a conservative majority on the U.S Supreme Court. In Ellison’s view, recent decisions by the Roberts court — particularly in 303 Creative v. Elenis, in which the court ruled that a business owner could not be obligated to serve a gay couple — signify that the country is moving towards legal segregation.
“We are a whisper away from Jim Crow,” Ellison said.
Still, Ellison was upbeat, celebrating the AGs string of victories and predicting that even conservative Supreme Court justices will resist the Trump administration’s attack on the rule of law and the institution of the court itself.
The Democratic AGs may benefit from a weakened Department of Justice under Trump, Ellison said. The agency that defends the federal government in court is hemorrhaging longtime staff attorneys, through both firings and resignations.
Ellison emphasized that many of the policies enacted by Trump in his first months in office would be legal if they were passed by Congress. Instead, the president is running the country through “edict” and “proclamation,” Ellison said.
“Our democracy is not perfect,” Ellison said, “but you will absolutely miss it when it’s gone, and Trump has given you a glimpse of that.”

Andy Beshear has signed an executive order to establish an advisory committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky. 
Beshear, a Democrat, has long supported implementing universal pre-K statewide. He again called on Republicans in the state legislature supermajority to fund such initiatives in his State of the Commonwealth Address earlier this year. However, top Republicans said their caucuses don’t have a consensus on the matter. 
The executive order creates the Team Kentucky Pre-K for All Advisory Committee with 28 members representing experience in business, workforce development and education. Jamie Link, the secretary of the Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet is the chair of the committee. Other members include Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher, Council on Postsecondary Education President Aaron Thompson and former state lawmakers, both Democratic and Republican.
Beshear announced the “Pre-K for All” initiative with local leaders in Louisville Wednesday. The city launched a five-year plan for universal pre-K last year. The governor emphasized a need to offer all Kentucky 4-year-olds pre-K programs to increase kindergarten readiness.
““We are here, not as Democrats or Republicans, not as part of the right or the left,” Beshear said in a statement. “Instead, we are here as parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, educators and business leaders. We are here because we want the best for our Kentucky kids, the best for our Kentucky parents and caregivers, and we want to build and maintain the best workforce in America.”
The Kentucky Center for Statistics says that 53.8% of Kentucky children are not prepared for kindergarten on the first day of school. 
Beshear also said that 18 states, including Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia and West Virginia, offer pre-K access to 4-year-olds — further underscoring that he views the issue as nonpartisan. 
The advisory committee will hold public meetings throughout Kentucky and create a report on feedback heard by Oct. 15. That’s a few weeks ahead of the beginning of the 2026 legislative session, which is when lawmakers will begin debating the next two-year state budget.

Gov. JB Pritzker will have hundreds of bills to review after lawmakers concluded their spring session, including measures protecting press freedoms and baby food, as well as creating a state public defender’s office.

Lawmakers voted along party lines Saturday to pass House Bill 3363, which would create the “Office of State Public Defender” that would primarily be responsible for providing public defender offices around the state with more resources.

It also reforms how public defenders would be appointed by requiring a local nominating committee to appoint or remove public defenders, which is designed to give the public defenders more independence from the judiciary.

“Every Illinoisan deserves a strong defense, no matter their income,” bill sponsor Sen. Robert Peters, D-Chicago, said in a statement. “Instating this new system would ensure real help reaches people who have been left behind in conversations about criminal justice reform for far too long.”

Public defender offices throughout the state have been starved for resources, with some defense attorneys at public defender offices handling hundreds of cases at a time. Supporters of the legislation say the main goal of the office, at least initially, will be to provide more comprehensive state resources to public defender offices, which now are typically subject to the limitations of county budgets.

Limited data shows all Illinois counties need more public defenders. According to an analysis of county public defender budgets compiled by Northwestern University, no Illinois counties have “sufficient” staffing in public defender offices.

State lawmakers appropriated $10 million for county public defense services in the FY26 budget and have appropriated as much each year since 2023. If signed by the governor, Peters’ legislation won’t fully take effect until 2027.

Safer baby food

Lawmakers in both chambers unanimously passed Senate Bill 73, which bans the sale and distribution of baby food in Illinois that contains levels of toxic elements – including arsenic, cadmium, lead or mercury – that surpasses the limits set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The bill now only needs a signature from the governor to become law.

Under SB73, any manufacturer selling baby food in Illinois would be required to test a sample of their product monthly to ensure the levels of toxic elements contained in the product fall in line with the limits set by the FDA. The bill also gives the Illinois Department of Public Health the right to request and review manufacturers’ testing results and requires manufacturers to publish the levels of each toxic element in each of their products on the manufacturer’s website.

Manufacturers who sell products in Illinois would also have to print a QR code on the label of any baby food that contains toxic elements that are limited by the FDA. The QR would be required to direct consumers to the product’s testing information and FDA guidelines on “the health effects of the toxic element on children.”

The bill comes after a study published in 2019 by Healthy Babies Bright Futures, which found that 95% of 168 baby foods tested for toxic elements contained one or more contaminants. One in four of the baby foods tested in the study contained all four elements, with arsenic being found in 73% of the baby foods tested and lead in 94% of the products.

The study gained public traction after its publication, resulting in the creation and implementation of “Closer to Zero” – an FDA initiative that aims to reduce the percentage of toxic metals found in baby food to zero.

If signed by the governor, the bill will take effect on Jan. 1, 2026.

Press protections

Pritzker will also consider a measure to bolster news media protections against lawsuits.

Senate Bill 1181 explicitly adds news media as an entity protected under the state’s Citizen Participation Act, which prohibits “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPPs. It passed the House 75-38 and the Senate 47-10.

It was spurred by a recent state Supreme Court ruling that allowed a defamation suit filed by a former government employee against the Chicago Sun-Times to progress.

The Supreme Court’s ruling in that case differentiated “investigative” reporting from the paper’s coverage of a state inspector general’s investigation into the Illinois Property Tax Appeals Board’s executive director.

Lawyers from the Chicago Sun-Times sought to use the Citizen Protection Act to dismiss the executive director’s 2021 lawsuit against the paper, which contended it mischaracterized the inspector general’s investigation.

But the Supreme Court declined, ruling the paper’s coverage lacked any intent to elicit action or a solution from the government – which was needed to apply SLAPP protections – because the coverage was not investigative in nature.

“We are simply holding that the (Citizen Participation) Act specifically protects government participation and does not encompass all media reports on matters of public concern,” Justice David K. Overstreet wrote in the opinion.

SB 1181 directly addresses that sentiment. The bill states, “The press opining, reporting, or investigating matters of public concern is participating and communicating with the government,” meaning organizations doing so would be protected under the law if the bill is signed. It would apply to actions taken after Jan. 1, 2026.

The measure also provides that all legal proceedings in a case would be paused while a party’s Citizen Participation Act lawsuit motion progresses in court.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison condemned Tuesday’s militarized federal law enforcement action in Minneapolis, saying “it seemed like the point was to inflict terror and fear into the community.”
Dozens of armed federal agents from multiple agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, raided a Minneapolis taco restaurant Tuesday in what ICE said was a “groundbreaking operation” involving drug smuggling and human trafficking.
The raid was Minnesota’s first under President Donald Trump’s Homeland Security Task Force, which he established via executive order on the first day of his second term, according to a statement from ICE.
The operation inflamed tensions with residents in the Midtown neighborhood, which includes many Latino residents and which was rocked by protests and riots following the police murder of George Floyd in 2020.
“If they want to inflict fear, and they wanted to discourage cooperation, they achieved both those goals yesterday,” Ellison said Wednesday in an interview with States Newsroom.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the raid was not related to immigration enforcement, but “a criminal search warrant for drugs and money laundering.”
But information was sparse on the scene. Hundreds of immigrant rights activists and neighbors surrounded the restaurant, yelling at officers and attempting to block their armored vehicles. Many officers wore face coverings and camouflage fatigues, and some refused to identify which agency they were with.
Officers used chemical irritants and piercing sirens to disperse the crowd. No one was arrested during the raid, Frey said Tuesday.
Ellison said he was not informed of the raid before it happened, and that the raid was “way over the top in terms of resource allocation.”

Ellison’s remarks add to a chorus of condemnation among local officials who are concerned about the fate of immigrants in Minnesota. 
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty released a statement Wednesday morning saying across the country, “ICE is being deployed to terrorize people.”
“My singular focus is on the safety of the people who live here, and I want to be clear that ICE showing up alongside local law enforcement causes grievous and irreparable harm,” Moriarty said. 
DFL State Sen. Omar Fateh, who is running against Frey for Minneapolis mayor, said on social media that Minneapolis is a “‘sanctuary’ in name only.” 
“There is no circumstance in which MPD should cooperate with ICE,” Fateh wrote. “By labeling it in an investigation of ‘criminal activity,’ ICE visited fear into the heart of an immigrant neighborhood — and our communities were shaken.”
After Trump’s re-election, Frey promised that Minneapolis police would not assist with civil immigration enforcement. 
“The Minneapolis Police Department’s only role was assisting with crowd control and keeping the community safe as a large number of residents and bystanders had gathered at the scene,” Frey said Tuesday. “They have not been involved in anything related to immigration enforcement.”
Ellison said Wednesday that the state government also is not obligated to help federal agents locate and arrest immigrants.
Asked how the raid’s execution will impact his working relationship with federal agencies, Ellison said “it’s not that great now.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250603_0749-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-04 17:10:49.354044

(Photo by Karolina Wojtasik/HBO)From “The Gilded Age” to “Hocus Pocus 2,” Rhode Island has played a starring role in a growing number of TV shows, movies, commercials and theater productions.
So many, in fact, that the state unintentionally approved more tax credits to production companies for local spending than available state funding for the incentive program. 
The unexpected $3.2 million shortfall, which dates back to credits from productions completed in 2022, was recently revealed in a May 28 memo from Gov. Dan McKee to state lawmakers. McKee suggested dipping into state coffers in the upcoming fiscal 2026 budget to cover the retroactive overrun.
Not a welcome proposal as the Rhode Island General Assembly grapples with a projected $185 million deficit heading into the new fiscal year alongside potentially devastating federal funding cuts to major programs like Medicaid. But lawmakers may not have much choice — the 2005 law that created the motion picture tax credit program offers a three-year window for eligible productions to redeem approved credits, which are based on state taxes paid on workers’ wages and local goods and services. 
This is the final year for companies to redeem credits they were awarded in 2022 — the year of the inadvertent overspend.
“The production companies followed the rules,” Brian Daniels, director of the Rhode Island Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers during a presentation to the Senate Committee on Finance Tuesday night. “They didn’t do anything wrong. There’s not a lot of discretion here.”
The film incentive program is a perennial hot potato on Smith Hill; proponents insist that offering tax credits for up to 30% of local production costs boosts Rhode Island’s economy, creating jobs and incentivizing people to visit (and spend more money) to see the places where their favorite shows and films were created. Naysayers question whether the unquantifiable “indirect spend” from the program is actually enough to offset the initial upfront investment, also noting that more than half of jobs go to non-Rhode Island residents, as documented in multiple reports by the Rhode Island Office of Revenue Analysis.
The revenue office in a July 2024 report reiterated its prior conclusions that the state loses money on the program, with 9 cents in net general revenues for every dollar spent on tax credits from 2019-2021, and $3.19 in total economic output. The findings suggest the program is less beneficial than a 2021 study commissioned by the Greater Newport Chamber of Commerce, which touted a “multiplier effect” in which $1 invested in tax credits for locally filmed productions yielded $5.44 in economic activity for the state.
Yet even Feinberg, the program’s most stalwart defender, admits there are some problems with timing and accuracy of initial production cost projections. 
Feinberg helps market the Ocean State to production companies, relying on the tax credit program as a key incentive. He also gives first vetting to tax credit applications, sending an initial determination based on eligibility and projected local spending to the Rhode Island Division of Taxation. Lawmakers determine a maximum amount in each state budget plan for the program based on the preliminary estimates and introductory conversations— many of which never turn into actual productions eligible for state funding.
But it is only after taping finishes and a thorough audit by state tax officials that credits are awarded — often years after the initial estimates upon which state budget calculations are made.
Usually, the mismatch is not a problem. Costs, and therefore credit amounts, are almost always lower than initially estimated.
Until now, when final audits show the state gave out $33.2 million in tax credits to eight productions that wrapped in 2022 — exceeding the $30 million funding cap for that year.

Blame it on COVID
In 2022, pent-up post-COVID demand converged with a rush to finish filming in anticipation of writers’ and actors’ union strikes that happened in 2023 to create what Steven Feinberg, executive director for the Rhode Island Film and Television office, called the “perfect storm.” 
“This was an anomaly,” Feinberg said, speaking to lawmakers Tuesday. “I’ve been doing this for 20 years, and this has never happened.” 
Feinberg also noted the earlier-than-expected completion of an “Emmy-award winning,” show, referring to the second season of HBO’s “The Gilded Age.”
The hit TV series concluded filming its second season in Newport in October 2022, receiving $7.5 million in state tax credits based on more than $28.4 million in local production costs, according to program information submitted to state budget analysts at the May Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference.
A third season of “The Gilded Age” was taped in Newport in late 2024. Final production costs have not been submitted, but initial estimates predict a nearly $27 million spend, with a corresponding $8 million in tax credits.










This was an anomaly. I’ve been doing this for 20 years, and this has never happened. 


– Steven Feinberg, executive director of the Rhode Island Film and Television Office, on exceeding the state’s funding cap for motion picture tax credits in 2022


Of the $40 million set aside in 2023 for tax credits, $31 million remains, Daniels said. McKee’s proposed $14 billion fiscal 2026 budget would authorize up to $20 million more for the program in 2026.
Still, both Daniels and Feinberg acknowledged the need to address timing and accuracy of program awards. Feinberg said his office is working with the state taxation division to keep officials in the loop on potential changes to initial project estimates, while also considering how to tweak state regulations to better align budgets and awards.
Feinberg did not immediately respond to requests for more information Wednesday.
Senate Finance Chairman Lou DiPalma pointed out that if the overspend was uncovered after the legislative session ended on June 30, the consequences could have been worse.
“What would you do if we’re not here?” DiPalma said during the hearing. “Do you wait till January?”
He continued, “We’re fortunate it hasn’t manifested itself yet, but what we can do, we should do. What did we learn? We don’t want this to happen again.”
DiPalma’s concern over reporting discrepancies did not preclude him from a more lighthearted request of Feinberg.
“I still want to meet Danny DeVito,” DiPalma said. “When can that happen?”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson both remained noncommittal on the proposed funding adjustment in separate statements Wednesday. The additional money will be considered as part of budget deliberations, which are expected to be hammered out in the next few weeks ahead.

They divided the documents into sections and marshaled their staff lawyers to be ready with lawsuits.   
So when Russell Vought and the Office of Management and Budget and froze the distribution of certain federal funds — as outlined in Project 2025 — Ellison and other the Democratic AGs were ready. 
They sued over the funding freeze the next day. 
“They were not hiding the ball,” Ellison said in a wide-ranging interview with States Newsroom in Minneapolis Wednesday. 
Ellison and his colleagues have engaged in more than two dozen lawsuits against Trump administration actions in the first five months of the president’s second term. The AGs have sued over cuts to federal agencies, tariffs, DOGE’s access to government data, attempts to end birthright citizenship, and more. 
They’ve also toured blue states to tout their accomplishments and listen to voters’ concerns.
The stakes are high, Ellison said: the fate of multi-racial democracy. 
Ellison, who served for a dozen years in Congress representing Minnesota’s Minneapolis-based 5th District, said the states are a sovereign bulwark against federal power grabs. 
The Democratic attorneys general are not only fighting a Republican-controlled executive branch, but also a conservative majority on the U.S Supreme Court. In Ellison’s view, recent decisions by the Roberts court — particularly in 303 Creative v. Elenis, in which the court ruled that a business owner could not be obligated to serve a gay couple — signify that the country is moving towards legal segregation. 
“We are a whisper away from Jim Crow,” Ellison said.
Still, Ellison was upbeat, celebrating the AGs string of victories and predicting that even conservative Supreme Court justices will resist the Trump administration’s attack on the rule of law and the institution of the court itself. 
The Democratic AGs may benefit from a weakened Department of Justice under Trump, Ellison said. The agency that defends the federal government in court is hemorrhaging longtime staff attorneys, through both firings and resignations.
Ellison emphasized that many of the policies enacted by Trump in his first months in office would be legal if they were passed by Congress. Instead, the president is running the country through “edict” and “proclamation,” Ellison said. 
“Our democracy is not perfect,” Ellison said, “but you will absolutely miss it when it’s gone, and Trump has given you a glimpse of that.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MG_1897-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-04 16:04:19.701692

High construction costs, labor shortages and supply chain issues all contribute to soaring housing costs and supply shortages, Gov. Josh Stein said Tuesday. But the state’s growing popularity as a destination for transplants is also a big part of the problem, Stein said.
The governor noted that North Carolina is the third fastest growing state since the last census. The state, he said, added more people than any other except Texas and Florida. “There are just a lot of people moving here and houses aren’t being built fast enough,” Stein said.
When people move to North Carolina, Stein said, they need a place to stay and when there is a shortage of available units, newcomers, who often come with higher salaries and larger bank accounts, are willing to pay more for housing.
“And then it means everybody else is left to struggle,” he said.
Experts, advocates, elected leaders gather
Stein made his remarks during a roundtable discussion in Raleigh with more than a half-dozen housing experts and elected officials. The event was held at Milner Commons, a 156-unit public/private venture on Russ Street in Raleigh that was built to house seniors 55 and older with modest incomes.
Tuesday’s meeting was an opportunity for Stein to discuss solutions to the housing crisis with housing experts and local officials and to consider legislation and public policy initiatives to speed up the building process to boost the state’s housing supply.

“Our state is growing, and people need a safe and affordable place to live,” Stein said. “We will remain focused on identifying solutions to lower the cost of housing for North Carolinians at every stage of life and work to ensure every person has a safe place to call home.”
The housing crisis in North Carolina is real. The state faces a five-year housing inventory gap of 764,478 units (322,360 rental units and 442,118 for-sale units), according to a recent statewide report commissioned by the NC Chamber Foundation, NC REALTORS and the N.C. Homebuilders Association.
And across the country, people, particularly those with low incomes, are finding rents increasingly unaffordable. A recent report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) found a national shortage of 7.1 million affordable and available rental homes for extremely low-income renter households – those with incomes at or below the poverty level or 30% of their area median income, whichever is greater. This means that there are just 35 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income renter households nationwide.
North Carolina was slightly better off than the nation as a whole, but only slightly. The report revealed that only 41 affordable and available rental homes are available for every 100 of the 332,199 extremely low-income households in the state.
Affordable housing developers face challenges
Even though Milner Commons is considered an affordable property, Yolanda Winstead, president and CEO of DHIC, the nonprofit that developed the senior community, said the rents are higher than DHIC would like because construction costs grew and interest rates continued to increase during the development process.

“With those things happening in real time as we’re trying to get it on the ground, we had to fill the gaps that we experienced,” Winstead said.
Raleigh City Councilman Corey Branch said affordable housing developers are facing funding challenges that require government assistance due to higher construction costs and other development obstacles.
“A lot of the costs developers are facing, people don’t see,” Branch said. “So those are the things that we see and continue to put money into … but if you raise property taxes, then you’re impacting the people you’re trying to help.”
Samuel Gunter, executive director of the NC Housing Coalition, said it is critical to focus on increasing the state’s housing supply.
“If we’re not fixing and making sure that we have enough supply, then all of the other stuff we do to subsidize and stabilize [housing] is just not going to go far,” Gunter said.

Keeping people in their homes
Scott Farmer, executive director of the NC Housing Finance Agency, said the preservation of existing homes is often overlooked in the struggle to provide safe and affordable housing. One of the agency’s most important tools is its Urgent Repair Program, which finances emergency repairs for low-income homeowners who are elderly or have disabilities and whose incomes are below 50% of the area media, Farmer said.
“We’re able to go in and do small scale repairs to keep people in their homes,” Farmer said. “Being able to open $17,000 to keep somebody in their house for an additional five years goes a long way toward saving those [state and federal] dollars because in an institutional setting, we know that’s going to cost the state and federal government a lot more money.”
Stein’s proposed state budget included $60 million to leverage federal and private resources to build more housing for low-income families, veterans, seniors and people with disabilities, he said. His proposal also includes $15 million for the Workforce Loan Program to aid in the construction and repair of affordable housing. He said he supports bipartisan proposals in the General Assembly to cut red tape and make it easier to build more homes. Budgets advanced by state lawmakers, however, have not been nearly so ambitious.

Roadblocks to speeding construction
State Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe) said getting legislation passed to ease construction restrictions has been difficult this legislative session. Mayfield has introduced several housing-related bills including one that would allow more mixed-used developments across the state.
“We’re working on it, but we haven’t gotten anything passed yet,” Mayfield said. “It’s a little challenging … but I’m not giving up until that gavel comes down.”
Mayfield said voting to increase density in many communities across the state has proven to be a “one-way ticket to getting unelected.”
“Now, there are enlightened communities like Raleigh and Chapel Hill and Durham and Asheville where that’s not so much the case, but we have some communities who are not there.” As a fan of local government, Mayfield said she doesn’t like telling local officials what to do. But adopting state laws to increase density could give resistant communities a much-needed nudge.
“These bills are not trying to be punitive to local governments; they’re just trying to say we’re [lawmakers] going to take this problem and pull it up here, so you don’t have political risk around it anymore,” Mayfield said.
Homebuilder D.R. Bryan said local ordinances restricting density slows the development process and makes it difficult to build multi-family homes, which helps to increase the housing supply.
Another obstacle, Bryan said, is city and town employees who continue to work from home five years after the pandemic. He said the practice also slows the development process. Many builders prefer to meet face-to-face to discuss project rather than over Zoom, he said.
“The people who are reviewing our plans, we’re having to communicate through email and maybe Zoom, and you just can’t get it done,” Bryan said. “You need to sit there and either have paper plans or a computer and say, “OK, what do you mean here or there?’”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSCN0167-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-04 16:04:19.701692

— Senator Jim Justice (@JimJustice_WV) June 4, 2025

The bipartisan bill aims to reintroduce whole milks and 2% milk to schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. 
The measure also has the support of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who tweeted in March that his administration is “encouraging programs to switch from low-fat dairy – which the antiquated Dietary Guidelines require them to promote — to full-fat/whole milk.” 
Current guidelines from the United States Department of Agriculture require schools to offer fat-free and low-fat milk, flavored and unflavored, to kindergarten through twelfth grade students.
Whole and reduced-fat (2%) milk were removed from school menus in 2012 under the Obama administration to limit saturated fat consumption and calorie consumption among children. 
Recent research suggests that kids who drink whole milk could be less likely to be overweight or develop obesity than children who drink reduced-fat milk.
“Milk is an important part of a balanced diet that delivers critical nutrients students need for growth and development. It makes sense for National School Lunch Program operators to have the authority to offer this healthful beverage to students during the school day,” said Sen. John Boozman, (R-AR). I’m proud to lead the committee in advancing this bipartisan solution to expand milk options and encourage increased dairy consumption while supporting America’s hardworking dairy producers,” 
The U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, which Boozman chairs, advanced the measure on Tuesday. Justice is also a member of the committee. The bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration.
The measure also authorizes parents or legal guardians, in addition to licensed physicians, to provide a written statement for their student to receive a nondairy substitute for fluid milk at school.
Nearly every West Virginia county provides free breakfast and lunch to students regardless of income due the state’s high poverty level.

Michael now works in a small-town hospital in Canada. KFF Health News and NPR granted him anonymity because of fears he might face reprisal from the Trump administration if he returns to the U.S. He said he feels some guilt that he did not stay to resist the Trump agenda but is assured in his decision to leave. Too much of America has simply grown too comfortable with violence and cruelty, he said.
“Part of being a physician is being kind to people who are in their weakest place,” Michael said. “And I feel like our country is devolving to really step on people who are weak and vulnerable.”
Michael is among a new wave of doctors who are leaving the United States to escape the Trump administration. In the months since Trump was reelected and returned to the White House, American doctors have shown skyrocketing interest in becoming licensed in Canada, where dozens more than normal have already been cleared to practice, according to Canadian licensing officials and recruiting businesses.
The Medical Council of Canada said in an email statement that the number of American doctors creating accounts on physiciansapply.ca, which is “typically the first step” to being licensed in Canada, has increased more than 750% over the past seven months compared with the same time period last year — from 71 applicants to 615. Separately, medical licensing organizations in Canada’s most populous provinces reported a rise in Americans either applying for or receiving Canadian licenses, with at least some doctors disclosing they were moving specifically because of Trump.
“The doctors that we are talking to are embarrassed to say they’re Americans,” said John Philpott, CEO of CanAm Physician Recruiting, which recruits doctors into Canada. “They state that right out of the gate: ‘I have to leave this country. It is not what it used to be.’”
Canada, which has universal publicly funded health care, has long been an option for U.S.-trained doctors seeking an alternative to the American health care system. While it was once more difficult for American doctors to practice in Canada due to discrepancies in medical education standards, Canadian provinces have relaxed some licensing regulations in recent years, and some are expediting licensing for U.S.-trained physicians.
In mere months, the Trump administration has jeopardized the economy with tariffs, ignored court orders and due process, and threatened the sovereignty of U.S. allies, including Canada. The administration has also taken steps that may unnerve doctors specifically, including appointing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead federal health agencies, shifting money away from pandemic preparedness, discouraging gender-affirming care, demonizing fluoride, and supporting deep cuts to Medicaid.
The Trump administration did not provide any comment for this article. When asked to respond to doctors’ leaving the U.S. for Canada, White House spokesperson Kush Desai asked whether KFF Health News knew the precise number of doctors and their “citizenship status,” then provided no further comment. KFF Health News did not have or provide this information.
Philpott, who founded CanAm Physician Recruiting in the 1990s, said the cross-border movement of American and Canadian doctors has for decades ebbed and flowed in reaction to political and economic fluctuations, but that the pull toward Canada has never been as strong as now.
Philpott said CanAm had seen a 65% increase in American doctors looking for Canadian jobs from January to April, and that the company has been contacted by as many as 15 American doctors a day.
Rohini Patel, a CanAm recruiter and doctor, said some consider pay cuts to move quickly.
“They’re ready to move to Canada tomorrow,” she said. “They are not concerned about what their income is.”
The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which handles licensing in Canada’s most populous province, said in a statement that it registered 116 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of 2025 — an increase of at least 50% over the prior two quarters. Ontario also received license applications from about 260 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of this year, the organization said.
British Columbia, another populous province, saw a surge of licensure applications from U.S.-trained doctors after Election Day, according to an email statement from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. The statement also said the organization licensed 28 such doctors in the fiscal year that ended in February — triple the total of the prior year.
Quebec’s College of Physicians said applications from U.S.-trained doctors have increased, along with the number of Canadian doctors returning from America to practice within the province, but it did not provide specifics. In a statement, the organization said some applicants were trying to get permitted to practice in Canada “specifically because of the actual presidential administration.”
Michael, the physician who moved to Canada this year, said he had long been wary of what he described as escalating right-ring political rhetoric and unchecked gun violence in the United States, the latter of which he witnessed firsthand during a decade working in American emergency rooms.
Michael said he began considering the move as Trump was running for reelection in 2020. His breaking point came on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob of Trump supporters besieged the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the election of Joe Biden as president.
“Civil discourse was falling apart,” he said. “I had a conversation with my family about how Biden was going to be a one-term president and we were still headed in a direction of being increasingly radicalized toward the right and an acceptance of vigilantism.”
It then took about a year for Michael to become licensed in Canada, then longer for him to finalize his job and move, he said. While the licensing process was “not difficult,” he said, it did require him to obtain certified documents from his medical school and residency program.
“The process wasn’t any harder than getting your first license in the United States, which is also very bureaucratic,” Michael said. “The difference is, I think most people practicing in the U.S. have got so much administrative fatigue that they don’t want to go through that process again.”
Michael said he now receives near-daily emails or texts from American doctors who are seeking advice about moving to Canada.
This desire to leave has also been striking to Hippocratic Adventures, a small business that helps American doctors practice medicine in other countries.
The company was co-founded by Ashwini Bapat, a Yale-educated doctor who moved to Portugal in 2020 in part because she was “terrified that Trump would win again.” For years, Hippocratic Adventures catered to physicians with wanderlust, guiding them through the bureaucracy of getting licensed in foreign nations or conducting telemedicine from afar, Bapat said.
But after Trump was reelected, customers were no longer seeking grand travels across the globe, Bapat said. Now they were searching for the nearest emergency exit, she said.
“Previously it had been about adventure,” Bapat said. “But the biggest spike that we saw, for sure, hands down, was when Trump won reelection in November. And then Inauguration Day. And basically every single day since then.”
At least one Canadian province is actively marketing itself to American doctors.
Doctors Manitoba, which represents physicians in the rural province that struggles with one of Canada’s worst doctor shortages, launched a recruiting campaign after the election to capitalize on Trump and the rise of far-right politics in the U.S.
The campaign focuses on Florida and North and South Dakota and advertises “zero political interference in physician patient relationship” as a selling point.
Alison Carleton, a family medicine doctor who moved from Iowa to Manitoba in 2017, said she left to escape the daily grind of America’s for-profit health care system and because she was appalled that Trump was elected the first time.
Carleton said she now runs a small-town clinic with low stress, less paperwork, and no fear of burying her patients in medical debt.
She dropped her American citizenship last year.
“People I know have said, ‘You left just in time,’” Carleton said. “I tell people, ‘I know. When are you going to move?’”

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois lawmakers have decided to delay a ban on “swipe fees” for another year as bankers are locked in a court battle with the state over the ban.

Lawmakers passed the Interchange Fee Prohibition Act last spring as part of the legislative package that enacted the state budget. It prohibits financial institutions from charging fees on the tax and tip portions of credit and debit card transactions. The rest of the transaction, including the price of goods or services, would still be subject to the fees.

The ban was supposed to take effect on July 1, but lawmakers voted with strong bipartisan majorities Sunday morning to pass House Bill 742 to push the ban back until July 2026.

Banking groups filed a lawsuit last August challenging the law on the grounds it superseded federal banking regulations. Bankers argued the law forces banks and credit card companies to implement costly new computer systems to differentiate between the transaction, tax and tip, and contended they can’t comply with the law by July 1.

A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in December preventing the law, once it takes effect, from applying to federally chartered banks while declining to extend the injunction to state banks and credit card companies.

In February, the judge declined to extend the injunction to credit unions, though it was extended to out-of-state banks that operate in Illinois. The case has remained unresolved in the courts since then, leading lawmakers to push back the start of the ban.

The measure pushing back the effective date still needs approval from Gov. JB Pritzker.

Banking groups supported the delay and continued their messaging campaign against the underlying legislation that passed a year ago.

“This law will cause widespread economic disruption, and mounting evidence shows that the measure overwhelmingly benefits corporate megastores while placing an undue financial burden on small businesses and smaller financial institutions that form the backbone of our local economies,” Illinois Bankers Association Executive Vice President Ben Jackson said in a statement.

The ban was a request of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association as part of a deal during budget negotiations last spring. State lawmakers capped a monthly sales tax deduction claimed by retailers at $1,000 to generate $101 million to fill a budget hole. In exchange, lawmakers passed the ban on swipe fees.

IRMA said in a statement it was disappointed lawmakers have decided to delay the ban.

“By refusing to require compliance as originally intended, legislators are again taking hundreds of millions of dollars out of the pockets of working families and Main Street businesses and giving it to big banks, credit card companies and credit card processors,” IRMA CEO Rob Karr said in a statement.

However, other business groups such as the Illinois Chamber of Commerce said lawmakers made the right decision and urged the legislature to fully repeal the law.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Author I.M. Aiken Skewers Crooked Developers and Explores Women in Combat in Second Vermont Novel.","Our state Vermont charms with untouched beauty. Come for the leaves, come for the snow, come for the lakes and rivers. Find a comfy chair, a local mash (or stomp), a good book, and breathe our fresh air. That is our brand. One fiery red/orange leaf of the sweet maple is enough to say “Vermont.” Yet, Vermont is also a hunting ground for the unscrupulous. For northern Vermont, just cast your memory on Jay Peak. For southern Vermont, a similar story was told in Dover and Wilmington with Haystack Mountain. I.M. Aiken, author of The Little Ambulance War of Winchester County, has turned her wit and deep knowledge of the system to create a fictional version of ski-area-fraudsters, along with politicians, lawyers, and business folks who get pulled along with the fantasy of getting rich by tarting up a lovely hill so that wealthy folks from away would find a home in it. They’d spend their money here. They’d hire people who need jobs. They’d restart flagging economies. One need not ask the obvious question: What could possibly go awry? In her second novel, the forthcoming Stolen Mountain, Aiken nibbles away at our assumptions, and has a bit of fun along the way. Why not? Why not use modern, everyday Vermonters to explore this sticky world? In The Little Ambulance War, Aiken create Brighid and her spouse Major Sarah Anne Musgrave (Sam)—a seasoned combat soldier and intelligence officer—of the US Army as secondary characters. In Stolen Mountain, Brighid, an EMT and captain of a small-town Vermont rescue squad, turns narrator and sleuth, leading us through an adventure. In addition to being a classic legal thriller, Stolen Mountain boasts a tender love story, which is punctuated by Sam’s absence when she deploys.After a 200-plus-year history of military service of all manor and flavors, women were only recently permitted to serve in combat positions. Notoriously, during the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, women used “male” names, outfitting themselves as gents for the privilege of entering battle. Flash forward to 1988, where women were officially banned from combat with implementation of the DOD’s “Risk Rule,” rescinded in 1994, paving the way for more gender-neutral policy, if not practice, both of which are subject to change. Aiken draws on her experience as a civilian member of US Army’s 4th Infantry Division to explore Sam and the impact of her service on her own life and Brighid’s.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Six of South Dakota’s 96 nursing homes are on the newest monthly federal list of the nation’s worst-rated care facilities.
Five of the facilities are eligible for a special program to improve quality of care through increased regulatory oversight, and one is already in the program.
The eligible South Dakota facilities as of the April report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are Avantara Norton in Sioux Falls, Riverview Healthcare Center in Flandreau, Good Samaritan Society Sioux Falls Village, Lake Andes Senior Living and Wilmot Care Center.
One facility, Dells Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Dell Rapids, has been in the Special Focus Facility program for nearly two years. Good Samaritan Society Sioux Falls Center — separate from the society’s similarly named Sioux Falls Village — graduated in July 2023, after spending 27 months in the program.
Nursing homes are identified by the state as special-focus facilities based on their last three standard health survey inspections. Special-focus facilities must meet more stringent criteria two times in a row to be eligible for graduation. Dells Nursing and Rehabilitation Center did not pass its most recent inspection in January, so it will restart the process toward graduation. 
Because the number of special-focus facilities is capped, eligible facilities — even those that have earned CMS’ lowest ratings for quality — can’t be named a special-focus facility until other homes in the same state already in the program are terminated from Medicare and Medicaid or improve and “graduate” from the program. 
That’s a process that can take several years. As a result, there are homes in each state that are eligible for special-focus status due to ongoing quality-of-care problems, but can’t enroll in the program. It’s also why two of the five eligible South Dakota facilities have waited more than three years as candidates: Avantara Norton and Riverview Healthcare Center. 
Typically, the homes that are deemed eligible for special-focus designation have about twice the average number of violations cited by inspectors; they have more serious problems than most other nursing homes, including harm or injury to residents; and they have an established pattern of serious problems that has persisted over a long period of time.



Facility summaries
The five South Dakota homes eligible for inclusion in the Special Focus Facility program all have 1-out-of-5-star ratings from CMS. 
The federal agency penalizes and fines nursing homes for serious citations or if the facility fails to correct a citation for a long period of time. A portion of fines collected are returned to the state, which can be reinvested to support nursing home residents and improve their quality of life and care.
Following are summaries of the problems cited at each of those facilities, along with the one South Dakota facility already in the program and a facility that graduated in 2023.
Dells Nursing and Rehab Center: The 48-bed facility, operated as a for-profit corporation, has participated in the SFF program for 22 months. The home has been cited for 19 deficiencies since the start of 2024 and has been fined $67,773 in the last three years.
It was flagged for “immediate jeopardy” to its residents in February 2024 after a resident left the facility without staff knowledge for a third time in a year. The last two times, the patient was found wandering the facility parking lot. The first time, in June 2023, the resident was found a mile away. An alarm was set on the resident’s tracking device to alert staff if the resident left the facility. The home was cited for 19 deficiencies since the beginning of 2024, with about $67,800 in fines during that time.
The facility was found noncompliant for infection control in its latest state survey inspection report in March.
Avantara Norton: The 110-bed facility in Sioux Falls is owned by for-profit company Legacy Healthcare. The home has been cited for 15 deficiencies since the start of 2024 and has been fined $175,402 in the last three years. It’s been a special focus candidate for 39 months.
The home received a serious deficiency in its November 2024 report for failing to protect a resident from neglect by a certified nursing assistant. The resident was not cared for in a timely manner, possibly contributing to two skin sores. The staff member was disciplined and educated, according to the report.
The facility’s most recent inspection report in March included several citations, including a quality of life citation affecting several residents primarily due to poor call light response times and aid. In an interview, one resident told the state inspector “no one cared” at the facility, that he did not receive timely showers or help out of bed, and that staff response times to call lights vary from five minutes to three hours.
He and other residents said they would sometimes have to call the receptionist’s desk on the phone to ask her to send staff for help. Residents also said there were not enough staff to meet their needs, according to the report. Staff confirmed they occasionally experience staffing shortages. Administrators said they would require regular call light audits to review progress.
The facility’s most recent complaint inspection in April found a registered nurse was stealing controlled substances from the facility for four months. The nurse tested positive for hydrocodone and oxycodone and admitted to the accusation.
Riverview Healthcare Center: The 49-bed facility in Flandreau, owned by for-profit company EmpRes Healthcare Management, has been cited for eight deficiencies since the beginning of 2024, including an “immediate jeopardy” flag for failing to respond and report abuse allegations. It has been fined $81,568 in the last three years and been a special focus candidate for 37 months.
According to the January 2025 report, a certified nursing assistant kicked a resident in the shin twice and covered another resident’s mouth with a washcloth to quiet them. Several staff reported their suspicions but the staff member continued working and the nursing home did not conduct an investigation or follow its abuse and neglect policy. According to the facility’s correction plan, the staff member was put on administrative leave, the administration educated staff on its abuse and neglect policy, and staff interviewed residents randomly and on a weekly basis to hear concerns or look for signs of abuse and neglect.
In its most recent state recertification inspection report from February, citations included improper ulcer prevention and improper food preparation and storage. In a complaint inspection in February, the facility was cited for quality of care problems and failing to provide a safe, clean environment, among other citations. An inspector also found hazards including rusty, exposed edges of an emergency exit door, chunks of missing floor, baseboards, wallpaper and paint, and a hole in a ceiling.
Good Samaritan Society Sioux Falls Village: The 177-bed nonprofit facility in Sioux Falls has been a special-focus candidate for eight months. The home has been cited three times since the start of 2024 and fined $67,504 in the last three years. It has been a special focus candidate for nine months.
The facility was flagged for “immediate jeopardy” to resident health in its June 2024 report because a resident left the facility without staff’s knowledge twice within a few days and because another resident fell multiple times without receiving prompt assistance.
In its most recent complaint inspection report in September, the facility was investigated for alleged abuse and neglect. A staff member was “written up” for lack of care and false charting, for saying they’d checked in on residents and changed them when they hadn’t. The staff member’s charting will be audited, administration said in their correction plan, and the facility will randomly audit to ensure residents received scheduled baths, toileting and repositioning according to their care plan.
Lake Andes Senior Living: The 43-bed for-profit facility in Lake Andes is affiliated with Accura Healthcare. The home has been cited 18 times since the start of 2024 and was fined $91,601 in the last three years. It has been a special focus candidate for six months.
The home was flagged for “immediate jeopardy” to patient health in two citations in the September report, including not notifying four diabetic residents’ doctors when their blood sugar levels veered outside a normal range and failing to manage and prevent a COVID outbreak among residents. The report does not provide details on the size or results of the outbreak.
It was also cited in a September complaint inspection when a resident left the facility without supervision. The facility reviewed its policy for missing residents, ran drills among staff and audited alerting technology used by the facility.
Wilmot Care Center: The 29-bed nonprofit nursing home has been cited 17 times since the beginning of 2024 and has paid $10,377 in the last three years. The facility has been a special-focus candidate for two months.
The facility was flagged for “immediate jeopardy” to residents in its February 2024 report and its March 2025 report both for quality of life and care deficiencies. In March, an inspector found a water leak from the facility’s whirlpool tub next to an electrical box, which increased the risk of electrical shock to residents and staff. In February last year, a resident left the facility without staff’s knowledge and was retrieved by a staff member about a half-mile away. Staff left the facility’s front door unlocked and the resident cut off their tracking and alert device before leaving the facility.
Good Samaritan Society Sioux Falls Center: The 98-bed nonprofit nursing home graduated from the special-focus program in July 2023, after spending over two years on the list. It was cited for four deficiencies since the beginning of 2024 and has been fined twice for a total of $38,301 in the last three years.
The home was found noncompliant during its last state inspection report in June last year for infection prevention and control, food storage and preparation, and using expired medications.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Good-Sam-1024x814.jpg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 19:13:39+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont stops release of CT Dept. of Correction medical malpractice report,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-medical-malpractice-doc-report-ned-lamont/,The report on malpractice and neglect at the Department of Correction examined 25 cases that led to lawsuits or could result in a lawsuit.,"An effort to compel Connecticut’s Department of Correction to release an independent report on some of the worst medical malpractice and neglect cases that happened in its custody was halted after Gov. Ned Lamont’s office requested a provision calling for the release be removed from legislation as the General Assembly’s 2025 session drew to a close.
The report was commissioned by the Department of Correction in 2017 for $63,000 and completed within the year by the Criminal Justice Institute Inc., according to an article in the Hartford Courant. The report examined 25 cases that resulted in lawsuits or were considered likely to result in a lawsuit. 
A provision of the bill, a broad piece of legislation put forward by the legislature’s Judiciary Committee earlier this year, called for the Department of Correction to post the entire report online within a year of the bill’s passage. It also would have required the department to send any medical documentation the report collected that may have been pertinent in a medical malpractice case to the victim’s family. 
In addition, the legislation would have required the Department of Public Health to open an investigation into each case detailed in the report, and the commissioner would have been assigned to determine whether any physicians involved in the cases be disciplined for their actions. The report was expected to identify 25 medical personnel to be investigated by the Connecticut Department of Health. 
The provision was jettisoned from the legislation during negotiations between the two legislative chambers and the governor’s office. Other portions of the Judiciary Committee’s bill were rolled into the legislature’s sprawling budget bill, which passed both chambers earlier this week.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Governor Ned Lamont’s Office, said the medical malpractice report was “commissioned by the Attorney General in preparation for litigation,” suggesting it needed to be kept confidential under attorney-client privilege. The Department of Correction also referred to attorney-client privilege in a statement to The Connecticut Mirror. 
Cara Passaro, chief of staff for the attorney general’s office, said while the office had “concerns” about making the report public, “It is not something that rose to the level of asking legislators to remove it.” 
Ken Krayeske, a civil rights attorney who has litigated multiple cases against the Department of Correction for medical malpractice, told CT Mirror in an email that Lamont’s request to keep the report confidential was “another example of Governor Lamont’s repeated failure on prison management and oversight.” 
Krayeske said in an interview that the release of the report would have represented a “victory over darkness.” 
Cases against the department
The Department of Correction has been the subject of several lawsuits over the last ten years regarding poor medical care that has led to the suffering and sometimes death of individuals in custody.
These include the case of Wayne World, whose skin cancer was repeatedly misdiagnosed by the Department of Correction, and who received a $1.3 million settlement from the state. It also includes Karon Nealy Jr., whose family received $1.65 million from the state after the 19-year-old died from lupus. Krayeske and current Correction Ombuds DeVaughn Ward were both involved in litigating the cases of World and Neely. 
Krayeske said he had been able to get access, through a federal lawsuit, to an additional 20 cases of inadequate medical care that occurred within the Department of Correction.  
One was the case of Billy Bennett, who died from cancer of the larynx in 2017. Krayeske said Bennett had begged for medical care for months. By the time he finally ended up in the emergency room, in January 2017, the cancer had reached stage four and Bennett was unable to breathe because of a tumor in his throat. He died eleven months later. 
A second was the case of Patrick, “Patsy” Camara, who complained of nosebleeds for months before finally being diagnosed with stage 4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma. By the time the cancer was discovered, a tumor located in his sinus cavity had grown to the size of a baseball and had eaten through his brain plate. He died in 2019. 
Documents reviewed by the CT Mirror show that the additional cases — individuals with cancer, neurological disorders, hepatitis C, fractures and spinal stenosis, among other things — revealed delays or denials of care, failures to pursue recommended follow-up care, inaccurate diagnoses, as well as “negligence” and “deliberate indifference” to patients’ conditions. 
The cases outlined in the report all occurred when the University of Connecticut Health Center, under UConn’s Correctional Managed Health Care, was responsible for the medical care of incarcerated people in the state. In 2016, a consultant was hired to conduct a review of the system, which had drawn a growing number of complaints about the quality of care people in custody were receiving. 
After two decades of a no-bid contract with UConn, the Department of Correction took over providing health care to incarcerated individuals beginning in July 2018.  
 Krayeske said releasing the report, even now, many years after it was conducted, “would mean that we have, as a society, the confidence to own up to bad policy.”
“It’s important, in this age of the destruction of objective reality, for us to be able to say, as a government, ‘We made a poor choice. We hurt families and we’re sorry,’” Krayeske added.
Ward said not having the report released would prevent families from being able to have closure, and to “seek justice in a meaningful way.” 
“I think it’s unfortunate for the individuals and for the families that were subjected to what has clearly been identified as horrible medical care,” he said. For the families of incarcerated people to be allowed to sue the state for what their relatives had undergone, would be “monumental,” Ward said.
As the legislative session reached its terminus, Ward said he had a reason to be hopeful because lawmakers had included sections in the budget bill granting his office greater oversight over medical care in the Department of Correction. This includes allowing the office to conduct investigations into any complaints around health care and to collect data on things like appointment wait times and access to medication and medical care. 
The bill also requires the Department of Correction to provide mental health assessments for incarcerated people when they first enter the department. 
“I hope, through all of that suffering that those individuals may have went through, we get some good policy,” said Ward.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8955-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425

The shutdowns have alarmed officials and students in Vergennes, who fear the program’s end could uproot the lives of its more than a hundred students and hurt the local economy.

Photo by Henry Fernandez/VTDiggerNatalie Edwards found a sense of security at the Northlands Job Corps Center — but now that lifeline is set to close its doors along with dozens of other job centers across the country. After a childhood marked by abuse and addiction in the home, Edwards spent years trying to pull herself out of the cycle of instability. At 15, she entered rehab for substance use disorder for the first time. That same year, she was removed from the care of her mother, thrust into Missouri’s foster care system, and later tried — but then dropped out of — community college in Maine.“I just didn’t really have stability,” Edwards said. “I didn’t have the type of lifestyle around me at that time to feel safe.” It wasn’t until her aunt suggested she move to Vermont that things began to shift.“I messaged my aunt, and she told me I could move up to Vermont with her, and she suggested I come to Northlands,” she said. This is how Edwards became one of about 150 students now living on Northland’s flat, stately green campus, located just north of Vermont’s iconic Vergennes Falls.The Vergennes-based chapter of the Job Corps, a nationwide network of vocational schools, could cease to exist at the end of June, following a recent order by the U.S. Department of Labor to “pause” all ongoing operations across the country. However, the department’s order is not going unchallenged, with contractors who run Job Corps programs suing to keep the program alive.The order coincides with President Donald Trump’s “Make America Skilled Again” plan, which seeks to replace the program with a “cost-effective” alternative — a $2.6 billion grant program that emphasizes registered apprenticeships over federal programming. Since its inception in 1964, the Job Corps has been dedicated to training low-income young people ages 16 to 24 in a medley of primarily blue-collar professions like welding and urban forestry. The program provides room and board and an education to its participants for free.Natalie Edwards, a student at Northlands seeking her certified medical assistant certification. Photo by Henry Fernandez/VTDiggerAs part of the tentative ending of the program, Job Corps staff are mandated to return students safely to their “home of record.” However, Northlands Director Michael Dooley said not all Northlands students have a home to return to. “There’s about two dozen students that are unhoused. … Sadly, some of them we may actually be just taking to a homeless shelter.” Dooley said he’s scared his students — all working class young adults — are losing a lifeline. “The impact of providing a safe, stable environment on somebody who hasn’t had one is enormous,” he said. “A lot of our students are going back to pretty terrible home lives and home situations.” Flower Stop, an art installation in Vergennes designed and welded by local artist Kat Clear in collaboration with Northlands Job Corps welding students. Photo by Henry Fernandez/VTDiggerNorthlands is the top Job Corps center in job placement outcomes in the country, according to a paper copy of the rankings provided by Dooley. The Department of Labor has redirected a rankings webpage — alongside several other informational webpages — to a resource page for existing Job Corps graduates. Part of Northland’s strategy for readying students for the job market is its work-based learning programs, where students work directly for local businesses across Vermont. Several of these students work in Vergennes, and if the Job Corps program ends, Vermont’s smallest city is poised to lose one of its biggest employers.Susan Magill has lived in Vergennes for over 40 years, arriving a few months before Northlands first opened in June 1979. She serves as a career technical manager for Northlands, and says the school has brought positive change to the city.“We have students that are always out in the community doing something,” she said, noting students’ welding and tree removal work for Vergennes as examples of the harmony between the city and Northlands.Ron Redmond, Vergennes’ city manager, agreed. “It’s a very well-run organization, in my experience,” Redmond said. “I think the tough part for us is that we have students who have contributed to the downtown. There’s a welding program that we worked with, they’ve built bike racks, and an art project.” The art project is “Flower Stop,” a sculpture built around a bus stop made by artist Kat Clear in collaboration with Northlands welding students. For Redmond, one uncertainty is how Northlands’ closure is going to impact Vergennes. “There is gonna be an economic impact, we’ll have to wait and see,” he said.Dooley estimated that Northlands contributes around $2.5 million to the local economy, and said he’s worried that its closing could have a big effect. “You’ve got the money the center is spending and putting into the local economy, the program itself, plus the students and local staff that are buying gas, buying coffee, buying lunch. I don’t think anybody’s thought that through, really,” he said.Despite the economic uncertainty, the impact Northlands has had on the lives of students like Edwards is clearer. Edwards recently started working at Vergennes Grand Senior Living, and was looking forward to renting her own apartment after completing Northlands’ certified medical assistance program. “Helping people. I think that’s what draws me towards it,” she said.  At Northlands, Edwards said she’s found “a lot of stability. … It’s like a big family here. We all look out for each other.”But she said the feeling of Northlands shutting down and her aspirations being curbed is “heartbreaking. It’s absolutely horrible.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘It’s absolutely horrible’: Federal shutdown of Northlands Job Corps leaves students and city reeling.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/michael-dooley-northlands-vergennes--1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa sent letters Wednesday to five Iowa city councils calling for a change to local statutes that classify “female impersonators” and “male impersonators” as adult entertainment, saying such measures are unconstitutional.
The letters were sent to the city councils of Carroll, Harlan, Mt. Pleasant, Polk City and Webster City. The five Iowa municipalities have restrictions on performances — typically referring to drag shows — as adult entertainment. In the letters to the city councils, ACLU Staff Attorney Shefali Aurora wrote that the prohibitions on drag performances violate the state and U.S. constitutions, as they conflict with the First Amendment by restricting a form of expression that’s protected under free speech rights.
Aurora also argued the ordinances violate constitutional equal protection rights, as the measures target the LGBTQ community on the basis of sex and gender expression.
Aurora said in a news conference Wednesday the ordinances are restricting performances that are neither obscene or sexual.
“Not all drag is obscenity,” Aurora said. “A lot of drag performances are, in fact, family friendly. Too often, drag is equated with sexualized performances. But drag is not, by definition, adult entertainment. It can simply be someone wearing clothing and accessories conventionally worn by a person of a different gender.”
Other performances that entail stories involving a person dressed in a manner that does not traditionally correspond with their gender at birth — such as movies like “Mulan” or “Mrs. Doubtfire” — could be restricted from being shown under such local ordinances.
A statewide measure to ban minors’ attendance at drag performances was discussed during the 2025 legislative session but ultimately did not advance. This proposed legislation contained similar language that defined drag as performances where the main aspect is “a performer who exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer’s gender assigned at birth through the use of clothing, makeup, accessories, or other gender signifiers.”
The bill, which was amended, received heavy criticism not just for limiting family-friendly drag shows but potentially impacting transgender people’s ability to be in non-drag public performances and preventing local theaters from performing classic art such as Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night,” as it contains a character that dresses as the opposite gender.
Aurora said this is not the first time the ACLU has sent letters to local governments about similar anti-drag ordinances. In the past, the organization has contacted Eagle Grove, Knoxville, Newton, Dyersville, Pella, Waukee and Grinnell — communities that agreed to amend their ordinances after receiving communications from the ACLU on the issue.
In 2021, Doña Martha’s Office in Eagle Grove had canceled a drag show after receiving a letter from the city attorney that called for the performances to cease, claiming they violated municipal code. Aurora said Eagle Grove later agreed to amend the restriction on “female impersonators” as part of the city’s definition of adult entertainment.
While the ACLU is encouraging all cities to review their ordinances and remove language related to drag performances as inherently obscene, Aurora said the latest letters were sent as many Iowa communities are celebrating Pride month, holding events that sometimes host drag performances.
“We thought it was particularly important to raise this issue again this month, with it being Pride, which is why we’re sending out the letters this week, just to bring that to the forefront,” Aurora said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20230428_140315532-scaled-e1682722582987-1024x592.jpg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425

(Photo: Anna Liz Nichols)U.S. Department of Justice pardon attorney Ed Martin Jr. not only has plans to pardon the men convicted in planning to kidnap and kill Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, he also has a framework for granting clemency to the 2020 Republican false electors, according to a report released Wednesday.
Martin has now indicated that he is eyeing federal pardons for Republican state-level electors who allegedly helped President Donald Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 election results, according to a report from Mother Jones.
In Michigan, 15 of Trump’s 16 presidential electors were charged with state forgery and conspiracy crimes and are awaiting word from a Lansing district court judge on whether they will stand trial. One of those electors has since pleaded guilty and assisted the Michigan Department of Attorney General with its investigation and prosecution. Despite those charges coming from Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a person familiar with Martin’s plans said that the state electors could be next for consideration.
The plan was framed as a wide-ranging effort to wipe away the memory of Trump’s attempts to overturn the election, which has included pardons for January 6 U.S. Capitol insurrectionists. The plan is also meant to elevate the department’s actions in a highly public way, showing that the federal government is working to gloss over the Trump campaign’s actions following his loss to former President Joe Biden.
“We’ll be a little bit more outward-facing in terms of talking about what’s happening,” Mother Jones reported Martin as saying at a May press conference outlining his plans. “The law can be taken up, but the starting point is to make sure that the public sees that we’re doing it.”
The 2020 Trump electors charged in the matter include former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Meshawn Maddock and former Republican National Committeewoman Kathleen Berden.
Martin said, quite candidly, in May that Barry Croft and Adam Fox, who were convicted of planning to kidnap Whitmer from her Elk Rapids vacation home along with a cadre of militia recruits, were also on the list for consideration.
Trump later acknowledged that he would take a look at Croft and Fox’s case. The Detroit News is reporting that Whitmer said she spoke with Trump this week about the idea of giving Fox and Croft pardons.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
The ‘balance sheet’
In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.

Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”

Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
Housing arguments
The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
Trump wants to log more trees. He’ll need states’ help.

In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”

Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
The costs of management
In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
Western states’ budgets, industries rely on federal lands. So does wildlife.

“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, discusses her resolution to establish a Make America Healthy Again Kentucky Task Force to implement the Trump administration's health policies. Feb. 27, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)During the first meeting of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Kentucky Task Force, lawmakers said they want to address food deserts and food quality, childhood obesity, mental health and health care costs, among other things. 
Members and non members had a slew of ideas for what the task force should focus on — including education, diabetes, personal responsibility around health, the importance of physical fitness, agricultural partnerships, chronic illnesses, dental care, cancer and other topics. 
Co-chair Sen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, said the task force could “chase a lot of rabbits” but should stay focused. She and co-chair Rep. Matt Lockett, R-Nicholasville, want to place emphasis on food quality and availability.
In 2023, 753,410 Kentuckians were food insecure, meaning they don’t have enough to eat and may not know where their next meal will come from. Meanwhile, the “big beautiful bill” Republicans in the U.S. House passed in May shifts to state governments some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food to low-income Americans.
The Kentucky General Assembly created the MAHA Kentucky Task Force this year as a way to implement the Trump administration’s principles in the commonwealth. 
Hot button topics like fluoridated water will come up during the interim, Funke Frommeyer said, but “I don’t think you’ll hear that in our committee.” In the 2025 session, a bill to make fluoride in water optional in Kentucky passed the House but not the Senate. 
Task force members, in addition to Funke Frommeyer and Lockett, are Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville; Sen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville; Sen. Craig Richardson, R-Hopkinsville; Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville; Rep. Emily Callaway, R-Louisville; Rep. Robert Duvall, R-Bowling Green; Rep. Adam Moore, D-Lexington; and Rep. Marianne Proctor, R-Union. 
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, who is not a task force member but shared his thoughts during the Wednesday meeting, said “the work that will be done here will touch every committee that we have in the legislature.” 
“We forget that we don’t live and work in a vacuum, and everybody’s going to be impacted by this, said Meredith, a retired hospital executive. “I’ve been preaching for the last year about the unsustainable growth in health care costs, particularly in the United States. If we don’t get control of this, I truly believe it’s going to cause our economy to collapse.” 
The next task force meeting is July 10 at 3 p.m.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 18:54:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont forces legislators to keep elections watchdog independent,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-state-elections-enforcement-commission-seec-approval/,A bill would have subjected the appointment of the director of the CT State Elections Enforcement Commission to legislative approval.,"Facing a potential veto from Gov. Ned Lamont, the General Assembly agreed Wednesday to delete a portion of a bipartisan bill that would have ended a half century of independence by Connecticut’s elections watchdog.
Lamont objected to a portion of Senate Bill 1405 that would have subjected the appointment of an executive director of the State Elections Enforcement Commission to approval by a legislative committee, the House and Senate.
Rather than risk a veto of a bill already approved by both chambers and on its way to Lamont’s desk, legislative leaders agreed to insert language into an unrelated fiscal bill that makes the change sought by Lamont, the League of Women Voters, Common Cause and others.
“We are beyond grateful to the governor for standing up for the independence of the agency and are fully aware, but for the governor defending it, none of these proposals would have happened,” said Clare Kindall, the interim director of SEEC.
The executive director will be limited to serving two four-year terms, however, a limitation not imposed on other watchdog agencies such as the Freedom of Information Commission.
Kindall, the former solicitor general of Connecticut, said the “leadership churn” imposed by the term limits could have a chilling effect on the pool of applicants. She is among those applying for the job.
“I don’t see how that benefits anyone,” Kindall said. “That said, whatever the governor and legislature comes up with, we will live with.”
Kindall had no objections to a requirement that a nominee for director go through a hearing before one of the two committees with cognizance over elections law, the Government Administration and Elections Committee and the Government Oversight Committee.
“They could ask us to come before them any time to talk about the state of the agency,” she said.
The portions of the bill that will remain intact reduce the number of campaigns that can be audited post-election from 50% to 20% and require they be completed in one year.
Kindall, who acknowledged that the commission and General Assembly need to rebuild what has become a fraught relationship in the past decade, said she had hoped that the governor would veto SB 1405 and allow a cooling off period.
“We would prefer [it] to be vetoed and just see if we can’t get every one to calm down and see if we can’t reset the relationship,” she said.
The original bill was the product of mounting legislative grievances and frustrations with the State Elections Enforcement Commission, which enforces election laws and administers the Citizens’ Election Program, a 20-year-old reform that created a voluntary system of publicly financing campaigns for state office.
Lawmakers complained that SEEC staff was slow last year to review and approve applications for public financing grants, which require candidates to raise qualifying small-dollar donations, mostly from the communities in their legislative districts. Without presenting evidence, some Republicans claimed their applications were unfairly scrutinized.
The vast majority of legislative candidates use public financing.
Candelora said he was most concerned that public financing grants, which have become nearly universal in General Assembly races, are processed fairly and quickly.
“We are sort of requiring people to participate in the public financing process in order to run for elections,” Candelora said. “We want to make sure that everybody has equal access to that, and if the process isn’t working properly, it interferes with democracy. So I think the intentions have been good.”
The agency is overseen by five commissioners, one each appointed by the governor and the leaders of the four legislative caucuses: the House Democrats, House Republicans, Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans. The commission has sole authority to hire and fire the executive director.
The original bill was negotiated by the four caucus leaders, although House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said demand for legislative approval of the director’s hiring was initiated by the Senate.
Senate leaders said the change keeping the executive director’s hiring independent of lawmakers was unnecessary but acceptable.
“I felt what we passed was fine,” said Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk. “I think this is a reasonable compromise. I have no problem with it.”
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he would have preferred retaining the legislative approval of the director.
“I still would like to see continuous legislative approval, but as I understand it, it’s a compromise.”
The Senate approved the bill 34-1. But the House vote was 92-46, with all the “no” votes cast by Democrats — a protest to the provision the governor successfully urged them to remove.
Last week, the former executive director of the State Elections Enforcement Commission, Jeffrey Garfield, urged Lamont to either veto SB 1405 or demand the change that was being made Wednesday.
“Sadly, the commission’s independence is again under attack,” Garfield said. “We must continue to fight for the agency’s independence, its funding and its future.”
The occasion was the 50th anniversary of the creation of SEEC, one of the reforms adopted after the Watergate scandal, and the 20th anniversary of the public financing law passed after a bid-rigging scandal forced the resignation of Gov.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) After former LSU President William Tate abruptly departed campus for the same job at Rutgers University in New Jersey, political forces began jockeying to posture their preferred replacements to take the prized office. 
LSU’s faculty will expect Tate’s replacement to have an academic background, including the highest degree, a body of research and time as a faculty member. But politically-appointed university board members are mulling names without this pedigree, including those at the highest echelons of elected office in Louisiana. 
Before the LSU Board of Supervisors can take action on a replacement, two questions must be settled: Will Tate, who served as both president of the LSU System and chancellor of the Baton Rouge campus, be replaced by one person or two? And what kind of search will the board undertake?
Earlier this year, two board members confirmed to the Illuminator the possibility of splitting the president and chancellor roles is being discussed.  The two positions were combined in 2012. The uncertainty could impact the pool of candidates, as some applicants might not want to take a job that could be split in two. 
The effort to split the job is spearheaded by LSU Board Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, a Republican mega-donor from Lake Charles. He said the combined roles have not served the university well.
“We’ve tried it for over a decade, and I believe the results speak for themselves,” Mallett said in an emailed statement. “When a university is large, complex, and multifaceted, leadership must be distributed.” 
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard, who was a member of the board in 2012 when the merger occurred, is generally opposed to splitting the roles again. He said in an interview he might consider dividing the jobs as “there may be a reason to,” though he did not elaborate on what that reason would be. 
Ballard said the board will soon announce a search committee, which he predicted would work over the next six months or so to conduct a nationwide search for Tate’s replacement. Such a move could ease fears among some faculty who thought the board might choose and coronate a successor without their input. 
Though Tate’s successor could very well be a top administrator at an out-of-state university, there are some in-state names circulating. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Matt Lee  
Matt Lee, LSU’s vice president for agriculture and dean of its College of Agriculture, currently serves as interim president while the search plays out. An academic with an aptitude for politics, he could be seen as the compromise candidate. 
Lee got his Ph.D. from LSU before joining the faculty at Mississippi State for five years, after which he returned to LSU. In Baton Rouge, he earned the rank of full professor before making the jump to administration. 
Lee’s work as a sociologist has mostly focused on crime, and his publications have touched on Louisiana themes, including the aftermath of the BP-Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Hurricane Katrina. 
Lee previously served as interim provost before Tate ultimately hired Roy Haggerty, who is also on his way out to take the same job at Oregon State University. Though being made vice president for agriculture might have been a consolation prize, the position better serves him if his goal is to replace Tate. 
Lee has not responded to questions about whether he intends to apply for the job. 
Leading the LSU AgCenter, which has a presence in all 64 parishes — and by extension, every legislative district — means Lee has had the opportunity to form connections with lawmakers and other public officials. 
His political clout, his academic pedigree and his general affability could make him the choice who would make the most people happy. 
Wade Rousse 
Wade Rousse has served as president of McNeese State in Lake Charles for just over a year. Before taking the job, he had worked several other administrative jobs at the school since 2019. 
Rousse is the candidate favored by Mallett, who is a Lake Charles resident. 
“Dr. Rousse will stand on his own two feet,” Mallett said. “If he chooses to enter this process, I am confident in his ability to rise to the top based on merit, leadership, and qualifications.” 
In an emailed comment, Rousse did not confirm or deny his interest in the position. 
“While I am flattered that my name was mentioned as a candidate for its presidency, I remain laser-focused on building on our successes at McNeese State, where we have right-sized the university, stabilized our finances and reversed a 14-year enrollment decline,” Rousse said. 
While Rousse has a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Illinois Chicago and some experience as an adjunct professor, he does not have the typical academic background expected of the president of a major research institution. And with just one year of experience running a regional university — with very different goals than an institution that spends over $500 million annually on research —- higher education observers question whether his administrative knowledge is enough to make up for his lack of academic experience. 
Julia Letlow 
U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, R-Start, is rumored to be the most-favored political candidate for the job. 
Letlow has represented Louisiana’s 5th Congressional district since 2021. Her district was redrawn in 2024 to include LSU, where she held her re-election victory party last year. 
Letlow has a Ph.D. in communications from South Florida University and worked in administrative jobs at the University of Louisiana at Monroe before joining Congress. A finalist for the ULM presidency in 2020, she was passed over for Ronald Berry.
In remarks to students visiting her during Washington Mardi Gras earlier this year, Letlow described applying for the job as one of the most terrifying experiences of her life. 
“It was horrible and the faculty were terrible to me,” Letlow said. “I didn’t get it, and that was so good … because it was preparing me for the next step.” 
Letlow spokesman Matt Smith declined to comment for this story. 
Like McNeese, UL-Monroe is a regional non-research university. While Letlow might have the favor of the political class, the fact she was passed over for that job raises questions for faculty as to what makes her qualified to lead a much larger, much more research-focused institution. 
That could change if the LSU board ends up splitting the two jobs. While faculty would be unlikely to back Letlow for chancellor, she wouldn’t necessarily need to win their support to be successful as the system president, which is a much more political and administrative position. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Bill Cassidy 
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge, is another rumored political pick for the job. He is currently in a fight for his political life in next year’s election after voting to convict President Donald Trump for his actions in the attempted insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. 
Though Cassidy might find an easy out — and a much higher paycheck — leading his alma mater, he said in an interview that he’s focused on re-election. 
A two-time LSU graduate, Cassidy is a physician and was on its medical school faculty for many years before starting his political career. 
The theory of Cassidy as a potential successor is predicated on the idea that getting Cassidy out of the U.S. Senate race would be a political boon for Trump-aligned conservatives who want to replace him with a more favorable Republican. 
The desired political domino effect is not unprecedented in Louisiana higher education. Just last year, Gov. Jeff Landry threw his support behind state Supreme Court Justice Jimmy Genovese to become president of Northwestern State University. That allowed a Landry-backed candidate to run and win Genovese’s seat on the high court. 
Other rumored names 
Though they were both finalists for the job in 2021, former Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne and current Louisiana Tech President Jim Henderson are very unlikely to enter the fray again. 
While Dardenne is a Republican, his endorsement of former democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Landry foe, and a subsequent eight years of service as Edwards’ budget chief, makes him a non-starter with the Landry-controlled LSU Board of Supervisors. If his political disadvantage wasn’t enough, Dardenne’s lack of an academic background also puts him at odds with faculty expectations. 
Dardenne is a two time LSU graduate, earning his undergraduate in mass communications and a J.D. from the Law Center. 
Though he was passed over for the job previously, Dardenne, who was previously LSU student body president and a student member on the board of supervisors, has remained ubiquitous at LSU events, always dressed in purple and gold. That is unlikely to change. 
Henderson served as president of the University of Louisiana System from 2017-23 and has been president of Louisiana Tech since then. He laughed when contacted about the possibility of him succeeding Tate and said he was happy where he is. 
Though Henderson has experience running a research institution and plenty of political allies, his candidacy would come at the same time LSU is taking back control of the fiscally embattled University of New Orleans from the University of Louisiana System. That could prompt uncomfortable questions for Henderson about his knowledge of the crisis when he led the UL System. 
And though he has a doctor of management from the University of Maryland, Henderson is not an academic and has never held a faculty job. He was also handed the Tech job under unusual circumstances, without a search committee or faculty feedback. Both factors could impact his standing in the eyes of LSU faculty.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-20-23_LSU_MP-12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425

(Madelyn Hanes/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Hundreds of Hoosiers die each year in traffic collisions and thousands more are seriously injured. Numbers have fallen slightly but Indiana traffic safety groups are working to bring that number down even further statewide. 
According to the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute, traffic fatalities decreased to 894 in 2023 compared to 985 fatalities in 2022. Another 4,232 Hoosiers were seriously injured in traffic crashes in 2023 while 5443 were seriously injured in traffic crashes in 2022. 
Indianapolis-based nonprofit Health by Design is partnering with the Institute to expand its Indiana Road to Zero Academy, aiming to reduce serious traffic crashes and fatalities across the state. 
Solutions include tactical urbanism, which uses street murals, separators and pedestrian-only lanes to slow down traffic and accommodate bikes, wheelchairs and strollers. 
“Streets need to be rebuilt every year,” said Andrea Watts, Health by Design’s communications and policy manager. “We want to rebuild them right, but not just car orientated infrastructure — safe streets for everyone.”
Launched in 2022 with funding from the National Safety Council and Road to Zero Coalition, the academy initially offered virtual training over several weeks, spreading awareness and knowledge to various stakeholders working to improve Indiana’s roadway. Now backed by the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute Traffic Safety Improvement Program, the program is shifting gears. 
The Indiana Road to Zero Academy plans to offer two in-person regional training workshops — one in northern Indiana and one in southern Indiana — in mid- or late September. These hands-on sessions will teach the safe system approach: safe roads, safe speeds, and safe road users. It is designed for municipal staff, planners, engineers, safety advocates, and residents. 
“Northern and southern Indiana were hungry to get this rolling,” Watts said.
The expanded academy also introduces a statewide Vision Zero Working Group, building on the Indianapolis Vision Zero Ordinance adopted in August 2024. Vision Zero prioritizes eliminating traffic deaths and serious injuries through smarter road designs that ensure safe travel for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers alike.
 Health by Design will provide customized crash analysis and technical assistance to high-risk areas, partnering with data experts and EMS records to track fatal crashes and identify solutions. 
The group has also teamed up with the Indiana Department of Transportation and the Department of Health to improve community safety. One of their initiatives, the Safe Routes to School program, is open to all Indiana schools — regardless of federal funding — and encourages more students to walk or bike safely to class.
Through this program, the organization supports schools through grants such as one for bike helmets. Most recently, they supported Fort Wayne students participating in Bike-to-School Day, Watts said. 
Despite challenges from recent federal funding cuts and changes, the organization remains committed to enhancing traffic safety. Proposed federal funding cuts on green infrastructure attacks a lot of the work the nonprofit does, Watts said. Following threats to federal funding, state partnerships are becoming even more important. 
“It has impacted us and we had to get more creative,” Watts said. “There’s an attack on a lot of the work we do and it feels like a step backward or we are stuck in time.”

Garrison, who’s farmed in Pendelton since graduating from Clemson in 1980, was among the group who pushed for a 2017 law that allowed farmers in the state to grow hemp, a plant that’s the same species as marijuana but lacks the THC that gets people high.
Despite being one of the state’s hemp pioneers, he abandoned the crop after just two seasons. He didn’t even seek a permit in 2020. Garrison told the SC Daily Gazette his venture into hemp was probably the worst in his 45 years as a farmer.
It’s a risk that Garrison estimates cost him more than $100,000 in unused crops, equipment and time spent, said the 67-year-old son of the late state Sen. T. Ed Garrison, namesake of the livestock arena at Clemson. He declined to specify how much he lost.
“It was not a very good experience,” he said.
Hemp was supposed to be the next moneymaker for South Carolina farmers. And once they were able, the farmhands flocked to the opportunity.
Many suffered similar fates to Garrison.
Farmers and lawmakers described the hemp industry as an unregulated battle for survival, where supply ultimately outweighed the demand, causing many to ditch the crop altogether.
“It was like the Wild West,” Garrison recently told the SC Daily Gazette.
From 20 to 265
After the 2017 law passed, 20 farmers received a permit to grow hemp on a maximum 20 acres each in the state’s pilot program. More than 100 applicants were denied. Among the 20 were Danny Ford, Clemson’s first national championship football coach, and former state Rep. Chip Limehouse.
The pilot program created by the 2017 law allowed a doubling in 2019 to 40 permits farming 40 acres each.
But in the wake of the 2018 federal farm bill that legalized the crop nationwide, the Legislature passed another law in March 2019 that deleted the constraints and allowed the state Department of Agriculture to issue licenses to any farmer who met the legal criteria.
The agency ended up giving 161 permits for the 2019 crop. For 2020, the number rocketed to 265.
But this year, the number of farmers with permits is down to 80.

It’s unclear how many of those 80 farmers actually grow hemp. Some of the farmers go through the process to get licensed, which costs about $600 and involves a background check. But they aren’t planting hemp. They’re just keeping their options open.
Among the factors that could have affected a desire to grow the crop was the 2019 arrest of Lowcountry farmer John Trenton Pendarvis.
Law enforcement claimed his 10 acres of hemp in Harleyville were unregistered and mowed it down the same day.
Pendarvis, the first person charged with violating the state’s hemp-growing law, filed a lawsuit against the State Law Enforcement Division, including SLED Chief Mark Keel in his official capacity, Attorney General Alan Wilson and others.
The suit led to SLED being forced to pay more than $11,000 in attorney fees to Pendarvis in 2023 for its handling of the lawsuit’s discovery process. A SLED spokesperson declined the allegations at the time.
The mess could have deterred farmers who were worried about being targeted, said state Sen. Brad Hutto, Pendarvis’ lawyer.
“I think it definitely had a chilling effect,” Hutto, D-Orangeburg, told the SC Daily Gazette. “They put a farmer in jail when he was growing a legal crop.”
The case is ongoing. Hutto doesn’t expect a resolution until at least late summer.
When South Carolina first permitted farmers to grow hemp, lawmakers and farmers thought they were getting in on the next big cash crop.
Most farmers have a primary crop that they make money on. Hemp was supposed to provide a year-round option to grow for lots of different uses, including clothing, food, textiles and even paper.
Encouraging its growth was supposed to allow farmers to continue profiting at times when their main crop could not grow, said House Majority Leader Davey Hiott, who chaired the House agriculture committee when the hemp laws passed.
“It was supposed to help them make a little bit of money,” said the Pickens Republican.
A decade ago, Hiott was eager to see farmers capitalize on the industrial use of hemp, such as clothing. In 2017, Pickens County was home to 740 farms, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
“It started that way. It didn’t end that way,” Hiott said.

CBD Problems
In 2014, the Legislature passed a law legalizing the sale of CBD, or cannabidiol, a hemp-derived, non-psychoactive oil used for various ailments. But that state law was very limited, authorizing it only for patients diagnosed with severe epilepsy.
After the 2018 federal law broadened what was legal, farmers saw an opportunity. And the large majority of hemp growers in the state wanted in.
And that’s when problems started, farmers told the Gazette.
James Fairey, a 50-year-old from Williamston, started growing hemp in 2020, the state’s peak for permits.
Even after others bowed out of the industry, he continued to grow. After four years of losing money, he finally turned a profit on the crop in 2024. He credits a gradually growing customer base and a willingness to learn along the way for reversing his fortunes.
The biggest difference between him and most growers, he said, is he started growing hemp because he believes in the ailment-relieving health benefits of CBD. The money was secondary.
“The only currencies that matter are health and kindness, and that’s what I provide,” Fairey said.
When hemp growers first started growing, the biomass material used for CBD could be sold for up to $60 a pound, DeWitt said. A couple of years later, farmers were offered as little as $5 per pound.
“Nobody wants to grow something they can’t sell,” DeWitt said.
If the market changes, licensed farmers who are sitting on the sidelines may jump back in.
“Some of them have planted very little, but there’s no penalty for not planting it,” Dewitt said.  
Other early hemp growers included Cannalina Hemp Company, formerly known as Charleston Hemp Company.
The company started in 2018 and grew its own hemp, while operating a storefront.
In 2020, the decision was made to stop growing the crop.
“There was an oversupply of the market, and the prices collapsed,” said Lina Wu, the company’s owner.
However, there was still money to be made in selling the CBD gummies, oils, vapes, lotions, and other edibles.
The Cannalina Hemp Company’s Goose Creek retail location is open and operating. It has a loyal customer base, buys from numerous South Carolina hemp growers and prides itself on carrying quality products at an affordable price, according to its Facebook profile.
However, there are “a lot cheaper products out there, especially in gas stations,” Wu said.
When asked if the business would ever return to growing its own hemp, Wu said now is not the time.
“There’s too many growers on the market,” she said.
Kurt Brower, the co-owner of Carolina Botanicals, echoed a similar sentiment after losing about $200,000 in his venture. Though the company maintains a hemp license, it doesn’t make economic sense to grow hemp right now, he said.
Brower now focuses on processing biomass for farmers into products they can sell, as well as selling their own products.
The 27-year-old said he previously bought hemp exclusively from South Carolina farmers, but as the number of producers has dropped, he’s had to start buying from farmers in neighboring Georgia and North Carolina.
“There’s no outlet of sale on the hemp side” for farmers, he said. “It put a chokehold” on growers.
What’s Next
Hiott, the House majority leader, said hemp is no longer on his radar.
Eva Moore, a spokesperson with the state Department of Agriculture, said recruitment isn’t a problem, farmers are often intrigued by growing hemp. But a shift from CBD to growing hemp for fiber or grain would open up new economic opportunities.
Moore said she’s heard reports that processors are still sitting on hemp they bought in 2022.
“The market has not been great for farmers,” Moore said. “Whether you’re growing cotton, peaches, or hemp, you have to be able to make a living doing it.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7899-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425

Ron DeSantis, received unanimous approval from the Florida Board of Education Wednesday to serve as the state’s next education commissioner. 
Florida’s education commissioner plays a major role shaping education policy in a state that has drawn national attention for its contentious policies on library book removals, and diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“If given this opportunity, you can rest assured that I will take the baton and continue to run the race,” Kamoutsas told the Board of Education Wednesday morning. 
Education commissioner to leave post, become interim president at University of West Florida

He started at the Department of Education in 2019, serving as general counsel and eventually as chief of staff, before joining the governor’s office in 2023. 
DeSantis came out in full support of Kamoutsas Tuesday, saying “Stasi Kamoutsas has delivered on important issues like parental rights, school choice, and fighting back against radical ideologies in education.”
The job opened after Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. was named interim president of the University of West Florida. He will take that job in July, making Wednesday’s meeting likely his last as commissioner. 
Kamoutsas’ approval as commissioner is contingent on Diaz being named the official president of UWF after a search, board Chair Ben Gibson said.

History
“A lot of times in these situations, we are taking somewhat of a leap of faith in having a commissioner come in, … Here we have an opportunity, members, I believe, to choose someone we don’t have to guess, really, how they’re going to perform,” Gibson said. “And someone who’s been in the trenches at every level of the department, has been involved in every major education decision that the state of Florida has made over the last six years.”
During the public comment period, political figures lined up to praise Kamoutsas, including Florida International University President and former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez, New College of Florida President and former Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, former House Speaker Jose Oliva, and Broward County College President Torey Alston.
“If I had to use one world to describe him, I’d say he’s relentless,” Oliva said, while others praised him for his work ethic and family values. 
“What’s been the gem that’s been hiding in the background is coming public,” Diaz said, attesting to Kamoutsas’ involvement in previous policies and actions by the department. 
“He understands that history because he’s been present for a good amount of it inside the department, inside the governor’s office, but he’s heard the battle stories from President Corcoran, from Speaker Oliva, from Chancellor [Ray] Rodrigues, from myself, so he understands the history and where we came from in this reform, and he’s perfectly equipped and willing to continue it,” Diaz said. 
In addition to pledging to fight for parental involvement in the education system, Kamoutsas appealed to teachers, too.
“Teachers, you have my word that I stand in support of you. Whether that’s maintaining discipline in your classrooms or working with the governor on continued pay increases, know that I have your back,” Kamoutsas said. 
The Washington Post reported in 2023 that Kamoutsas, who worked in the governor’s office, was responsible for denying a pending promotion to a Florida Department of Law Enforcement attorney who advocated for the governor’s travel records to be public. The attorney “was not on our team,” the paper reported Kamoutsas as saying.
The push to hide details of the governor’s travel records came before DeSantis ran to be the GOP nominee for U.S. president.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 18:21:21+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT legislators to hospitals: Trust us on taxes, again",Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-legislators-hospital-tax-hike/,CT legislators are out of time to shrink a $375 million hospital tax hike down to $285 million but promised to before it takes effect in 2026.,"Legislators on Wednesday asked Connecticut’s hospitals, which sued the state over escalating taxes 10 years ago, to trust them with their money one more time.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Wednesday that legislators, due to a lack of time, couldn’t shrink an approved $375 million hospital tax hike down to $285 million before the General Assembly’s mandatory adjournment deadline at midnight.
But the tax increase, part of a complex plan to help hospitals and the state financially, doesn’t take effect until July 2026. The speaker offered assurances that the industry wouldn’t be harmed.
“If there’s any concern in hospital land that the state is somehow going to do them wrong, I just don’t see that happening,” Ritter said. “We’re going to want to get to a fair deal for everybody.”
Connecticut has been levying a providers tax on hospitals since 2011. But for some of that history, it was a tax in name only, designed chiefly to increase federal aid.
As originally conceived, the industry would pay $350 million per year to the state, which redistributed those funds, plus more, back to hospitals. That exchange, legally, counted as public health spending and entitled Connecticut to extra Medicaid reimbursements from Washington.
Hospitals and the state came out ahead, all both sides were happy — but not for long.
As Connecticut struggled with budget deficits for much of the 2010s, it gradually took more from hospitals and returned less.
The industry, which sued the state in federal court in 2015, was losing $436 million under this modified taxing scheme by 2017.
Lamont settled the lawsuit upon taking office in January 2019, and he and lawmakers approved a plan to gradually move the tax back to its original win-win format.
But when President Donald J. Trump and Congress targeted Medicaid earlier this year for cuts worth hundreds of billions over the next decade, Connecticut officials feared the provider tax arrangement — which most states follow — might be capped, reduced or eliminated altogether.
Still, state officials hoped to boost the tax, and federal aid, one more time this year.
Lamont proposed increasing the hospital tax, which currently collects $820 million from facilities, by another $140 million. The Democratic-controlled legislature upped the ante, pitching a $375 million increase. The hope is this will trigger at least $94 million in extra federal Medicaid reimbursements.
That projection and the $375 million tax increase were built into the new $55.8 billion two-year state budget the General Assembly adopted Tuesday.
But hospital officials had warned Lamont Tuesday morning that they believe any hike beyond $285 million would surpass existing federal limits on the provider tax system. Any state increase needs approval by federal Medicaid administrators before it can be applied.
Both Ritter and Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said the state still could negotiate a $285 million tax increase with federal Medicaid officials this summer, regardless of the increase listed in the adopted state budget, and simply have state legislators adjust it in statute later.
“We have assured [the Connecticut Hospital Association] that the hospitals will be treated equitably,” Collibee said.
Connecticut legislators are expected to return in special session this summer or fall to adjust the state budget to compensate for likely cuts in federal aid. And since the hospital tax increase wouldn’t begin for 13 more months, legislators could adjust the tax then, or even during the regular 2026 session, which starts in early February.
“The provider tax is very important to everybody,” Ritter added.
But House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said Lamont and the legislature’s Democratic majority handled the hospital tax in disorganized manner.
“I am puzzled by the fact that the administration has never prioritized that [tax issue] to get it done before the budget was passed,” he said.
The hospital association wrote in a brief statement Wednesday that “Making the tax adjustment in the budget remains important to Connecticut hospitals. We are meeting with legislators and staff to discuss further.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0227_SR_ER_043-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425

(Faith Miller/Colorado Newsline)Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young on Wednesday became the fourth prominent Democrat to throw his hat in the ring for Colorado’s highly competitive 8th Congressional District.
“The residents of Colorado’s 8th District are worried about their economic future — and rightfully so,” Young said in a statement announcing his candidacy. “I’m running for Congress to stand up for working families, protect the programs they count on, and ensure our economy works for everyone, not just the wealthy few.

The 8th District is Colorado’s newest, most competitive and most diverse congressional seat. Drawn by an independent redistricting commission in 2021, it includes parts of Denver’s northern suburbs as well as more rural areas in southern Weld County. Four in 10 residents of the district are Latino.
The seat is currently held by U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican who unseated former Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo by a margin of fewer than 2,500 votes in the 2024 election. Despite representing one of the nation’s most evenly divided congressional districts, Evans has remained a steadfast supporter of President Donald Trump’s historically extreme anti-immigration agenda, his chaotic efforts to launch a global trade war and a sweeping GOP budget bill that would cut $625 billion from Medicaid.
Caraveo has launched a bid to win back her seat in 2026, joining a Democratic primary that also includes state Reps. Manny Rutinel of Commerce City and Shannon Bird of Westminster.
Young’s campaign announcement noted that he is the only Democratic primary candidate to hail from the district’s more conservative half in Weld County, calling him the Democrat “best positioned to win this seat back.” And it blasted Evans’ support for a package of deep cuts to Medicaid, which provides coverage to more than 1 in 4 of the 8th District’s residents.
“This is personal to me. My sister has severe developmental disabilities, and has been reliant on life sustaining support provided by Medicaid for much of her life,” Young said. “Congressman Gabe Evans and his GOP allies just voted to slash Medicaid benefits, which will impact tens of thousands of people in this district, as well as millions of others including people like my sister.”
“Colorado’s 8th Congressional District deserves a representative who shows up, listens, and delivers,” he added. “I’ve spent my life making government work better for people, and I’m ready to bring that same energy and experience to Washington.”

She wasn’t the only one getting kids out of the house, recalled Latosha Travis, a Jackson Public Schools child nutrition manager working with the district’s summer feeding program who oversaw the cafeteria at Key last year. 
“Kids gonna eat you out of house and home during the summer,” Travis said.

Starting this week through June 27, anyone under 18 years old can stop by one of 12 schools in Jackson for a free breakfast from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and lunch from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., regardless of whether or not they attend Jackson Public Schools. Adults can buy a meal for $4. 
The district’s federally funded program, now in its 33rd year, is intended to combat the rise in hunger that occurs during the summer, an issue of particular concern in Jackson, where the childhood poverty rate is just over 40%. 
“I put a little extra on their plate from time to time, knowing this is the only meal many of them will have today,” Travis said. 
JPS anticipates serving 18,000 breakfasts and 25,000 lunches this month, said Marc Rowe, the district’s executive director of child nutrition. He noted this is a different program from the one Mississippi opted out of last year due in part to a lack of funding from the state’s welfare agency. 
“Just like anything else in the climate we live in, at any point the funding could be pulled for this,” Rowe said. 
The district doesn’t track who is eating the meals, only how many are served. Travis, who has worked in the district’s cafeterias for 16 years, said schools situated in neighborhoods are more likely to serve families during the summer. 
“It depends on the location,” Travis said. “You see a lot of them come off the street with their children and cousins, little nieces and little babies and stuff. They all come through the line.”

Many of the meals will be served to children enrolled in local daycare centers or attending JPS’s summer camps, such as one that started this week at North Jackson Elementary School near the Tougaloo community. The program is limited to June due to JPS starting its school year earlier this year at the end of July. In prior years, the district served meals through mid-July.
Around 7:45 a.m., kids walked in with sleepy faces and colorful backpacks half the size of their bodies. Teachers said good morning and asked if they were eating breakfast, which was a sausage, egg and cheese burrito with taco sauce, a Pop-Tart, and orange juice or milk. 
Diamond Harris, who had brought a group of students for breakfast from the daycare at Caiden’s Christian Academy, said she sometimes cooks for her kids, which can be a heavy lift. “So it’s definitely beneficial for us and less stressful, and we are just really grateful,” she said.
The meals are based on USDA recipes, and the district also works with a food company, Walker Quality Services, to serve children healthy meals, Rowe said. When school is out, students might have junk food as their only option, which is why research has shown that as hunger spikes in the summer, so does obesity. 
“So the meals are very attractive, appetizing,” Rowe said. 
As part of her menu planning, Travis said she tries to introduce kids to food they haven’t tried before. Each meal comes with a fruit. Today it was plums for breakfast and watermelon for lunch. 
“A lot of kids don’t really know what a plum is,” she said. 
But it can be a challenge to get children to try food they aren’t used to, Travis said. During the school year, she’s at Green Elementary School off Hanging Moss Road, but she’s managed cafeterias all over the district, including at high schools. 
“Elementary children are more easy going and sweet and they love to eat,” she said. “High school students, they are very, very picky. They like a lot of hamburgers and fries. When you put down spaghetti you have to convince them to try. They’re used to fast food.” 
She also tries to feed kids meals from different cultures, so lunch at North Jackson tomorrow will be General Tso’s chicken and rice.

The measure, introduced as a strike-all amendment on the Senate floor Wednesday — a rewrite of another bill that also includes incentives for high performing nursing homes — cleared the chamber with unanimous support.
“Consumers need to be aware of increases over 10% and really have the ability to tell their stories, to tell the companies directly how this will affect them,” said Sen. Jan Hochadel, D-Meriden, co-chair of the Aging Committee. “Companies should also want the opportunity to explain why the rate increases are necessary. It’s making them accountable, but also transparent.”
In follow-up speeches, a Republican lawmaker and the Senate’s majority leader both expressed enthusiastic support for the proposal.
But within 24 hours, the bill appeared dead on arrival in the House.
A contingent of Republican legislators and at least one moderate Democrat planned to filibuster, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The move apparently came after representatives for the insurance sector registered their dissent.
A lobbyist for companies selling long-term care insurance policies confirmed he reached out to House lawmakers expressing opposition to the bill.
“We don’t hold public hearings; governmental entities hold public hearings,” said Eric George, president of the Insurance Association of Connecticut, which lobbies on behalf of the carriers. “We would have concerns with any requirement that we — private insurance companies — hold public hearings.”

Lawmakers in the House who had planned to take up the bill early this week said they were frustrated with the turn of events.
“There was nothing specific on how the companies needed to do this. They could do a regional meeting. They could partner with area agencies on aging and do five public hearings a year; at each one share what’s coming up,” said Rep. Jane Garibay, D-Windsor, co-chair of the Aging Committee. “We left it wide open.”
Hochadel, a key backer of the measure in the Senate, said she was blindsided by the pushback in the House.
“I’m shocked that they waited until it got out of the Senate to say, ‘Oh no, I have some issues with it,’” she said. “We wanted to try and give something back to the policyholders, because the rates keep increasing, and some of these people are dropping their plans after paying for years and years.
“We’re having a difficult budget year, so I understand that giving a tax credit or an exemption – things like that – are difficult,” she said, referring to other policies proposed this session. “That’s why I wanted to get some small portion adopted.”
Hochadel said the public hearing requirement would enhance transparency in the rate setting process without costing a lot of money. Proposals to offer policyholders a tax credit or tax deduction would have cost tens of millions of dollars.
“It seems like a very easy ask,” she said. “If you’re going to raise a policy by more than 10%, all you have to do is hold a public forum. … I am assuming some folks on the other side of the aisle are looking to help the insurance companies.
“These folks need some help, some relief,” she said of the policyholders. “It just boggles my mind.”
Earlier this year, lobbyists for the insurance companies testified against a volley of legislation that would help consumers with long-term care coverage, from capping annual rate increases to issuing consumer notifications with warnings about price hikes.
They opposed public hearing requirements in several bills this year and in previous years.
“I don’t think it’s in the consumers’ best interest to extend the period of time it takes to get products to the market,” George told The Connecticut Mirror when asked previously about resistance to public hearings.
“You would be adding to the bureaucracy of how this process goes. You already have the department approving the rates. I don’t see how the benefit would balance out the delay.”
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said he was unaware of the filibuster threat.
“Generally speaking, public hearings are fine to have,” Candelora said. “The problem we’ve seen with long-term care insurance rates is, the way they’re actuarially done, they’ve continued to increase and outpace people’s ability to pay. And it’s just something the legislature and the state have never been able to get their arms around.
“I think it’s a critical issue that we do need to tackle.”
Rep. Matt Blumenthal, D-Stamford, who himself introduced legislation this year to help LTCI policyholders, questioned the opposition to public hearings.
“There are a lot of vested interests [and people] who don’t want things to change. It’s a complex industry and a powerful industry,” he said. “I don’t understand why you’d be opposed to a public hearing if you’re willing to stand behind your rate increase requests and think they’re justified.”
Nearly 100,000 people in Connecticut have long-term care insurance — coverage that, depending on the policy, supports skilled in-home care, rehabilitation therapy, assisted living, nursing home stays and respite care.
A CT Mirror investigation found the annual cost of maintaining these policies has skyrocketed for many residents due to miscalculations by insurers on how long people would live, the price of care and how many would need it. Consumers face sizable rate increases, often exceeding 50% and, for a few dozen people, as high as 174%, according to a CT Mirror analysis.
A review of rate hikes from January 2019 to October 2024 shows more than 17,000 people with long-term care policies have gotten hit with increases of 50% or more. Some of the biggest companies in the market, including Genworth Financial, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Transamerica Life Insurance Company, requested hikes for five years in a row beginning in 2019.
When providers seek premium increases, thousands of consumers can be affected. In 2019, for example, Genworth Financial requested a 40% rate hike on more than 9,000 Connecticut policyholders. In 2021, Transamerica requested a 20% rate increase on 8,000 policies. The Insurance Department approved both requests with no changes.
In 2022, Genworth raised rates for more than 2,000 people by an average of 97%, with increases ranging from 79% to 173%, depending on the policy. The approved amounts were a slight reduction from the company’s original request.
As consumers are squeezed, grievances filed with the Connecticut Insurance Department have mounted. The office received more than 700 complaints in the last six years about long-term care insurance, mostly rising premiums.
Solutions have been elusive. Legislators introduced more than 50 bills from 2019 to 2024, with only a small number passing and offering limited relief. They blamed budget constraints and pushback from insurers, among other problems.
Legislative efforts impacted by costs and fierce opposition
Five wide ranging bills were advanced by legislative committees this session, with lawmakers pledging urgent reform.
But substantial costs associated with some solutions and sharp opposition to others slowed progress.
Measures that would give policyholders a financial break in the form of a tax credit or tax deduction hit a wall due to sizable costs. Estimates by the state’s Office of Fiscal Analysis put the price of one tax credit at $67.2 million and a tax deduction at $20.2 million.
Despite Connecticut being on pace to close this fiscal year with the second-largest surplus in state history — a nearly $2.4 billion windfall according to Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration — officials were wary of providing tax relief in the state budget.
Given ongoing congressional efforts to make unprecedented cuts in Medicaid, lawmakers fear Connecticut stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
Legislators also proposed 10% caps on annual rate increases, public hearings, consumer notifications warning of the risk of large premium increases, and a sweeping audit of the state’s regulation of long-term care insurance. Other measures would have tied annual rate hikes to the consumer price index, required insurers to certify that premium increases are necessary to prevent a material risk of insolvency, and barred carriers from entering into state contracts if they don’t comply with LTCI policy changes.
Many consumers and legislators testified in support of the bills, while insurers opposed them.
“If a reduction in these outrageous premiums is not legislated, policyholders will be forced to drop these policies,” Jan Kritzman, who herself has endured large rate increases, told lawmakers in February. “If they end up in a nursing home, then here comes Title 19 Medicaid. Thank you, taxpayers of the state of Connecticut.
“My husband and I have long-term health insurance policies from Transamerica. We have endured a 350% increase in our premium since 2004. This May, our annual premium combined will be more than $6,000 … this is after I pared down the policy benefits in 2021.”
“Residents, mostly seniors … are being forced to choose between buying food, paying their rent or mortgage or paying for their long-term care insurance,” Newington resident David Schwartzer said. “Solving this problem is not easy. It takes courage to write new laws that will serve the citizens of Connecticut and not the insurance industry.”
Representatives for the insurance companies warned the proposals would have “serious consequences” and undermine the financial stability of long-term care insurance policies.
“Actuarially sound rates are essential to achieving this goal, and deviating from this principle may lead to inadequate premiums, jeopardizing insurer stability and consumer protection,” George wrote in joint testimony with officials from America’s Health Insurance Plans and the American Council of Life Insurers.
Rep. Lucy Dathan, co-chair of the Government Oversight Committee, which passed a bill on the issue in March, said it was an especially tight budget year. For the last four years, Connecticut has used billions in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds to prop up an array of state initiatives. But nearly all of that money has been exhausted.
Dathan and her colleagues had proposed, among other things, an audit of the state’s long-term care partnership plan, a review of Connecticut’s policies for regulating this coverage, and an evaluation of an alternative insurance pool for policyholders. The reviews would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
“I was told there was a lot of stuff that wasn’t advanced because it needed an external group to come in and do the review or study, and we didn’t have room in the budget,” she said. “There was a pretty ruthless budget focus this year and making sure we were under the spending cap, trying not to let anything new in.”
Lawmakers said they would continue to look at ways to offer relief to policyholders.
“This is an issue that requires a lot of sophistication in the industry, and I’m hopeful we’ll be able to work with the insurance department in the off session to do something substantive to help people,” Blumenthal said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0127_SR_BankersLife009-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 13:12:47.278434

Free.,Federal judge unseals some records in Abrego Garcia case,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-unseals-some-records-abrego-garcia-case,,"WASHINGTON — The Maryland federal judge overseeing the lawsuit concerning the wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia unsealed documents Wednesday that the Trump administration had asked to keep unavailable to the public under the so-called state secrets privilege.The order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis unsealed three documents that she said did not contain any privileged information. Xinis questioned the Trump administration’s broad use of the privilege during a hearing last month.The request to unseal the documents came from a coalition of news organizations, arguing First Amendment rights and the public’s right to information in a case that has become a flashpoint between the judiciary branch and the Trump administration.“The Press Movants rightly contend that, at common law, the public enjoys a presumptive right to access court records, overcome only when outweighed by competing interests,” Xinis wrote Wednesday.President Donald Trump has said Abrego Garcia, who was removed in March due to an “administrative error,” will not return to the U.S. and Department of Justice attorneys on behalf of the Trump administration have argued in court that the Maryland man is in the custody of El Salvador and the federal government has no authority to bring him back.In a separate case of another wrongly deported immigrant to El Salvador, the Department of Justice submitted a document detailing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was personally working with the Salvadoran government to return a 20-year-old referred to in court documents as only ""Cristian,"" after another federal judge ordered his return.Discovery documentsSome of the filings that were unsealed Wednesday had been public until the Trump administration moved to seal them.One unsealed record related to an April discovery request Abrego Garcia’s attorneys made to the government seeking information about how the administration was facilitating Abrego Garcia’s return from El Salvador. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration must facilitate the Maryland man’s return, but stopped short of requiring it.Another document related to the Trump administration’s request for more time in discovery proceedings.“It does not disclose any potentially privileged or otherwise sensitive information for which a compelling government interest outweighs the right to access,” Xinis wrote.One document was partially redacted, because it “includes some information potentially implicated by the state secrets privilege,” Xinis wrote.The document, signed by Abrego Garcia attorney Jonathan G. Cooper, objected to the Trump administration’s attempt to pause discovery. The government had argued that complying with discovery in the lawsuit would hinder efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return.“As we explained to the government, in our meet-and-confer, we do not understand why the production of documents or interrogatory responses — none of which has occurred in the public eye — has any bearing on efforts to facilitate Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release and return,” Cooper wrote in the partially redacted document unsealed Wednesday.A fourth document, a transcript from a late April hearing, will be released but redacted until the high-profile case is settled, Xinis wrote.“Although the Court does not wholly agree with the Defendants’ overbroad characterizations of the government interests at stake, the Court does recognize that certain information touches upon Defendants’ asserted state secrets privilege as applied to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the State Department,” she wrote about the partially redacted transcript.",,,,2025-06-04 13:12:47.278434
,California,2025-06-04 17:03:55+00:00,CalMatters,These gas appliances — one of the largest sources of LA’s smog — could be phased out,Alejandra Reyes-Velarde,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/06/gas-appliances-smog-la-south-coast/,Air quality board will vote Friday on phasing out water heaters and furnaces powered by natural gas. These appliances emit more smog-causing gases than the region's largest industrial polluters.,"In summary
Air quality board will vote Friday on phasing out water heaters and furnaces powered by natural gas. These appliances emit more smog-causing gases than the region’s largest industrial polluters. 



New household water heaters and heating systems powered by natural gas would be phased out in the Los Angeles basin under two controversial rules that air quality regulators will vote on Friday. 
Manufacturers would sell increasing percentages of zero-emission heating appliances in the four-county Los Angeles basin — beginning with 30% in 2027 — and pay fees if they sell natural gas ones, under the draft rules.
Home appliances are among the largest sources of smog-causing gases remaining in the L.A. basin, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Officials there say the measures would eliminate the second largest amount of pollutants of any rule they have enacted over the past several decades. 
Consumers won’t have to switch their appliances. However, when their natural gas water heaters, central heating systems and furnaces break down and it’s time to replace them, they can choose to buy zero-emission heat pumps powered by electricity. 
Based on the lifetime of these appliances — 25 years for heating systems and 15 years for water heaters — about 200,000 furnaces and 300,000 water heaters will be replaced annually in the region, according to the air district.
The cost of buying and installing a heat pump to replace natural gas appliances varies, depending on what people need: Replacing an entire HVAC system with a heat pump would cost consumers about the same or even less than a natural gas system, according to the South Coast district’s estimate. But installing a heat pump instead of a natural gas water heater would cost $2,000 more, and replacing just a furnace would cost $8,000 more.
Contractors and developers oppose the phaseout, saying the fees paid by manufacturers will be passed on to residents, businesses and landlords.  
“This money is not coming out of thin air,” said Brian Johsz, advocacy manager for the Los Angeles County Business Federation. “It’s a solution in search of a problem in a lot of ways. It’s just putting the financial burden on residents when we are already seeing they have such a hard time trying to make ends meet right now.” 
SoCalGas officials say the rules would limit consumer choices and raise the cost of appliances. The company also said the measures would be preempted by federal law because they effectively ban appliances covered by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. 
“Over time, the public will be forced to pay hundreds of dollars more to replace their gas appliances,” wrote Kevin Barker, a senior manager for SoCal Gas’s energy and environmental policy, in a letter to the district. “It is not in the public interest, especially at a time when consumers are demanding affordable energy solutions, to raise upfront costs of the most affordable options.” 
But air quality officials say that consumers will save money by switching to electric heaters. Between 2027 and 2061, residents in the four-county region will collectively save an annual average of between $191 million and $250 million on utility bill costs by switching from natural gas to electricity, according to the district’s estimate.

Under the proposed rules, manufacturers have two compliance options: They can sell all zero-emission units by 2027 or they can pay a fee for each gas appliance they continue to sell. The funds will be used to offer incentives to help low-income residents and landlords buy heat pumps. 
Environmental groups say the air agency should move more quickly. The L.A. region still has the nation’s worst smog despite half a century of efforts, so it has a long way to go before its residents breathe air that meets federal health standards.
“There are still a lot of emission reductions that are being left on the table that will either have to be taken up with subsequent rules or are being foregone,” said Chris Chavez, deputy policy director with the Clean Air Coalition,
The air quality agency’s original plans, which were years in the making, would have guaranteed substantially more emissions reductions. The proposal would have required manufacturers to sell 100% zero-emission water heaters and furnaces by 2031. But after pushback from businesses and gas companies about affordability concerns, the air district amended it.
Under the current draft, the targets are 30% of water heaters and furnaces sold in 2027 would be zero-emissions, ramping up to 50% in 2029, 75% in 2033 and 90% in 2036. Manufacturers will have to pay fees between $500 and $50 for each natural gas one sold in the region. 
The air district expects 90% of all water heaters and furnaces in the region will be zero emissions in 2061. 
Chavez said the original version was projected to eliminate 10 tons per day, accounting for 18% of all the nitrogen oxide emissions in the basin. The proposal as written now reduces emissions by six tons per day.  
Nihal Shrinath, an attorney for the Sierra Club, said “we’ve seen the Trump administration really waging a war on clean energy. And concurrently we have the South Coast (district) basically caving to gas lobbying efforts and really weakening a rule they have been working on for years.
“All the while, the air district is in extreme noncompliance with federal air quality standards and we’re the most polluted air basin in the country,” he said.
The South Coast district’s governing board will hold a public hearing and vote Friday on the measures, which update two emissions rules that the agency set in 1978 and 1982.
Billions of dollars in health savings 
Gas appliances in the L.A. region — mostly water heaters and furnaces — emit more nitrogen oxides and fine particles into the air than power plants, refineries and oil and gas production combined, according to the non-partisan research group Rocky Mountain Institute. 
The basin’s 10 million water heaters and furnaces emit almost 7 tons of nitrogen oxides and 1.5 tons of fine particles each day, according to air district data. In comparison, oil refineries — the region’s largest industrial polluters — emit far less, about 3 tons of nitrogen oxides and fine particles combined daily.
Nitrogen oxides react with other gases in the air and bake in the sun to form ozone, the main ingredient of smog, which causes asthma attacks and other health effects. The gases also pollute indoor air and can trigger respiratory effects. Fine particles can lodge in lungs and raise the risk of heart attacks and respiratory disease.
Between 2027 and 2053, the rules would save $59 billion in health expenses, according to the air district. Each year, the reduction in pollution would prevent an average of 280 new asthma diagnoses, 44 emergency room visits from respiratory problems and 6,100 lost school days, according to the district’s data. That doesn’t include health benefits calculated from the reduction in fine particles.
The Bay Area already has similar rules, enacted in 2023, that mandate zero-emission water heaters in 2027, furnaces in 2029 and large commercial water heaters in 2031. However, they are being amended to allow more flexibility for manufacturers to comply.  
The region’s two largest cities, Los Angeles and Long Beach, have passed resolutions supporting the South Coast district’s rules, while Huntington Beach, Fullerton, Riverside, Rancho Palos Verdes and other conservative cities are opposed.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051925_Water-Heaters-Lowes_LV_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 13:12:47.278434

The Council will study and recommend options for a comprehensive statewide approach to cannabis that is grounded in public health and public safety considerations. Stein’s order says the new council will learn from lessons in other states and experts and focus on the protection and safety of all North Carolinians, especially the state’s youth.
The council announced Wednesday includes 24 members and will be co-chaired by State Health Director Lawrence Greenblatt and Robeson County District attorney Matt Scott. Other who will serve on the board will be representatives from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Public Safety, the state Department of Justice, local law enforcement officials, as well as North Carolina farmers. Notably, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians would also have a seat at the table. The Eastern Band first approved the use of medicinal cannabis in 2021, launching recreational marijuana sales on its tribal land last year.

In an interview with WRAL on Tuesday, Gov. Stein likened the current situation surrounding cannabis and THC products to the ‘wild, wild West.’
“The idea that we have a system where this product, which is a drug that can get you high, is for sale out there without any restrictions on how it’s sold to me is insane,” said Stein.
Legislators have been grappling with whether to legalize medical marijuana for several sessions as well as how to address the growing number of vape stores that sell THC-infused products.
Stein said he hopes the new council can bring Republicans and Democrats from both chambers together to work with health professionals and law enforcement to find common ground.
What’s clear, said the governor, is that the unregulated marketplace is not working.
“Just go into a vape shop, ask the clerk what product will get me the most high and they will give you something. And it would get you high if you were to take it. So that’s not acceptable,” Stein said. “So, if we don’t accept the status quo, what do we want the reality to actually be?”
According to the governor’s office the rate of emergency department visits in North Carolina for intoxicating cannabis ingestion among children and youth ages 17 and under has increased more than 600 percent in recent years, and among older teens, the rate has increased more than 1,000 percent.
Senator Bill Rabon, a cancer survivor and the primary sponsor of the Compassionate Care Act, has been a leading voice for medical marijuana legislation. He is one of four legislators asked to serve on the advisory council.
Rabon (R-Brunswick) told his colleagues last year that there was very little difference between products like Delta 9 and marijuana and the state would be wise to craft its own regulatory framework. Legislation to regulate hemp-derive consumables and medicinal marijuana passed the NC Senate last June, only to languish in the House.
The new Council will consider public health considerations, potential marijuana prescriptions for certain conditions, as well as what regulatory guardrails are needed regarding potency and purity standards.
Another consideration would be the possibility of expunging past convictions that do not align with the recommendations of the Council, including for simple possession of marijuana.
According to Pew Research, nearly six-in-ten Americans (57%) believe that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes. USA Today, citing the group DISA Global Solutions, reported in April that North Carolina is one of a tiny minority of just six states in which marijuana is fully illegal for both recreational and medicinal purposes.
The North Carolina Advisory Council on Cannabis will hold its first meeting in July submitting preliminary recommendations for a comprehensive cannabis policy to the Stein by March 15, 2026.
In the meantime, the governor said he would like the General Assembly to prohibit the sales of products that contain intoxicating THC to anyone under 21 by requiring photo ID age-verification, while requiring packaging that lets adults know what is actually in the cannabis products they may be buying.

The CBO, the official financial scorekeeper for Congress, estimates that Trump’s tariffs, as they stand now, would lower the U.S. gross domestic product, or the total value of a country’s goods and services, on average by 0.6% per year through 2035. In addition to increasing costs on supplies and other assets businesses use in production, the tariffs are expected to raise prices on consumer goods in the next couple years. The CBO projects the price index used to measure personal consumption will be 0.9% higher by the end of 2026.While lower-income households spend a higher percentage of their income on consumer goods, the CBO projects that prices will increase the most on goods like home appliances and vehicles more likely to be purchased by higher earners.The eight-page analysis only takes into account the effects of Trump’s tariffs as of May 13. These include the following taxes calculated on the value of imports: a baseline 10% on goods from most countries; a base of 30% on all goods from China and Hong Kong; 25% on most foreign vehicles and auto parts; 25% on steel and aluminum; and 25% on certain goods from Canada and Mexico.The CBO released the figures in response to a request from U.S. Senate Democrats wanting to know the cost of the administration's import taxes.The report did not take into account any tariff changes after May 13, including Trump’s doubling to 50% the import taxes on steel and aluminum. The report also did not factor in changes that could result from a May 29 trade court decision striking down most of Trump’s tariffs — though an appeals court swiftly left them in place while the case plays out.",,,,2025-06-04 13:12:47.278434

Rick Smith, the warning coordination meteorologist in Norman, said the radios seemed to be operational for the “bulk” of Tuesday’s severe weather. 
Maintenance will continue through 4 p.m. Thursday. 
The Norman office is not aware of any complaints of any service issues during Tuesday’s severe weather, Smith said. The public was warned of the outage Monday. 
The maintenance is “mandated” computer upgrades required of all National Weather Service locations, he said. The Norman office was one of around 20 offices to receive the upgrades at this time, Smith said. 
The office remains staffed during the maintenance period and a “back-up office” in Tulsa will conduct forecast operations and the “core warning and forecast products and services will not be impacted,” according to a statement. 
Erica Grow Cei, a spokesperson for the National Weather Service said people should have multiple methods for receiving alerts, such as broadcast media, weather apps and emergency alerts on mobile devices. 
“This is a scheduled and necessary upgrade for our system, and the National Weather Service office in Norman, OK is ready for it,” she said in a statement. “Watches, warnings, and forecast products will continue to be issued in a timely fashion through a wide range of distribution channels including mobile apps, push alerts, websites, local television and radio.”
The Norman office is also being assisted during the disruption by neighboring local forecast offices, Cei said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-04 16:37:26+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Waiting for government action on air pollution, Pascagoula community grabs the wheel",Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/04/waiting-for-government-action-on-air-pollution-pascagoula-community-grabs-the-wheel/,Delay in MDEQ air quality monitoring prompts Pascagoula community residents to confirm pollutants on their own.,"After 14 years of pushing for safer air quality for her Pascagoula neighborhood, 78-year-old Barbara Weckesser is tired of waiting for government officials tasked with such responsibilities to take action. 
In the last seven years alone, she said, over 30 people in her Cherokee Forest neighborhood of just 120 homes have died from heart disease, lung disease or cancer. In 2013, Weckesser started her activist group, Cherokee Concerned Citizens, which has long blamed releases from surrounding industrial operations – including a Chevron oil refinery, a Bollinger shipyard and a Rolls-Royce Naval center – for poor health outcomes in their community. 
“Industry has grown, and chosen to put out more and more and more pollution,” Weckesser said. “And guess what? Our bodies can’t absorb it.” 
Then in 2021, a ProPublica analysis of Environmental Protection Agency data identified the area as one of the nation’s top hot spots of toxic air pollution. Weckesser said that investigation helped boost her cause’s credibility.
Cherokee Concerned Citizens have remained active against potential environmental harms from local industry. Last year, the group sued the EPA for approving a plastic-based fuel experiment at Chevron’s Pascagoula facility that, ProPublica revealed, could have caused cancer to one in four exposed to production emissions. The EPA then in September said it planned to withdraw its approval. 
Weckesser spoke on the phone days before heading to Atlanta to graduate from an environmental justice academy program, through Tuskegee University, that empowered community leaders across the South with knowledge and resources to lead their respective causes. Hearing from former EPA officials, she said the academy taught her a lot, including potential legal avenues for protecting the Cherokee Forest neighborhood. 
In 2022, a year after the ProPublica story, the EPA awarded the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality $500,000 to monitor air quality in Pascagoula, later increasing the amount to $625,000. 
But both agencies have yet to give a timeline for the yearlong study. So instead of waiting, Weckesser partnered with University of Colorado Boulder researcher Caroline Frischmon to do their own investigation, the results of which they published in March. 
“This is the best data that we’ve had,” Weckesser said.
Their study used air sensors to compare “episodes” of pollution – or when the sensors detected rising levels of chemicals such as ammonia or VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) – in the neighborhood with those at another location near downtown Pascagoula, about two miles away. VOCs, the EPA says, can cause liver and kidney damage as well as cancer.

The episodes in Cherokee Forest, Frischmon found, were much more frequent than at the other location, and in total lasted about four to five times longer over the course of two months. On top of the significant frequency of those episodes, she also pointed to correlating wind direction data suggesting the pollution came from the nearby industry. 
The timing of those episodes, Frischmon added, also lined up with health symptoms and observations residents recorded, such as red or itchy eyes, nausea – all known impacts of exposure to ammonia and VOCs – and strong “chemical” odors. The largest spike in symptoms, the study says, came just after a jump in emissions from the Chevron refinery. 
When asked about the study, MDEQ Communications Director Jan Schaefer said the agency wouldn’t comment on research that didn’t use “EPA-approved methods.” Mississippi Today also reached out to several facilities, including Chevron, Ingalls and Rolls-Royce, but did not hear back before publication. 
Fischmon admitted the work has its limitations. Most notably, she said, they couldn’t afford calibrated sensors that could say if pollutant levels exceeded public health guidelines. She said her team was set to receive federal funding to expand the study, but in May the EPA said via email, “The agency determined that your application no longer supports administrative priorities and canceled issuance of an award.”
While the EPA-funded monitoring MDEQ is planning would include more advanced measurements, it’s unclear when the state agency will begin its year-long study. 
“We are currently working with EPA to finalize the Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and install two EPA-loaned VOC sensors,” Schaefer said in a May email, over two and a half years since the EPA announced the grant. “Official data collection will begin once those sensors are installed and the QAPP is finalized.”

Meanwhile, Cherokee Forest residents are hoping to pool enough dollars from public and private stakeholders to fund buy-outs of their homes. According to a survey, nearly three-quarters of those living in the neighborhood want to relocate “as soon as possible.” Weckesser said Cherokee Concerned Citizens is proposing to convert the area into a natural buffer since the neighborhood, which was built in the 1960s, sits in a flood zone.  
Fischmon said she hopes the March study can serve as a model for communities elsewhere who may be discouraged by the high costs of measuring air pollutants. She said the sensors they used for this study cost around $1,000 to build, but that there are others commercially available for around $200. 
“ It is becoming more and more feasible, which I think is really exciting because communities can really tailor what they want to measure for what they’re feeling and noticing,” she said. “ We did this project really to demonstrate that there’s still a lot that we can do with these sensors for communities to highlight issues and get the attention of the agencies that do have the resources to do the (more advanced) monitoring.”

Last Friday, Weckesser graduated from the environmental justice program at a ceremony held in an Embassy Suites hotel in Atlanta. Despite no prior environmental work experience – her only jobs before were in banking and real estate – she said she finished third in her class.
“ The class taught how people need to start holding their own with industry and say, you are not doing this anymore,” Weckesser said, adding she was the oldest student in the academy. “And I only have a high school education. So you can achieve whatever you want to achieve.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/04093818/9DD_5604-1.jpg,,,2025-06-04 13:12:47.278434

Read this story in English.
Los Republicanos en el Congreso están cada vez más cerca de aprobar una importante ley que podría afectar todo, desde los impuestos hasta inmigración y Medicaid.
La “Gran y Hermosa Ley” es el vehículo para promulgar gran parte de la agenda del segundo mandato del presidente Donald J. Trump. Los Republicanos quieren extender las exenciones fiscales de la ley tributaria de 2017, aprobada durante su primer mandato y que expirará a finales de año.
La legislación tiene implicaciones fiscales para individuos y familias de la mayoría de los niveles de ingresos, así como para empresas y universidades. Para compensar algunos de estos costos, el proyecto de ley incluye fuertes recortes de gastos, que tendrían un impacto directo en algunos programas de protección social.
Dado que controlan ambas cámaras del Congreso, los Republicanos pueden aprobar un proyecto de ley de presupuesto por su cuenta. Sin embargo, han estado lidiando con conflictos internos, y el proyecto de ley podría terminar considerablemente diferente en las etapas finales.
Los Demócratas, incluida la delegación del Congreso de Connecticut, se oponen y no participan en la elaboración del proyecto de ley. Argumentan que beneficiará desproporcionadamente a los estadounidenses más ricos y a las grandes corporaciones, inflará la deuda nacional y recortará servicios esenciales.
A continuación, se presenta la situación actual del proyecto de ley y lo que podría significar para sus finanzas.
¿Cómo afectará a mis impuestos en el futuro?
Las personas y los hogares en Connecticut podrían ver un alivio rápido en algunos de sus impuestos. Sin embargo, parte de este alivio será solo temporal y durará hasta el final del mandato de Trump.
Hace permanentes muchas de las exenciones fiscales de la Ley de Reducción de Impuestos y Empleos de 2017, ya que expirarán a finales de año, incluyendo tasas de impuesto sobre la renta más bajas.
Uno de los aspectos más debatidos del proyecto de ley ha sido si se debe aumentar el límite de las deducciones de los impuestos estatales y locales (SALT). Si el límite aumenta, será especialmente beneficioso para los estados con un costo de vida más alto, como Connecticut.
El proyecto de ley elevaría el límite de $10,000 para las deducciones SALT a $40,000, que se eliminaría gradualmente para quienes ganan más de $500,000. Ambos límites aumentarían un 1% hasta 2033. Sin embargo, es probable que el Senado modifique esta disposición.
Los trabajadores podrían deducir el pago de horas extras o propinas de su impuesto federal sobre la renta. Además, se podría deducir hasta $10,000 en intereses sobre los préstamos para automóviles, siempre que el vehículo se haya ensamblado en EE. UU. Las tres exenciones fiscales estarían vigentes hasta 2028.
Las familias podrían solicitar un crédito tributario por hijo ligeramente mayor. El reembolso aumentaría a $2,500 hasta 2028 y luego volvería a bajar a $2,000, indexado a la inflación. También exige que los padres que declaran impuestos conjuntamente tengan número de Seguro Social.
Las personas mayores de 65 años con ingresos bajos o medios podrán obtener una deducción adicional de $4,000. El proyecto de ley crearía automáticamente nuevas cuentas de ahorro para los recién nacidos entre el 1 de enero de 2025 y el 1 de enero de 2029. El gobierno federal otorgaría un depósito único de $1,000 para invertirlo en la bolsa de valores. Otros podrían contribuir hasta $5,000 al año hasta los 18 años.
También habría cambios en los préstamos estudiantiles y la asistencia financiera.
Quienes reciban la Beca Pell y deseen obtener el monto máximo deben ser estudiantes de tiempo completo. Según el proyecto de ley, los estudiantes tendrían que aumentar el número de créditos que cursan cada semestre de 12 a 15 para alcanzar ese nivel. Deben ser estudiantes de medio tiempo para recibir al menos alguna ayuda. Además, ampliaría estas becas en otros casos, haciendo que la formación profesional a corto plazo sea elegible para la Beca Pell.
Además, el proyecto de ley reduciría el número de planes de pago basados ​​en los ingresos para pagar los préstamos estudiantiles y eliminaría los préstamos federales subsidiados para estudiantes universitarios.
Los consumidores ya no verían las exenciones fiscales para vehículos eléctricos y electrodomésticos de bajo consumo que formaban parte de la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación de los Demócratas.
¿Perderé el acceso a las prestaciones de Medicaid o SNAP?
No necesariamente. Pero se esperan recortes si se promulgan requisitos laborales más estrictos y otros cambios. Si el proyecto de ley se aprueba en su forma actual, estos podrían entrar en vigor a finales de 2026.
La Oficina de Presupuesto del Congreso, que analiza y evalúa los proyectos de ley federales, estima que hasta 10 millones de personas podrían perder la cobertura de Medicaid y alrededor de 3 millones podrían perder la asistencia alimentaria en EE. UU. durante la próxima década.
Para calificar a Medicaid como adulto menor de 65 años, deberá trabajar o participar en capacitación, educación o servicio comunitario al menos 80 horas al mes. Se hacen exenciones para ciertos grupos, como mujeres embarazadas o en posparto, beneficiarios de Medicare, veteranos, cuidadores y personas con discapacidad.
Para quienes cumplan con este requisito, el proyecto de ley les exigiría que reportaran su trabajo y el estado realizaría verificaciones frecuentes para garantizar su elegibilidad. Esos mismos adultos también tendrían que pagar un copago de $35 por la mayoría de los servicios.
El proyecto de ley también busca penalizar a estados como Connecticut que ofrecen Medicaid sin importar el estatus migratorio. “HUSKY para inmigrantes” brinda atención médica estatal a niños menores de 15 años y personas en posparto con ingresos que califican. Connecticut utiliza sus propios fondos para brindar dicha cobertura, pero podría verse expuesto a reducciones en su reembolso federal de Medicaid por hacerlo.
Según la propuesta del Programa de Asistencia Nutricional Suplementaria (SNAP), más estadounidenses mayores tendrían que trabajar o capacitarse al menos 80 horas al mes. El proyecto de ley eleva el límite de edad para adultos sanos sin dependientes de 54 a 64 años.
Actualmente, se considera que los dependientes son menores de 18 años. Sin embargo, en lo que respecta al SNAP, el proyecto de ley reduciría significativamente la edad de un dependiente a menos de 7 años. Esto significa que los requisitos de trabajo también se aplicarían a los adultos sanos con hijos de 7 años o más para recibir beneficios.
Estados como Connecticut tendrían que pagar una parte de los beneficios del SNAP por primera vez en la historia del programa. Esto ha generado preocupación por posibles recortes a las prestaciones.
¿Cuál es la situación del proyecto de ley de Trump en el Congreso?
Los Republicanos están utilizando un proceso acelerado conocido como conciliación presupuestaria. Esto les permite evitar las obstrucciones en el Senado y aprobar ciertos tipos de proyectos de ley sin depender del apoyo de los Demócratas. Sin embargo, el proceso aún puede tardar meses en completarse.
A finales de mayo, los Republicanos de la Cámara de Representantes aprobaron por un estrecho margen el proyecto de ley llamado “Gran y Hermosa Ley” tras semanas de negociaciones y divisiones dentro del partido sobre qué incluir.
Con el Congreso regresando del receso la primera semana de junio, el Senado ahora se ocupará del tema. Realizarán sus propias negociaciones tediosas, una serie de votaciones nocturnas sobre las enmiendas y luego una votación final sobre su aprobación.
Dado que es probable que el Senado introduzca cambios, los Republicanos de ambas cámaras tendrían que conciliar las diferencias y votar sobre un proyecto de ley de compromiso. Los Republicanos pretenden concluir el proceso y enviarlo a Trump para su firma antes del 4 de julio. Pero podría llevar más tiempo si el partido sigue dividido sobre la versión final.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
 The ‘balance sheet’

In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.
Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”

Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
 Housing arguments

The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”

Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
 The costs of management

In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

Many students feel  stuck paying for classes that don’t align with their professional goals.,"Imagine this: You’re getting ready to register for your college classes, and you’re met with the mountain of required — but unrelated to your major — general education courses. This is the reality for college students. Extensive gen-ed courses take up a lot of time, increasing costs and possibly delaying graduation.


According to Best Colleges, only 49% of undergraduate students nationwide actually finish their degree in just four years, and I believe these unnecessary courses are to blame. At Central Connecticut State University, undergraduates must complete 41 to 46 credits of gen-ed classes — 40% of the credits needed for a bachelor’s degree. This system makes students spend extra time and money on classes that often have little to do with their intended careers.

Allyson Hickey
Supporters argue that gen-eds create well-rounded students. Schools like UConn, for example, defend their own gen-ed programs by claiming they help students navigate future challenges through broad learning. UConn’s system, however, is less intensive: It requires just 21 credits, half as many as CCSU.
At CCSU, the policy appears more demanding. Students must take multiple courses in written and oral communication, world languages, arts and humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and even “Thriving in College” lectures. Some subjects range from three to four classes each. 
Many students feel swamped with coursework and stuck paying for classes that don’t align with their professional goals. As a student myself, I see how these unnecessary courses affect my college life. Instead of building skills for our intended careers, many of us are wasting time sitting through classes that have little to no impact on our education and are almost a review of high school classes.
Cutting down on CCSU’s gen-ed load — or allowing it to be optional for students who might need the review — would save money, reduce dropout rates and get students into their fields faster.
If universities truly want to set their students up for success, they need to rethink the congested gen-ed system. Right now, students are paying too much and waiting too long to earn degrees that should empower them — not exhaust them.

,DC,2025-06-04 16:00:58+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump-backed giant tax and spending bill bloats deficit by $2.4T, nonpartisan CBO says",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-backed-giant-tax-and-spending-bill-bloats-deficit-24t-nonpartisan-cbo-says,,"WASHINGTON — The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released detailed analysis Wednesday showing Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion during the next decade.CBO projects that if enacted as written, the legislation would result in 10.9 million people losing access to health insurance by 2034, a number that includes “1.4 million people without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status who would no longer be covered in state-only funded programs in 2034.”The score is the most up-to-date analysis by Congress’ official scorekeeper on how the sweeping tax and spending cuts package the House approved last month will impact the federal budget in the years ahead.Republicans have been highly critical of the CBO’s assessment of the legislation’s real-world impacts, arguing that keeping tax rates as they are now, instead of letting them rise at the end of the year when the 2017 GOP tax law expires, will boost economic growth.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., lambasted the CBO during a press conference shortly after the report came out, arguing its economic growth projections haven’t been completely accurate.""This bill will actually reduce the deficit, if you recognize the historical economic growth that has always been there,"" Scalise said. ""To say you're going to get 1.8% growth. At a minimum, we think you can get 2.5 to 4% growth. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, says over 4% economic growth. So I get that we've got to play by the rules of the referee, but the referee has been wrong.""Disagreement over the ‘big beautiful bill’GOP lawmakers have also sought to brush aside criticism from some of their own members, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who both argue the legislation must cut spending more to reduce the federal deficit in the long run.Billionaire and former Trump administration staffer Elon Musk has also become increasingly vocal about his opposition to the package, writing on social media this week that the “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.”The House voted mostly along party lines in May to send the sweeping spending and tax cuts package to the Senate, which is expected to debate and amend the legislation in the weeks ahead.CBO’s analysis will likely inform some of that conversation, and help senators better understand how the policy changes proposed by their House colleagues would affect state government budgets and the communities they represent. The CBO previously shared analysis of each of the 11 bills that make up the package, but those didn’t reflect several changes GOP House leaders made just hours before the floor vote in that chamber.Updated numbersThe updated projections show Republicans’ plan to extend the 2017 tax law and make other tweaks to tax policy would increase the deficit by $3.754 trillion during the next decade. That increase to the deficit caused by the tax changes, which CBO has also found would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners, would be partly offset by spending reductions on certain programs.The Armed Services Committee’s bill would increase deficits by $144 billion. Homeland Security’s provisions would increase deficits by $79 billion. And the Judiciary Committee’s language would increase deficits by $9 billion during the 10-year budget window.The section of the package drafted by the Energy and Commerce Committee, which would make substantial changes to Medicaid and several other programs within the panel’s jurisdiction, would decrease spending by $1.086 trillion during the 10-year budget window.The panel’s bill has four subcategories: energy, environment, communications and health. The health provisions, which include substantial changes to Medicaid, would reduce federal spending by $902 billion between 2025 and 2034.Language barring Medicaid from covering gender transition procedures for anyone in the state-federal health program would reduce federal spending by $2.6 billion during the next decade.Requiring some people on Medicaid to work, participate in community service or attend educational programs for at least 80 hours a month would reduce federal spending by $344 billion during the next 10 years.Blocking any Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood would cut federal costs by $261 million during the 10-year budget window. Federal law already bars health care programs like Medicaid from covering abortions unless the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or it endangers the life of the woman.Democratic criticismEnergy and Commerce Committee ranking member Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, wrote in a statement that it's ""shocking House Republicans rushed to vote on this bill without an accounting from CBO on the millions of people who will lose their health care or the trillions of dollars it would add to the national (deficit).""The truth is Republican leaders raced to pass this bill under cover of night because they didn’t want the American people or even their own members to know about its catastrophic consequences.”The Agriculture Committee's provisions, including pushing off some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to states, would reduce federal spending by $238 billion during the next decade.The Education and Workforce Committee’s language would decrease federal spending by $349 billion. The Financial Services section of the package would reduce federal spending by $5 billion. Natural Resources would lower spending by $18 billion. Oversight and Government Reform would decrease spending by $12 billion. And Transportation and Infrastructure would reduce spending by nearly $37 billion. Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2025-06-04 12:25:16.280128

Casey Snider, R-Paradise, speaks in the House Chamber at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Friday, Jan. 26, 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In order to fill an open leadership position left by former House Majority Leader Jefferson Moss, the Utah House Republicans chose their next second-in-command during a closed-door caucus meeting Tuesday night. 
The House GOP elected Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, for their next majority leader, picking him over Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Clearfield. Moss resigned from the Republican-controlled House effective last week to accept Gov. Spencer Cox’s appointment as executive director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity. 
Lisonbee previously served as majority whip and Snider served as majority assistant whip, leaving both of those positions up for grabs. Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, won election to be majority whip, while Rep. Bridger Bolinder, R-Grantsville, was elected assistant majority whip. 

“I am excited to work alongside this new leadership team as we represent our caucus and work on behalf of all Utahns,” House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said in a prepared statement issued Tuesday night. “Congratulations to Rep. Snider, Rep. Pierucci, and Rep. Bolinder. This leadership team stands ready to work on behalf of all Utahns.” 
Snider and Pierucci have both been rising stars in House leadership, having previously served in leadership positions before taking the higher-ranking roles. Bolinder is a relative newcomer, having first been elected in January 2023. Snider began his legislative service in October 2018, while Pierucci has served since November 2019. 

Snider has political experience both in Utah and Washington, D.C. He previously worked as a legislative director for a congressman, former Utah Rep. Rob Bishop, and was a staffer on the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources. He has also served as a firefighter for the Paradise City Fire Department and worked in various agricultural roles. He owns and operates a 300 acre farm in Cache County, according to his campaign website. 
When Snider was first appointed in 2018 at the age of 33, he assumed the role as the state’s youngest legislator. Now, that title belongs to Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, who took office in 2023 at the age of 25. Previously, Snider served in a powerful position as chair of the House Rules Committee, which decides which bills get committee hearings. 
“I am honored to take on this role and grateful for the opportunity to serve,” Snider said in a prepared statement. “Our leadership team is committed to serving the members of our caucus and the people of Utah with integrity and foresight as we continue to advance meaningful policy for the benefit of every Utahn.”

Pierucci — who was also deemed the Legislature’s youngest lawmaker when she first took office in 2018 at the age of 27 — previously worked as director of community relations for another congressman, former Rep. Chris Stewart, and as development director for the conservative think tank Sutherland Institute. 
As a lawmaker, Pierucci most recently served as chair of the House Education Committee. One of the most high-profile and controversial pieces of legislation she ran included the creation of the state’s “school choice” voucher program, named Utah Fits All, which a district court judge recently ruled as unconstitutional. State leaders said they would appeal the ruling to the Utah Supreme Court. 
“I am thankful for the trust our Majority Caucus has placed in me,” Pierucci said in a statement. “Our leadership team is energized and ready to represent our caucus as we work to make a lasting impact for families and communities across our state.” 

Bolinder owns a family construction company, according to his campaign website. He’s affiliated with the Utah Manufacture Association and lists Grantsville High School as his education, according to his legislative page. Last year, he was selected to serve as chair of the House Health and Human Services Committee.  
“It’s an honor to earn the trust of my colleagues,” Bolinder said. “I’m eager to get to work, to listen, and to help ensure every voice in our caucus, and every Utahn, is represented.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/012624_Casey-Snider_025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 12:25:16.280128

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerGlobalFoundries announced plans Wednesday to invest $16 billion in its New York and Vermont operations to bolster domestic chip manufacturing.The company expects to dedicate $13 billion of those funds to modernizing its plants in Malta, New York, where it is based, and Essex Junction. It plans to commit an additional $3 billion to research and development in the Northeast, the company said in a Wednesday press release.It was not immediately clear how much of the aggregate $16 billion in new investment would go toward the company’s Vermont operations. The company said it was collaborating with President Donald Trump’s administration and leading tech companies, including Apple and General Motors, to help reshore domestic chip production. “At GlobalFoundries, we are proud to partner with pioneering technology leaders to manufacture their chips in the United States — advancing innovation while strengthening economic and supply chain resiliency,” Tim Breen, CEO of GlobalFoundries, said in the release. “The AI revolution is driving strong, durable demand for GF’s technologies that enable tomorrow’s data centers — including GF’s leading silicon photonics, as well as GaN for power applications.”The announcement is just the latest sign that bipartisan attempts to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing have begun to bear fruit for the company’s Essex Junction facility, which is one of the largest employers in Vermont.Last February, GlobalFoundries was awarded $1.5 billion in federal funding through the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, $125 million of which went to the company’s Vermont plant. In December, the company secured nearly $10 million in additional federal funds to bolster operations in Essex Junction.GlobalFoundries is also a key player in Vermont’s Gallium Nitride Tech Hub, a consortium of entities including the University of Vermont that is dedicated to the development and production of Gallium Nitride semiconductors, a cutting edge chip technology. Earlier this year, the outgoing Biden Administration awarded the Vermont tech hub nearly $24 million in funding for chip manufacturing, a decision that was revoked by the Trump administration, which said it would re-award the grant money next year. GlobalFoundries said it plans to allocate part of its $3 billion in research and development funding toward Gallium Nitride production in Vermont, though it did not specify the amount.Read the story on VTDigger here:  GlobalFoundries to invest $16B in chip manufacturing in Vermont and New York.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/global-foundries-2-20221017.jpg,,,2025-06-04 12:25:16.280128

The opinion released Wednesday said the board violated state open meetings laws, which says school districts must publish a notice about tax proposals in a local newspaper at least a week before meeting to vote on the proposal. The attorney general’s office also refuted a recent claim by the school district to local media outlets that the state law doesn’t apply to the tax increase because it is a “county-level tax” also needing approval from the Fayette County Fiscal Court. 
The opinion said state law “expressly recognizes that levying an occupational license tax is a power shared jointly by the School Board and the Fiscal Court.” It adds that a fiscal court vote could not happen unless the school board “certified” the new tax rate. 
“Accordingly, when the School Board properly certifies a new rate, the Fiscal Court’s role is ministerial; the discretion and decision-making power lies with the School Board — which is why it is the body that must give public notice prior to voting on whether to impose the additional tax,” the opinion said. “Therefore, it is the opinion of this Office that the Fayette County School Board’s May 27 vote to increase the occupational license tax was unlawful.”
The board voted 3-2 to approve the tax increase of 0.25% about a week ago. The tax rate would have taken effect in January. The board approved a  $848 million proposed budget with the tax increase that would cost residents an average of $13 more per month, local media outlets reported. 
However, Coleman’s office wrote the resolution for the tax increase “is void and of no effect.” 
“Tax and spend government is a danger to Kentucky’s future, especially when officials who should be accountable to Fayette County voters try to ignore the rules to raise taxes,” Coleman said in a statement. “If the Fayette County School Board members believe they need more of Kentuckians’ hard-earned dollars, they should clearly and publicly make their case before their own constituents.”
Based in Lexington, Fayette County Public Schools is the second largest school district in the state with more than 41,000 students. 
Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, a Lexington Republican, requested Coleman’s office review the legality of the school board’s vote. 
“This validates what so many in our community, including myself, felt: Taxpayers were shut out of a huge decision about their own tax dollars,” Bledsoe said. “I’m calling on the Fiscal Court to take no action today and for the school board to remedy this misuse of its authority. The board should table any further discussion of a tax increase until trust can be restored.”
Consideration of the school board’s tax increase request is on the agenda for the fiscal court’s Thursday meeting.

In his statement, Liggins said “we respectfully but strongly disagree with the conclusions drawn, particularly because the opinion does not reference the relevant statute that governs this matter.” He added that the district’s legal counsel believes the attorney general’s opinion “raises more questions than it resolves, and we believe there are reasonable differences in interpretation.”
“That said, we remain committed to honoring the spirit of the opinion,” Liggins said. “We have documented the public comments received at the May 27 meeting and will offer an additional opportunity for public comment at our upcoming June 23 Board meeting.”
He continued: “While others may be focused on political maneuvering, our focus remains squarely on student achievement and fulfilling our community’s expectation that we provide a world-class education to every child. We will continue working closely with the Fiscal Court and ensure that our efforts follow both the letter and spirit of the law, especially as we navigate this complex process that blends local and state policy.”
Liggins thanked the community for “continued support of our public schools and our shared responsibility to invest in the future of our students.”
Bledsoe said in a statement to the Lantern responding to the district’s interpretation of the opinion that attempting to pass “a tax increase without the input and transparency of the taxpayers it affects is the ultimate political maneuver—especially when done quietly over Memorial Day weekend.” 
“The Attorney General’s opinion is unequivocal: the Fayette County School Board’s vote to raise the occupational tax was unlawful due to a failure to provide the required public notice,” the senator said. “This is about upholding the law and respecting the voices of our community. Taxpayers deserve transparency and accountability, not maneuvering made behind closed doors. It’s imperative that we restore public trust by ensuring all future actions are conducted openly and in full compliance with the law.”

The New Mexico Court of Appeals ruled to dismiss a lawsuit alleging the state violated the state constituion and failied to protect residents from oil and gas pollution.(Photo by Jerry Redfern / Capital & Main)The New Mexico Court of Appeals ordered a lower court Tuesday to toss a case alleging that state officials failed to protect residents from oil and gas pollution in violation of the New Mexico State Constitution.
In the order issued Tuesday, justices in the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed a lower court’s ruling and concluded that the judiciary does not have the power to address the plaintiffs’ claims.
“The relief Plaintiffs seek—as presented by their complaint—exceeds the boundary of that which the judiciary is authorized to grant,” wrote Chief Judge Jacqueline Medina.
Justices ordered the lower court to dismiss the complaint.
The civil lawsuit was first filed in May of 2023 on behalf of environmental groups, youth activists and individuals from the Pueblos, the Permian Basin and Navajo Nation against the Legislature, New Mexico’s top officials and rulemaking bodies on oil and gas.
The lawsuit alleged the state government failed to limit permitting of oil and gas production and did not adequately enforce pollution laws, which plaintiffs argued is a violation of a 1971 amendment to the state constitution, called the Pollution Control Clause.




 Pollution Control Clause

“The protection of the state’s beautiful and healthful environment is hereby declared to be of fundamental importance to the public interest, health, safety and the general welfare. The legislature shall provide for control of pollution and control of despoilment of the air, water and other natural resources of this state, consistent with the use and development of these resources for the maximum benefit of the people.”
Further, the plaintiffs argued the state’s actions around oil and gas production and pollution discriminated against Indigenous people, youth and frontline communities.




Plaintiffs requested the courts rule that the state has a constitutional duty to prevent pollution — similar to landmark rulings in education and workers’ compensation — and asked the courts to “suspend additional permitting of oil and gas wells” until the state is in compliance. Moreover, plaintiffs asked the courts order state government to install a regulatory structure and plan to protect from pollution.
Attorneys for the State of New Mexico argued the ruling oversteps separations of power between the branches of government, and that youth and frontline communities are not protected classes and there’s no discriminatory intent.
In June 2024,  First District Judge Matthew Wilson dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims against the Legislature, but allowed the case to continue moving through the courts to determine if a constitutional right to pollution control exists.
On Tuesday, the Appeals Court determined the state Constitution does not grant any specific right “to any individual or group, to be free from a given amount of pollution. Nor can it be inferred to create an enforceable right to a beautiful and healthful environment,” Medina wrote.
Additionally, justices agreed with the state’s arguments that frontline and youth are not classifications for discriminatory treatment.
Gail Evans, lead counsel for the Center for Biological Diversity, said plaintiffs plan to appeal Tuesday’s decision.
“New Mexicans amended our constitution 50 years ago to protect our residents from pollution. With this terrible ruling, the court has eviscerated our constitutionally protected rights,” Evans said in a written statement. “This will lead to more air pollution, more contaminated land and water, and more sickness in our communities. We’ll continue our fight against the filthy oil and gas industry on behalf of all New Mexicans and will be appealing this decision to the state Supreme Court.”

Iowa Dental Board records indicate Shawn Kerby was issued a dental license in 2004. Ten years later, in 2014, Kerby was charged by the board with indiscriminate or promiscuous prescribing or dispensing drugs for unlawful purposes.
The board alleged that it had subpoenaed nine of Kerby’s patient files, and in seven of those cases there were multiple prescriptions issued by Kerby that were never recorded in the patients’ files.  On multiple occasions, the board alleged, Kerby had prescribed controlled substances for patients he hadn’t seen for more than a year.

According to the board, Kerby explained his actions by saying he was unaware of the regulations pertaining to prescribing medications. The board allowed Kerby to continue practicing, but fined him $2,500 and placed his license on probation for two years.
In December 2015, agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration served search warrants at Kerby’s dental practice and home. Five months later, in April 2016, Kerby agreed to have his license placed on “inactive” status.
In February 2017, Kerby was indicted on 11 federal criminal charges, including knowingly prescribing hydrocodone and other drugs for other individuals in order to obtain the drugs for his own personal use. The offenses allegedly were committed while Kerby was operating two central Iowa dental clinics, Kerby Family Dental and Bright Smiles Family Dental.
Prosecutors alleged that through his dental practice, Kerby had prescribed patients hydrocodone despite the lack of any medical need for the drug. He would then arrange for the patients to route the hydrocodone pills to him once they had filled the prescription at a local pharmacy.
While awaiting trial in July 2017, Kerby was alleged to have violated his pretrial release agreement by testing positive for opiates.
In January 2018, with the federal charges still pending, Kerby was arrested by police in Marengo on charges of serious domestic abuse assault and interference with official acts. He later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of disorderly conduct.
In February 2018, a plea agreement in the federal case was reached in which nine of the charges were dismissed and Kerby pleaded guilty to charges of obtaining hydrocodone by deception or fraud and being an unlawful user of drugs while in possession of firearms. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison, according to court records.
Shortly after his sentencing but before he began serving his sentence, Kerby was pulled over by police in Marengo. Court records indicate a search of his vehicle resulted in the discovery of a Crown Royal bag in which a glass methamphetamine pipe was located. Kerby subsequently tested positive for amphetamine and methamphetamine and allegedly admitted using meth, according to court records.
After Kerby began serving his federal prison sentence in Leavenworth, Kansas, he voluntarily surrendered his Iowa dental license. In November 2020, after Kerby’s release from prison, the Iowa Dental Board reinstated his license subject to five years of probation, during which he would have to abstain from drug use and submit to practice monitoring.
Recently, the board agreed to terminate the probation agreement early, restoring Kerby’s license to full privileges, free and clear of any restrictions.

(Amir Levy/Getty Images)Ever since 251 people were taken hostage during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, a group of residents in Boulder have refused to let the community forget the people who were abducted.
The group is the local chapter of the global Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the release of the hostages. Participants in the Boulder chapter have demonstrated by walking in the city’s downtown area every week — 80 weeks so far — since November 2023.
Their walk on Sunday came on the 604th day since the hostages were taken. It also marked the first time they encountered violence. An assailant attacked the demonstrators with a flamethrower and crude homemade bombs in what federal prosecutors say was an antisemitic hate crime.
The attack came amid rising antisemitism throughout the country and followed other recent acts of violence against Jews. The threat of more violence is real. It’s uncertain when the group will walk again. 
The tragedy is compounded to the extent terror muzzles the group’s message.

Run For Their Lives is nonviolent and nonpolitical. It is not pro-Israel. It is not anti-Palestine. It has a single purpose, which no person of conscience should find objectionable: to raise awareness and call for the release of hostages. There are still 58 hostages in Gaza, including four Americans. Roughly 20 are believed to be alive, and group members want the remains of the rest to be given a proper burial.
“This is an international humanitarian crisis, where people from many varying backgrounds and religions and ethnicities were taken hostage. They were not just Israelis,” Shari Weiss, global coordinator of Run For Their Lives, said during an interview this week on WBUR.
She acknowledged the horrors that have befallen Gaza as Israeli forces continue military operations that have resulted in more than 50,000 deaths, most of the territory destroyed, and unspeakable hardship among survivors. 
“The same people do understand the suffering of the Palestinian people and do understand that they are going through something extremely traumatic. You can absolutely hold space for that at the same time,” Weiss said.
When members of the group demonstrate in Boulder, they walk silently for 18 minutes, the number value of the word “chai,” Hebrew for “life.” Many of the participants are older adults (the age range of victims is 52 to 88). They carry photos of the hostages.
Tara Winer, a member of the Boulder City Council, sometimes joins the group on their walks.
“It’s not a protest, it’s not a march. Nobody talks, nobody does anything except walk,” said Winer, who is Jewish. “I’m upset about the hostages, who are still there. So it’s just a way to remind myself about them and also to remind my community about them.”
Many participants have friends and family in Israel.
“They do not want people to forget these hostages … And this is their way of keeping their memory alive,” Winer said. “I know on the walks I go to sometimes they mention all the people who have died in captivity. They mention the hostages by name. They say them by name, so people won’t forget.”
She was not on the walk Sunday. She described the victims as “good friends.”
Police said 12 people were injured in the attack, and at least one was in critical condition, but all are expected to survive.
Run For Their LIves organizers intend to continue the walks, though they might stop for a time until adequate security can be ensured. Whatever the group’s future, the Boulder and Colorado communities can sustain its humanitarian message. Terrorism succeeds only when its target is cowed or diminished.

(Photo courtesy of the American Wild Horse Campaign)Advocates for America’s wild horses are finding little beauty to behold in Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would slash funding for the Bureau of Land Management’s Wild Horse and Burro program by 25% and allow the slaughter of some 64,000 federally protected wild horses in government holding facilities. 
“The President’s budget will greatly endanger wild horses and burros,” Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada, said in a statement to the Current. “I am deeply concerned by how these cuts will impact the care of these beloved creatures. Even more worrying is the omission of the long-standing provision against horse slaughter.”
The proposal, horse and burro advocates note, mirrors Trump’s 2017 budget, which initially called for a 30% cut to the program’s funding and the elimination of protections against slaughter. Congress restored the protections against killing the animals and augmented funding. 
“Typically, the president’s appropriations bill contains a provision prohibiting horse slaughter. The Trump budget bill does not have this provision, opening the door to animals being sold off for slaughter,” said Dick Cooper, a spokesman for Titus. 
The budget proposal is straight from the pages of Project 2025, the ultra-conservative manifesto of which Trump once claimed ignorance, but has since adopted de facto as a blueprint for his policies. 
“What is happening to these once-proud beasts of burden is neither compassionate nor humane, and what these animals are doing to federal lands and fragile ecosystems is unacceptable,” says Project 2025, which asserted “the uncontrolled growth of wild horses and burros poses an existential threat to public lands.” 
More than half of the nation’s wild horses, estimated between 70,000 and 95,000, are in Nevada, notes Project 2025. “Congress must enact laws permitting the BLM to dispose humanely of these animals.” 
The policy is an “attack on animal welfare and America’s public lands,” according to American Wild Horse Conservation (AWHC), a wild horse advocacy organization. 
“This budget would be a bullet to the head of America’s wild horses if passed by Congress,” said Suzanne Roy, executive director of AWHC. “Slaughter is a barbaric solution to a fundamentally broken federal program.”
The current program is focused on what critics contend are inhumane roundups that end in the warehousing of the creatures in government holding facilities. 
A better solution, say horse advocates, is increasing fertility control efforts and restoring habitat. 
Last month, Titus announced the formation of the Wild Horse Congressional Caucus, “to encourage federal policies for more humane treatment of wild horses and burros,” according to a news release. 
Days later, Titus and 82 members of Congress urged a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee to craft legislation requiring the BLM to spend at least 10% of the Wild Horse and Burro program’s $140 million budget on fertility control in additional herd management areas. 
“The letter included several requests but notably included language maintaining the prohibition on the sale or adoption of healthy wild horses and burros that results in their destruction,” Titus said in a news release. 
Titus has opposed the BLM’s use of aircraft in roundups. The U.S. has paid helicopter companies $57.4 million for roundups since 2006, according to Titus, a process she has attempted to ban. 
“Scientific research has shown that more humane and cost-effective alternatives, like fertility control, are equally effective in controlling equine populations,” according to the May statement from Titus announcing the Wild Horse caucus. “The BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program, however, currently spends less than four percent of its budget on these methods.”
Diverse interests, ranging from cattle ranchers to animal activists, have called for vast reductions to wild horse populations, which they contend are three times the number public lands can accommodate. 
“The greatest threat to our wild horses and burros and our public lands right now isn’t the BLM, it’s not cattle, ranching or mining interests. It’s not animal advocates. It’s climate change and the new reality is fast settling in,” Stephanie Boyles Griffin, the chief scientist of the Humane Society of the United States’ (now Humane World for Animals’) wildlife protection department,  told Reuters in 2021.
Americans, deeply divided on a plethora of topics, are on common ground when it comes to wild horses, says AWHC, which commissioned a 2017 poll that revealed 83% of Trump voters supported protecting wild horses and burros from slaughter, compared with 77% of Hillary Clinton’s supporters. 
“After decades of costly and ineffective roundups, the BLM now stockpiles more wild horses in government pens than remain free on the range,” said Roy in a news release. “Americans deserve a better federal plan that  genuinely tackles off-range holding issues without resorting to slaughter.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_4372-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-06-04 12:25:16.280128

These treatments have enabled individuals to achieve significant weight loss, improve their metabolic health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. 
In August 2024, North Carolina’s Medicaid program expanded coverage to include FDA-approved obesity management medications for beneficiaries aged 12 and older. This policy change recognized obesity as a serious health condition requiring medical intervention and aimed to provide equitable access to effective treatments for low-income residents. 
However, a recent budget proposal circulating within the North Carolina General Assembly threatens to undermine this progress. The state legislature is currently considering significant budget cuts to Medicaid, which would jeopardize coverage for obesity medications. Such cuts could reverse the strides we’ve made in addressing the obesity epidemic and exacerbate health disparities across our state.
Obesity is not merely a matter of personal responsibility; it’s a complex health issue influenced by various factors, including genetics, environment, and socioeconomic status. Obesity medications have emerged as a powerful tool in the medical management of obesity, offering hope to patients who have struggled with traditional weight loss methods. By reducing access to these medications, we risk increasing the prevalence of obesity-related complications, leading to higher healthcare costs and diminished quality of life for affected individuals.
Moreover, the proposed Medicaid cuts could disproportionately impact rural communities in North Carolina, where healthcare resources are already limited. Approximately 40% of the state’s Medicaid beneficiaries reside in rural areas. 
It is crucial to recognize that investing in obesity treatment is not only a moral imperative but also a fiscally responsible decision. Research from Global Data shows that obesity costs North Carolina households $1.4 billion in medical expenses and the Medicaid program $404 million in increased spending.
As healthcare providers, policymakers, and citizens, we must advocate for the preservation of Medicaid coverage for obesity medications. Ensuring access to effective treatments for all North Carolinians, regardless of income, is essential for promoting public health, reducing long-term healthcare costs, and upholding the values of equity and compassion in our healthcare system.
I urge our state legislators to consider the profound implications of these proposed Medicaid cuts on obesity treatment and to take action to protect and expand access to these life-changing medications.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wegovy.jpg,,,2025-06-04 12:25:16.280128

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. House's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Members of the Kansas congressional delegation participated in a moment of silence on the U.S. House floor to honor the memory of a couple slain in May during an apparent antisemitic attack outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.
Federal lawmakers stood in tribute for Sarah Milgrim, who grew up in Prairie Village, Kansas, and her partner, Yaron Lischinsky. Both were staff members at the Israeli embassy. They were fatally shot May 21 by a Chicago man who reportedly yelled “free Palestine” while handcuffed and has been charged with first-degree murder.
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat who represents the community where Milgrim was raised, said the couple were “tragically and senselessly killed in an antisemitic attack.”
“This hateful and targeted violence is not only heartbreaking, it is unacceptable,” she said. “Antisemitism has no place in our country, and yet we are seeing a deeply disturbing rise in these acts of hate.”
Davids said Milgrim was a member of Congregation B’nai Jehudah and that Milgrim and Lischinsky were committed to building understanding and connection between Israel and the United States.
“To the Jewish community in Kansas, Colorado and across the nation,” Davids said, “please know that I am standing with you. We mourn with you. We recommit to creating a world where no one fears for their safety because of who they are.”
Davids offered her thoughts Tuesday in collaboration with a group of representatives, including Kansas Republican U.S. Reps. Tracey Mann and Derek Schmidt.

WILMINGTON — Bicyclists hitting the scenic Jack A. Markell Trail can now borrow helmets for free, thanks to a new safety initiative from Delaware Greenways.
The nonprofit has launched a bike helmet loaner program aimed at ensuring riders—especially visitors renting bikes—have proper head protection as they travel the popular route between the Wilmington Riverfront and Historic New Castle.
Helmets are available at three key trail access points: the Greater Wilmington Convention and Visitors Bureau Visitor Center and the DuPont Environmental Education Center, both located on the Riverfront, and the New Castle Courthouse Museum.

The initiative is particularly targeted at those using rental bikes from Fin Outdoor Recreation stations along the trail.
Many visitors arrive without helmets, according to Delaware Greenways.
Funded by a grant from the William Penn Foundation, the program provides adult and child-sized helmets, which are cleaned and sanitized after each use.
To borrow a helmet, cyclists must present a driver’s license or credit card—held securely until the helmet is returned—and sign a waiver.
Borrowers will also receive trail safety guidelines. Helmets must be returned to the original loan location by closing time the same day.
Only adults (18+) may rent helmets, though they may do so on behalf of minors in their group.

The hearing was billed as “discussion only.” Lawmakers will take a vote at their next meeting.
  NC Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson (Photo: NC DEQ)
Wilson formerly served as secretary for the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources from 2021 to 2024. Before that, he was DNCR’s chief deputy secretary from 2017 to 2020.
Following his appointment earlier this year by Gov. Josh Stein, he’s been serving as DEQ secretary on an interim basis while awaiting confirmation.
At the national level, Congress has been working on a federal budget that would include cuts to some of the areas under DEQ’s purview.
Sen. Jay Chaudhuri (D-Wake) asked what the cuts would mean to DEQ and how Wilson would respond.
About half of DEQ’s budget comes from federal sources, Wilson said. In particular, the proposed budget would remove $31.5 million from operating grants.
“We would have to let a whole lot of people go, and the consequences of that are that our permitting processes would take longer, our responses to spills and other problems would take longer, our responsiveness and assistance to businesses would not be as strong,” Wilson said. “Everything we do, we would do less well.”
Chaudhuri jokingly followed up with, “Do you still want this job?” Wilson answered in the affirmative.
Sen. Jim Burgin (R-Harnett, Lee, Sampson) asked about water quality, specifically microplastics.
Wilson said DEQ staff are looking into the issue, and the department also collaborates with others like university researchers to learn more.
“Water quality is a huge priority,” he said. “It is a significant health concern, so we’re gonna’ be involved with that.”
After Hurricane Helene swept through the western portion of the state, DEQ worked closely with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to provide mobile programs testing the quality of drinking wells.
Wilson said the agencies found out how polluted the drinking water was, how to get it cleaned, and tested it to make sure it was healthy before people drank it again.
“For folks with a well in the yard or on their property, they’re more vulnerable, so we want to make sure we are doing as much testing,” Wilson said. “We have a [fund] which helps pay for additional private well tests around the state when we determine that that is needed.”
Lawmakers also voted to approve two pieces of legislation at Tuesday’s meeting, which they discussed yesterday: House Bill 247 (“8-1-1 Amendments“) and House Bill 694 (“Study Water/Wastewater Regionalization“).

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Florida installed the second most solar power capacity in the country last year, and is predicted to become the top-ranked residential solar power state in the nation in 2028, but that growth could be severely impacted by the removal of tax credits in the major spending and tax bill which passed in the U.S. House of Representatives by a single vote last month.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) says Florida could lose potentially up to 21,800 solar and storage jobs if the current bill isn’t altered before making its way to President Donald Trump’s desk and into law.
Among the provisions included in the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that would severely alter the solar power industry are the removal of tax credits. The bill includes a measure to eliminate the 30% residential federal solar tax credit by the end of the year. Also the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for commercial and utility-scale projects would remain intact initially but phase down to 80% of its full value by 2029, then 60% in 2030, 40% in 2031 and fully eliminated by 2032, according to GreenLancer.com.
“Lost jobs in every single state are a recipe for disaster for American families, businesses, and the U.S. economy,”  SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in a press release. “From Texas and California to Florida and Illinois, lawmakers will put Americans nationwide out of work if this legislation becomes law, plain and simple. Axing energy jobs means shuttered U.S. factories, cancelled local investments, and energy shortfalls nationwide. We hope that U.S. Senators won’t let their constituents lose their livelihoods on their watch.”
If unchanged, the removal of tax credits would also hurt efforts on climate change. The bill could increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions annually by 1 billion metric tons in a decade, according to an analysis from Princeton University researchers.
Florida GOP Sen. Rick Scott has been critical of the bill passed by the House, saying last week it will raise the deficit. He added that he intends to work hard throughout this summer to find more cuts in the package so that he’ll be able to support it when it comes to the Senate floor.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 14:39:30+00:00,CT Mirror,‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally,Tim Henderson | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/big-beautiful-bill-health-care-immigrants/,The government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole.,"The Republican budget bill the U.S. House approved last month includes a surprise for the 40 states that have expanded Medicaid: penalties for providing health care to some immigrants who are here legally.Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized if immigrants qualify for the program, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.Stateline reporter Tim Henderson can be reached at thenderson@stateline.org.

Environmental groups like the Atchafalaya Basinkeeper and Sierra Club worry a new bill will make it easier to develop in isolated wetland areas. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)In a stretch of wild land in Iberville Parish, a small dirt dam built across an out-of-the-way bayou is at the center of a lawsuit. Environmental advocates fear cases like this could become more common if a Louisiana proposal to redefine its wetlands becomes law.
Opponents say this proposed change doesn’t just open doors for mixed legal interpretations; it could also make it easier to erase valuable wetland habitat and build in flood-prone areas. 
The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana in Baton Rouge two years ago by the environmental group Atchafalaya Basinkeeper and the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association-West. They allege Benjamin Miller of Miller Hunting Club in Eunice illegally dammed Pat’s Throat Bayou in 2021 to access hunting grounds on the other bank. 
The hunting club didn’t get a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before Miller built the dam, according to the lawsuit. Instead, the plaintiffs claim the USACE granted a permit after the dam was illegally built. 
If the Louisiana Legislature approves a proposed update to its wetlands laws, environmentalists fear property owners and developers will argue that wetlands like these – illegally dammed off from a navigable body of water – shouldn’t be protected under state or federal law. 
“There will be lawsuits,” said Margie Vicknair-Pray, conservation coordinator for the Sierra Club Delta chapter. “They’re changing the definition, but that doesn’t change reality.” 
 
Mirroring Sackett
Pat’s Throat Bayou is a window into how a national policy shift could affect Louisiana. 
A 2023 Supreme Court decision, Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, narrowed federal protection for wetlands. The case arose from an Idaho family who backfilled their property, which the EPA later determined to be protected wetlands. The Sacketts challenged that determination, arguing successfully their land did not connect to a navigable water body – known in federal law as Waters of the United States (WOTUS). 
Before Sackett, developers needed a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge or fill a wetland area protected under the federal Clean Water Act. 
The Sackett ruling also left uncertainty as to where navigable channels under WOTUS begin and end when it comes to wetlands, according to Mark Davis, director of the Tulane Center for Environmental Law. 
“They didn’t define exactly how that’s going to play out … and people will agree and disagree where those lines are drawn,” Davis said.
This means owners and developers might not need permits from the USACE to build in isolated wetland areas. The grey area has prompted states to step in and try to fill the regulatory gap with their own wetlands laws. 
Louisiana state Sen. “Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, has sponsored Senate Bill 94 in response to the Sackett decision. His bill looks to redefine wetlands cut off by levees that break their connection to navigable water bodies as “fastlands,” disqualifying them from federal protection. 
Fesi said in an interview his bill is meant to bring Louisiana law in line with the Sackett decision.
“We try calling everything wetlands just because it has a little water in it,” Fesi said. “It’s gotten way out of hand.”
The Sackett ruling does not affect wetlands connected to navigable bodies of water, such as the Mississippi River, or tidal wetlands along Louisiana’s coast. They would still have federal protection under the Clean Water Act. 
Wetlands with levees, either through “current or future lawful construction,” are left more vulnerable in Fesi’s proposal. The senator did not give a conclusive answer when asked what will happen to current wetlands cut off by future levees, saying his bill was intended to invite room for individual interpretation 
“One size doesn’t fit all,” he said. 
That’s exactly the issue wetlands advocates have with Senate Bill 94 – the room for interperetation it leaves for how wetlands are defined. 
In the case of Pat’s Throat Bayou, the argument was over whether wetlands connected to the navigable bayou were cut off legally or illegally when Miller built a dam, said Brennan Spoor, a member of Atchafalaya Basinkeepers. The group’s mission is to protect and restore the swamps and waterways of the basin. 
“The bill applies to all [levees and dams] that are currently existing or future ones that are lawfully constructed,” Spoor said.
“You could argue that the dam was lawfully constructed, and therefore the wetlands that they have destroyed since they built the dam were never wetlands at all,” he added, explaining that the bill tries to eliminate the need for a federal permit if the property owners want to dredge or fill the landscape. 
The exact language of the bill is also concerning to legal experts for the confusion they say it will create in the law. 
Fesi’s bill changes the definition of wetlands under the Louisiana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, the program that regulates contamination released into surface waters. But Louisiana still needs to follow federal law for pollutants. 
“The notion of a continuous surface connection is not really part of the rule for what a pollution discharge covers,” Davis said. “If anything, it creates deeper confusion rather than clarification.”
The Louisiana Senate approved Fesi’s bill Tuesday in a 35-1 vote. It heads next to the governor for his signature. 
 
Flood concerns
As legal arguments mount, environmental advocates say the stakes are high for Louisiana. Building in wetland areas eliminates valuable habitat and increases the risk of flooding in nearby communities, Vicknair-Pray said. 
“People just want to build where they want to build, and they don’t want to think of the long-term consequences” like habitat loss and flooding, she said. “That water has to go somewhere. We need wetlands for that water to back up into.”
When asked about flood concerns, Fesi said he thinks his bill would make it easier to construct and repair levees, aiding with much-needed flood control in some areas and “promoting individual property rights” for those wanting to build in previously defined wetlands. 
“Those aren’t wetlands,” Fesi said, speaking about wetland areas surrounded by levees or cut off from bodies of water. 
The 2023 Louisiana Coastal Master Plan, a document outlining various coastal restoration and flood protection projects, recommends a combination of wetland resources and manmade levees for flood control. The same document also warns that overengineering rivers like the Mississippi can “impact coastal wetlands and undermine their ability to replenish naturally.”
“The marsh behind a levee is going to die,” Vicknair-Pray said. 
Aside from just diminished natural flood control, she worries wildlife living in isolated wetland areas, including migrating ducks and native reptiles, will be put at risk with development encouraged under Fesi’s legislation. 
“We used to consider this Sportsman’s Paradise,” she said. “I don’t think we can say that anymore.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4094-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 11:06:40.985358

In part 4 of a five part audio series,  Mabuhay sa Alaska, KMXT’s Brian Venua reports that this is just the latest wave in more than a century of ebb and flow.
The first Filipino known to visit Alaska came in 1788, aboard a Spanish trading ship called the Iphigenia Nubiana. The ship passed by Kodiak Island, where Russia had founded one of its first permanent settlements in Alaska a few years earlier.
That’s according to research by Thelma Buchholdt, the founder of the Filipino Heritage Council of Alaska and the first female Filipino American legislator in Alaska and the U.S.
According to Buchholdt, that sailor’s name was lost to time. He’s listed in the captain’s journals only as “Manilla man.”
Ship records note a handful of “Manilla men” coming to trade with Alaska Natives before the 1800s. At least 27 more came on whaling ships through the 1800s.
The Alaskeros establish the first organized communities
The U.S. bought Alaska in 1867, and the first big waves of Filipinos to make the territory their home came late in the century, when the salmon business went industrial.
“They were coming for education, they wanted to follow the American dream,” said Katherine Ringsmuth, Alaska’s state historian.
In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, cutting off a source of cheap labor. In 1898, Filipinos became U.S. nationals when the United States annexed the Philippines as a colony after the Philippine-American War.
By then, Ringsmuth said pre-Exclusion Act Chinese migrants were aging out of the workforce. That set the stage for American companies to hire Filipino people.
“So the Filipinos, who could speak English, who understood American ways of doing things, fit right in there perfectly and really began to dominate the cannery workforce right up through the 21st century,” she said.
In the early days of the territory’s commercial fisheries, one of the first groups to organize were the Alaskeros, or Filipino salmon cannery workers
“Filipinos would be the ones to really lead the way in organizing labor and unionizing,” Ringsmuth said.
Even though they were seasonal workers, the unions fought for better food, working conditions, and more equitable hiring practices. The Filipino cannery workers later sued to end segregation in cannery bunkhouses.
“This kind of racialized segregation of the canneries – is it constitutional?” Ringsmuth said “And they end up winning that case.”
Canneries used to separate workers by country of origin but switched to numbers after the union won its lawsuit. The legacy of the Alaskeros set the foundations of organized Filipino communities in Alaska – now the state’s largest group of Asian Americans.
The number of new Alaskeros cannery workers wound down after Congress further curbed immigration from Asia with new restrictions in 1924. Still, the Filipino diaspora reaches everywhere across the state.
The Kodiak Island Borough has some of the highest concentrations – about a quarter of the population has some kind of Filipino heritage. Anchorage has a population of 18,000 Filipino people, with thousands more across the state totaling to around 35,000 people.
World War II created a new labor shortage
“During World War II, the United States asked for assistance with the Filipinos to help them,” said Gabriel Garcia, a professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage. He’s teaching a course on Filipino history and community, which starts in the fall.
Under the Second War Powers Act of 1942, military service gave U.S. nationals, who can’t vote or run for office, a path to citizenship.
“That was one of the perks that was promised to the Filipinos at that point,” Garcia said. “And so many Filipinos from all over the Philippines enlisted as members of the military here in the U.S.”
After WWII, the Philippines received its independence, becoming its own nation in 1945.
Immigration after Independence
Filipino immigration boomed again about 20 years after that, when the federal government lifted immigration restrictions from Asia.
“The ban was lifted in 1965, so post-1965, that’s when immigration numbers again significantly increases, specifically in the Filipino community,” Garcia said.
Many of these new immigrants were engineers, doctors, educators, and other professionals. Filipino nurses in particular immigrated in droves through the Exchange Visitor Program.
Schools there primarily teach in English, which makes an immigrant’s transition easier than it might be from many other countries.
“(The) Philippines is a good country to look into particularly because the type of educational system they have in the Philippines is very much Westernized,” Garcia said.
Now, as the U.S. faces a national teacher shortage, school districts are looking at the Philippines once again. Garcia said it’s not surprising that the island nation is supplementing another U.S. workforce, largely for the same reasons as for nurses and other skilled professions.
“With the historical connection of the Philippines and the United States, and the educational system being very close to the United States, I think the Philippines is a natural choice for labor shortages,” he said.
Jobs in America tend to pay better, so many emigrate to send money to their families back home.
“The natural choice is to look for better opportunities for them – financial specifically – so that they can provide for their family back home in the Philippines,” Garcia said.

Ned Lamont. But hundreds will die from inaction at the midnight adjournment.
“It’s an annual event at this stage,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford.
A select few still have a chance for passage, most notably House Bill 5004, a largely aspirational measure that would strengthen the state’s existing carbon-reduction goals and create a new “Clean Economy Council” to develop strategies and policies to help meet those targets.
It passed the House and has been sitting on the Senate calendar since May 5. Senate President Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said Tuesday night it will be one of the Senate’s first tasks on Wednesday.
Nearly 4,000 bills were filed this year. On Wednesday morning, there were nearly 80 Senate bills awaiting final action in the House and 63 House bills awaiting passage in the Senate. House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said most are effectively dead.
“I think most of us know that not every idea that we put out, not every bill that I put in, is going to become law, either,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. “And this is just part of the natural process, that is this process of filtering through lots of ideas and only having enough time and or resources to pass so many.”
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said the legislative committees churned out too many bills.
“We say that every year: There’s too many bills that get out of committee,” Candelora said. “But I feel as if committees didn’t do their work. These bills are coming very late. A lot of them weren’t ready for prime time.”
Senate Bill 1, a priority bill for early childhood care, passed easily, as did House Bill 5001, an effort to improve special education services. An energy bill glided to final passage Tuesday night.
Other bills found new places to survive, and some are effectively dead.
State finances
Several smaller bills related to fiscal matters received final approval Tuesday when the Senate adopted the $55.8 billion two-year state budget.
Those smaller bills wrapped into the budget package would:

Cap the reserve for the budget’s Special Transportation Fund at 18% of the STF.

Any reserves above that cap would be used to pay down bonded debt tied to highway, bridge, rail or other transportation projects.

Create a business tax credit for farmers’ investments in machinery, other equipment and buildings. The credit would offset 20% of expenses in these categories.


Establish a $500 state income tax credit for owners of a licensed family child care home.


Require the Department of Economic and Community Development to submit a Sept. 1 progress report on an initiative launched last year to reduce concentrated poverty in Connecticut.


Require the Department of Revenue Services to study ways to improve collection of delinquent taxes owed by state contractors. An earlier version of the bill would have allowed the state to deny driver’s license renewals to any delinquent taxpayer, not just to contractors.


Require telecommunications companies to charge subscribers a five-cents-per-month fee to support a cancer relief account for Connecticut firefighters.

Other bills with fiscal elements were expected to die when the 2025 session closes Wednesday at midnight. These include:

A plan to expand an existing property tax abatement program for police, firefighters and emergency medical technicians killed in the line of duty to including surviving domestic partners.


A program to gradually phase out municipal property taxes on motor vehicles, beginning in 2028.

Insurance
The House on Monday gave full passage to a sweeping bill that seeks to boost insurance affordability and transparency, as well as address industry practices that critics say limit patients’ access to care.
Among its many provisions, the bill would allow the state insurance commissioner to limit rate increases for insurers that have a track record of hiking costs. Beginning Jan. 1, 2027, if an insurer’s rate increases exceed the state’s “cost growth benchmarks” for the previous two consecutive years where data is available, the commissioner can reduce the carrier’s proposed rate increase by up to two percentage points.
The insurance commissioner can also fine carriers that don’t comply with a state law requiring insurers to offer mental health coverage that’s as robust as coverage for medical services, known as “mental health parity.” The bill would allow the insurance commissioner to fine insurers up to $625,000 annually for noncompliance with the mental health parity law. It also would require the parity reports submitted by insurers, including the names of each company, to be made public.
The bill also contains measures directly responding to high-profile public scrutiny of the insurance industry over the past year on issues including prior authorization and proposed time limits on the use of anesthesia.
Housing
A bill that would have prevented municipalities from fining people for sleeping outside hasn’t moved forward since it gained Committee passage in March and is likely dead.
House Bill 7033 would prohibit municipalities from penalizing people for conducting “life sustaining activities,” such as sleeping, eating and storing personal belongings, in public spaces. There are exceptions if there is adequate indoor shelter offered that includes transportation to the shelter for the person and their belongings or if people are impeding traffic.
The proposal follows a summer Supreme Court decision that ruled in an Oregon case that towns can pass and enforce ordinances that prevent people from sleeping outside. 
Children’s issues
The Committee on Children debated a bill that would have allowed hospitals to install so-called “baby boxes” on an exterior wall, high-tech, temperature-controlled chambers with alarms where people could have left infants. But that bill died in committee. 
Proponents said the boxes would have given people a judgement-free option to safely relinquish newborns, which could save lives. Opponents argued that the boxes, while well-intended, are not needed because Connecticut already has laws that allow mothers to anonymously relinquish babies with no consequences, and that the boxes could unleash many negative consequences. 
They say that because the boxes are made by only one company in the U.S., Safe Haven Baby Boxes, and are unregulated, there could be unforeseen safety issues in the event of a blackout or technological problem. A baby was recently found dead in a baby box in a church in Italy, where a priest said he never received a notification linked to his cellphone, though that box was not made by Safe Haven Baby Boxes.
Safe Haven Baby Boxes are concentrated in the Midwest. Indiana, the home state of Safe Haven Baby Box CEO Monica Kelsey, an anti-abortion activist, has more than 100 of the boxes.
The Committee on Children also heard testimony on a bill that would have extended financial support for foster youth to attend college and other post-secondary education programs from age 23 to 28. That bill died in the Appropriations Committee.
At the start of the legislative session, Lamont championed the creation of a Universal Pre-K endowment. That bill, House Bill 6867, was since been abandoned for a plan in Senate Bill 1 that also encompasses infant and toddler care and is the result of negotiations between Lamont, House and Senate Democrats and advocates.
Environment
The last week of the legislative session has brought a bit of déjà vu for environmental activists, who once again find themselves waiting for the Senate to take up a climate bill numbered 5004.
Last year, that bill died in the Senate when the clock struck midnight. But this year, advocates are still hoping that lawmakers will find time to pass their legislation, which promises to set Connecticut on a path toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
“I’m like teetering between ‘Is it gonna fail again?’ and hoping that it’s gonna go,” said Samantha Dynowski, the state director for Sierra Club Connecticut. “Every five minutes I hear something different, and I don’t know what to think.”
The bill passed the House on a party-line 98-47 vote in May. The Senate chair of the Environment Committee, Sen. Rick Lopes, D-New Britain, said he expected to run the bill early on Wednesday.
Loosely tied to that bill is the fate of another measure dealing with the state’s growing population of black bears. 
A controversial proposal to allow hunting of bears, Senate Bill 1523, was passed by the upper chamber on May 15. In the House, however, lawmakers plan to strip the hunting provisions of the bill and replace them with a requirement for the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to come up with a bear management plan.
Should the House pass the amended bill, it would have to go back to the Senate for concurrence. The bill also includes language clarifying when farmers can shoot a bear that is causing damage to crops, a priority for Republicans representing rural districts.
With the session adjourning at midnight, both bills are prime candidates for the last-minute horse-trading that often takes place between the two chambers.
Criminal justice
Amid a public outcry from immigrant advocacy groups and faith organizations, lawmakers passed an expanded version of the Trust Act, Connecticut’s law outlining the circumstances under which local and state officials are allowed to work and communicate with the federal government’s efforts to detain unauthorized migrants. Individuals are now permitted to sue over alleged violations of the law. The bill also expands the situations in which officials can comply with federal immigration detainers — and not be subject to such litigation — to include 13 additional crimes. 
Certain portions of the original bill were removed, including a section that would have prohibited companies who wish to contract with state agencies from working with federal immigration authorities.
A bill prohibiting the use of handcuffs in children passed through the Senate and the House, although significantly watered down. The bill would have originally raised the age at which a child could be arrested from age 10 to age 14, but this was eliminated before the bill reached the Senate. The adopted bill says a police officer cannot place handcuffs on a 14-year-old unless there is a risk to public safety or to the officer. An amendment to the bill says the officer is not held culpable if he or she handcuffs a child under 14 without knowing their age. 
A bill that would have expanded the eligibility of parole for people who committed crimes at a young age has not yet been called in the House of Representatives. The bill would make people who committed a crime while between the ages of 18 and 21 and were sentenced for that crime after Oct. 1, 2005, eligible for parole after serving a portion of their sentence. 
An act revising certain portions of Connecticut’s hate crimes statutes was temporarily passed in the House on Tuesday after a lengthy and technical debate over a proposed amendment that would add law enforcement officers as a protective class. The bill would move all the current statutes that pertain to hate crimes into one section, clarify conflicting language around intent and increase penalties for criminal acts that are found to have been motivated by bias against a protected group. 
Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said Tuesday that the purpose was to consolidate Connecticut’s hate crimes laws, which are “scattered,” “inconsistent” and “difficult for police officers and prosecutors to charge” into one place.
The House of Representatives has yet to call a bill passed by the Senate earlier this session that would penalize companies that manufacture and sell drugs or devices that can be used in capital punishment. Under the proposal, the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Protection can refuse to issue a certificate of registration to a business that manufactures or sells items the business knows will be used to “execute a sentence of death.” The department can also suspend or revoke a registration that already exists. Republicans have argued that the bill violates the Interstate Commerce Clause, since the death penalty is legal in other states.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont signed into law a bill that would establish a 23-member trade commission between the state and Puerto Rico.
“This is a long time in the making, and I believe that it was the collaborative effort. We worked very hard to make it a reality, and we’re excited that this is moving forward,” said Rep. Juan Candelaria, D-New Haven. “I think now the real work begins, right?”
The measure aims to boost trade and economic investment, and allows lawmakers in the continental U.S. and on the island to team up on policy issues of interest to both communities, among other things.
“The committee will break out into academics, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, agricultural and the like because those are four avenues that can parlay and play off each other, going back and forth to Connecticut and Puerto Rico,” explained bill co-sponsor Geraldo Reyes, who represents Waterbury.
Another aim would help to promote business and academic exchanges between the state and the island. Some had already been in talks — like the just-inked agreement between the University of Puerto Rico’s Ponce campus and the University of Bridgeport’s nursing programs.
“(It) opens up a myriad of opportunities for those folks on the island,” said co-sponsor Christopher Rosario of Bridgeport, “and, vice versa, for those students from here that can go and study down there and experience Latin America — being that we have a high concentration of Latinos here in New England — to learn the language and work in that environment.”
Given the skills sharing focus, support has come from both sides of the aisle.
“This is about creating mutual opportunities for job growth and economic development,” said Republican Sen. Henri Martin in a statement. “It makes sense for us to create a panel that will focus on deepening ties with Puerto Rico. Those deeper ties can bring about entrepreneurship and innovative ideas while boosting tourism.”
But before the commission can be formally established, Puerto Rico’s legislature must pass a parallel bill and get a signature from their governor, Jenniffer González-Colón.
And as Puerto Rico still recovers from damage to its electrical grid after a series of hurricanes and earthquakes in recent years, the new commission aims to help garner investment in infrastructure on the island and the state.
“One of the things that we kind of feel helpless here on the mainland is: When something happens back home, what can we do to help? I think this is a way for us to kind of reach out again, and especially when it comes to the infrastructure with energy,” Rosario said. “We want to send our folks as well, those experts that can help fix that electrical grid — something that Washington is not doing, something that we can do as a state.”

Imagine a row of children’s books and educational materials, deemed inappropriate or controversial by some, shoved away in an adult’s only section – further out of reach than that imaginary cabinet – each with a warning that disseminating those books to a minor could be a crime.
In some cities and townships across Michigan, library officials or the members of boards that oversee them, especially those who have expressed hostility to the LGBTQ+ community, are toying with the idea of making those barriers a reality.
The effort has become a second front, so to speak, in the culture war over children’s books and particularly those with LGBTQ+ content or themes. 
Much like the battles over prohibiting library books or criminalizing them for minors that have played out over the last few years, activists and attorneys across Michigan have said that similarly sequestering or restricting access to books runs afoul of the First Amendment.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Jay Kaplan, a long-time staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan staff specializing in LGBTQ+ rights, said in an interview with Michigan Advance that right-wing culture warriors were employing this new tactic because they were losing the overall campaign on outright book bans.
“They’re losing in terms of the public opinion, [because] a vast majority of people disfavor this type of thing,” Kaplan said. “And so they feel, ‘We’ll just try to move it to another place in the library. We’ll try to put a label on it. We’ll try and discourage people from being able to take them out.’”
But federal courts have looked at the issue, and they have found, Kaplan said, that even when a community is not just removing the book entirely from the library, the act of putting a burden on the First Amendment right to receive information based on content amounted to the same.
“Particulary if what’s motivating you to want to limit them is your disapproval of the subject matter of the book, or some of the contents of the book,” he said. “That also violates the First Amendment.”
The crusade in Hartland
For the Hartland Cromaine District Library in Livingston County, the conversation on labeling books started in 2022. Over time and with the election of new library Board of Trustees members, the conversation became much more pointed.
Much of that had to do with the election of Bill Bolin, the pastor of the FloodGate Church in Brighton, and his elevation to the president of the Cromaine District Library board in January. Bolin and his church have been written about by various publications, including The Atlantic’s Tim Alberta, detailing Bolin’s mixture of right-wing conspiratorial politics and Christianity. Bolin also features throughout Alberta’s 2023 book, “The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory: American Evangelicals in an Age of Extremism.”
Some board members questioned Bolin’s experience and qualifications for running the library board in a breezy rural district just before he was selected as its leader in January. But the board voted 5-2 to install him at the top.
In February, Bolin, as the congregants of the FloodGate Church know him to do, began to speak out of order to introduce himself and detail exactly why it was that he sought the library board position and its leadership post, according to the approved minutes of the board’s February 20 meeting.
“For those who do not know why I ran for this position, I desire to protect children from the harm that can befall them over coercive behavior,” Bolin said in a statement to the crowd. “The approach I am suggesting, along with certain colleagues, is a commonsense approach to changing the sexual tone and nature of some library policies and practices.”
Bolin said that the board would then discuss controversial items on the agenda, including the removal of June LGBTQ+ Pride displays, labeling certain books that may be deemed controversial, moving books to an age restricted area, providing supervision in the teen area to monitor “behavior” and returning the Pledge of Allegiance to monthly meetings.
Bolin then read from Michigan law regarding the displaying or disseminating of sexually explicit materials to minors, followed by a recitation of a potential warning label he had created warning adults of the dangers of providing such material to children.
But Bolin wasn’t talking about dirty magazines in a seedy retail store: he was talking about books within the community’s public library.

“Someone needs to stand up for the children,” Bolin said. “Those who serve on the library board and want to implement policies that restrict access to certain books and place content warning labels will be able to enact policies that reflect the community in which they serve the people of Cromaine Library District, either tonight by vote or later after referral to the appropriate committee for refinement of language and crafting of policies that state intention of the people.”
Bolin added that a list of books that could be recommended for labeling was being compiled with at least 80 titles, minimum, to be presented to the librarian “for labeling and movement into an age-appropriate section of the library.”
Members of the community present at the February 20 meeting noted that the Top 10 challenged books in that list had LGBTQ+ characters or themes. Some questioned if the board had the legal authority to deem what was and wasn’t sexual in nature about these books, while others praised the move.
Among the latter was Livingston County Commissioner Wes Nakagiri, one of the architects of the conservative Tea Party movement in Michigan, which undoubtedly built the framework of the America First and MAGA movement that propelled President Donald Trump to power in 2016 and again in 2024.
Attorneys advise against censorship
A day before that meeting, on February 19, the board sought and received a legal opinion from its corporate counsel at the Foster Swift law firm on whether it could move forward with restricting access to books or otherwise discouraging minor patrons from getting to them.
In a memo provided to Michigan Advance, the law firm expressed concern that the library would be on shaky constitutional ground if it moved forward with a policy that would move books to an adult-only section, placing them behind glass, creating a separate section for controversial books or placing on them labels identifying them as obscene.
The firm said each one of those actions might be unconstitutional based on similar policies already deemed unconstitutional by the courts.

Although each of those actions came with significant risk of opening the library up to a lawsuit, the move to place warning labels on books indicating sexually explicit content and the possibility of criminal prosecution if the material was provided to a minor was noted as having “several practical shortcomings that could lead to further violations of the law.”
Not only would the labels constitute a burden on access to materials, the firm said courts would undoubtedly analyze the motives behind labeling some materials and not others. The firm added that the library would likely lose that challenge.

Some community members have noted that communications between board members and residents or allies in the push to have some books labeled would only help a suing party win a case against the library.
“For example, if the ‘sexually explicit material’ labels tended to stigmatize protected speech or one viewpoint more heavily than another, like anti-LBGTQ+ messages vs. pro-LBGTQ+ messages, the library may be subject to liability,” the firm said in the February legal memo. “Lastly, we note that there is current litigation in federal court involving an Alabama library’s use of ‘labels’ that signaled that a material contained ‘adult’ themes and the library’s prohibition on minors accessing those materials. In that case, the parties are awaiting a hearing and/or decision on the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction.”
Yet Bolin and members of the board who supported the push continued on, and eventually sought a separate opinion from the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal advocacy group that works primarily to seed Christian religious beliefs, practices and customs in public schools or other government bodies.
Bolin eventually brought a refined version of the proposed policy with labeling as the main avenue to keep LGBTQ+ themed and other materials deemed inappropriate to library staff and the board with notes from ADF attorney Paul Spena. Bolin was wary to name Spena as the attorney he was now working with to craft the policy but later relented when pressed on the issue.
When asked to talk about the legal theory behind the labels and what case law they could point to show that it was legally sound, Spena and the ADF declined to comment or be interviewed for this story.
Letter to Board of Trustees
The ACLU of Michigan formally chimed in on the policy last week, and sent the board a letter drafted by Kaplan warning members that what they were pursuing was an act of censorship, even if the titles are not banned from the library and remain within its walls, located in special sections or with new labels affixed to the covers.
“Doing so impedes the rights of library patrons and runs afoul of the First Amendment,” Kaplan wrote. “It can also harm marginalized communities who may come to places like public libraries hoping for an inclusive space, and in this particular instance, doing so with regard to LGBTQ+ titles will exacerbate that harm.”
Opposition mounts as board moves forward
Several community members who spoke to Michigan Advance in the course of reporting this story said that Bolin and his allies on the board were moving closer to adopting the policy despite those warnings, in essence inviting a lawsuit to be pioneers on the issue here in Michigan. Among them was Stand Against Extremism LivCo (SAGE) co-founder Julie Ohashi, who has been vocal in her opposition to the board’s actions thus far.
On Tuesday evening, Spena was expected to speak at the library board’s special meeting to discuss the policy in full. No such discussion with Spena or another attorney from the ADF occurred, and it was not clear if Spena or another member of the group were present at the meeting.
Bolin mentioned, however, that the legal discourse was changing in America, indicating that courts in the era of Trump might be turning the tide to support measures much like the one being discussed by the Cromaine District Library board.
Present at the meeting, however, were several community members, some in support of Bolin and the board’s majority on the label issue and plenty of others who said they were disheartened, dismayed and angry that the board would continue moving toward a policy they called discriminatory and clearly illegal.

As the board moved through the policy line by line, softening it due to objections from several board members out of fear of being sued and settling more on labeling as the possible avenue, those opposed to the move held signs calling on the board to not mix religion and politics. But those silent protests quickly turned vocal, with shouts and jeers rising above the din of what started as a calm meeting.
Board Vice President Jeannine Gogoleski was appointed as the sergeant at arms for the meeting, and she and her husband, Glenn Gogoleski, a member of the Hartland Consolidated Schools Board of Education, began removing disruptive members of the meeting.
Tensions rose further when the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office was called to ensure there were no further outbursts. The meeting went into recess until deputies could sort out the situation, and they remained there until it ended.
Although the board did not adopt a policy on Tuesday, it is expected to do so at its next meeting.
During public comment, some read lengthy diatribes laden with Christian scripture, while others lambasted the board inviting what they called a hate group to give the board legal advice and defend them if they are forced into court. One woman held up Alberta’s book while speaking, noting that Bolin’s name appeared in it multiple times, to which Bolin smiled.
Ohashi called ADF a “hate group” that has described LGBTQ+ rights as a principal threat to religious freedom, and attacking those rights was at the center of their work.
“Their goal is to trigger as many lawsuits that can get to the U.S. Supreme Court as fast as possible,” she said. “That is precisely the point. They want this to go to court, because ADF’s ultimate goal is eliminating LGBTQ+ Americans’ status as a protected class of citizens.” 
Kate Mazzara of Hartland said she feared that the nation was tiptoeing toward religious fascism and that the small district library in her hometown was sliding on the same path.
“Make no mistake about it, that’s what this is,” Mazara said. “It starts with baby steps, and then it’s over.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603_191506-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 10:03:26.228465

Angie Eberspacher of Beaver City, a former member of Educational Service Unit 6, seeks to represent District 5 on the Board of Ed. While on the ESU board, Eberspacher said, she was a strong voice for fiscal responsibility and an advocate for students and teachers. She eventually served as chair. She said she is dedicated to ensuring a “quality education” for all students.

Eberspacher is a graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with dual degrees in elementary education and early childhood education.
“I’m committed to supporting today’s students and helping ensure the next generation has every opportunity to succeed,” Eberspacher said in a statement.
District 5 on the State Board consists of Butler, Clay, Fillmore, Franklin, Gage, Hamilton, Jefferson, Nuckolls, Pawnee, Polk, Richardson, Saline, Saunders, Seward, Thayer, Webster and York Counties, as well as portions of Lancaster County (south Lincoln and surrounding communities including Denton, Sprague, Hallam, Roca, Hickman, Firth, Bennet and Waverly).
The eight members of the State Board of Education generally oversee the Nebraska Department of Education. Terms in office are for four years.

Eberspacher said she plans to visit communities across her district to listen and focus on how to improve literacy and proficiency scores, recruit and retain quality teachers and strengthen academics. She said she also wants to be “a voice for all parents” and promote spending restraint.
In 2023, Eberspacher testified at the Nebraska Legislature in support of a handful of conservative-led proposals, including opening up teachers or librarians to possible criminal penalties for distributing “obscenity,” prohibiting certain medical care for minors with gender dysphoria, outlawing drag shows for minors, creating a “Parents’ Bill of Rights” in education and allowing public dollars to follow students to private K-12 schools (the “My Student, My Choice Act”).
Eberspacher and her husband of 36 years, Curt, own a farming operation in rural Beaver Crossing. The family has three adult daughters, a son-in-law and a granddaughter.
Penner on Wednesday confirmed to the Examiner that he is not seeking reelection. He has given his “full endorsement” to Eberspacher and said her experience and dedication “make her the right choice to continue advocating for students, parents and educators across the district.”

The race is officially nonpartisan, but Penner and Eberspacher are both Republicans. She previously worked as a spokeswoman for the Nebraska Republican Party. Penner was appointed to the State Board in December 2021 and won election in 2022 with 55% of the vote.
The State Board of Education is currently split 4-4 between Republicans and Democrats. The split has led some to advocate for giving the governor more control over the education bureaucracy. A January vote for board chair required 54 votes in January.
“I am excited to run for the Nebraska State Board of Education and hear from voters across District 5 about their vision for education in Nebraska,” Eberspacher said. “I’m running to support Nebraska’s students, teachers and parents, and to work toward a stronger education system for everyone.”

The probes come after Cromwell Public Schools received a similar notice last week, informing the district that the U.S. Department of Education was investigating whether it was violating federal law by allowing transgender students to participate in sports and use facilities aligned with their gender identity.
At the time, representatives with the state Department of Education said Cromwell’s was the only such investigation they were aware of. Now there are three.
A spokesperson from the state Department of Education said the new investigation notices were sent directly to district officials in Bloomfield and Canton and that the department had not received copies. The department was notified by the districts and was aware of the investigations, the spokesperson said.
If the districts are found in violation of Title IX, millions of dollars in federal funding could be at risk: roughly $1.26 million for Cromwell, $3.3 million for Bloomfield and $700,000 in Canton.

Superintendents Tracy A. Youngberg, of Bloomfield, and Jordan E. Grossman, of Canton, did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
Cromwell Superintendent Enza Macri wrote to district parents over the weekend, according to a report from WFSB. “As a public school, we make it a priority to create a welcoming and nurturing environment where all students can participate in our educational programs,” she wrote. “At the same time, we are fully committed to following federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination in educational programs. We are keeping both of these priorities at the forefront as we review our policies with the Office for Civil Rights.”
Policy questions
The investigations follow several executive orders from President Donald J. Trump that have reshaped the federal Department of Education — particularly with respect to Title IX guidance and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Under the new rules, the federal Education Department will enforce Title IX “on the basis of biological sex in schools and on campuses.”
Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination, was extended under former President Joe Biden to students who identify as LGBTQ+ and added protections for transgender students. But after Trump took office in January, he reverted Title IX protections back to the 2020 guidance that was issued during his first administration.
Rep. Christie Carpino, R-Cromwell, sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont Monday seeking guidance with respect to what she called “conflicting policies at the state and federal level.” The investigation and funding threat, Carpino wrote, “seem to stem from a problem created by the State.”
“We are a small town that values the education and safety of our students,” she wrote. “We are now being faced with mounting legal fees and the potential loss of almost $1 million dollars, annually, for no reason other than dichotomy between state and federal policies.”
Lamont disagreed Tuesday, saying the state was compliant with federal statute and adding that Connecticut “will continue to adhere to those laws.”
“What we will not adhere to is divisive bullying in our schools or targeting of transgender students, who deserve to have their rights protected,” Lamont said in a written statement. “At a time when we’re trying to ensure that all students feel connected and engaged, discrimination and exclusion have no place in our schools or in our state.”

Connecticut law “prohibits discrimination based on gender, gender identity & expression and sexual orientation,” and shall offer “an equal opportunity to participate in the activities, programs and courses of study offered in such public schools, at such time as the child becomes eligible to participate in such activities, programs and courses of study, without discrimination on account of race, color, sex, gender identity or expression, religion, national origin or sexual orientation,” according to the state’s official website.
The Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference says its policy to provide transgender student-athletes with equal opportunities consistent with their gender identity remains unchanged.
“Throughout this process, we continue to support the well-being of all student-athletes while abiding by federal and state law,” CIAC Executive Director Glenn M. Lungarini said, adding that his office has sought additional guidance from the Attorney General’s Office, the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities and the Connecticut State Department of Education.
A common thread
Cromwell, Canton and Bloomfield are three of five school districts who were defendants in a 2019 lawsuit that sought to ban transgender athletes from participating in female sports.
Soule et al v. Connecticut Association of Schools was filed on behalf of four cisgender female high school track athletes who said the participation of transgender girls in their sport took away their opportunities for victory, public recognition, athletic scholarships and future employment and violated Title IX, according to the lawsuit.
Trump administration officials agreed in 2020 that Connecticut violated Title IX, but state leaders pushed back. In early 2021, when President Joe Biden took office, his administration withdrew support for the lawsuit and rescinded the Education Department’s threats to cut funding to the districts. At that time, a district court ruled in favor of the defendants to dismiss the lawsuit and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision in December 2022.
The case, however, remains ongoing after a larger panel of appellate judges from the 2nd Circuit Court sent the case back to the district court to consider the full Title IX claims. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint last year requesting athletic records be changed where transgender athletes participated.
Dan Barrett, legal director of the ACLU of Connecticut, said Connecticut was not then, or now, in conflict with federal law, nor is the state violating Title IX by allowing transgender students to participate in sports aligned with their gender identity.
“[State law] won’t be in conflict unless and until the U.S. Supreme Court or the Second Circuit rules that agrees with the plaintiffs in Soule and others like them and the current United States government, which is pushing this theory that Title IX actually requires discrimination — requires schools to discriminate against trans kids,” Barrett said. “If one of our higher appellate courts agrees with that theory, then yes, Connecticut’s law will come into conflict with Title IX.”
The federal government’s threat to pull funding “is a mechanism by which the current executive branch can advance its agenda,” Barrett said. 
“Not just when it comes to the rights of transgender kids in Connecticut, but on a range of activities,” Barrett said. “They’re using either federal constitutional provisions or federal statues that would have preemptive effect, to nationalize discrimination and to override state laws that require people to be treated fairly.”
State Attorney General William Tong said in a written statement Tuesday that the investigations were “meanspirited and unlawful, and deeply harmful to all Connecticut students.”
He said precedent from the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County has “made it clear … that discrimination against transgender individuals is illegal under federal law.” Tong said his office is “considering all legal options within our authority to protect Connecticut’s students and schools.”

Despite being the fastest-growing population group, APIA voices are often overlooked due to sparse data. A new report aims to change that. 
The post New survey shows that Asian and Pacific Islander Americans are concerned about cost of living, lean Democrat, and have high levels of civic engagement  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER AMERICANS in Massachusetts are concerned about the cost of living and housing in the state, tend to have a high level of civic engagement, and are more likely to vote for Democrats, according to a new statewide poll conducted by the MassINC Polling Group. On Tuesday, a group of organizations that work on issues relating to Asian and Pacific Islander Americans (APIA) released a survey report – titled No Longer Invisible – on the lived experiences and civic engagement of APIA residents in the state. The study included responses from 1,414 APIA residents in the state and was conducted from March 5 to March 31, 2025.  Asian and Pacific Islander Americans make up 7 percent of the population and are the fastest-growing racial group in Massachusetts, with the population rising by nearly 38 percent since 2012, according to the survey. However, little data has been collected that provides insights into the experiences of APIA in the state. Top of mind for APIA survey respondents were issues around the affordability of housing and the cost of living in the state. Twenty-seven percent cited housing, and 32 percent picked cost of living as the most pressing issue. Broader statewide surveys have shown that housing shows up as the top issue for people living in Massachusetts. The survey asked questions about political participation, safety and sense of belonging, and viewpoints on the Trump administration and its policies. Nearly a quarter of respondents said that they had experienced discrimination with 21 percent saying that they faced ethnic slurs.  Only 39 percent of respondents said that they strongly agree that they feel like they belong in the United States. Respondents largely said that they anticipated negative impacts from the Trump administration on critical issues like immigration policy (61 percent), racism (65 percent), reproductive rights (63 percent), climate change (63 percent), and LGBTQ+ rights (67 percent). A majority of survey respondents opposed President Donald Trump’s executive orders purportedly ending birthright citizenship; rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts; and increasing deportation actions. However, the results were a bit more divided on the deportation executive order compared to the others, with lower overall opposition.   Advocates for APIA communities say that their work is more difficult without adequate data, and elected officials might overlook APIA voters. The survey is meant to address that gap and provide some of the data necessary for more advocacy and policy changes regarding APIA issues. The project was a collaboration between the Massachusetts Asian American and Pacific Islanders Commission, the Institute for Asian American Studies at UMass Boston, the Asian Community Fund at The Boston Foundation, and APIs CAN. The groups worked with the MassINC Polling Group, which is partly owned by MassINC, the nonprofit organization that publishes CommonWealth Beacon, to create the survey questions.  Anti-Asian hate and discrimination have been on the rise nationwide. Nearly 36 percent of Asian Americans across the country reported having experienced harassment, and 63 percent reported that they have felt unsafe in a public place, according to the 2025 STAATUS Index – an annual survey of Asian Americans in the US.  “This project is both a wake-up call and a call to action,” said Danielle Kim, the executive director of the Asian Community Fund at the Boston Foundation and a member of the Massachusetts Asian American and Pacific Islanders Commission, at an event on Tuesday launching the survey report. “This reported partnership represents an important milestone in uplifting greater visibility for our communities and harnessing our collective voice to advocate for lasting change.” The survey also found that APIA survey participants were engaged politically at a relatively high rate, with 80 percent saying that they were registered to vote. Among those who were registered, 84 percent said that they had voted in the 2024 election. APIA survey respondents reported being politically active in other ways as well – 23 percent signed petitions, 19 percent attended government meetings, and 15 percent attended rallies. A majority of APIA survey respondents – 56 percent – leaned Democrat, and 67 percent of those who reported voting in the 2024 election said they voted for Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president.  At the report launch event, members of the APIA community spoke of the importance of data in empowering APIA communities to advocate for themselves. Chahat Kalia, a member of the Massachusetts Asian American and Pacific Islanders Commission’s Youth Council, noted that more work needs to be done to include other APIA voices that aren’t present in this survey report. “As a young person, I want to inform a future where our mental health, our safety, our education, and our identities are not an afterthought,” said Kalia. “To the policy-makers and community members in this room, thank you for listening. Please continue to listen to us, include us, and value our stories because we are not just the future. We are the present, and we’re ready to be part of the conversation.”  The post New survey shows that Asian and Pacific Islander Americans are concerned about cost of living, lean Democrat, and have high levels of civic engagement  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603_132309-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 10:03:26.228465

Would paying teachers-in-training more money help California solve its teacher shortage? One state lawmaker thinks it should, but faces an uphill battle as California also grapples with a $12 million budget shortfall, reports CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones. 
To become a California K-12 public school teacher, candidates need a bachelor’s degree and a teaching credential. The credential is usually earned after completing a one-year program that can cost as much as $40,000. During this time, candidates work with experienced teachers or lead their own classes to obtain 600 hours of classroom experience.
Roughly 60% of teachers in 2020 took out loans to finish their degrees, with loans averaging about $30,000, according to the Learning Policy Institute. Meanwhile, the average starting teacher salary in California is $58,000, so it can take some people more than a decade to pay off these debts.
Under these circumstances, about 65% of California teachers surveyed skipped out on family vacations, 37% delayed medical care and 30% took on gig work to earn more income, according to a report by the California Teachers Association union released in January.
To address pay issues and encourage more people to join the profession, Assembly Bill 1128 would create a grant program for school districts to pay student teachers the same amount as substitute teachers — about $140 a day. While the bill has no formal opposition, an Assembly bill analysis estimates that the proposal, if passed, would cost up to $300 million a year.

Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, a Torrance Democrat and bill author: “This bill ensures that more talented, diverse, and committed educators can complete their training and serve in our public schools.”

The bill advanced through the Assembly Monday and now sits before the Senate.

Tariff fight continues 🥊

Two months ago, businesses and multiple states, including California, filed separate lawsuits against President Donald Trump’s administration to halt its tariff policies. On Monday a federal court judge threw out California’s lawsuit, setting the stage for an appeals process before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.
The dismissal is considered a minor win for California Attorney General Rob Bonta. Legal experts anticipate the lawsuit to ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Trump administration had requested that California’s lawsuit be transferred to the U.S. Court of International Trade. Though the federal court judge agreed the lawsuit should be before the federal trade court, they ruled that the administration “could not articulate why transfer … serves the interests of justice.”

Raising the standard for charging accomplices


The California Supreme Court in San Francisco on May 8, 2024. Photo by Jeff Chiu, AP Photo




This week the California Supreme Court ruled to resentence a prisoner’s murder charge, in the first case that tests a 2018 state law to raise the bar for an accomplice’s murder conviction.
As CalMatters’ Nigel Duara explains, seven years ago California passed a law barring prosecutors from pursuing felony murder charges against accomplices unless they “aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer … and acted with reckless indifference to human life.” 
Under that policy, the state’s highest court ruled that Louis Emanuel, who was at the scene of a 2012 shooting death in San Jose but did not fire the gun, should be resentenced because his conduct did not reflect “a reckless indifference to human life.”
Emanuel was initially convicted of first-degree felony murder in 2015. This week’s ruling kicks his case back to trial court for resentencing.

Ruling also rejects Trump’s attempt to get California’s case transferred. State takes its tariffs fight to the 9th Circuit appeals court, which experts believe is more likely to give it a favorable ruling.


A judge threw out California’s lawsuit against President Trump’s tariffs this week, but the case will keep going because the state itself asked for the dismissal. 
State Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office said he will immediately appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.
The Trump administration had requested that the California lawsuit, filed in April, be transferred to the U.S. Court of International Trade. The federal court judge in San Francisco rejected the transfer on Monday, even though she said she believes tariff questions belong before the federal trade court. 
“Because California requests dismissal rather than transfer to the CIT, transfer is not in the interest of justice,” wrote U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in her ruling. She also wrote that the Trump administration “could not articulate” why it would serve the interest of justice — in other words, be fair — to transfer the case.
Bonta said in a statement that he was “pleased” that the decision gives the state a chance to bring the case before the 9th Circuit. Bonta has argued that Trump’s tariffs are illegal under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which the administration says gives the president the authority to impose wide-ranging tariffs. 
Trump has already lost two cases that made the same arguments. Last week, the Court of International Trade ruled that the tariffs are unlawful because Trump has exceeded his authority under that act. That decision, in a lawsuit brought by Oregon, 11 other states and five businesses, has been put on hold pending an appeal by the Trump administration. A federal district court judge in Washington, D.C. also made a similar determination last week in a suit brought by a couple of small businesses. 
The tariffs — which have so far affected California ports, agriculture and other industries — remain in effect in the meantime. 
Legal experts say Bonta is more likely to get a favorable ruling in the 9th Circuit appeals court, which has a reputation for being liberal. But they differ on whether the case belongs in that court. 
“It’s hard to see how it belongs in the 9th Circuit,” said Richard Steinberg, professor at UCLA School of Law. “It’s a tariff case.” 
Brian Peck, adjunct professor at University of Southern California Gould School of Law, said “the whole question is whether the (International Emergency Economic Powers Act) gives the president the power, which is more of a constitutional question, so it should be before the 9th Circuit rather than the Court of International Trade.”
An appeal from the trade court would land before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which Peck said might be more favorable to the Trump administration because it has historically been more deferential to presidential powers.
Bonta recently spoke about his tariffs lawsuit at a roundtable of business leaders in San Francisco, and he noted that the act “doesn’t mention the word tariffs.” 
“Since the Court of International Trade deals with civil actions arising out of U.S. customs and international trade laws — which we argue does not include (the emergency economic powers act) — we believe the 9th Circuit has appropriate jurisdiction here,” wrote Elissa Perez, a spokesperson for the attorney general, in an email to CalMatters.
The White House did not respond to CalMatters’ request for comment.
Peck and Steinberg both said they think the question over Trump’s authority to impose tariffs the way he has been doing — broadly and without consulting Congress — is likely to end up before the Supreme Court.
Steinberg said the Trump administration can cite other statutes that give him the power to impose tariffs, but they would be more restrictive. But he doesn’t doubt that the president will keep trying.
“This is an endless game of whack-a-mole,” Steinberg said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/021225-Port-of-LA-JAJ-CM-09.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 09:04:57.034517

While health care workers, community groups and other officials say many factors may contribute to the drop in opioid overdose deaths, they agree that access to overdose-reversing drugs like naloxone, often provided under the brand name Narcan, is saving lives. “I do think […[...]","Narcan dispensing boxes are becoming more common across Missouri. Medicines like Narcan, also known as naloxone, help fight opioid overdose deaths, but officials say more investment is needed to treat addiction (Suzanne King/The Beacon).After years of exponential growth, opioid overdose deaths in Missouri are dropping.
While health care workers, community groups and other officials say many factors may contribute to the drop in opioid overdose deaths, they agree that access to overdose-reversing drugs like naloxone, often provided under the brand name Narcan, is saving lives.
“I do think that Narcan is the reason for those trends statistically dropping,” said Cooper County Ambulance Chief Brandon Hicks. “I see Narcan in a lot more homes than I used to, and I do see family members administering Narcan prior to us getting there.”

In 2014, the state saw 360 opioid overdose deaths from drugs other than heroin. By 2021, that figure rose to 1,493, state data shows.
After increasing through 2021, the trend started changing. The number of deaths flattened in 2022 and began dropping in 2023. By 2024, non-heroin opioid overdose deaths had fallen to 876.
Central Missouri and the St. Louis area saw the largest drop in drug overdose deaths, dropping 38% and 35%, respectively.
But after responding to opioid overdose calls for years, Hicks sees the need for more access to treatment and better coordination between emergency services and long-term care, especially in rural areas.
That belief is shared across community health organizations. Access to things like peer support specialists and community resources is an essential piece of the puzzle, according to Derek Wilson, who runs harm reduction at the AIDS Project of the Ozarks, which serves 29 counties in southwest Missouri.
“I think there is a particular bit of challenge when you come up against some of these societal things,” Wilson said. “When you get into a more rural area … there’s a ton of stigma. There’s still a lot of shaming, whether it’s self-shaming or from outside sources.”
Wilson hopes that a continued focus on naloxone distribution, coupled with community support and more access to medication-assisted long-term treatment, can continue making inroads in rural communities.
 Did Missouri’s naloxone distribution plan lead to the drop in overdose rates? 

In 2016, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration began a new grant program for states to receive federal funds for addiction treatment, recovery and harm reduction services.
The federal money and state settlement dollars from opioid litigation allowed Missouri to increase investment in addiction treatment and overdose prevention. Early funds were mostly used to support treatment efforts. But as the response evolved, the state began investing more heavily in distributing naloxone across the state.
From 2017 to 2023, the Missouri Institute of Mental Health (MIMH) distributed nearly 430,000 naloxone kits across the state. In 2023 alone, nearly 250,000 kits were given out, including more kits shipped off to local health departments, social services and first responders, according to a report from researchers at MIMH.
In their report, researchers connect the drop in overdose deaths with the availability of naloxone across the state. But other rural health researchers think more time is needed to truly understand the drop in deaths.
“It’s encouraging, but I don’t think we know exactly why it’s changed,” said Kelly Price, a rural addiction researcher in Vermont. “It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out over time … It does sometimes seem like it takes a little bit longer to see those effects that you see nationally in some of these more isolated rural communities.”
MIMH researchers also pointed to the westward movement of fentanyl across the country. Data show that eastern parts of the country see lower levels of fentanyl-related deaths, while they are rising in western parts of the country.
Hicks sees the need for better data collection for health officials to truly understand the trends, especially in smaller counties where funds for autopsies may not align with death rates. He pointed to the prevalence of opioid-related cardiac events.
“We just did a community health assessment,” Hicks said. “We identified that there’s really not been any opioid deaths in Cooper County for quite some time. The problem is that they’re getting ruled cardiac arrest.”
“At the end of the day this is a true statement, their heart stopped,” he added. “When it comes to pulling statistics, nobody sees the opioid deaths that we do have.”
If someone’s heart stops as a result of an overdose, naloxone won’t revive them without chest compressions. Researchers at the American Heart Association found that of the 360,000 cardiac arrests from 2017 to 2021, 8% were caused by drug overdoses.
Part of the problem in collecting that data, Hicks said, was funding for autopsies. If the county only budgets for a certain number of autopsies, it can be difficult to determine whether a death was related to drugs in other ways besides an overdose.
“I have one gentleman that I have (used Narcan on) three times that’s been in cardiac arrest, and after the third time, he literally told me: ‘See, I can do whatever I want. You’re going to be here to save me,’” Hicks said. “We can’t save somebody who is dead, and they can’t save themselves either. But if they get Narcan before we get there, usually they refuse care.”
But Stephanie Malita, a health educator at the St. Joseph Health Department, says peer support specialists who are active in the area report that the number of overdoses someone experiences isn’t relevant to their recovery outcomes.
“Peers will say time and time again that some of them overdosed multiple times,” Malita said. “But eventually they got to the point in their lives where they were ready and had a support team around them to make that very scary leap into non-use.”
 Addressing fear of law enforcement when treating overdoses 

Studies show that despite Good Samaritan laws, which offer legal protection for people who are witnessing or experiencing a drug or alcohol overdose, skepticism remains when it comes to calling first responders in the event of an overdose.
Missouri’s Good Samaritan law provides immunity from things like possession of controlled and synthetic substances or paraphernalia, as long as someone is actively seeking medical assistance. It also requires law enforcement to provide treatment resources. It does not protect against other crimes like distributing a controlled substance or active warrants.
Hicks regularly runs into that fear when he responds to overdose calls. If 911 is called, the person overdosing often has already gotten a dose of naloxone, and law enforcement almost always arrives at the scene before EMS.
“People don’t want law enforcement, they feel like they’ve done something wrong,” Hicks said. “So we usually encounter somebody who is angry and upset … because they’re scared of getting arrested. They didn’t want to go to jail, they just wanted to live.”
He and his staff take extra steps to differentiate themselves from law enforcement when responding to overdose calls. They don’t wear button-up shirts or badges to try and make people feel more comfortable.
“I appreciate law enforcement,” Hicks said. “But I don’t want to be associated with them in these scenarios, because then I can’t help somebody like we’re supposed to help them.”
 How to address the need for long-term care in rural Missouri 

Wilson and the AIDS Project of the Ozarks are working on ways to make naloxone more available across their coverage area. The group places drop boxes with naloxone kits in places like libraries and other public settings, so it is available to the community 24/7.

It’s an investment that Malita and the health department, which was one of the top county recipients for naloxone kits from the MIMH, are looking at making as they continue naloxone outreach.
But more attention is needed when it comes to connecting naloxone recipients with longer-term addiction care. Things like distance to a provider, income, transportation and child care are often cited as roadblocks for rural patients seeking care.
Hicks said he hopes to see more investment in things like transportation to crisis centers. He also pointed to integrating 911 and 988, the national suicide and crisis hotline, as a way to ensure Missourians are getting the care they need.
“The emergency room is just not the place for a lot of people in these situations,” Hicks said. “More mental health support (is needed), not a physician that tells them to go seek care elsewhere once they’ve fixed a very temporary problem.”
Price pointed to data that shows starting people on medication-assisted treatment, including buprenorphine or naltrexone, after an overdose and then connecting them with a long-term provider has been shown to be an effective approach.
Things like expanded access to telehealth, where people can meet with providers in the privacy of their own homes, can also help people in smaller communities seek care in ways that are more fitting for them.
Wilson said reducing stigma so everyone feels comfortable seeking care is a priority.
“I do think it is something that is thicker in rural areas, the idea of not wanting to get into it, and: ‘Why don’t those people just go take care of themselves? Why don’t they stop?’” Wilson said. “It’s just not that simple, not with the way that substances interfere with our brain chemistry.”
“It’s just a human being and things get away from them,” Wilson said. “Then they find themselves in very, very horrible situations.”

This bill would pay those who try,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/06/student-teachers-california/,"To earn a teaching credential, students are required to complete a one-year program combining coursework and 600 hours of classroom experience. A new bill would provide money to pay them for that work.","In summary
To earn a teaching credential, students are required to complete a one-year program combining coursework and 600 hours of classroom experience. A new bill would provide money to pay them for that work. 


When Brigitta Hunter started her teaching career, she had $20,000 in student loans and zero income – even though she was working nearly full time in the classroom.
“We lived on my husband’s pathetic little paycheck. I don’t know how we did it,” Hunter said. “And we were lucky – he had a job and my loans weren’t that bad. It can be almost impossible for some people.”
Each year, about 28,000 people in California work for free for about a year as teachers or classroom aides while they complete the requirements for their teaching credentials. That year without pay can be a dire hardship for many aspiring teachers, even deterring them from pursuing the profession.    
A new bill by Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, a Democrat from Torrance, would set aside money for school districts to pay would-be teachers while they do their student teaching service. The goal is to help alleviate the teacher shortage and attract lower-income candidates to the profession.
“Nothing makes a bigger difference in improving the quality of public education than getting highly qualified teachers in the classroom,” Muratsuchi said. “This bill helps remove some of the obstacles to that.”
Big loans, low pay
To be a K-12 public school teacher in California, candidates need a bachelor’s degree and a teaching credential, typically earned after completing a one-year program combining coursework and 600 hours of classroom experience. During that time, candidates work with veteran teachers or lead their own classes.
Teacher credential programs cost between $20,000 and $40,000, depending on where a student enrolls and where they live. In 2020, about 60% of teachers borrowed money to finish their degrees, according to a recent study by the Learning Policy Institute, with loans averaging about $30,000 for a four-year bachelor’s degree and a credential program.
Entering the profession with hefty student loans can be demoralizing and stressful, the report said, adding to the challenges new teachers face. The average starting teacher salary in California is $58,000, according to the National Education Association, among the highest in the country but still hard to live on in many parts of the state. It could take a decade or more for teachers to pay off their loans.
Muratsuchi’s bill, AB 1128, passed the Assembly on Monday and now awaits a vote in the Senate. It would create a grant program for districts to pay student teachers the same amount they pay substitute teachers, which is roughly $140 a day. The overall cost would be up to $300 million a year, according to Assembly analysts, but Gov. Gavin Newsom has set aside $100 million for the program in his revised budget.
Muratsuchi has another bill related to teacher pay, also working its way through the Legislature. Assembly bill 477, which passed the Assembly this week, would raise teacher salaries across the board.
Paying teachers, saving money
Christopher Carr, executive director of Aspire Public Schools in Los Angeles, a network of 11 charter schools, called the bill a potential “game changer.”
Teacher candidates often have to work second jobs to make ends meet, and sometimes finish with debt of $70,000 or more, he said. That can be an insurmountable barrier for people with limited resources. Paying would-be teachers would attract more people to the teaching profession, especially Black and Latino candidates, he said. 
School districts around the state have been trying to diversify their teacher workforces, based on research showing that Black and Latino students tend to do better academically when they have at least one teacher of the same race.
Carr’s schools pay their teachers-in-training through grants and a partnership with a local college, which has led to more of them staying on to teach full time after they receive their credentials, he said. That has saved the schools money by reducing turnover.
“This could open doors and be a step toward racial justice,” Carr said. “California has a million spending priorities, but this will lead to better outcomes for students and ultimately save the state money.”
Tyanthony Davis, chief executive director of Inner City Education Foundation, a charter school network in Los Angeles, put it this way: “If we have well paid, qualified, happy teachers, we’ll have happier classrooms.”
No opposition, yet
Muratusuchi’s bill has no formal opposition. The California Taxpayers Association has not taken a position. The California Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers union, is a supporter.
“This legislation comes at a critical time as we continue to face an educator recruitment and retention crisis,” said David Goldberg, the union president. “Providing new grants to compensate student teachers for important on-the-job training is a strong step forward in the right direction to strengthening public education.”  
Hunter survived her student-teaching experience and went on to teach fourth grade for 34 years, retiring last year from the Mark West Union School District in Santa Rosa. The last 15 years of her career she served as a mentor to aspiring teachers. She saw first-hand the stress that would-be teachers endure as they juggle coursework, long days in the classroom and often second jobs on nights and weekends.
But paying student-teachers, she said, should only be the beginning. Novice teachers also need  smaller class sizes, more support from administrators and more help with enrichment activities, such as extra staff to lead lessons in art and physical education. 
“We definitely need more teachers, and paying student teachers is a good start,” Hunter said. “But there’s a lot more we can do to help them.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/032723-Buttonwillow-LV_CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 09:04:57.034517

In Riverside, more people were in shelters than last year but fewer were on the streets.","In summary
Fewer people were living outside or in shelters in San Bernardino County. In Riverside, more people were in shelters than last year but fewer were on the streets.


Homelessness in some parts of the Inland Empire declined this year, according to an annual survey that estimates the number of people living in shelters or on the street.
The 2025 Homelessness “point-in-time” count marks the first drop in San Bernardino County’s homelessness in years. Before that the homeless population had risen steadily, doubling between 2018 and 2024.
San Bernardino reported an overall 10% drop in the number of homeless people counted compared to last year, driven by a 14% decline in people living outside. Riverside County reported that homelessness increased by 7%, with more people in shelters but fewer living on the street.
The count takes place on a single night in January, when public officials and volunteers search their region to see how many homeless people they find. The counts include people staying in private or public shelters or using hotel vouchers, whom they classify as “sheltered,” as well as those living on the street, who are counted as “unsheltered.”
That data helps cities and counties estimate their total homeless populations and plan for services, including emergency shelters and transitional or permanent housing.
Throughout California, other regions’ point-in-time counts showed mixed results. San Diego reported a 7% drop in homelessness, with big drops in unsheltered families and veterans.  But the Fresno/Madera count in the Central Valley found a 3% increase in homelessness in the region since 2023, with a 10% jump in unsheltered homelessness.
California had the highest homeless population in the nation last year, but it also saw slower growth in homelessness, CalMatters’ Marissa Kendall reported. Homelessness grew 3% to more than 187,000 people in California last year, compared to 18% growth nationwide.
In San Bernardino County, the annual count, conducted on Jan. 23, found 3,821 homeless adults and children this year, down by 434 from last year. That was due to a drop in homeless people living on streets or in other public places. 
Marcus Dillard, chief of homeless services, said the county invested $22 million in permanent housing and other support for people experiencing homelessness last year.
“The county appreciates the funding that has been allocated to support local governments providing support and services for people experiencing homelessness,” he said.
County Supervisor Joe Baca, Jr., said in a statement he is encouraged by the data ”because it shows that our efforts are making a difference. Although our work is far from over, I’m glad to see progress in reducing homelessness.”
But there were still hotspots of homelessness, including three of the county’s biggest cities. 
The city of San Bernardino counted 1,535 homeless people — the highest number in the county — followed by Victorville with 448 and Fontana with 364.
In Riverside County, total homeless numbers rose by 7% since 2023, the last time officials conducted the count. That might sound like bad news, but homelessness had climbed 12% in 2023 and 15% in 2022, which means the growth in homelessness has slowed down over the last few years.
Even so, the number of homeless people in shelters rose sharply from 1,284 in 2023 to 2,012 this year, as the county increased shelter capacity by 11%, according to the point-in-time count. But that was offset by a 19% decrease in people living on the streets, dropping from 2,441 two years ago to 1,978 this year.
The city of Riverside had the biggest homeless population, with 1,087 people counted this year. The count found 509 homeless people living in Indio and 322 in Hemet.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/012524_Alameda-PIT-Count_LE_CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 09:04:57.034517

How a new case tested the law,Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/06/felony-murder-supreme-court/,A recent California law raises the standard for when prosecutors can charge accomplices to killings with felony murder. A case testing that law recently reached the state supreme court.,"In summary
A recent California law raises the standard for when prosecutors can charge accomplices to killings with felony murder. A case testing that law recently reached the state supreme court.


Hundreds of people convicted of murder in California didn’t kill anyone. They were handed long sentences because they drove a getaway car or kicked down a door in a robbery that ended in murder  — and the state used to allow prosecutors to charge accomplices with first-degree felony murder. 
That changed in 2018, when California legislators required a higher standard for an accomplice’s murder conviction.
This week, the first case stemming from that law came before the California Supreme Court, and the ruling is expected to lead to a prisoner’s resentencing. 
The court held that a man who was at the scene of a 2012 shooting death in San Jose should be resentenced under the new law. While he was present at the scene of a robbery and murder, the court found his conduct did not reflect “a reckless indifference to human life” — the standard for convictions of first-degree felony murder. 
The decision reverses rulings by both a trial judge and an appeals court, and sends the case back down to the trial court for resentencing.  
Louis Emanuel and Jacob Whitley set up a fake deal to buy a pound of marijuana from John Sonenberg. In reality, they had plans to rob him, and police later said the pair had likely robbed other people of drugs before who didn’t report the crimes.  
They met next to a park in San Jose in the middle of the afternoon on Dec. 11, 2012. According to court records, Emanuel didn’t know Whitley had a gun. The pair pulled up next to Sonenberg’s pick up truck. Emanuel later allegedly told his ex-girlfriend that, in the confusion during the robbery, Whitley shot Sonenberg. 
“The guy started fighting back and (Whitley) pointed the gun,” said Breanna Santos, Emanuel’s former girlfriend and the mother of his son, according to court records quoted in the ruling. “He was trying to aim down, but the guy hit his hand, it went up and (Whitley) pulled the trigger and he said he shot him in his neck.”
Sonenberg died at the scene. 
At trial in 2015, Emanuel was convicted of first-degree felony murder. Though he didn’t pull the trigger, California law at the time equated his actions to murder while committing a robbery. The Sixth Appellate District Court of Appeal upheld his sentence. 
Then, California legislators passed a law which prohibited prosecutors from pursuing felony murder charges against accomplices unless they “aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer in the commission of murder in the first degree, or the person was a major participant in the underlying felony and acted with reckless indifference to human life.” 
U.S. Supreme Court on felony murder
The U.S. Supreme Court has handed down mixed rulings on comparable cases.
In a 1982 case, they found that a getaway driver in an armed robbery that led to someone’s death could not be given a death sentence. 
But on the other end of the spectrum was a 1987 case in which the people accused of murder broke two people out of prison, armed them, held a family at gunpoint then abandoned the victims in the desert after the escapees shot them. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that those suspects, even though they didn’t pull the trigger, could indeed face the death penalty. 
Those two cases are the opposite ends of the spectrum for defining the culpability of an accomplice to murder, wrote California Supreme Court Associate Justice Kelli Evans in the Emanuel opinion.
“This Court has thus made clear that participation in a “ ‘garden-variety armed robbery’ … is insufficient without more to establish reckless indifference,” Evans wrote.
But when Emanual filed for a resentencing under the 2018 law, the trial court judge ruled that he should have acted to prevent the shooting. 
“In the trial court’s view, Emanuel ‘created’ the situation by participating in the robbery, and thus, had an affirmative obligation to do more than withdraw his aid and support from a murderous cohort,” Evans wrote in the Supreme Court opinion. 
Perhaps most critically, the trial court found that Emanuel acted with reckless indifference to human life. The court of appeal agreed with that decision. 
Focus on Emanuel’s mental state
The California Supreme Court, in reversing both courts, found that Emanuel didn’t have a duty to prevent the robbery. They also pointed to other circumstances, like time of day and location. 
If someone plans to rob a house where methamphetamine is being manufactured by “several armed occupants” at 3 a.m., the person committing the robbery should anticipate violence, the court found. On the other hand, if a person intends to rob an unarmed marijuana dealer in a public park in the middle of the day, “the objective risk of violence posed by the crime and reasonably anticipated by the perpetrator is far less grave.” 
The court also noted that Emanuel tried to dissuade Whitley from robbing Sonenberg and walked away after the shooting. 
“The focus should not be on the ultimate efficacy of his actions, but on what his actions reveal about his mental state,” Evans wrote. “The (trial and appeal) courts did not carefully consider evidence bearing on Emanuel’s state of mind but rather simply judged that he had not employed an adequate measure of restraint.”

Many were in the field in L.A., helping the region recover from deadly wildfires.","Guest Commentary written by

Lauren Levitt
Lauren Levitt is an emergency preparedness outreach lead and California Emergency Response Corps member with AmeriCorps. Lauren is a Marine veteran and native New Yorker currently residing in San Francisco.


Last month, I hung up my yellow vest for the last time.
We were there after wildfires tore through Los Angeles communities, standing alongside survivors in shelters, donation centers, disaster recovery centers and scorched neighborhoods. We helped Californians take their first steps toward rebuilding.
And now, we’re gone.
After the federal government cut funding for AmeriCorps’ disaster relief programs, more than 60 of us in the California Emergency Response Corps were told our service was ending early. Some of my teammates were still in the field when the news came in. They had to pack up and leave while the work was still unfolding.
This is not just about a few disheartened young adults losing the opportunity to serve their community. It’s about what we lose as a state when we cut off the pipeline of people trained and ready to show up in times of crisis.
This derailment happened at a curious time. Our deployment to Los Angeles was the biggest operation in the California program’s history. Our teams helped more than 26,000 wildfire survivors navigate FEMA paperwork, replace lost IDs and find emergency housing. 
We didn’t arrive with all the answers, but we came with compassion, training and a willingness to listen. One afternoon, I sat with an elderly couple as they showed me photos of their destroyed home. They weren’t asking for much — just someone to walk them through the maze of forms and requirements while they tried to make sense of their new reality.
Another day, I met a young man sitting outside a disaster recovery center because he was too nervous to go inside. I sat with him for a while as he recounted how he evacuated his elderly neighbors as the fire approached their neighborhood. The trauma he suffered was significant and it was clear he was struggling to process it. Thankfully, we were able to connect him with the wonderful people at the county department of mental health to get him the services he needed.
Moments like these don’t much attention. But they matter.
As a former Marine, I’ve seen how critical it is to have trained, mission-ready people in the right place at the right time. California’s emergency corps gave me a new mission: helping communities prepare for, respond to and recover from disaster. This program provided critical, entry-level emergency management experience that I would not have otherwise received. 
I thought this was the beginning of my career. For me (and so many others) it was supposed to be a first step, a launchpad into public service.
Instead, it’s been cut short.
The argument you may hear is that national service is too expensive, but that’s not the case with AmeriCorps. For modest stipends, people can serve their communities and gain valuable career experience for a fraction of what outsourcing those services would cost. Emergency response members provide support through fires, floods, pandemics and earthquakes, helping fill gaps no one else can or will. 
We’re not waste, fraud or abuse. We’re vital components of the communities we serve.
At a time when wildfires, floods and climate-driven disasters are only becoming more frequent, we need competent and experienced disaster response professionals. They don’t magically appear. They have to get their start somewhere. Programs like this are how we grow the next generation of emergency responders, crisis managers and community resilience leaders.
Ending the corps program is not just shortsighted, it’s dangerous.
I’m proud of the work we did. I’m grateful to my teammates and mentors. And I’m heartbroken — not just for myself, but for the people we haven’t yet had the chance to help.
If you didn’t know who we were before, I hope you do now. We were the ones in yellow vests, and we were just getting started.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/012625_Eaton-Fire-Rain_JH_47.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 09:04:57.034517

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Republican budget bill the U.S. House approved last month includes a surprise for the 40 states that have expanded Medicaid: penalties for providing health care to some immigrants who are here legally.
Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.
Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.
Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”
West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.
Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”
“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.
There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized if immigrants qualify for the program, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.
The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.
By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.
“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”
The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.
Need to go to the hospital? Texas and Florida want to know your immigration status.

“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”
Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.
Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.
Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.
Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.
“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”
Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.
“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”
More States Offer Health Coverage to Immigrant Children

Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.
“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.
Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.
Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.
“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.
California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.
“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.
If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.
“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.

(Mike Kittrell)State officials on Tuesday asked internet service providers tasked with building Alabama’s broadband network to more strictly adhere to reporting requirements.
During a series of project updates at the Alabama Digital Expansion Authority meeting in Montgomery, representatives from nearly two dozen companies provided details about their progress on state-funded internet projects. While most reported being on or ahead of schedule, others were cautioned for lagging reports and a lack of detailed progress.
“I feel like we are having good progress with some, and some that may not understand the system as to what we are asking for,” Kenneth Boswell, director of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA), said in a firm tone. “We’re happy to provide technical assistance, but we’re not going to do it for you.”

ADECA oversees more than $400 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, with a significant portion of this funding aimed at building “middle-mile” infrastructure, which provides the link from internet providers to local networks. An initial project, funded up to $85 million in 2022, is supposed to create a 3,000-mile fiber network across the state. A second, $245 million middle-mile effort will add another 4,287 miles of fiber infrastructure to specifically connect nearly 800 institutions like schools, hospitals and government facilities.
ADECA is also managing a “last-mile” broadband program that brings service directly to consumers, using up to $191.89 million in ARPA funds. The projects are expected to be completed by February 2026, though extensions are available until the federal spending deadline of December 2026.
During the presentations, several companies that claimed they had progressed further than the data presented were asked to provide up-to-date information and schedule a meeting with the ADECA within 15 days to discuss their progress.
“What we would like to see at the next field meeting is this dashboard filled up to reflect what you’re sharing with us verbally,” Boswell said to AT&T representatives, saying it’s unfair to the other companies submitting the requested data.
Cleo Washington, vice president of external affairs for AT&T Alabama, said that despite appearances on the dashboard, work was well underway, saying the planning phase for several projects would be completed by late summer and early fall.
“We are already constructing fiber in those areas, so we are building out to get to these areas,” Washington said. Boswell scheduled a follow-up meeting with the company within 15 days.
Terry Metze, CEO of Alabama Fiber Network, said that its middle-mile network is “98% complete,” with only a single permit remaining.
“Our contractors are working heavily. This month, we had a couple of weeks of really heavy rain, kind of slowed this down a little bit, but we’re back on track, and everything’s moving forward right now,” Metze said.
Providers pointed to several challenges affecting progress on specific projects. Several, including Coosa Valley Technologies and Farmers Telecommunications Cooperative, said they had delays in securing permits. Weather, including a couple of weeks of heavy rain, was also a factor.
The meeting concluded with Boswell saying that “time is ticking” and asking companies to be more diligent about ensuring projects meet the funding deadline.
“Sounds like we got a lot of time left, but we really don’t. We don’t know what kind of obstacle that you may run into,” Boswell said.

Mike Kehoe announces a plan to give state funding to the MOScholars program during his State of the State speech Jan. 28 in the Missouri House chamber (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe’s first budget proposal launched a tug of war between public-school advocates and those hoping to use state funds for private education. Both sides ultimately came away with what they wanted — but neither expects this to be the final showdown.
State Treasurer Vivek Malek, who oversees the state’s tax-credit scholarship program, told The Independent in an interview last week that he expects to more than double the number of scholarships administered by MOScholars in the upcoming school year.
Those students would have a “reasonable expectation,” he said, to be funded through graduation. And if donor funds continue to come up short, state funds would be required to support them.
In January, Kehoe laid out a budget that did not fully fund public education while giving state funds for private-school scholarships.
His request cut back $300 for the formula that determines state aid for public schools, contrary to the state education department’s recommendation. But he added a $50 million appropriation to the State Treasurer’s budget to help fund private-school scholarships through the MOScholars program. This windfall was not part of the treasurer’s initial request.

“The governor made a policy or a budgetary decision to invest in one form of education and not fully invest in the other,” said state Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Democrat from Springfield and ranking minority member of the House Budget Committee.
The House kept the governor’s recommendations, and the Senate flipped the two priorities: restoring full funding to public schools but axing the $50 million for MOScholars.
In May, state lawmakers reached an agreement to fund both and are awaiting the governor’s signature.
But the infusion of funds to MOScholars is likely to create more need in the program.
Malek said he expects to use the $50 million to offer more scholarships than the current pot of donations could provide. There are 6,000 students ready to participate in the upcoming year, and he expects more to sign up. This past year, 2,700 students received scholarships.
Malek hopes to make MOScholars self-sufficient, with enough donations to meet demand. But until then, he will request funds to, at a minimum, sustain aid for students already enrolled.
“I’ll be working through the years to make sure the tax credits are still utilized and nobody is depending on a direct appropriation from (general revenue),” he said.
Fogle told The Independent that the $50 million did not appear to be a one-time request.
“The $50 million that was put in general revenue was done, in part, because the tax credit program wasn’t very popular, and donors weren’t giving to that,” she contends. “And the governor wanted to figure out another solution to privatizing education.”
MOScholars currently operates through taxpayer-directed spending, where state funds are given to scholarship organizations through donations that receive a 100% tax credit. The program has faced issues funding scholarships each fall with the majority of donations coming at the end of the year.
An additional $50 million — more than double the amount of donations received last year — would solve the funding lag, Malek said.
“Our calendars were misaligned, so now we will be opening (enrollment) up for next year, starting early in the fall so that people can sign up for next year’s academic school year,” he said. “This will give us the flexibility of doing that, which was not possible before.”
The program has a $75 million expandable cap thanks to a large education package passed last year.
State Rep. Stephanie Hein, a Springfield Democrat, said during debate in April that she wondered why the legislature expanded the donation limit from $50 million to $75 million when there have been $23.4 million in donations in 2024. 
In 2023, donations totaled $16.6 million.
“Donors just are not that excited to give to this program, even at a 100% tax credit,” she said.
The program is in its infancy, with just three years of scholarships completed. The increased funding could help grow MOScholars to meet outsized demand — or it could create dependency on general revenue.
Hein said this problem would be exacerbated by tax cutbacks planned by Republican state lawmakers.
“We are setting a precedent,” she said. “And if we eliminate state income taxes, tax credits go away and we are going to be on the hook with (general revenue) to cover this program.”
Even if the appropriation is signed by the governor, it might face legal challenges as some question the constitutionality of using general revenue for MOScholars.
  State Treasurer Vivek Malek speaks during the Disability Advocacy Day rally in the Missouri State Capitol Wednesday (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The 2021 law that established MOScholars prescribes that scholarships are funded by tax-deductible donations to educational assistance organizations, which are nonprofits that apply to administer the scholarships.
But 2% of donations are directed to an account dubbed the “Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Accounts Fund” overseen by the Treasurer’s Office. The fund is “to be used by the state treasurer for marketing and administrative expenses or the costs incurred in administering the program.”
Some believe the law does not authorize the program to use general revenue. Fogle expects legal “challenges that argue that directly appropriating tax dollars to private schools is unconstitutional.”
“The direct appropriation of general revenue is a completely different foundation than the tax credit,” she said. “There are people on both sides of the aisle, whether they’re voting in favor of it or not, who have considerable doubts and concerns.”
Malek did not speculate on the possibility of a lawsuit.
“We will deal with it and when that happens, we will defer that to our general counsel, the attorney general,” he said. “I cannot predict which course it will take.”
Malek says MOScholars is “another tool” for educating children, in addition to the public school system.
“I don’t see why people would be nervous. This is not taking away any funding dollars from our traditional educational institutions,” he said.
As State Treasurer, Malek was not part of the governor’s decision on public-education funding and considers himself a “big proponent of public schools.”
“My focus was just for the MOScholars program,” he said. “We need some help to strengthen this program… and I’m glad that need was listened to.”

The Rev. D.A. Graham stepped to his A.M.E. pulpit in Indianapolis. He often read from the Gospels or spoke about the love of Jesus, but on this day, he decried the mistreatment of Black Americans. 
Over the past seven years, there had been more than 1,200 lynchings of Black Americans, but nothing had been done to halt them, he said. The newly formed Afro-American Council had just held a National Day of Fasting and Prayer to protest the lynchings of Black Americans: 
“We are arrested and lodged in jails on the most frivolous suspicion of being the perpetrators of most hideous and revolting crimes, and, regardless of established guilt, mobs are formed of ignorant, vicious, whiskey-besotted men, at whose approach the keys of these jails and prisons are surrendered and the suspicioned party is ruthlessly forced from the custody of the law and tortured, hanged, shot, butchered, dismembered, and burned in the most fiendish manner.” 
In some lynchings, mob members collected charred body parts as souvenirs, Graham said. 
“How many of them are guilty? What is the proof against them?” 
In Georgia, a white girl met a young Black man “coming down a path and as he did not get out of the path she was afraid and ran. She swore that he did not speak to her and did not follow her,” Graham said.
Despite the utter lack of evidence, 19-year-old Ed Aikin served 10 years on a prison chain gang for attempted assault, Graham said. 
“How can the colored youth ever learn to look upon himself as a man when he is constantly treated as a brute?” Graham asked.

,California,2025-06-04 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s economy is just limping along. Why is Newsom always boasting?,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/california-economy-limping-along/,"California's unemployment rate remains among the nation's highest, while the state struggles to build homes and grow its labor force.","Gavin Newsom loves to boast about the state he governs, claiming that California is No.1 in some category or that the state is leading in some economic or cultural activity.
Sometimes his boasts crumble in the face of reality, such as his 2022 declaration that the state budget had a $97.5 billion surplus and “no other state in American history has ever experienced a surplus as large as this.”
It was later revealed that the surplus claim was based on revenue estimates that were wrong by $165 billion over four years, leading to multibillion-dollar budget deficits.
Undeterred, Newsom has continued his boastful ways. A few weeks ago bragged that California, were it a nation, now has the world’s fourth-largest economy at $4.1 trillion, edging out Japan.
“California isn’t just keeping pace with the world — we’re setting the pace,” Newsom cheered. “Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritize sustainability and believe in the power of innovation.”
Actually, California’s edge over Japan is more the result of currency exchange calculations rather than productivity, but $4.1 trillion is still a big number. Unfortunately, its size masks the darker reality that, by many measures, California is doing no better than treading water.
As the Legislature’s budget analyst, Gabe Petek, said in a report on California’s budget situation late last year, “California’s economy has been in an extended slowdown for the better part of two years, characterized by a soft labor market and weak consumer spending.
“While this slowdown has been gradual and the severity milder than a recession, a look at recent economic data paints a picture of a sluggish economy. Outside of government and health care, the state has added no jobs in a year and a half.”
What Petek described six months ago is still true, as recent employment data indicates. In April, the state’s unemployment rate, 5.3%, was higher than all but two other states, Michigan and Nevada, and it’s been stuck at that elevated relative position for several years.
“Since February 2020, the state’s labor force has grown by just 126,100 workers, a 0.6% increase,” Beacon Economics said in an analysis of the April data, adding, “This slower growth is being driven largely by the state’s chronic housing shortage and the retirement of aging workers.”
Justin Niakamal, Beacon’s research manager says “it’s difficult to see how California will be able to break out of its slow-growth cycle when there has been virtually no increase in housing production. This is an elemental problem that is impacting the state’s ability to grow its population, industry and economy.”
A major indication of California’s relatively moribund economy is what has been happening in the San Francisco Bay Area’s technology industry, a sector that, in essence, been propping up the entire state in recent years.
Having expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic to serve those confined to their homes and working remotely, the industry has been shedding jobs month by month.
While Newsom cited numbers from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics in claiming that California now had the globe’s fourth-largest economy, he didn’t trumpet a recent bureau study that underscores the state’s poor employment picture. California has more than a million unemployed workers. The new bureau report reveals that the ratio of jobless workers to job openings is the highest of any state, 1.6 jobseekers for every one open job.
To put that data point another way, if every job opening in California were to be filled, we’d still have hundreds of thousands of Californians on the unemployment rolls.

ACLU filed a federal lawsuit against the Chambers County Board of Education on behalf of two teachers who were wrongfully arrested in 2023.(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Alabama filed a federal lawsuit in May against the Chambers County Board of Education on behalf of two teachers who were wrongfully arrested in 2023.
According to the lawsuit, Yolanda Ratchford and Tytianna Smith held letter-size papers at a Chambers County Board of Education meeting picturing John Lewis reading “Good Trouble.”
“Silently holding pieces of paper is not a crime. What happened to Ms. Ratchford and Ms. Smith is a clear and shocking abuse of power,” said Alison Mollman, legal director at the ACLU of Alabama. “These women were exercising their most basic constitutional rights—freedom of speech and peaceful protest—and they were punished for it.”
According to a May press release, the complaint includes claims under the First and Fourth Amendments, the Americans with Disabilities Act and Alabama common law.
The litigation, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, is to get Ratchford and Smith compensated for the harm they endured while in police custody. She said Ratchford is wheelchair bound and was not given access to a toilet while in police custody. A judge ruled the two teachers were not guilty of disorderly conduct.
Messages seeking comment from Chambers County Board of Education and the Valley Police Department were left Tuesday.
As of Tuesday, the defendants have not responded to the lawsuit through the court.
According to a press release, the silent protest was part of ongoing community opposition to the school board’s plan to consolidate the county’s two public high schools into a new facility located in Valley, a predominantly white city, which would displace Black students and educators from LaFayette.
Mollman said the merging of the two schools would cause issues with commuting for Black students that live in spread out county and they would get a different education in the city.
“When you’re going a few miles down county roads, it’s much different than going down I 65 or 85 you know, at 80 miles an hour. And so that’s part of the issue,” Mollman said in an interview in May.
The merging of the two schools, Mollman said, would put the Black students at a disadvantage because they would no longer be with their teachers.
“Many of those teachers were black, and so it’s not just the bussing times. It’s also where those students are going to be placed, who they’re going to be taught by, and how that’s going to be different, how they’re going to be differently situated than from their white peers.”
“A judge determined that they were not guilty of those offenses, and made comments to the effect that if anyone was disorderly in the incident, it was law enforcement,” she said. 
For the past 50 years, the Chambers County School District has been under a federal desegregation order. A federal judge ruled that both Valley and Lafayette high schools must be combined into one Chambers County High School. A new consolidated high school is set to be built this year, according to WTVM.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Chambers-County-Courthouse-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Elected officials and criminal justice reform advocates will continue their efforts to reduce the recidivism rate for people who were formerly incarcerated.
The Alabama Reentry Task Force convened the first meeting on Tuesday because of a joint resolution enacted by the Legislature authorizing it to build on the efforts from the Reentry Alabama Commission by implementing strategies to reduce the barriers that people face once they are released from prison.
“The only way you are ever going to truly reduce recidivism is to provide the full body of services,” said Cam Ward in an interview following the meeting, chair of the Task Force and director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles.
Candidates need mental health treatment, substance abuse and other social services that include medical care and workforce development.
“All that together, one agency can’t do that,” Ward said. “There is no one law that does that. You need five, six, seven, eight agencies working together.”
The Reentry Alabama Commission was created in 2021 and reauthorized in 2024 by the Legislature to review the issues pertaining to reentry and identify any barriers that people face once released from incarceration, either through parole or after completing their sentences.
Commission members, who stem from state agencies to criminal justice reform organizations, in collaboration with the Council of State Governments Justice Center, sought to identify factors to assist with reducing recidivism.
Members met monthly and listened to people who offered different perspectives on the problem. Ronald McKeithen, director of Second Chances at Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform organization, told the commission during a September meeting about the problems people have with obtaining documents they need to rebuild their lives after getting released.
At another Commission meeting in October, Sarah Stewart, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, proposed job courts as one solution to address workforce barriers for those who are formerly incarcerated.
Members compiled the information from the meetings and other feedback received from people involved in the criminal justice system and produced a report that outlines their findings regarding reentry.
Safe and affordable housing was a barrier to reentry, according to the report.
“Transitional housing for people upon reentry is limited and often does not follow best practices regarding service provision,” the report states.
There were problems collecting quality data, which led to inconsistent information that hindered evaluating decisions that people made to address problems with reentry.
The report also identified problems tied to workforce development, from receiving vital documents, like McKeithen told the Commission, to limited transportation options for people who need to get themselves to work and other appointments.
The study also found that the rules and regulations surrounding the criminal justice system are problematic.
“Alabama law imposes hundreds of barriers to work for people with criminal convictions,” the report states.
The report proposed a series of strategies to address some of the issues. The recommendations were assigned to four domains dealing with infrastructure, workforce development, preparing people for reentry and collecting the appropriate data to gauge the effectiveness of policy and programmatic decisions.
In terms of supporting people’s employment efforts, the authors recommended reducing barriers to obtaining licensing and education, as well as reducing barriers to getting hired.
“Resources should include information about mechanisms that may provide relief from legal barriers to work and how to address criminal history in the hiring and occupational licensing processes,” the report states.
It also suggested speaking with employers to provide them with information about hiring people with a criminal history. This includes the benefits, the incentives and support that is available, dispel myths about hiring people who had been incarcerated and provide best practices and support for those reentering the workforce.
The report suggested providing support for people as their incarceration ends by informing them of the services and benefits that are available, such as SNAP benefits and health insurance.
The report also proposed helping those getting released with fines and fees that they owe.
“The burden on this is also really difficult for criminal defendants to manage when they do get out, whether they are on probation or in accountability court, or they get out of prison at the end,” Stewart said during the committee meeting. “It becomes something that affects their families, their ability to get jobs, their ability to hold onto any of the money they put into their pockets once they get the job. That affects housing, that affects transportation. It becomes a never-ending cycle.”
There are other suggestions listed in the report, from making transportation more available to providing more resources to deal with mental health and substance abuse.
Meetings are scheduled quarterly, but different groups will meet to address different aspects of reentry and develop action items to implement that will help address the barriers for people and reduce recidivism.
“It is going to be a pleasure to work with you all,” McKeithen said, who was assigned to be on the Task Force. “I have had to deal with a lot of these issues. These things that I am reading in the report, I am so excited about it. I can’t wait to get in the room and talk with you all.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7279-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

VA Secretary Doug Collins, the Air Force Reserve colonel now running a public health care system serving nine million former service members, has tried to allay their concerns.
According to Collins, even if more than 80,000 VA positions are eliminated this year (as projected by his chief of staff), veterans will have no trouble accessing doctors, nurses, or therapists elsewhere.
That’s because they will get faster referrals to a network of equally qualified private sector providers, who now number 1.7 million nationwide and receive more than $30 billion in annual reimbursements for treating eligible veterans outside the VA.
Thanks to President Trump, Collins says, “VA is providing veterans with more health care choices…while making it even easier for veterans to get their health care when and where it’s most convenient for them.”
On Friday, May 30, members of American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 2152 challenged this rosy scenario at a noon-time rally in Reno that brought together VA patients and their care-givers.
Rally speakers warned a crowd of several hundred about the possible loss of specialized care provided by their local VA hospital, its counterpart in Las Vegas, eighteen out-patient facilities in Nevada, three community-based counseling centers, one nursing home, and a residential treatment program for substance abusers.
According to VA defenders, local private hospitals, clinics, and medical practices will struggle to meet veterans’ needs if more VA care is outsourced and its own facilities are downsized or closed.
VA patients will have longer wait times for appointments. They will drive further to get less “veteran centric” treatment. And they will be deprived of the wrap-around services currently available to over 120,000 Nevada residents who have qualified for VA coverage due to their low-income, service-related conditions, or recent service in combat zones.
A recent assessment of the state’s healthcare access problems, by the University of Nevada Medical School in Reno, makes this danger quite clear, particularly for vets in rural areas. As the authors of another research paper found, Nevada ranks nationally “among the lowest states in terms of available primary care doctors and general surgeons per capita, resulting in limited access to essential services and an increased reliance on emergency departments and hospitals.”
Currently, none of the state’s 17 counties have enough primary care providers, while 12 report a severe shortage of mental health providers. In 2023, nearly 87 percent of all Nevada residents lived in a federally-designated “mental health professional shortage area.”
According to the Nevada Health Workforce Research Center,  the state  ranked “last in the country for overall youth mental health based on the prevalence of mental illness, as well as access to services” for problems like anxiety and depression.
Since 2005, several of the state’s rural hospitals have closed and more than half of those remaining have curtailed some critical services. Others remain at risk of going out of business, particularly if Medicaid cuts, just backed by the House Republican majority soon win Senate approval as well.
By one estimate, Nevada needs 1,700 more therapists, social workers, and substance abuse specialists just to reduce drug over-dose and age-adjusted suicide rates that, in recent years, have exceeded national averages. To improve primary care access, experts say the state also needs to replace its aging physician workforce and significant proportion of inactive providers with more than 1,100 new primary care docs in the next five years.
None of these estimates anticipate a big influx of new patients from the VA with more mental health problems, chronic illnesses and pain, more back, neck, and shoulder injuries, and higher rates of hypertension and diabetes than non-veterans.
 Those who experienced combat came back with more cases of traumatic brain injury or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Veterans also suffer from higher rates of substance abuse and suicide, than the general population. Nearly a million post-9/11 vets have qualified for VA care recently due to past toxic exposures – from burn-pits in the Middle East or military bases in the U.S. with poisoned soil or water.
Right now, a major employer in Nevada—the VA—stands ready and able to serve this challenging patient population, with a skilled and committed workforce numbering more than 4,200 (a third of whom are veterans themselves). The VA’s two major medical centers in Nevada provide clinical training for many young doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals who either decide to stay at the VA or migrate to private sector jobs, where, as noted above, they are much needed locally.
If President Trump proceeds with his planned downsizing of the VA and the services it provides, one thing is certain. Military veterans promised better “customer service and convenience” outside their own healthcare system will find themselves in the same “medical deserts” (and long lines) familiar to patients already under-served by the private healthcare industry.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VA.jpeg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado NewslineFew Trump administration agencies are so out of control as Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
ICE in recent months has disappeared people from American communities, a hallmark of unaccountable authoritarianism. The agency releases scant information to the public about its activities, and it withholds information even in court proceedings. Its agents wield the awesome power to deprive people of their liberty, and they’ve used that power to deposit hundreds of people in a brutal foreign prison, likely for life.
Demand for oversight has rarely been so great, and no tool of ICE oversight should be left unused.
Members of Congress have at least one method by which to oversee the agency — they can show up at ICE detention centers unannounced and perform inspections. But U.S. representatives and senators in Colorado exercise this authority too infrequently.
ICE this year has undertaken aggressive immigration enforcement efforts as part of President Donald Trump’s plan for mass deportations. In Colorado, which Trump made a particular focus of his anti-immigration program, the agency has undertaken several raids and other operations that have resulted in scores of people being held at its detention center in Aurora, operated by private prison company the GEO Group.
People there are often denied constitutionally guaranteed due process, targeted for their exercise of First Amendment rights, and held without being charged with a crime, according to court documents and immigration advocates. About 12 detainees were removed from the Aurora facility to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador.
Federal authorities have gone about this business with essentially no transparency. That’s where oversight comes in.
In 2019, U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, tried to inspect the ICE facility after learning about poor health conditions there. He was denied entry, prompting him to pursue on-site oversight authority, which he helped secure in law. Members of Congress, according to language that is included annually in appropriations legislation, now have the authority to conduct unannounced oversight visits at Department of Homeland Security facilities.
This was no empty gesture. Crow has routinely invoked the authority ever since, and he posts to his website reports about visits to the detention center in Aurora. His office has already completed two oversight visits this month.
This is the same authority by which three U.S. representatives from New Jersey recently tried to conduct oversight at an ICE facility in that state. They were denied entry, and the Trump administration charged one of the lawmakers with a crime.
But ICE’s refusal to respect oversight authority is no cause to idle it. It’s reason to assert it to its fullest extent.
Crow should not be alone in conducting inspections in Aurora. Democratic U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado should also show up. Hickenlooper has expressed anger over the Trump administration’s lawless approach to immigration enforcement, even suggesting in April that “the country’s going to rise up” in response. But to a reporter’s question about what senators like him could do, he said, “You want me to get my pitchfork?”
No. But lawmakers can get inside a facility where Colorado residents, snatched off the streets by the federal government, now face unconstitutional removal to prisons run by foreign dictators, and at least demonstrate to ICE and the people of Colorado that they’ve got their eye on MAGA malfeasance in Denver’s backyard.
Other members of the U.S. House from Colorado can also exercise oversight of ICE. The detention center in Aurora sits in Crow’s district, and territorial deference is doubtless a factor, especially among fellow Democrats. But Crow could arrange a multimember visit. The detention center in New Jersey sits in U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver’s district, and two other members of Congress from neighboring districts had arrived to inspect the facility with McIver when they were denied entry. Strength in numbers sends a message that the members will do everything they can to hold an outpost of authoritarianism in Colorado to account.
A member of Hickenlooper’s staff accompanied a Crow staff member during one inspection in March. In response to questions from Newsline about whether they’d visited the Aurora facility, the six Democratic members of the Colorado congressional delegation — Bennet, Hickenlooper, Crow and Reps. Diana DeGette, Joe Neguse and Brittany Pettersen — responded in a joint statement: “Oversight is a key part of our jobs, and a responsibility we don’t take lightly. The Trump Administration’s recent attempts to intimidate Members of Congress from conducting oversight of ICE detention facilities are alarming — and we will not back down. We are fully committed to providing the necessary oversight and transparency of the GEO ICE facility in Aurora to ensure these facilities are run in full accordance with the law, and our offices will continue to perform the critical casework to ensure detainees are treated fairly.”
The oversight authority alone won’t enable members of Congress to stop the abuses that ICE commits in Aurora. Crow helped establish the authority at a time when immigration advocates were most concerned about health conditions, not cancellation of basic rights. No facility walk-through can remedy the profound injustices at work there.
But at a time when Democrats seem overwhelmed and impotent as the Trump administration dismantles constitutional order, every available counterweight should be applied with maximum force.

Gov. Jeff Landry is pushing House Bill 693, sponsored by House Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Wright, R-Covington. It carves out more circumstances under which political contributions and expenditures don’t have to be disclosed on a public campaign finance report. 
The 101-page proposal is difficult to understand for people who don’t deal with campaign finance regulations frequently. Even staff attorneys for the Louisiana Board of Ethics, which enforces the campaign finance laws, admit the changes are confusing. 

“To be honest with you, it’s going to take quite a grace period to figure all this out,” Ethics Administrator David Bordelon said when presenting the bill to the state ethics board last month. 

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Private attorneys Stephen Gelé and Charles Spies helped write the bill. They have represented Landry in multiple disputes he has had with the ethics board, including over campaign finance laws and enforcement. 
Gelé has said the proposal respects constitutional rights, including freedom of speech, while still providing transparency and “preventing the appearance of corruption.” 
The state’s preeminent government watchdog group disagrees. The Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana (PAR) has come out against the legislation, saying the bill would benefit politicians while offering little for the general public. 

“There is a very large bill, and I don’t quite understand the problem it is trying to solve,” PAR President Steven Procopio said at a legislative hearing last month. 
In more than 20 places in the law, the bill increases the minimum dollar threshold at which a donation or expense has to be included on a public campaign finance report. 

For example, national political committees that raise most of their money outside Louisiana are required to publicly disclose their spending on a Louisiana election once it reaches $20,000. The proposed bill would hike that disclosure threshold to $50,000. 
The current law also requires any campaign contributions or expenditures over $200 given within the 20 days before the election to be reported on a public campaign finance report. The proposed law would hike that disclosure threshold to $5,000. 
Louisiana set to spend at least $7 million to bring Saudi-owned LIV Golf to New Orleans

Over a dozen similar changes are also part of the legislation. 
Individuals who are not political candidates and groups that are not explicitly political committees could also spend money on an election without disclosing contributions they accepted for the politicking. 

Those who are not a candidate or a designated political committee would only be required to disclose election spending over $1,000 in a political cycle and if it involved: 

federally-regulated broadcast media; 
 500 pieces of mail;
a phone bank of 500 calls within a 30-day period; or 
digital or print advertising with a candidate’s image that’s distributed in the area the candidate would represent within 30 days of their primary and 60 days of their general election

These changes would apply to large, statewide elections and smaller ones such as those for police juries, town councils and school boards. 
Money spent to communicate with people in a “membership organization” – such as a union, industry association or an athletic club – as well as employees and stockholders of a business also would not have to be reported as a political expense. This could include communication sent to thousands of people at once. 
In some cases, current campaign finance law obliges people to report this type of spending that would be shielded under the Wright bill. Supporters of the legislation said these exceptions were mainly carved out with so-called social welfare organizations in mind. 

The organizations, which critics call “dark money” political groups, are registered with the IRS as 501(c)(4) nonprofits for tax purposes and are not required to disclose their donors under federal regulations. It’s unclear to what extent the groups have to disclose their spending on Louisiana elections under current state campaign finance laws. 
Landry has received help from at least one of these “dark money” groups, Protect Louisiana Values, to advance his political agenda. It also notably put up the money to rent a live tiger to attend an LSU football game last year. 
Defying Landry, Louisiana lawmakers reject giving him more control over licensing boards

Former Gov. John Bel Edwards also established two of his own “dark money” groups during his eight years in office: Rebuild Louisiana and A Stronger Louisiana. 
While limiting disclosure on political spending, Wright’s legislation does open up allowable uses of politician’s campaign funds to a much wider group of expenses, including their home mortgages, country club fees and gym memberships. 

The legislation is also one of a few bills Landry is pushing to soften ethics laws and regulations this session. Lawmakers in favor of them said they are reacting to overzealous enforcement by the ethics board. 

In 2007, former Gov. Bobby Jindal and legislators passed dozens of restrictions and public disclosure requirements for elected officials and public employees as part of Jindal’s effort to reach a “gold standard” of ethics for Louisiana that would be a model around the country. 
Lawmakers are now saying that effort was overreach that needs to be corrected. 

“I haven’t come across an elected official who has enjoyed working through this process and hasn’t questioned what they did back in the Jindal era,” Wright said of ethics and campaign finance regulations.

On Tuesday, the House of Representatives narrowly passed and then enacted — by a one-vote margin — LD 589, which mirrors a proposal Gov. Janet Mills put forward last session. The Senate enacted the measure later that day, sending it to the governor for her approval. 
“By supporting this legislation, we affirm our commitment to fairness and consistency in our labor standards while continuing to honor the invaluable contributions of our agricultural community,” said Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) during the House debate Tuesday.
Mills has vetoed multiple similar proposals in the past, including her own last session after the Labor Committee changed it. However, Labor Commissioner Laura Fortman said during a committee meeting last month that Mills seems to be on board with the amended version of LD 589.
Similar to the discussion on the Senate floor Monday, some House Republicans raised concerns that this bill would prohibit piecework, which is often used by sectors such as the blueberry industry to pay people based on how much they pick. 
Roeder, who co-chairs the Labor Committee, clarified that piecework is not outlawed by the bill. 
Most agricultural employers who spoke to the committee said they already pay more than the state’s minimum wage of $14.65 an hour, but proponents have said the bill is important because it addresses the historic exclusion of agricultural workers from labor rights.

Insurers say the rate increases are needed to account for the impending expiration of federal insurance premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year. If the tax credit remained, insurers would only be seeking “an overall average rate change of 7.9%, with most carriers filing for an increase between 5% and 7%,” the MIA statement said.
The tax credit expiration is just one of the changes under discussion at the federal level that state officials fear could upend Maryland’s insurance marketplace and lead to higher premium costs.
Maryland Insurance Commissioner Marie Grant said the budget reconciliation bill recently passed by the House of Representatives could lead further increases insurance premiums and make it harder to enroll in an ACA individual plan.
“There are many changes in the House budget reconciliation bill on the federal level that will impact the ability of Marylanders to … enroll in our exchange, as well changes in the calculations that would lower the amount of tax credits further for Marylanders,” Grant said in a virtual press conference Tuesday.

The insurers are also asking for premium increases for small group plans with an “overall average rate increase of 5.5%, with the averages by carrier ranging from 3.3% to 12.2%,” according to the MIA press release, though state officials were more focused on the increases in the individual market Tuesday.
The House narrowly passed the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” last month to carry out much of the Trump administration’s policy plans, including massive changes to Medicaid and the ACA. The current bill does not include language to extend the premium tax credit, leaving it to expire in December unless the U.S. Senate decides to extend it.
That “wild uncertainty” at the federal level is driving the need for rate increase requests by Maryland’s insurance companies, said Matthew Celentano, executive director of the League of Life & Health Insurers of Maryland, which includes major providers such as CareFirst, Kaiser Permanente and UnitedHealthCare.
“The budget reconciliation package that passed the House of Representatives last week would have dramatic impacts on Maryland insurance markets, and the loss of subsidies would create affordability challenges across the board for Maryland consumers that would lead to a reversal of progress over the years to drastically reduce the number of uninsured Marylanders,” Celentano said in a written statement.
“We hope that the Senate realizes and reverses course on the negative consequences of reducing premium tax credits and the concerning impacts it will have on the entire health care ecosystem including our most vulnerable neighbors,” his statement said.
Grant said the proposed premium rate increases are not final and will go through a “really careful review” by MIA, with public hearings and public comments over the next couple months before new rates are set for next year.
But legislators and state officials say that the potential expiration of premium tax credits is just the tip of the possible impacts on the insurance market from the federal level.
“We don’t know at this point the exact impact on Marylanders of all those changes, but I think that we can anticipate that they could further lower subsidies and further lead to increases in the market, if they are not addressed by the Senate,” Grant said.
Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, said that one of the proposals in the House bill would cut a month off the open enrollment period when people shop around for health care plans – running from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15, instead of through Jan. 15.  Eberle noted that many young people who enroll in private health plans tend to enroll in the later weeks of the current open enrollment period.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We know that younger, healthier people in the risk pool is good for everyone, as it lowers the rates,” she said.
Eberle said that some provisions in the reconciliation bill would also reduce the state’s ability to automatically re-enroll individuals by requiring more upfront eligibility checks. Other language in the bill would prohibit tax credits for many undocumented individuals who are lawfully present, including those with asylum protections.
“The collective impact of these changes will not only destabilize the private health insurance market place, but we anticipate we could go back to pre-pandemic levels of enrollment – a loss of about 30% of our enrollees,” Eberle said.
Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) said during the virtual press conference that the current bill language will “skyrocket prices for average working people,” calling the One Big Beautiful bill is “one big, brazen betrayal of working Marylanders and Americans.”
In the 2025 General Assembly session, lawmakers passed legislation aiming to mitigate potential disruptions in the state marketplace due to federal decisions.
Among those was a proposal to give the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange authority to create a state subsidy if the federal premium tax credit comes to an end. That authority would only be available for 2026 through 2028 under this law sponsored by Del. Joseline A. Pena-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), chair of the House Health and Government Operations Committee.
Sen. Pam Beidle (D-Anne Arundel), chair of the Maryland Senate Finance Committee, fears the changes will take a toll on the state’s relatively low 6% uninsurance rate for health care, backsliding on legislative efforts to boost insurance coverage across the state.
“To me, health care is like food and water. It’s one of the most important benefits we can provide to people,” Beidle said. “Seeing the changes this bill (budget reconciliation bill) will bring … we’ve seen our numbers go down to where it’s just a small percentage of people who don’t have health insurance, and now we’re going to see that number increase exponentially,” she said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_dec13_openenrollment2-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bryce Sammel: Want lower taxes? Then let’s reform education the smart way..","This commentary is by Bryce Sammel of Barnard. He and his wife Nakina are the parents of three children. He previously served on and chaired both the Barnard Academy and Mountain Views school boards and currently runs a baseball program supporting youth from over a dozen towns in the area.Vermonters are rightly worried about taxes. With rising costs across the board, including property taxes, health care and energy bills, many residents, especially those without school-aged children, are asking a fair question: Why are we spending so much on education, and are we getting our money’s worth?If you care about taxes, you deserve to know the truth: closing schools and cutting programs doesn’t automatically lower your property taxes. It can raise them.When schools close, or programs are gutted, young families leave. That shrinks the full-time population and weakens the local economy and the residential tax base. Empty homes get snapped up by second-homeowners, inflating local property values and the grand list, creating the tax increases we’re seeing today in communities across Vermont.At the same time, Vermont’s aging population means we need younger families more than ever. Not just to fill classrooms but to power our economy and support essential services. Strong public schools are a magnet for those families, and they’re also where we prepare students to become skilled workers in trades, healthcare, agriculture, small business and other critical sectors.If those students leave for better opportunities elsewhere or can’t afford to live here as adults, the cycle worsens. That’s why we must invest wisely in education and keep taxes manageable so that working families and young Vermonters can afford to stay.The current proposals in Montpelier, including H.454, claim to answer that question by cutting costs through school consolidation and funding reform. But these proposals don’t appear to fix what’s broken. They shift the costs in ways that may backfire on communities, taxpayers and the economy.In addition, forcing expensive transitions like merging mega-districts, laying off staff or overhauling infrastructure without support creates short-term costs that outweigh any long-term savings. Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for poorly planned reforms that don’t deliver results.There is a better way. A more innovative approach to education reform could stabilize taxes and improve efficiency without destabilizing our communities.Instead of extreme mandates, we should focus on voluntary consolidation and shared services, offering increased per-pupil funding or targeted grants for districts that work together to reduce overhead. A high school that serves 450 students or a classroom with 15 kids may make fiscal sense without sacrificing educational outcomes. Rewarding schools that hit those marks is smarter than punishing those that don’t.We could also set a realistic goal of reducing the number of school districts, not to five, as some have proposed, but perhaps by half. That alone could cut administrative costs and save taxpayers money while preserving local control.Some other ideas the governor has proposed would also help facilitate easier consolidation in the near future.A unified school calendar is a practical way to promote cost savings and future flexibility. If all Vermont schools operated on the same schedule, it would eliminate one of the barriers to collaboration and future district mergers as well as making it much easier for students in different schools to access career and technical education centers without as much of a disruptive impact on the rest of their high school schedule.Setting universal minimum graduation requirements would establish a clear statewide standard for earning a diploma, ensuring every Vermont graduate meets a baseline level of preparation. If, in the future, schools or districts merged, there would be no risk of it affecting students’ outcomes because they would already be aligned. At the same time, individual schools could add additional requirements for advanced programs, CTE tracks or academic pathways, allowing for local innovation and higher achievement.When it comes to school infrastructure, delaying repairs only makes them more expensive later. If we want to reduce costs long-term, we need to invest in energy-efficient, right-sized school buildings today. Let’s raise the state match for projects meeting new enrollment benchmarks and sustainability standards. The cost would pay off quickly through efficiency of scale, reduced heating bills and lower maintenance.Most importantly, we need a funding formula that reflects the real costs of running schools in Vermont. The Senate version imposes arbitrary growth caps that don’t solve the problem but mask it and risk driving up costs to homeowners. The House version of H.454 does this better. It uses more accurate, research-based pupil weights for rural, low-income and high-needs students.We could fine-tune this formula to further reward voluntary mergers, shared programming, community-based schools and those schools offering CTE programming.Short-term grants, limited use of surplus or reserve funds, or revenue adjustments could ease the transition and help districts adjust without sudden tax spikes. This way, we can start today while continuing to discuss the needed broader tax reform.It’s not about protecting the status quo or pretending everything’s fine. Vermont’s education system needs to evolve. But let’s not fall for proposals that sound good on paper and cost us more in practice.Want lower taxes? Then, support a reform strategy that incentivizes smart decisions, doesn’t force bad ones and avoids short-term chaos that leads to long-term costs. Let’s fix what’s broken without bulldozing what works.Let your representatives know that real reform balances cost savings with common sense. It rewards efficient schools and academic achievement, encourages collaboration and respects all Vermont taxpayers.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bryce Sammel: Want lower taxes?

To stand with the Jewish people today means more than statements of solidarity. It means real, tangible action.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Shalom Alliance: Vermont legislators have a chance to save Jewish lives — now.","This commentary is from the Shalom Alliance, a nonpartisan nonprofit working to build a bright future for Vermont Jews by fighting antisemitism and misinformation in Vermont schools, communities and media. We do this through building bridges, providing educational resources and helping Jews around Vermont have a safe place for Jewish pride.In moments of crisis, history judges leaders not by their rhetoric, but by their response. Today, Vermont lawmakers are facing a defining moment — a moral crossroads where their decisions will profoundly impact the safety and well-being of Jewish people in Vermont.As the war in Israel and Gaza continues and antisemitic violence surges worldwide under the guise of “Free, Free Palestine,” Jewish communities worldwide, including Vermont, are seeking safety and solidarity. Vermont has the opportunity, and indeed the responsibility, to act, because it is not a matter of if this behavior escalates into violence in Vermont. It’s a matter of when.One immediate avenue lawmakers have at their fingertips is H.310, a bill currently introduced that would define ethnic and antisemitic harassment, and provide schools and students with the tools to identify, address, protect against and teach about antisemitism. This legislation recognizes what Jewish students and families have long reported to Vermont elected officials and schools, and the Jewish people have experienced for more than 3,000 years: that antisemitism does not begin with violence — it begins with silence, denial, ignorance and exclusion.Vermont is the only state in New England without any Holocaust education standards, despite bills being introduced seeking this change since 2017. By equipping Vermont’s educational institutions to confront this hatred directly, H.310 not only offers protection but also affirms the dignity and identity of Jewish Vermonters.The urgency of this moment was heartbreakingly underscored by the recent murder of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim — two young members of the American, Israeli and Jewish communities — gunned down outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC. Their killer reportedly shouted ‘Free, Free Palestine’ after targeting the couple, who worked at the Israeli Embassy, in cold blood.Here in Vermont, we cannot ignore the surge in antisemitic rhetoric and conspiracy theories flooding social media platforms, especially in local forums and comment sections. Jewish Vermonters have reported seeing Holocaust comparisons, coded slurs, and explicit denial of Jewish identity or history — often unmoderated and, worse, encouraged by coordinated online mobs.This digital hate translates into real-world fear and threats, particularly for visibly Jewish residents and children in schools. It’s a reminder that Vermont is not immune to the dangerous currents sweeping the country.To stand with the Jewish people today means more than statements of solidarity. It means real, tangible action. It means creating avenues for safe harbor, standing firm against rising antisemitism, and making Vermont a beacon for those fleeing danger. Legislators: you have a choice. You can be remembered as leaders who rose to meet history, or as bystanders who allowed it to pass them by. The opportunity to save lives is before you — take it.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Shalom Alliance: Vermont legislators have a chance to save Jewish lives — now.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-06-04 07:01:59.583328

Like many of the world’s children, they and their classmates switched to online learning when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020. But, unlike children in the US, these boys never went back to their old classrooms. 
  Two third grade boys play ping pong outside of their neighborhood school in Kharkiv.

(Cecilia Nowell)
In February 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, cluster bombs, missiles and shells began to rain on their hometown of Kharkiv, located just 23 miles from the Russian border. Three years later, the threats have not ceased: drones hover over the city and air raid sirens announce incoming ballistic missiles day and night.
In Kharkiv, it’s never been safe for children to return to the schools they once attended, so public officials moved education underground. 
“I love metro school,” one of the boys says, pausing his game to speak through a translator. In mid-April, shrapnel shattered the windows of the school he is playing outside after Ukrainian air defense shot down an incoming missile. “There you can talk normally and no one will interrupt you.“
The boys attend one of Kharkiv’s six metro schools, where children go to class deep in the city’s subway stations. Last year, the city began work on an additional four underground schools, massive facilities with more than a dozen classrooms each.
“Altogether, about 10,000 students — roughly 15% of all children currently in Kharkiv — are studying in these safe locations in person,” Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said through a translator. “We are now completing construction of three more underground schools and plan to open them by the beginning of the new academic year.”
While the United States government has terminated funding to international aid organizations previously supporting the schools, like USAID and the UN refugee agency, the City of Albuquerque has not.
The Albuquerque Sister Cities program is currently working to provide 29 laptops to the underground schools in Kharkiv. The organization has secured 19 laptops to date and is hoping to donate the remainder this summer, according to the Albuquerque Mayor’s Office.
“Though the Trump administration’s support for Ukraine has been shaky at best, the City of Albuquerque keeps showing up for our Sister City of Kharkiv and the people of Ukraine,” Mayor Tim Keller said in a statement. 
“We are sincerely grateful for that support,” said Terekhov. “We are deeply committed to properly equipping our schools — especially underground ones, where children study in safe conditions during wartime.”
At the outbreak of the full-scale invasion, Russian soldiers occupied the city of Kharkiv and many surrounding villages. Oksana Suprun, mayor of the nearby town of Savyntsi, says that during that time period, “all laptops and computers were stolen from every educational institution — all of them. Everything related to multimedia equipment was ripped out and taken. Computers, projectors — it was all looted.”
“Basically, no classroom — except for math — was left untouched,” echoed Hennadii Kliuyev, director of the Savyntsi Lyceum, a school for grades first through twelfth.
While the schools have tried to provide laptops to all students as they attended classes remotely, some have had to make do with the devices their families had at home.

“One of our teachers thought that a student wasn’t doing her assignments. She’s a good student, but she had serious issues with IT class. Eventually, we found out her tablet just couldn’t run the software that teachers were used to working with. Other children were using laptops, and she simply didn’t have that option,” said Kliuyev.
As the town of Savyntsi constructs its first underground school, which will bring 400 students back to the classroom, teachers are preparing to organize classes in person again. But there, as in Kharkiv, students will continue attending class online a few days a week to allow more children to rotate through the building.
“It won’t be easy. They’re no longer used to being in school. Some of the children, we can tell, are not socially adjusted. There’s a kind of psychological barrier. They’re even shy to speak up in class,” said Kliuyev. “And we’re talking about tenth graders. There are definitely some psychological issues lingering. As adults, we’ve somehow adapted to the situation. But children’s minds don’t work the same way.”

Those underground schools are especially needed now, as Russia intensifies its strikes on Ukrainian cities even amid ongoing peace talks.
As much as they’ve adapted three years into the full-scale invasion, it’s still important for adults to know their children will be safe returning to school, says Yulia Bashkirova, head of the education department in Kharkiv’s Shevchenkivskyi neighborhood. 
The schools are located six meters underground and a teacher’s aide meets students at the entrance to guide them to class to avoid parents gathering at the entrance and revealing the schools’ locations. 
“We have a generator. We have ventilation that cleans the air. The lighting in the underground school imitates daylight,” Bashkirova said. She oversees an underground school that opened in late April and already has 830 students enrolled.
“It is very important for children to have the opportunity to meet in an underground school, to communicate, to see the teacher and to learn offline,” said Bashkirova. But, “the safety of the kids is the biggest priority. And right now when kids are in the underground school, parents can feel safe that they are in a safe location.”
She hopes that reality does not last forever in Kharkiv. “We’ve gone underground not by choice, but because of the security situation,” Bashkirova said. “We would really like to meet somewhere above ground. Not underground — but in regular schools — because it’s more comfortable and familiar for the children, and it’s the way it should be.”

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings, and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance abuse treatment. Some of the grants were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards were intended for state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender, or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggest that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods, and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care, and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues, and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training, and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, show a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

It hasn’t.
Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, created and then headed up the Department of Government Efficiency until his recent departure.
He once touted DOGE as “the most transparent organization in government ever.”
He cited DOGE’s website as evidence of this transparency, especially the “Wall of Receipts” that claims to show exactly what the department has cut.
Among these cuts is a $15.8M grant to the U from the Department of Health and Human Services. The purpose of the grant is listed as “currently unavailable,” and the date of the grant’s cancellation was March 23.
The website neglects to mention that the grant was reinstated by April 7.
According to U officials, the grant helps fund the Midwest Antiviral Drug Discovery Center, which conducts research on antiviral drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus that causes COVID-19; Ebola; Lassa; and Zika.
DOGE targeted an array of COVID-19 related grants around the same time. Why these would be considered an example of government waste is unclear, but in any case, the money is still going to the U.
The $15.8 million purportedly cut — but not actually cut from the U — came on March 23. This was just one of 1,339 line items of savings reported that day, all from the Department of Health and Human Services, amounting to ​​$877,628,206.
It’s unclear how much of that money has actually been cut because the incident with the U’s reinstated grant has become all-too typical with DOGE’s accounting. Positions and funding are cut with great fanfare, and then many of those cuts are reinstated. Federal workers are laid off, then re-hired.
Barely a month into President Trump’s second term, a New York Times review of DOGE’s receipts found they were riddled with errors:
“Some contracts the group claims credit for were double- or triple-counted. Another initially contained an error that inflated the totals by billions of dollars. In at least one instance, the group claimed an entire contract had been canceled when only part of the work had been halted. In others, contracts the group said it had closed were actually ended under the Biden administration.”
Early this year, Musk showed up at the Conservative Political Action Conference convention in sunglasses, wielding a chainsaw, in an appearance that had many speculating on his drug use.
The chainsaw was an apt metaphor, just looking at a few days of data.
March 21-23 show cuts to HHS , bookended by days of cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency. The National Science Foundation and Department of Justice are frequent targets.
A chainsaw is not a precise instrument, and imprecision, when it comes to firing federal workers, is expensive. One group that studies the federal workforce estimated all the firing, severance, rehiring, legal bills, lost productivity and paid time off would cost the government $135 billion this year, wiping out most of the alleged savings.
The “Wall of Receipts” webpage is headlined by the total reported savings. As of May 23, that was $170 billion. But the total savings listed in the Wall of Receipts adds up to just over $70 billion. Both of these numbers are far from the $2 trillion Musk promised to cut on the campaign trail, or even $1 trillion he claimed once he started DOGE.
Despite all the moving targets, Musk has repeatedly claimed transparency. “Any action that we make, we post on the doge.gov website, and we post on our X account, so it’s extreme transparency,” he said to Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini at a meeting of Italy’s League Party in April.
Yet the $70 billion savings on the website is just 41% of what the DOGE claims in its headline number — on the very same website.
Belying Musk’s claims about DOGE being the most transparent government entity in history, all of the data on the DOGE website was already publicly available, and has been since 2004 on the Federal Procurement Data System website.
(The claims of transparency are also belied by a key question about DOGE’s actions in government: data security. There is little transparency about what data DOGE has access to, and what that data is being used for.
This is of special concern as the federal government expands its contract with software company Palantir to create an AI-powered data-sharing platform to aid the Trump administration’s goal of merging Social Security, IRS, and immigration information into one central database.)
Even if the math added up, the Wall of Receipts website is difficult to use. The receipt charts are not searchable, and only show 10 line items at a time for sections with tens of thousands of lines.
If you look closely, you can download the data in chunks of 500 lines at a time, which must be combined and then translated into a readable format if it’s to become meaningfully useful.
Here is that readable chart, with data ranging from the inception of the website through May 23.
DOGE has claimed historic levels of government fraud and waste, and provided this website as the smoking gun.
But the government has not indicted anyone for fraud, nor have investigations been announced or leaked.
Meanwhile, Musk’s flagship transparency tool would better be described as opaque and is riddled with errors — to the point of uselessness, except as a scorecard of Musk’s time in government.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2200918595-1024x715.jpg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

Victoria Hunt will move from the House to the Senate in the Washington Legislature after the King County Council appointed her on Tuesday to replace the late Sen. Bill Ramos. 
The council also chose  Zach Hall, an Issaquah City Council member, as Hunt’s replacement in the state House. 
The Senate seat will be on the ballot in a special election in November, with the winner serving through 2026. Hunt is a candidate. Republican Chad Magendanz, a former two-term state representative for the district, is opposing her.
Hall will serve through the 2026 election because the appointment is occurring after the filing period for this year’s elections closed.
Ramos passed away unexpectedly while on a trail run near his home in Issaquah on April 19, a week before the legislative session ended. He was 69. 
He was elected to the House in 2018 then won a Senate seat last year. Ramos was one of the Legislature’s leading voices on transportation issues in the 2025 session. 
Hunt, a Democrat, was sworn into the Senate shortly after being selected for the seat in the 5th Legislative District which includes parts of Issaquah, Black Diamond, Covington, and part of Snoqualmie. 
Hunt was elected to the House in 2024. She is a scientist who holds a doctorate in ecology and previously served on the Issaquah City Council. Her seatmate Rep. Lisa Callan, D-Issaquah, endorsed her. 
“With these tools and experiences I have been able to advance policies at the state level to meet the needs of our growing community,” Hunt said. 
Hall was elected to the Issaquah City Council in 2019. Prior to that he was a legislative assistant and a campaign manager for Callan.
“I have the background needed in the district, in the legislature, and in local government,” Hall said, adding that he wants to help build a Washington that’s safe, affordable, green and full of opportunities. 
“Bill Ramos set a high bar for public service and he had an unstoppable drive for the people of our district and we are all united in our commitment to honor his legacy,” Hall said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Victoria-Hunt-Headshot-1024x810.jpg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The Trump administration aims to end federal oversight a judge ordered in 2022 of a bank that avoided giving mortgages to people of color and opening bank branches in Black and Hispanic communities in the Newark area.
Lakeland Bank has substantially complied with changes required under the September 2022 consent decree to end such discrimination, which is known as “redlining,” and agreed to carry out whatever court-ordered reforms that remain unfinished, federal prosecutors said last week in a motion asking to end oversight more than two years early.
But a nonprofit that advocates for low- and middle-income residents filed an affidavit this week calling for the consent decree to remain in place, because ending it would threaten progress made in the last two years and leave advocates with no remedy if the bank’s compliance with unfinished remedies falters.
It also “sends a very bad message,” said Leila Amirhamzeh of New Jersey Citizen Action Education Fund, a Newark-based nonprofit that does housing counseling and fair housing investigations.
“Our concern with the Department of Justice’s motion to terminate the consent order really speaks more to the overall message that the administration is sending to financial institutions — that it is not going to enforce fair lending laws, that it is not going to ensure that any bad actors that do engage in discriminatory redlining practices are held accountable,” Amirhamzeh said.
Newark officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Under the decree, Lakeland agreed to open two branches in Newark communities of color and spend $12 million on a “loan subsidy” fund to offset closing costs, mortgage insurance premiums and down payments for Black and Hispanic residents in Essex, Somerset and Union counties who apply for mortgages and home improvement and refinancing loans. The bank also agreed to spend $1.1 million on outreach, advertising, financial counseling and community development partnerships and assign at least four loan officers to serve neighborhoods they had excluded.
Lakeland merged with Prudential Financial Services last year.
Prudential opened a new branch this week on the edge of the Ironbound, a Newark neighborhood home to many immigrants and people of color.
It’s unclear whether and when it will open a second branch, as ordered under the consent decree, as well as how much of the $13 million for the loan subsidy fund and outreach remains unspent.
Keith Buscio, a Prudential Bank spokesman, referred those questions to the Justice Department, and a spokesman there did not respond to a request for comment.
“Provident acknowledges the benefit of the mortgage loan subsidy to underserved communities and, in the event the DOJ’s motion is granted, will commit to spending the remaining amount under the subsidy,” Buscio said.
Despite such assurances, critics remain concerned.
The move to end oversight comes just two months after federal banking regulators announced they would rescind a 2023 update meant to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 law passed to prevent redlining, Amirhamzeh said.
Ending oversight also fits a pattern of Trump-administration rollbacks of Biden-era policies that protect marginalized people, she added.
The Trump administration is terminating $400 million in funds for states across the country to modernize their unemployment systems, money that was authorized in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act passed under the Biden administration.
Trump officials also recently dropped a federal civil rights investigation into police brutality and racial profiling in Trenton.

Mike Braun speaks to reporters at the Indiana Statehouse on Tuesday, June 3, 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana has exhausted its supply of lethal injection drugs after carrying out two executions in the past six months — and Gov. Mike Braun said Tuesday he doesn’t plan to buy more, at least for now.
The governor’s remarks followed the state’s December execution of Joseph Corcoran — Indiana’s first since 2009 — and last month’s execution of Benjamin Ritchie.
Recent reporting by the Indiana Capital Chronicle revealed the state spent $900,000 last year to obtain pentobarbital to carry out executions, but officials wouldn’t say how much was purchased and refused to provide information on expiration dates, storage or other details.
Braun said the high cost and short shelf life of the drug should prompt new discussions on how the state approaches capital punishment moving forward.










... I'm not going to be for putting it on the shelf and then letting them expire.


– Indiana Gov. Mike Braun


“We’ve got to address the broad issue of, what are other methods, the discussion of capital punishment in general, and then something that costs, I think, $300,000 a pop that has a 90-day shelf life — I’m not going to be for putting it on the shelf and then letting them expire,” the governor told reporters at the Indiana Statehouse.
Braun, a Republican in his first year as governor, said the question of whether Indiana should continue to carry out executions at all is one that lawmakers should weigh in the months ahead. 
“There are legislators that wonder if it’s still relevant,” Braun continued. “I’m going to listen to them, the courts, and the broader discussion in general.”
Execution methods in other states
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita and former Gov. Eric Holcomb announced the state’s acquisition of pentobarbital in June 2024, but it’s not clear when the state ultimately received the drugs.
Indiana Department of Correction officials have refused to disclose how many doses of pentobarbital were used for each of recent executions, or how close the drug was to its expiration when it was administered.
“I think we got in a pickle where we stored three, and now it looks like … it will be coming up again,” Braun said Tuesday, appearing to refer to execution drug expiration. 
‘Violent’ moment during Indiana execution draws scrutiny; DOC officials deny ‘botched’ process

Current Indiana law only allows lethal injection as a means of execution. The one-drug method is a departure from the state’s protocol used since 1995, involving a series of three chemicals.
But with ongoing drug shortages and increasing legal and political complications, some states have revived older execution methods — or approved new ones.
South Carolina recently reinstated the firing squad as an option after years of delays due to its inability to obtain lethal injection drugs. The state has so far carried out two executions by firing squad in 2025 — the first in the U.S. in 15 years.
According to the Death Penalty Information Center, prior to South Carolina’s move only three executions by firing squad had taken place nationwide since 1977 — all in Utah.
It’s expected to be the primary method for executions in Idaho starting in 2026. Mississippi and Oklahoma also permit firing squads, but only as a secondary method to lethal injection.
Braun pointed to South Carolina, specifically, but he didn’t endorse any specific execution method.
Nine states permit executions by lethal gas, but only five — Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma — specifically autho­rize death by nitro­gen hypox­ia, a process that deprives inmates of oxygen using nitrogen gas. 
So far, Alabama and Louisiana are the only states that have per­formed exe­cu­tions by nitrogen gas, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Arizona and Mississippi additionally allow gas chambers, a method in which inmates are exposed to a lethal gas — traditionally hydrogen cyanide — inside a sealed chamber. The process can take several minutes, however, and has drawn criticism over the risk of prolonged suffering.
Lawmakers could reexamine Indiana’s death penalty
Earlier this year, some Indiana lawmakers — from both sides of the aisle — questioned the future of capital punishment in the state.
Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, filed House Bill 1030, which sought to abolish the death penalty altogether in Indiana and replace it with life without parole. He later discussed plans to scale back the bill — and instead focus on execution drug rules and witness guidelines — hoping that a narrowed proposal could give it a better chance at advancing through the legislative process.



Despite some bipartisan support, Morris’ bill never received a committee hearing in the House, effectively killing the measure.
Separately, an amendment Morris offered on another bill sought to require that Indiana State Police test pentobarbital between 12 and 24 hours before an execution to ensure the substance is “100% effective” before it’s administered. But that proposal never moved, either.
Other Republican and Democratic lawmakers have previously suggested narrowing the list of crimes eligible for execution or mandating that any new methods meet constitutional and ethical standards.
No one has been added to death row in Indiana since 2013 as many prosecutors choose life in prison without parole over the cost of a death penalty trial.
The next opportunity for lawmakers to file and debate bills is during next year’s legislative session, slated to begin in January 2026.
The last person executed in Indiana before Corcoran was Eric Wrinkles in 2009. Six inmates currently remain on Indiana’s death row, and more than a dozen capital punishment cases are still pending statewide.

Clark County District Judge Nadia Krall ordered the city to pay $500 as well as attorney fees incurred by MaQuade Chesley, the city’s former chief of police.
Chesley was terminated in January by then-City Manager Edward “Owen” Dickie, who initially cited a vote of no confidence by the Mesquite police union as the reason for Chesley’s firing. He later said Chesley was fired for recording a conversation, which is not illegal in Nevada. 
Mesquite residents and Chesley provided the Current with recordings they made of Dickie, in which he makes racially-charged statements regarding the hiring of the city’s next police chief. 
The council, by a vote of four to one, terminated Dickie in late April, citing the recordings.  
Councilwoman Patti Gallo noted a string of “bad decisions” by Dickie, including firing Chesley at the behest of the local police union. “It’s time for this city to start healing,” she said before making the motion to terminate Dickie.  
In March, Krall granted Chesley’s request for a restraining order and injunction, prohibiting the city from holding a public investigation into Chesley’s termination because he was not afforded rights due police officers under Nevada law.
The city council ignored the order and ratified Chesley’s termination in March. Chesley then filed a motion for the city to show cause as to why it violated the order. 
Krall, in her order Tuesday, noted the city had more than a month to respond, but failed to file an opposition.
The City of Mesquite, “notwithstanding the Court’s clear and unambiguous order, willfully disobeyed and violated the Court’s order by calling and holding this prohibited agenda item,” Krall wrote, adding the city “tried to relabel” the agenda item “in an attempt to flout and circumvent the Court’s order.”
The city took the action even though two council members stated that hearing the item would violate Krall’s order, the judge wrote. 
Krall called the city’s subsequent effort to lodge a criminal allegation against Chesley “a bad faith attempt to harass” him and relieve the city of its legal obligations regarding terminating police officers under Nevada law. “This is part of an ongoing pattern of bad faith defenses” by the city, Krall wrote.  
“I am very grateful Judge Krall saw the injustice and found them in contempt,” Chesley, who is suing the city for wrongful termination, said via text Tuesday.  
Mayor Jesse Whipple and Lee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Last week, Branum, the city attorney, resigned hours before the city council was scheduled to review his performance.
“There is a small group of people who are upset that Joseph [MaQuade] Chesley was terminated from his position as Chief of Police,” Branum wrote in an email to city staff a week before the meeting. 
“For those of you who I have worked with, whether you think I am competent or not, I request that you provide your feedback to Council next Tuesday evening.” 
In a subsequent email, Branum told staff he could not “in good conscience” ask anyone to speak on his behalf, and would resign. “The last thing I would want is for any of you to be the next with a target on your back.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mesquite7_SM-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

It’s common sense that if you make something harder to access, fewer people are going to access it.
There are plenty of good reasons to prevent toddlers from eating their weight in gummy worms. 
There are no good reasons to prevent people from exercising their ability to vote.
And yet we continue to see more attempts—both nationally and here in Indiana—to chip away at the rights of lawfully eligible citizens to cast ballots for their preferred candidates.
Indiana elections chief defends voting ban on ‘unsecured’ student IDs after legal challenge

In order to understand the big picture, we have to rewind the clock to 2013, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a requirement that places with a history of racial discrimination in voting had to get federal approval to change their voting laws or practices.
In the years since that decision, the Brennan Center for Justice has tracked dozens of states, including Indiana, enacting a total of almost 100 restrictive laws making it harder for eligible voters to register, stay on the voter rolls or actually cast a ballot.
The latest effort here is Senate Enrolled Act 10, which bans student IDs issued by Indiana’s public colleges and universities from being used as valid identification to vote. Worth noting: 20 of the 37 states with a voter ID law on the books allow the use of some form of college student ID.
Removing student IDs from the list of acceptable voting identification puts one more roadblock in their path. Young voters already face higher barriers to participation in our democracy: They’re more likely to have recently moved, to lack access to transportation or to not yet have a driver’s license with their current address.
Proponents of these restrictions haven’t been able to produce a single case of student ID being used to commit voter fraud in Indiana.
Time to make democracy a habit
This years-long push to restrict voting access has had a negative impact. The latest attempt comes at a time when Hoosiers aren’t exactly showing up and showing out at the polls. In the 2024 general election, Indiana ranked 43rd in voter participation, with fewer than two-thirds of eligible voters casting a ballot. 
Here’s the thing: Voting is habit-forming. A 2003 Yale study found voting in one election substantially increases the likelihood of voting in the future. So if we want to improve that dismal turnout percentage, we should be doing everything we can hook young voters on democracy.
One idea lawmakers might consider is voter pre-registration, which allows 16- and 17-year-olds to sign up in advance so that when they turn 18, they’re automatically added to the voter rolls ready to cast a ballot.

In most states that offer it, pre-registered voters are listed as “pending” until they reach voting age, at which point their status switches to active without requiring any further action. By making the process easier and more accessible, we could turn first-time voters into lifelong voters.
That should be the goal. 
The conversation about voting is about so much more than Senate Enrolled Act 10, which was a solution in search of a problem from the jump. It’s about what happens when we slowly chip away at electoral freedom over time. 
It’s easy to say, “Well, it’s just one form of ID. What’s the big deal? People need to adapt.” And that’s how democracy dies by a thousand paper cuts. 
There’s bipartisan agreement that young people should be learning more about how government works, including how to get involved and the requirements to vote. To make that shared civics education vision a reality, we need to remove barriers instead of adding them. Let students use college-issued IDs to vote. Make it possible for them to pre-register at 16. Democracy should be attainable, accessible and habit-forming.

Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, speaks at a confirmation hearing for Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer. (screenshot courtesy of C-SPAN via Investigate Midwest)Despite rising child labor violations and new Senate demands to investigate the nation’s largest meat processor, the U.S. Department of Labor remains silent on whether it has the staff to conduct future probes amidst a major reduction in its workforce.
At a May 22 congressional hearing, newly appointed Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said 2,700 department employees have taken a deferred resignation program offered to nearly all federal employees as a part of Trump administration-led staff reductions. However, she said enforcement staff with the Wage and Hour Division, who are responsible for investigating child labor, are exempt from the program.
“At the Department of Labor, our goal is to fully enforce the law and make sure that we are using the full enforcement capability of the Department of Labor to crack down if someone is knowingly breaking that law, and we will double down to do that,” Chavez-DeRemer said.

Federal agencies that enforce labor, environmental and agricultural laws have seen layoffs, budget cuts and attacks on federal workers in recent months under the Trump administration.
Jessica Looman, former administrator for the Wage and Hour Division under the Biden administration, said she worries ongoing cuts to staff and budgets will have a chilling effect on the division’s ability to carry out its work.
“Enforcing federal child labor laws is one of the most important things that the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor does and it’s critical that they have the resources to be able to do that work,” Looman said in an interview with Investigate Midwest.
An excerpt from Sen. Josh Hawley’s letter to Labor Secretary Lori Chavez DeRemer, dated May 6, 2025. The letter in full is available to read below.
The Wage and Hour Division has roughly 1,400 full-time employees and a budget of $260 million as of fiscal year 2024, according to DOL budget documents and interviews with former staff. The agency has around 700 investigators tasked with enforcing federal child labor and other labor laws.
In its 2025 budget proposal under the Biden administration, the Wage and Hour Division requested 50 additional full-time employees to continue investigating child labor.
“Over the last decade, WHD enforcement capacity has decreased from more than 1,000 on-board investigators to just over 720 investigators — one of the lowest levels in fifty years,” the document states.
The DOL would not answer direct questions from Investigate Midwest about how federal budget cuts and deferred resignations have impacted the Wage and Hour Division, or how these changes would affect its ability to conduct child labor investigations.
An excerpt from DOL Acting Administrator Donald M. Harrison III’s response addressed to Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, dated May 12, 2025. The letter in full is available to read below.
The concerns over cuts to staff responsible for child labor investigations come as multiple senators are calling for more investigations into potential child labor in meatpacking plants.
This month, U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, sent a letter to DOL Secretary Chavez-DeRemer demanding an investigation into Tyson Foods, the nation’s largest poultry processing company. Hawley said he was contacted by a whistleblower who previously worked for the company and claimed to have seen underage workers at a processing plant employed by a third-party contracting service, as well as hearing from other coworkers that underage workers were working at the facility.
“They’re using child labor, they’re using illegal immigrant labor and they’re basically participating in an illegal human trafficking ring,” Hawley said in an interview with Investigate Midwest. “This has got to stop.”

In a letter sent to Hawley, the Department of Labor confirmed the company is under investigation for child labor, but did not detail specific facilities.
“We do not allow the employment of anyone under the age of 18 in any of our facilities, and we do not facilitate, excuse, or in any other way participate in the use of child labor by third parties,” a Tyson spokesperson said in a statement to Investigate Midwest.
Hawley and Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker reintroduced legislation in March to prevent companies with child labor violations from obtaining federal contracts and funding.
Nearly half of all child labor violations in the past two decades have come from agriculture industries, with the number of child labor violations increasing 35% in the past 10 years, according to DOL data.
While crop production accounts for most of these violations, major meatpacking companies, such as Tyson Foods, JBS USA, Perdue Farms, Cargill and Mar-Jac Poultry have been fined and investigated for violating federal child labor laws in the past decade.

In 2023, the Wage and Hour Division announced that Packers Sanitation Service, a company formerly based out of Wisconsin and now headquartered in Atlanta, employed more than 100 children – ages 13 to 17 – at 13 meatpacking plants across the country. The company was fined $1.5 million for child labor law violations.
Some worry Trump’s cuts could harm future enforcement efforts
“With cuts going on in the Trump administration, we certainly have a fear that there’s going to be even less capacity and less appetite for enforcing child labor laws,” said Todd Larson, co-executive director for environmental and labor advocacy group GreenPeace, part of a coalition working to prevent child labor in meatpacking and food processing..
While it’s unclear how child labor in the U.S. will be affected by federal cuts, international enforcement already has seen an impact.
The quasi-governmental Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, cut $240 million in funding for the Department of Labor’s International Labor Affairs Bureau in March, according to POLITICO. The office investigates global use of child labor in supply chains, as well as labor performed under human trafficking or coercion.
In a letter to the DOL, Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee called on the agency to reinstate funding to the bureau to prevent goods made under child labor conditions from entering the country’s supply chain and competing with the U.S. labor force.
“American trade policy relies on critical federal programs working overseas to challenge unfair competition from governments that commit egregious abuses in global supply chains,” the letter states. “By eliminating these and other technical assistance projects, the Administration is surrendering an essential tool for leveling the playing field and holding our trade partners accountable.”

In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.
But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

(2023 file photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)While providers, their supporters and Democratic lawmakers are pressing for a substantial continuing direct state investment in Wisconsin’s child care sector, Republicans in the Legislature are pursuing another route: expanding a child care tax credit for employers.
So far, child care providers and some small business owners aren’t interested.
The legislation circulated in draft form in early May. On Friday, May 30, it was formally introduced in the Assembly (AB 283) and the state Senate (SB 291).
“We really think it’s an important opportunity to reward employers for getting involved in child care,” Neil Kline, who says he encouraged GOP lawmakers to draft the tax credit legislation, told the Examiner.
Kline is executive director of Family Friendly Workplaces, a nonprofit based in Woodville that works with businesses in Burnett, Pierce, Polk and St. Croix counties. The organization certifies employers as family-friendly “to support their recruitment and retention efforts,” Kline said. To that end, one of its missions is focusing on workforce-related problems such as housing and child care access.
In early May Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Rep. Karen Hurd (R-Withee) circulated the proposed bill seeking cosponsors.
The legislation was written “to encourage more businesses to invest in child care in their communities,” Marklein and Hurd wrote in their May 12 cosponsor memo. “These changes will increase the number of available child care slots and provide more options for families.”
Demanding direct support
The legislation has been introduced while child care providers and Democrats are continuing their campaigns to revive direct support for the child care sector.
During the COVID-19 pandemic the Evers administration used federal pandemic relief funds to pay child care providers monthly stipends through the Child Care Counts program. The $20 million a month that the state doled out helped providers stabilize child care, increasing workers’ pay while keeping care more affordable for families.
When Evers tried to use $360 million from the 2023-25 budget to continue Child Care Counts with state money, none of the Legislature’s Republican majority got behind the measure. The governor was later able to reallocate other federal dollars to fund Child Care Counts through June 2025, but at half the original amount: $10 million a month.

With lawmakers now writing the 2025-27 budget, Evers, child care providers and their advocates have been campaigning for $480 million to continue the program for the next two years. A survey commissioned by the state and conducted by the University of Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty forecast closures and tuition hikes if the state payments end.  
At their very first budget vote, however, Republicans on the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee removed the proposal along with more than 600 other items Evers had included in his budget draft. The GOP outnumbers the Democrats 3 to 1 on the committee.
Democratic lawmakers responded by circulating a draft stand-alone bill to reinstate the Evers proposal.
“Child care providers are facing increasing cost to operate while still making poverty-level wages,” said Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) at a May 22 press conference to announce the Democrats’ bill. “This has made it extremely difficult to hire and retain quality staff. [Meanwhile] providers desperately want to avoid rising costs and rates on families already struggling to afford child care.”
Child care as business investment
As yet no Republican lawmakers have gotten behind the Child Care Counts proposal.
Instead, the bills that Marklein and Hurd have introduced would make changes to the Business Development Tax Credit, which is provided through the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC).
That tax credit is granted to reward a variety of business investments and reduces the state income tax that a business pays by the amount of the credit.
Currently, a business that spends money on starting a child care program for its employees can get up to 15% of that cost taken off its tax bill. The credit applies only to capital investments, however — building or remodeling the child care facility.

“Unfortunately, we have heard that the current program parameters limit the incentive for businesses to invest in child care programs,” Marklein and Hurd wrote in their co-sponsor memo. “While many businesses may want to provide child care as a benefit to employees, the current credit limitations reduce the incentive for this investment.”
In addition to capital expenditures, the draft bill would extend the tax credit to cover 15% of several other costs:

An employer’s spending on child care program operations;
Spending to reimburse employees for their child care expenses;
Spending to buy or reserve openings for its employees at a child care center;
Contributions an employer makes to an employee’s flexible spending account for dependent care.

The draft bill also allows the tax credit for “any other cost or expense incurred due to a benefit provided by an employer to facilitate the provision or utilization by employees of child care services.”
The tax credit would be refundable: Even if the credit totals more than the employer pays in taxes, the company would get its full value back from the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. 
It also would give a refund to nonprofit employers, which don’t pay taxes.
“While not a silver bullet, these changes are another step in the right direction to address the child care issue in Wisconsin,” Marklein and Hurd wrote in their memo.
  Neil Kline (Family Friendly Workplaces photo)
Kline, the Family Friendly Workplaces director, said the proposal would help engage employers more directly in addressing child care shortages.
“We really think it lays the groundwork for ongoing, self-sustaining support of child care in Wisconsin,” he said. “The primary goal is to help introduce new money into the child care — really, the child care ecosystem — by rewarding employers to support the ongoing expenses of child care, because the reality is that the sector needs additional money in it.”
Kline said he understands that “the ongoing operational economics” is a central problem for the child care sector. “That’s why we are so focused on helping employers find avenues and be rewarded for helping defray the expenses that are related to child care and helping support that ongoing operational side of child care.”
Chilly reception
To date the existing child care employer tax credit hasn’t had any takers, according to the WEDC. In January, as part of an overall evaluation of the state’s business development tax credit, an outside consultant told WEDC that “due to the high operational costs of childcare centers, affordability would likely be better achieved through subsidy as opposed to a tax incentive.”
The proposal to expand the tax credit isn’t gaining traction with providers or small business owners.
Main Street Alliance, which organizes small business owners to advocate for state and national legislation, has already announced objections to the bill.
  Shawn Phetteplace, Main Street Alliance
“These kinds of programs and tax credits are often advantageous for employers who can afford compliance and the procedural costs and have economies of scale,” said Shawn Phetteplace, MSA’s national campaign director. That leaves out the typical small business, said Phetteplace, who sent lawmakers a memo calling the proposal “deeply unserious.”
Evan Dannells, a chef and owner of two Madison restaurants, questioned how a relatively small business like his would benefit from the tax credit.
Of his eight full-time employees, one has two children. Most of the others are graduate students. Directly paying for the one employee’s child care, even if receiving a tax credit, doesn’t feel fair to the others who don’t have that expense, Dannells said.
“If you put the onus of taking care of child care on the employer, the employer won’t hire people with children,” he said.
Dannells considers the cost of child care a legitimate use of his tax dollars. “This is why government should be doing this,” he said. He observed that children are required to go to school when they reach the age of first grade. “Why can’t we take care of them from age 1 to 5?”
While the tax credit may make it easier for a particular company’s employees to afford child care thanks to the employer’s support, skeptics of the proposal say that assistance only helps some people — not the system as a whole.
“That doesn’t help keep the doors open,” said Heather Murray, who operates a child care center in Waunakee. “We’re hitting crisis mode and centers are shutting down now, and a quarter of them will be gone if [Child Care Counts] isn’t renewed. We need the investment to go directly to providers to make sure that the doors stay open.”
Child care as a public good
National child care analyst Eliot Haspel is also skeptical. Haspel is a fellow at Capita, a think tank that works in the area of family policy. In February 2024, the think tank New America published his report raising questions about the impact of various employer-sponsored child care benefits.
  Eliot Haspel (Capita.org photo)
Haspel views child care as a public good that benefits society broadly. For that reason, he contends, it should serve families regardless of whether they work for an employer able to fund a child care benefit.
“Small business will never be able to offer a really robust child care workplace benefit,” Haspel says. That puts small businesses and small business employees at a disadvantage if supporting child care is primarily an employer’s responsibility, he argues.
The large number of low-wage workers and “gig workers” “also raises the specter of increasing inequalities,” he writes in the New America report.
Haspel says that tying child care to a job also locks people into a job — or strands them from needed care if they lose their job. It also disrupts children’s early education at a time when they need consistent and reliable connections with their caregivers, advocates say.
“It’s really bad for workers and it’s really bad for kids for your child care to be tied to your employment,” Sen. Kelda Roys said at the Democrats’ May 22 press conference.
Tying health insurance to employment has been “a disaster,” Roys said. Health care is “rationed based on the job that you have or the wealth that you have,” she added, “and we do not want to exacerbate the current problems in our child care system by tying it to people’s employment.”
In his New America report and in an interview, Haspel says the problem isn’t providing child care at the workplace.
“I’m not against the idea of onsite child care — that can make all the sense in the world,” he says. “You can have an onsite center as part of a publicly funded system” — one to which employers contribute as taxpayers.
Focusing on the employer, however, carries with it “an opportunity cost,” Haspel says. “The more we say child care should be solved primarily through employers, the harder it is to say we need a fully public system that is universal and reaches everyone.”

(Photo courtesy of Yellowstone National Park)EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the first installment of Howl, a five-part written series and podcast season brought you in partnership between the Idaho Capital Sun, States Newsroom and Boise State Public Radio. 
The helicopter was flying low above a remote snow-covered mountain ridge outside Hinton, Alberta, Canada, when pilot Clay Wilson jumped the wolves and gave chase.
Carter Niemeyer picked the tranquilizer gun off his lap and sighted through the opening where the helicopter’s passenger side door had been removed especially for the mission.
Less than 50 feet below, a 9-month-old wolf pup broke into a run, bounding through the December snowpack.
His coat was the color of coal.
Even though the pup wasn’t yet a year old, he weighed 83 pounds and had developed a thick coat that would help him endure his first winter in the mountains.
The chopper made a pass at the wolf and doubled back, but Niemeyer wasn’t close enough to fire a dart loaded with tranquilizer drugs.
After essentially killing off all wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains by the 1930s, the United States government sent Niemeyer and a small team to Canada just over 30 years ago to sedate, catch, study and reintroduce wolves to the American West, where wolves were a native species. 

Wilson and Niemeyer had never flown together before this flight took off in December 1994.
Niemeyer was an experienced government trapper and wildlife biologist with a United States government agency called Animal Damage Control (which later changed its name to USDA Wildlife Services), but he had never been to Hinton and didn’t know his way around Alberta’s Northern Rockies.
To make matters worse, the local tranquilizer gunners the government hired for the mission hadn’t shown up yet.   
Niemeyer was supposed to be on the ground, carrying wolves out of the snow to a safe spot to land the helicopter after the wolves were darted from the air.
“I was mostly mugging,” Niemeyer said. “The mugger is the guy who you dump out in snow 20 feet deep. And you roll and crawl and drag yourself through this ungodly deep snow, sometimes where just the little tops of the pine trees were sticking out, because the wolves get darted in there and you can’t land (a helicopter). It’s too dangerous, between snags and deep snow that could collapse. So the mugger, you’ve got to get that wolf out of that deep snow situation, down the slope and try and drag them to river ice, somewhere where you’ve got a footing, where the helicopter can land securely.” 
An average adult male wolf weighs about 100 pounds.
The largest wolf caught for wolf reintroduction in 1995 and 1996 weighed 135 pounds, Niemeyer said. 
“And, yeah, talk about a workout,” Niemeyer said. “Sometimes it was something else.”
 Capturing wolves in Canada to release them into Yellowstone, Frank Church wilderness 

The reason Niemeyer was in Hinton is because the U.S. government decided to bring back wolves after a decades-long extermination campaign.
The controversial plan called for Niemeyer and the reintroduction team to capture gray wolves from Canada and release them in Yellowstone National Park and the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho. 
And the only way to do so was by hand.



But when Niemeyer showed up to Canada searching for wolves to bring back to the Lower 48, he found the local trappers who were supposed to be capturing live wolves for collaring and medical exams had grown distrustful of the American government.
Instead of caring for live wolves, the local trappers were killing them.
“The guys were killing them, skinning them and putting them on stretching boards and then I got up there and met them, and we had a confrontation, me and them, and they told me (to) take my truck and get the hell out of town,” Niemeyer said.
An already tense situation in Canada came to a head when a local trapper hauled in two dead wolves and threw them at Niemeyer’s feet. 
Standing 6 feet, 6 inches tall and fond of wearing a mustache and a fur trappers hat, Niemeyer wasn’t one to back down from a challenge. 
Since he was a boy following in his father’s footsteps, Niemeyer had trapped, skinned or taxidermied just about every predator and varmint in the West. 
It started with pocket gophers – 10 cents a head.
That night he ended up squaring off with a local trapper in a drunken wolf skinning competition inside the man’s cabin. 
It had been about 60 years since the wolves’ howl fell silent across the U.S. Rocky Mountains. 
If wolves were going to make a comeback, things were off to a bad start.
 Wolves driven out of the Rocky Mountains 

Wolves are a keystone species of apex predators that ranged from the Arctic, down through the Rocky Mountains and plains of the United States and into Mexico for thousands of years.
There used to be tens of thousands of wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.




But thanks to government bounties meant to encourage westward expansion, settlers used trapping and widespread poisoning to kill off virtually every wolf in the American West by the 1930s.
Between 1914 and 1926, at least 136 wolves were killed in Yellowstone, including two wolf pups killed in 1926 near a geologic feature named Soda Butte.
Yellowstone National Park reports that the last wolf pack in the park was killed in 1926. 
It wasn’t hunters or poachers who killed off the last Yellowstone wolves.
It was park rangers.
Congress had put up $125,000 to remove wolves and other predators from public lands, and it worked. 
The Idaho Department of Fish and Game says the last wolf in Idaho was believed to have been killed in the 1930s.
Wolves survived in Alaska, Canada and Minnesota but they were functionally extinct in the Western U.S.
Then things began to change for wolves in 1974, slowly at first.
Four subspecies of gray wolves, including the gray wolf of the Northern Rocky Mountains, were listed under the Endangered Species Act, which had just been signed into law the year before by President Richard Nixon.
Dozens of conservation groups, nonprofit organizations, biologists, veterinarians and members of the public pushed to save and restore wolves.
Meanwhile ranchers, hunters, politicians across Idaho, Montana and Wyoming and countless residents of small rural communities pushed just as hard in the opposite direction. 
By 1980, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery plan recommended reintroducing wolves to Central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park.
As the federal government set wolf reintroduction in motion, hunters and ranchers vehemently opposed the plan. They warned of conflicts between humans, wolves and livestock.

 ‘Wolf ground zero’: How wolves and livestock can collide in the West 

Ranchers said the loss of livestock like sheep and cattle would threaten to wipe out generations-old family businesses. 
They were already struggling with the thinnest of margins and facing uncertainties like drought.
They didn’t need wolves eating their livestock.
“We have family stories from my grandfather and great grandfather about the first generation of wolves and how they warned us about keeping them away from our livestock, and how important it was to not have livestock interactions with wolves,” said Jay Smith, owner of J Lazy S Angus Ranch in Carmen, Idaho. “So we have that long, long family history of knowledge on top of our own.”
Smith is a fourth-generation rancher. His ancestors first bought a ranch on Carmen Creek in 1924.

His own ranch is located a few ridges over from Corn Creek in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness – the original site of wolf reintroduction in Idaho in 1995.
Smith calls the area “wolf ground zero.” 
From the ranch, Smith can gaze across the valley and see the Diamond Moose grazing allotment. It was one of the first – and remains one of the most consistent – sites of conflict between wolves and livestock, Smith said.
“There’s no rhyme or reason,” Smith said. “You know, in 30 years, we never know what to expect. One year we’ll lose 20 head of cattle, and one year we’ll lose zero. And we just never quite know how to explain or how to do better, or how to mitigate that risk.”  
 Tense public meetings showed just how controversial wolf reintroduction was, not just to the West, but to the world 

Ranchers weren’t the only ones worried about wolf reintroduction. 
Hunters warned the return of wolves would lead to the decimation of elk herds, which would threaten a way of life for generations of passionate hunters.
A series of heated wolf reintroduction public meetings played out in cities and small towns across Idaho, Wyoming and Montana in the 1990s. 
Yellowstone National Park staff reported that over about 2.5 years, the team developing the environmental impact state conducted more than 130 meetings and considered more than 160,000 public comments, which came in from all 50 states and 40 foreign countries.


Upcoming Howl schedule

Wednesday, June 11: River of No Return: How the Nez Perce Tribe stepped in to save wolf reintroduction in Idaho. After the Idaho Legislature nearly derailed the entire operation, the tribe faced racist questions on whether it was capable of repopulating the Lower 48.
Wednesday, June 18: Fixing Yellowstone: How an intact ecosystem set the stage for a wolf queen’s long reign. Despite being orphaned and repeatedly challenged for alpha status and ultimately being killed by a rival pack, Wolf 907 leaves a long legacy.
Wednesday, June 25: Cattle Battle: How wolves and livestock collide – and how one Idaho project offers solutions. Western ranchers say their livelihood is at stake after wolves were reintroduced into the Lower 48 30 years ago.
Wednesday, July 2: Ghost Wolves: While wolves might represent nature’s greatest comeback, some longtime advocates say they aren’t seeing wolves in the same places they always used to after the Idaho Legislature expanded wolf hunting and trapping in the state. Some scientists have openly questioned how the state tracks and counts wolves, and some original members of the wolf reintroduction team worry 30 years of hard work to bring wolves back could be undone.



Several people in the room during those meetings described increasingly tense hearings, where emotion and fear trumped science and reason.  
“Working with wolves all the years I did before coming here, you can’t underestimate human hatred of wolves,” said Doug Smith, a biologist who led wolf reintroduction and monitoring in Yellowstone for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022. “I mean reason, compromise, facts, science doesn’t even dent people’s attitudes about (wolves).”
“Prior to wolves being listed as an endangered species, they weren’t just killed, they were tortured,” Smith continued. “People cut their lower jaws off and set them free, and they died that way. They would wire their jaws shut. They would take nails or razor blades and put it in hunks of meat… So they’d swallow the razor blades and nails. This is human hatred.”
Some wolf meetings ended in screaming matches.
But in 1994, former Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt authorized the reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone National Park and Central Idaho.
“It was a long slog,” Smith said. “Wolves were listed in 1974, so it was a 20 year process to get wolves back.”
After it became clear wolf reintroduction was going to happen, Doug Smith landed his dream job in 1994 – becoming a wolf project biologist at Yellowstone National Park. There were no wolves there yet, but he was there to lay the groundwork for reintroduction.
Within two years, Smith was named leader of the Yellowstone Wolf Project.
“If you’d studied wolves at all, or carnivores at all, it was the biggest opportunity in decades to come along,” Smith said. “I mean, wolves are eradicated from Yellowstone by the government. The government decides to restore them. It’s the largest intact temperate zone ecosystem in the world, and the government’s going to undertake wolf reintroduction – as controversial a thing as you can get.” 
 Howling for wolves – and a wake up call 

Babbitt’s authorization to reintroduce wolves didn’t ease the tension.
A few weeks before wolf reintroduction, Suzanne Asha Stone and a team of researchers were surveying the land where the wolves would be reintroduced in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. 
Stone is the co-founder of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network. At the time, she was an intern working for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and a member of the wolf reintroduction team.
After landing a small plane on a wilderness airstrip, the researchers received a report of a wolf sighting in an area called Bear Valley, just outside of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.
“Dr. (Steven) Fritz was teaching me how to howl for wolves,” Stone said. “That’s how we used to look for wolves before there were more of the digital type recordings that you would play for them. You just go out and do some howling. And so he was teaching me how to do that. And it was my first time to go solo.”
“We were on a Forest Service road out in the backcountry on the national forest and I got to my second howl, and we had rifle bullets just zing right over the top of our heads,” Stone said.
Nobody was hurt, and Stone still doesn’t know if the shooters knew people were in the area.
But the episode served as a wakeup call, a visceral reminder of how deep wolf hatred ran for some.










I got to my second howl, and we had rifle bullets just zing right over the top of our heads.


– Suzanne Asha Stone, member of wolf reintroduction team


By the time Stone and the reintroduction team arrived in Salmon to prepare to reintroduce wolves in Idaho, Stone was concerned for the team’s safety and worried about the potential for violence.
Members of the reintroduction team began to travel with an armed guard.
“We’d already received death threats in town from people’s signs,” Stone said. “They were handwritten. And it said, ‘kill all the wolves and all the people who brought them here.’”
  ‘Carter’s Hope’: How one man and one wolf made the West a little more wild  

Babbitt’s signature cleared the way for Carter Niemeyer and the reintroduction team to head to Hinton in November 1994. 
And that brings us back to that alcohol-fueled wolf-skinning competition.
Niemeyer, refusing to blink, won the competition with the local trappers and earned their respect. That’s when the capture and reintroduction mission finally got off the ground. 
With his credibility firmly established, Niemeyer got in touch with Clay Wilson, a helicopter pilot out of Cranbrook, British Columbia. 
Niemeyer and Wilson hoped to search for wolves by air, dart them with tranquilizers fired from the helicopter and then fit the wolves with radio collars. 
Once the captured wolves were temporarily released again, the radio collars would help the reintroduction team track the wolves to the location of the larger pack.
But the gunners hired for the operation hadn’t arrived yet.
Wilson decided to take a test flight and invited Niemeyer. 
Niemeyer was a seasoned hunter and government trapper who had experience using sedative drugs like telazol and ketamine.
But he did not know the area or have any leads on local wolves.
“When the pilots got there they go, ‘So do we have anybody who knows how to gun that could go ride with us to go dart a wolf?’” Niemeyer said. “And I was the only one.”
The team took two helicopters up.
Wilson and Niemeyer eventually spotted a group of three or four wolves, including that 9-month-old male pup with the thick black winter coat.
After several passes, Wilson flew in low and Niemeyer finally fired at the running pup.
The dart struck the wolf on one its front paws – just barely.
Wilson landed the helicopter, and Niemeyer sprang after the young wolf. 
The wolf was only partially sedated, still staggering and thrashing through the snow. 
After a mad dash, Niemeyer got close enough to slip a catchpole over the wolf and administer another round of drugs to sedate it. 
It was a moment he will never forget: Niemeyer had just darted and captured the first wolf for reintroduction in America.
“I named it Carter’s Hope, because it was the first wolf we caught up in Canada by darting,” Niemeyer said. “And I was just being silly and called it Carter’s Hope. Hoping that this was the beginning of a successful project, which it turned out to be.”
Once the wolves were darted and captured, they were sent to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park, where they underwent medical examinations, were given vaccinations and tested for disease. 
During exams, the wolves were given numbered radio collars that allowed biologists or park rangers to track the wolf’s location. 
Idaho elementary school students decorated collars for each of the wolves bound for Central Idaho.
Each collar has a different number and Carter’s Hope, who was bound for Yellowstone, received collar number 15. (Niemeyer said the collars don’t have any negative effects on the wolves who wear them.)
After his capture, Carter’s Hope was flown to Montana and then driven to Yellowstone National Park in January 1995.

As the horse trailers carrying Carter’s Hope and the other wolves entered Yellowstone’s North Entrance at Gardiner, Montana, and passed under the iconic Roosevelt Arch, crowds of people lining the side of the road cheered and waved.
 A soft release into Yellowstone country 

Carter’s Hope became one of the original members of the Soda Butte Pack, one of the first three packs of wild wolves to live in Yellowstone in nearly 70 years.  
Initially, the Yellowstone wolves were kept in one-acre acclimation pens, set back from the park’s roads, as part of a so-called soft release.
“We were on the receiving team, so our job was to take care of the wolves in the pens for 10 weeks. That meant visiting them twice a week, every week, to feed them, check on them, and then release them,” Smith said.
Yellowstone staffers used horse-drawn sleds to haul animal carcasses to the pens to feed the wolves. 
  After they were captured in Canada, the wolves released in Yellowstone National Park initially stayed in acclimation pens, like this wolf pictured in Crystal Creek on Jan. 26, 1996. (Photo courtesy of Jim Peaco/Yellowstone National Park)
But outside of the temporary acclimation pens where the new wolves were first held upon reintroduction, Yellowstone National Park is wild landscape with no fences – the park boundary is an invisible line.
After the wolves were released from Yellowstone’s acclimation pens in March 1995, Carter’s Hope didn’t stay within the boundaries of Yellowstone, where rangers patrolled and poaching was almost unheard of. Wolves were still listed as an endangered species in 1995, but protecting them in the vast tracts of national forest and ranchland outside of the park would be a challenge. 
After Carter’s Hope and the Soda Butte Pack left the park in April 1995, Niemeyer and Smith worried the wolves could be at risk of poaching anytime they strayed beyond Yellowstone’s invisible boundaries.

“We’ve learned through decades of wolf research that making it illegal to kill wolves doesn’t stop people from killing them,” Smith said in an interview in the Yellowstone backcountry. “Wolves are one of those cultural lightning rods that a ton of society doesn’t care about what the rules are. They hate wolves so much they’re going to shoot them. And you know, a country like this that I’m looking out upon is broken country. It’s forested. The wolves have got a chance to get away from human killing. (But) ringing the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is a sea of humanity, and it’s open country. And what I mean by open county is no place to hide. People jump on four wheelers. People jump in pickup trucks, and they’ll run them down… Yeah, they run them down with snowmobiles, or four wheelers. Or they get close enough where they can take a rifle shot on them when there’s no place to hide. And there’s no place to hide all around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.”
Aside from poaching, Smith and Niemeyer worried about wildlife control officers killing wolves if the wolves killed livestock outside of the park.
It turns out, it was only a matter of time.
The first report came in December 1995 – wolves killed a dog in Fishtail, Montana.
By spring and early summer 1996, wolves had killed sheep on a ranch about 30 miles north of Yellowstone’s border.
This time, Niemeyer was able to capture Carter’s Hope and bring the wolf back to a Yellowstone acclimation pen for two more months.
While Carter’s Hope was in the pen, a young visitor took notice.

Wolf 26, a female wolf pup from the Nez Perce Pack, began hanging around the pen.
Wolf 26 was one of the wolves brought to Yellowstone from Canada during the second year of reintroduction, in 1996, Yellowstone National Park records show. 
After inching closer and closer, Wolf 26 and Carter’s Hope touched noses through the fence in the pen, Niemeyer wrote in his memoir, “Wolfer.”
No longer a part of the Soda Butte Pack, Carter’s Hope paired off with Wolf 26 after he was re-released from the pen on Sept. 27, 1996.
Along with humans, wolves are among the few mammals that form long-term pair bonds – often remaining together for life, raising pups jointly and sharing food.
Carter’s Hope and Wolf 26 stayed together and traveled throughout the southern portions of Yellowstone National Park through the end of 1996, Yellowstone records show.
Eventually the two wolves left Yellowstone, heading south to Wyoming, where Wolf 26 had five pups.
The new pack was named the Washakie Pack.
Carter’s Hope had become an alpha wolf and made history.
“He did successfully acclimate to being a wild wolf and got away from livestock, and he became the first breeding male wolf to establish a pack in the state of Wyoming,” Niemeyer said. 
 A long line of descendants – and fear for the future 

But two years after Carter’s Hope arrived in Yellowstone, ranchers reported more calves were killed near the Washakie Pack’s territory.
This time, Niemeyer couldn’t save the wolf.
Carter’s Hope was shot and killed by a USDA Wildlife Services officer in October 1997 for killing livestock outside of Yellowstone National Park, according to the Yellowstone Wolf Project’s 1998 annual report.
Although wolves were still an endangered species, animal control officers tracked and killed Carter’s Hope under rules established to reduce conflict with ranchers. 
Niemeyer still thinks killing Carter’s Hope was unnecessary.

“I was upset, and I was saddened,” Niemeyer said. “I was disappointed.”
But he also realized the place Carter’s Hope holds in history.
Carter’s Hope was one of the 66 wolves captured in Canada released in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in 1995 and 1996.
“He made it a couple, three years, but he did have pups, and that’s a nice thing with wolves – they’re prolific animals, and some of his progeny lived to see another day,” Niemeyer said.
Today, just over 30 years later, there are an estimated 2,800 wolves in the Western United States.
Almost all of them descended from Carter’s Hope and the other 65 other wolves that a small team of biologists, veterinarians, trappers, pilots and conservationists reintroduced to America. 
Today, 30 years removed from reintroduction, Niemeyer, Stone and Smith say wolves are in danger once more. Wolves were removed from the Endangered Species List in 2011.
Now, Niemeyer, Smith and Stone worry about increased hunting and trapping and new government programs enacted in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming that are intended to reduce the wolf population. 
“I am worried about the future, because the most important thing for wolf restoration is human attitudes, and human attitudes have not changed about wolves,” Smith said. “One of my favorite sound bites when I started working in Yellowstone 30 years ago was, ‘I hope in 30 years, some of the controversy has died down, and people have gotten used to the ideas that wolves aren’t that bad.’ And that hasn’t happened at all. They are still hated as much as they were 30 years ago. They’re still a political football. They’re still controversial.”

Journalists Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin reported and wrote Howl over the course of 14 months, trekking deep into the backcountry in some of the most remote places in the Lower 48 chasing the story of America’s wildest and most controversial wildlife comeback story – wolf reintroduction.

As the state’s longest-running school prepares to shutter, students and staff will scatter to new classrooms and jobs. Many mourn the loss of an institution they say offered one-of-a-kind learning.
The post Eulogy for a school; Laramie students, staff say farewell to Lab School appeared first on WyoFile .","LARAMIE—The Lab School is a family affair for Corelle Lotzer. 
Not only did Lotzer enroll her daughter and son in the school, but she taught math here for over a decade. Her daughter, who thrived years ago as a student in the K-8 atmosphere, returned as an adult to work as a paraprofessional — just down the hall from her mom.
Because Lotzer took a year off to take care of an aging aunt, she lost tenure. So when the closure of the 138-year-old school became official this winter, she did not receive a contract with the district to continue working at one of its other schools. 
Lotzer, who was raised in Laramie, instead accepted a position at Cheyenne East High School. In early May, she was still trying to figure out the logistics involved with working in Cheyenne while her other, younger kids continue their education in Laramie. 
“It’s been tough,” Lotzer said in a second-story room in the Lab School. The shrieks and laughter of children at recess drifted in from an open window. “I would have rather stayed in Albany County.”
Lotzer is one of 11 Lab School teachers without tenure, Principal Brooke Fergon said. “That’s probably been the most difficult challenge, that our tenured teachers have been placed in other schools throughout the district, and our teachers who do not have tenure … were not initially placed in positions.”
It’s not the only pain point involved in closing a school that predates the state of Wyoming itself. Many people fought to keep the Lab School open, and the past year has been a rollercoaster of emotions for school staff, students and their families as hopes have been raised and dashed, Fergon said. The school, which sits on the University of Wyoming campus, started as an educational learning site for college students studying to be teachers. It’s beloved for its experiential and outdoor-based approach to learning and emphasis on inclusivity.

But the school’s future was thrown in doubt last summer as the university and Albany County School District 1 hit a stalemate over a lease agreement. School advocates pleaded to keep it open by some means and floated ideas that didn’t stick. The Lab School no longer served its former functions, university and district officials said, and issues from maintenance costs for the 75-year-old building to district-wide enrollment trends factored into closure talks. 
The final Hail Mary came during the Wyoming Legislature. A bipartisan bill sponsored by Laramie Democrat Chris Rothfuss would have required UW and a coordinating district to operate a K-8 public lab school. The bill passed out of the Senate, but House lawmakers killed it in February, and that was pretty much that for the Lab School. 
In the last year, Fergon said, “I think we’ve really been sitting in a place of uncertainty, just with all of the different avenues that could have kept the school going, and so that did feel kind of like a final door closing.”
And for her staff, she said, “even though we’re not happy to say goodbye to the school, and we didn’t want to see the school close, I think that having some certainty and a path forward … feels better than just sitting in limbo.”
With the school year ending Thursday, Lab School students will be saying goodbye to their classrooms and dispersing to other schools in the district. Some teachers will too, but others are starting new jobs or moving out of Laramie entirely. The school community spent the last couple of months bidding farewell, some with regret about how it ended.

“We love the school,” said Lindsey Rettler, a parent with two elementary students in Lab. Rettler was experiencing a mixture of emotions, she said in May. “Surprise, a little bit of shock, really, really sad, super disappointed and honestly, quite betrayed by those who are supposed to be leading people based on what’s best for the people.”
End of an era 
The school was established in 1887 as the Preparatory School to serve secondary education students from counties without access to high school. In 1913, it transitioned to the Training Preparatory School, used as a learning laboratory by UW’s College of Education. 
In 1999, the private school partnered with the Albany County School District to become a district public school. The Lab School then operated as a “school of choice,” meaning any district family could enter a lottery to enroll their kids.
College of Education students continued to train in its classrooms, but they also did so in classrooms across the district, state and beyond.
Historically, UW and the school district operated with a memorandum of understanding laying out terms of tenancy. Efforts to renew that MOU, however, failed to produce an updated agreement. Instead, the university announced last summer it was pursuing an extension only for the 2024-’25 school year, meaning the school would have to find a new home if it was to continue beyond that.

Among the major sticking points: whether the district or UW should pay for things like major maintenance in the aging building. UW also cited the fact that the school “no longer serves a significant role for teacher training in UW’s College of Education,” along with security challenges regarding having a school-district-operated facility located on university grounds; the Lab School’s incongruence with the state’s public funding model and the fact that the school district “has excess capacity in its existing facilities to accommodate current Lab School students.”
The Albany County School District Board of Trustees voted in December to close the Lab School after considering options to move it into another district building. Trustees expressed heartache but also a fiduciary obligation before making the decision. 
Concerned residents bemoaned the decision, and Albany County state lawmakers took notice. Sen. Rothfuss’ bill was the product of that concern. The bill brought together strange bedfellows, with co-sponsors ranging from Freedom Caucus-aligned lawmakers like Ocean Andrew to Laramie Democrat Karlee Provenza. Both serve in the Wyoming House of Representatives.
The issue raised questions about the state’s role in local education and what constitutes a situation so exceptional that lawmakers should meddle. Lab School supporters argued its unique role as a teaching laboratory and its century-plus of education history made it a place worth saving. 
“This legislation is not about saving a school,” Rep. Andrew, R-Laramie, said on the House floor on Feb. 28. “It is about protecting a legacy and educating future generations of Wyoming teachers.”

True local control reflects the wishes of the people in the community, he continued, “and in this case, the overwhelming support for keeping the Lab School open has been ignored. The people of Wyoming, the parents and the students have spoken, and they have been met with indifference by those in power.”
But others said the state should not interfere in a matter of local concern.
“This really feels like we’re being asked to micromanage a local school,” said Rep. Art Washut, R-Casper. “I don’t think this is the proper role of the state legislature.”
The body ultimately killed the measure on a 24-32 vote. 
Moving on 
With that, school staff began the work of transition, making plans with its 145 students to help them figure out transfer schools and options, Fergon said.. The school counselor even brought in a “transition curriculum” to help students navigate and cope with the stress of such significant change.
There was also a staff of roughly 20 teachers along with employees like janitors and paraprofessionals. Many say they are sad to leave a school community that felt like family. 
Some, like Fergon, are continuing to work in the district. She will be an assistant principal at another high school.

Others, like Matt Klima, hadn’t quite decided their next steps by early May. “I’m trying to figure out what I want to do when I grow up,” he joked. 
Klima moved to Laramie three years ago from Big Piney and started at Lab School in 2024, teaching middle school social studies.  
The school culture, he said “is lightning in a bottle. You don’t just transport it. This school allows me to do weird stuff.” He dressed up as a king and bossed students around when teaching about the Magna Carta, and helped take them on multi-day trips in nature. “That’s the kind of stuff you can’t do with 700 kids.”
Klima isn’t worried about himself, he said. “I’m more worried about some of my students.”
Lab was a good fit for students who don’t do well in large school populations, he and other supporters said. The small scale was well-designed for integrated and experiential learning. Older kids got to mentor younger ones in a unique way. The location on campus afforded easy access to incredible resources, they said.

Rettler’s two children have had “an amazing experience” at Lab School, she said. Rettler, who works at UW, has enjoyed the three-minute walk from her office to the school to have lunch with her children or help with reading. Since the closure became official, “We’ve definitely had a lot of tears in our household.” 
Annica Fenus is Lotzer’s daughter, the one who returned to the Lab School as a paraprofessional. Fenus fondly remembers taking ropes courses and visiting the astrology tower as a student. It was hands-on and vibrant, and a place that embraced weird kids like her, she said. “I’ve cried quite a bit over [the closure] because this school has made me who I am.”
Outside the window, the sounds of children playing started to wane. Bubbles drifted upward from the playground, disappearing one by one with a conclusive pop.

Beware of Wyoming political forces that don't mean what they say, columnist Rod Miller writes. 
The post Our new profanity appeared first on WyoFile .","Back in the day, comedian George Carlin did a scandalous routine about the “Seven Dirty Words” that shocked almost everyone. He explicated sexual terms in a way that either made you laugh or made you reach for your Bible.

Opinion

A few years prior, Lenny Bruce did an impromptu comedy set where he poked holes in racially charged words to show us how our language has the power to wound if we don’t use it with wisdom.
Both Carlin and Bruce should be required course material in any English Comp 101 or Introductory Civics classroom.
I, myself, sometimes sprinkle scatological words in my opinion pieces because quite often they are the most effective tools for the task at hand. For instance, at my former publication, I wrote a piece on Frank “Oral” Eathorne, the former GOP state chairman. In said piece, I used a street synonym for an intimate act that rhymes with “snowbob.”
The editor didn’t censor that piece and published it intact. But I received a cordial request to minimize my use of that word in future columns. I haven’t used the word @#$%&# in a column since.
Occasionally, a reader will push back against my use of the word “goddam” as an emphatic modifier. They say that is taking the Lord’s name in vain. I disagree.
To me, the only way to violate the third commandment in the Decalogue is to swear an oath using God’s name (like an oath for a political office), then to piss on that oath through official performance. Or perhaps another way is for politicians to cloak themselves in God’s name to gain worldly power. Goddamn ‘em!
That brings us to the language we use today in our civil discourse. A lot of terms that, in years past, were benign or neutral have, through political misuse, assumed a darker, more sinister semantic impact. The words are spelled the same, but the effects they have on us have changed.
These are the new dirty words, in no particular order.
“Grassroots” used to mean “of the common folks, widespread, holding the thin soil of Wyoming in place against a fierce wind.” The word has been co-opted by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus to the point that it has lost its meaning as a descriptor of the prairie landscape, and now means nothing more than an isolated patch of locoweed or larkspur in the corner of a dry pasture.
“Conservative” once denoted a political ethos exemplified by Mr. Conservative, Barry Goldwater, that emphasized fiscal restraint, individual freedom coupled with personal responsibility, reliance on the free market and a skepticism toward central government. The root meaning of the word has been bastardized by those who want to use it as a means of division, of control. “Conservative” now is less of an honest political movement, and more the team name on a bowling shirt.
“Common sense” was once self-explanatory. But, through devious misuse, it now means little more than adherence to a right-wing point of view. It seems as if everything is seen through a political lens these days, and that lens distorts our words.
“Equal” and “Equality” are mathematical expressions of equivalency, defined in the Equality State’s Constitution as “all members of the human race are equal.” Yet the term is used as a lever by both the right and the left to push us to one side of the political spectrum or the other. That, to me, is bait-and-switch semantic dishonesty and profanity.
“Freedom” and “Liberty” are the most basic of human impulses. But these words have been prostituted by the “Freedom” Caucus and Moms for “Liberty.” They are now used in political propaganda as nothing more than sweeteners for a program of authoritarian control — control over what we can read, how we can pray (or not), how we can use our bodies, what we can say, how we can vote, what our children can learn and who we can love. Goddamn the hypocrisy!
“Patriot” once described brave citizens who were willing to sacrifice their lives to resist tyranny. Those folks built our republic. Now the word is self-applied by apologists of despotism who hide behind keyboards and wouldn’t recognize true patriotism if it bit ‘em in the ass.
There are other words in our language that have similarly been hijacked by dark political forces, and their intrinsic meanings polluted by partisan hyperbole. I think you’ll recognize them when you see them.
So the next time you see this new profanity used in a politician’s press release, on a website or in a flashy mailer that shows up in your mailbox, plastered with buzzwords that appeal to base emotions, ask yourself a simple question. What does it REALLY mean?

The state’s top elected officials should listen to the people and oppose plans for a gravel pit in one of Central Wyoming’s most pristine spaces, writes guest columnists Michael Fernald and Carolyn Griffith.
The post There’s still time to stop a bad deal for Casper Mountain appeared first on WyoFile .","Stand on Casper Mountain’s north slope at dawn and you’ll hear little more than meadowlarks and a magpie’s rasp over Platte Creek. Families draw drinking water from shallow wells, kids and parents alike run dogs along dusty two-track and the mountain’s shoulder reveals first light for the 60,000 people in Casper. That Casper Mountain peace is why thousands of us chose to live and invest here. 

Opinion

Now, swap the birds for dozens of gravel trucks grinding up Coates Road six days a week — that is the stated future that Prism Logistics hopes to lock in by reapplying for sand and gravel leases on what Casper calls the “School Section.” School sections are state lands granted throughout the West at statehood to be managed for revenue production that supports schools and other public institutions. The state currently makes money through grazing fees and leasing the lands now at issue at the base of Casper Mountain. On Thursday, the State Board of Land Commissioners will decide whether to trade one of Casper’s signature landscapes for a short burst of road base and a royalty that amounts to less than $2 per student, while risking millions in long-term damage. 
The leases were granted in 2023 without even a postcard being sent to adjacent landowners or Natrona County officials. The first word came when residents witnessed test pits being dug. Within weeks, neighbors formed the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance, gathered more than 20,000 signatures, and requested that county commissioners correct zoning in the area to “Mountain Residential 1—no mining allowed” to once again preserve fragile water resources. The commissioners agreed unanimously. Prism has since sued the county, and unless the state land board acts, the leases are on track to move forward. 
But the board now has a second chance to look before it leaps and to prove it answers to the people, not the pit. The choice is not gravel versus nothing; it is gravel versus water security, property values and the mountain that defines Casper’s southern horizon. Trust lands like this sit in every Wyoming county. How Casper Mountain and Wyoming citizens are treated will echo from Sundance to Star Valley.
Why water is the red line
 Casper Mountain’s north slope sits atop a fragile perched aquifer — rain and snowmelt seep into gravel above an impermeable shale layer, feeding shallow wells. Strip away that gravel and the water drains off the mountain instead of soaking in. Hydrologists warn that even moderate excavation can lower the water table or cause it to drain downslope faster than it can recharge. Prism’s owner says the company will drill deeper wells “if something goes wrong.” Ask homeowners what that promise is worth: A replacement well, if water can even be found, costs tens of thousands of dollars and erases the security families thought they had bought. Long-term related expenses exceed the promise of drilling a water well. 
The money is laughably small 
In theory, schools benefit from gravel royalties. Even if production reached Prism’s high-end projection of about 300,000 tons a year, royalties at 60 cents per ton would only top out near $180,000 annually, or $1.95 per Wyoming K-12 student. Wyoming’s school system spends more than $20,000 per pupil annually. One failed well can cost $30,000 to replace; damage to a hundred wells would wipe out decades of royalties in a single summer. Factor in lost property value, dust-control expenses and road repairs, and the ledger flips from black to deep red. 
A process failure the board can fix
Secretary of State Chuck Gray and Superintendent Megan Degenfelder have acknowledged that they originally approved the leases without realizing the full scope of the situation. Their openness shows how quickly the original application moved through the system and onto the consent agenda in 2023. The board now has a second chance to do what should have been done the first time: evaluate environmental risk, economic trade-offs, and community input and deny this new round of lease applications. 
Things you can do right now 
1. Reach out to your elected officials who make up the State Board of Land Commissioners: 

Gov. Mark Gordon, 307-777-7434, governor@wyo.gov 
State Auditor Kristi Racines, 307-777-7831, SAOAdmin@wyo.gov 
Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, 307-777-7675, askthesuperintendent@wyo.gov 
Secretary of State Chuck Gray, 307-777-7378, SecofState@wyo.gov 
State Treasurer Curt Meier, 307-777-7408, treasurer@wyo.gov

2. Speak up. Email lands@wyo.gov with “Casper Mountain leases — public comment” and/or attend the meeting at 8 a.m. Thursday at the Wyoming Capitol Building in Cheyenne. Casper Mountain points us toward what matters: ample, clean water for our homes and leaders who listen. Make sure the land board hears that message — loud and clear — before they vote Thursday.

Brent Comstock, 29, is the CEO of the Lincoln-based marketing firm BCom, which he started a decade ago, after having thought up the idea for the business while he was in school. The District 1 seat Comstock is running for is held by Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln, who told the Lincoln Journal Star in April that he would not seek a fourth six-year term next year.

Comstock said it’s important to preserve Clare’s legacy of being principled and that he hopes to continue Clare’s ability to bring all Nebraskans to the table.
“With the current political climate and the current budget environment, I think the next decade is going to shape how future generations choose to work and live here in the state,” Comstock told the Nebraska Examiner. “All of that future depends on a strong, forward-thinking university system that brings everyone to the table and recognizes that every Nebraskan is impacted by what happens through the university system.”
Comstock said NU is the “most important public institution in the state,” from Nebraska Extension and 4-H in rural communities to degree programs across NU campuses and world-class research at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
“I think it touches every person in Nebraska,” Comstock said.
‘Education, opportunity and progress’
Comstock, the son of a plumber and a former special education teacher, is a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He said he made his own college decision similar to other small town Nebraska kids: on finances, dreams and aspirations.
A scholarship made it more economically viable to go to school in North Carolina, Comstock said he returned home and invested in BCom, which partners with start-up companies, a bipartisan group of candidates and other causes or organizations.
Comstock’s campaign announcement included endorsements from Nebraskans, including Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird, community leader and philanthropist Connie Duncan, former State Sen. Matt Williams of Gothenburg (who ran for the regents in 2022) and former U.S. Sens. Bob Kerrey and Ben Nelson, who both also served Nebraska as governor.

In a statement, Gaylor Baird said Comstock “helped put Lincoln on the map” and has played a key role in shaping Lincoln’s “growing entrepreneurial ecosystem.” He lives and works in the downtown and Haymarket space in Lincoln.
“Brent understands that the success of the university and the success of Lincoln are deeply connected. He brings people together — across politics, industries and generations — to focus on what really matters: education, opportunity and progress,” Gaylor Baird said. “He’s exactly the kind of regent we need right now.”
Jeff Raikes, the former Microsoft executive and Nebraska native who co-founded the Raikes Foundation, also endorsed Comstock. The Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is named after Raikes, the former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
Raikes said in a statement that Comstock understands that NU “is not only a world-class institution, but also a vital economic engine for our state.”
“His ability to work across sectors and across the aisle makes him exactly the kind of regent we need to lead with vision, integrity and purpose,” Raikes said.
New district boundaries
Clare ran unopposed in 2014 and 2020 and won in 2008 with 58% of the vote. New district boundaries took effect in 2021 and match those of the State Board of Education District 1, which in November elected newcomer Kristin Christensen.

Races for the education boards are officially nonpartisan, and Comstock is a registered nonpartisan, while Clare is a registered Republican and Christensen is a registered Democrat. Christensen won with 58% of the vote in a highly watched election in November, succeeding former State Board of Education member Patsy Koch Johns, a Democrat first elected in 2016.
Comstock said that while he would bring a “fresh perspective,” he also brings a decade of leadership in building a company in the Cornhusker State.
“I told people, if I were ever to seek elected office, I would want it to be in a place that we can make impact that touches as many people as possible,” Comstock said. “I think that this is the moment to do that.”
The top two vote-getters in May 2026 will advance to the November 2026 election.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Advocates for low-income and disabled Tennesseans sounded the alarm Tuesday over federal legislation that could slash an estimated $1.1 trillion over the next decade from federal safety net programs that provide food and healthcare to millions of Americans. 
The package includes a $600 billion reduction in federal Medicaid spending over 10 years, impacting TennCare, Tennessee’s program, which currently covers healthcare costs of 1.4 million people, including two of every five children in the state. 
It also includes nearly $300 million in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as “food stamps,” which helps more than 700,000 Tennesseans buy food. Some savings from SNAP cuts would then be used to increase farm subsidies. Both programs would establish new work requirements for adult recipients. 
Tennessee counties stand to lose a net $5.3 billion in federal help over 10 years if Congress approves the SNAP cuts even with increases in farm subsidies, one recent analysis found. 
Jeannine Carpenter, chief communications officer for the Chattanooga Area Food Bank, warned the proposed cuts to SNAP would create a surge in hunger among Tennessee families.

The food bank provided 17 million meals last year to families in southeast Tennessee and northwest Georgia, but, Carpenter noted, those efforts pale in comparison to the role SNAP plays in Tennessee. 
“For every meal we provide, SNAP provides eight,” she said. “So, if we take these benefits away, we’re talking about a food insecure population that cannot be cared for by our current charitable infrastructure.”
Speaking during a downtown Nashville news conference held outside the offices of Tennessee’s two Republican senators, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, Carpenter urged the pair to reject the cuts and “protect the very people they were elected to protect,” she said.
Medicaid cuts in the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” would largely come from new work requirements for adults and imposing more paperwork requirements that are expected to disqualify recipients unable to complete them. 
The work requirements could have a narrower impact on Tennessee, which has opted not to expand Medicaid, than other states. They apply primarily to non-elderly adults without disabilities. Most TennCare enrollees are children, their parents, pregnant women, seniors and people with disabilities. 
TennCare has an uneven history for the existing paperwork process it uses to enroll and then periodically verify people enrolled in the program. One government audit found that of the more than 240,000 children cut from TennCare between 2016 and 2019, only 5% were found to be disqualified from the program. Other children lost insurance because families did not fill out paperwork correctly. 
Neither Hagerty nor Blackburn responded to requests for comment about the bill left with their offices.
The Senate is expected to take up the package already approved by House Republicans later this month. GOP supporters of the bill say it is designed to root out  “waste, fraud and abuse” from the programs.
Analysis projects SNAP cuts will far outweigh subsidy bumps in Tennessee counties
An analysis by the Environmental Working Group, which has tracked farm subsidies for over the past three decades, found that just three of Tennessee’s 95 counties would see their net funding increase even with deep cuts to SNAP: Crockett ($32 million increase), Haywood ($32 million increase), and Lake ($1.2 million increase). 
The rest would see farm subsidy bumps far outweighed by SNAP cuts.
The group examined USDA county-level farm subsidy data and federal data for SNAP by county to determine how much funding each county stands to gain or lose should SNAP funding see a $300 billion cut and farm subsidies get a $35 billion boost under the bill. 
Tennessee’s most populous counties would lose the most, with Shelby County expected to see a net $1.2 billion decrease, followed by Davidson ($500 million), Knox ($301 million), Hamilton ($283 million), and Rutherford ($167 million). 
But more rural counties will also see significant reductions in overall funding.
“We have thousands of SNAP recipients in a single county that receives support to help their families eat on a daily basis, but that will get cut so that a couple hundred (farmers), maybe, will receive a few extra thousand dollars when it comes to harvest time,” said  Jared Hayes, senior policy analyst for the Environmental Working Group. 
These particular farm subsidies have higher payouts for larger commodity harvests, Hayes said, benefiting large-scale farmers over smaller operations.
“No matter what, people are going to be losing out in every single county. It’s just who is getting the money,” he said.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A record number of people sought services from North Dakota domestic violence and sexual assault advocacy centers in 2024, a statewide coalition reported this week.
The statistics include more than 6,300 victims of domestic violence and nearly 1,400 victims of sexual assault, according to the North Dakota Domestic and Sexual Violence Coalition. 
That represents a 3.3% increase in reports of domestic violence over 2023 and a 5.8% increase in reports of sexual assault. Seth O’Neill, executive director for the coalition, added he believes cases of domestic violence and sexual assault continue to be underreported. About one in four women and one in nine men will experience domestic violence in their lifetime, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“More people are being served, so that is a good thing,” said O’Neill, who oversees the coalition that includes 18 advocacy centers across the state.
We all have the power to stand up against domestic violence

The coalition received an increase in state funding in the legislative session that ended last month. The advocacy center will receive $11.7 million from the Department of Health and Human Services for the 2025-27 biennium, an increase of about $4.1 million over the previous biennium. The organization had requested $19.1 million from the Legislature.
O’Neill said some of that funding will go to increase wages for case advocates across the state. He added those frontline workers make about $21 per hour on average and some need to take additional jobs to make ends meet.
“No one is making a ton of money at this,” he said. “We’re hopeful this increase will allow people to be paid a living wage and take care of their families, but I still think we have a long way to go in that area.”
While O’Neill said the coalition is grateful for the state funding increase, he’s concerned about the potential of federal budget cuts. North Dakota’s advocacy service centers receive about 30% of their budgets from federal funds and the coalition receives about 95% of its money from federal sources, he said.
“We’re certainly reliant on federal funds,” O’Neill said. “We are in a holding pattern and we’re doing our best to apply for grants and different things, but we don’t know what the future will hold.”
Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, said state lawmakers are monitoring the federal budget negotiations.
“We definitely are very cautious and thoughtful in the decision-making, and what we need to do to ensure these programs are still running because the needs are there,” said O’Brien, who served on the House Appropriations Committee. “It’s something that we have to do to make sure that those people are being served.”
In 2024, North Dakota advocacy centers secured 481 emergency orders for protection for domestic violence victims, an increase of 50 over the previous year.
O’Neill said increasing the number of protection orders for domestic violence victims is important because that means law enforcement can provide protection to the victims.
During the 2023 legislative session, O’Brien said the Legislature passed a series of laws, including House Bill 1268 and House Bill 1269, that made it easier to serve court papers for people with protective order hearings and mandated intervention programs for domestic abuse offenders.
  State Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, speaks during a meeting of the Legislative Management Committee from the House Floor on Nov. 13, 2024. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
“To see the work that we’ve done previously come to fruition is huge,” O’Brien said.
According to the 2024 data, 81% of North Dakota domestic violence victims were women, including 150 who were pregnant when they were assaulted. About 4,700 children were impacted by domestic violence last year.
About 38% of the total victims of sexual assault reported the incidents to law enforcement, according to the coalition.
O’Neill also said he believes the stigma around not reporting domestic and sexual violence is beginning to be chipped away.
“Our goal is to make North Dakota a place where people feel they can report these things and they will be taken seriously by law enforcement and the criminal justice system, as well as our program,” O’Neill said.
O’Brien said lawmakers focusing on providing services for victims, rehabilitation programs for offenders and preventative education for the public are long-term structures that can correct behaviors.
“We’ve started to see an improvement, but there is so much more work that needs to be done,” O’Brien said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s newly-released listing of companies netting a business tax refund creates the appearance of transparency without providing the public a true picture, according to an open government advocate.
Deborah Fisher, executive director of Tennessee Coalition for Open Government, said Tuesday the information posted May 31 on the Department of Revenue website should contain more exact amounts of refunds to the 60,000 companies that received an estimated total of $1.5 billion. The lists also should remain available for more than 30 days because removal lends itself to “secrecy,” Fisher said.
When lawmakers passed the Republican-backed measure in 2024 at the request of Gov. Bill Lee, senators were loath to put out any public information. But the House demanded a modicum of openness before supporting Senate Bill 2103.










These are people threatening to sue the state, and they got $1.5 billion in refunds. Tell me who they are, tell me how much they got.


– Deborah Fisher, Tennessee Coalition for Open Government 


That included posting the names of companies that receive the refunds in categories of less than $750, between $750 and $10,000 and more than $10,000.
“To say something is above $10,000 is not transparent, because it could be $10,500 or $100,000. This covers three years of tax payments that were calculated … and it is not inconceivable that some companies might get a lot of money back,” Fisher said. “That’s why (businesses) got the legislature to change the law.”
In addition, Fisher said the governor should release the amount that Lee Company received in the refund and that any lawmaker who applied for a refund should disclose the amount. Lee has consistently said his interest in the family company was placed in a blind trust during his governorship, which will run out in late 2027.
Most proponents of the legislation said last year it was necessary because of the threat of litigation, though state officials never revealed the names of companies challenging the legality of the state’s franchise and excise tax. Others who supported the measure said it was good tax policy to slash the property tax for businesses statewide.
“Was it truly a legal threat or did they just want to give more money away to corporations who contribute to their campaign or who they’re connected with?” Fisher said.
Besides the refunds, lawmakers cut the franchise tax — which is levied on companies in amounts based on net worth of capital — by $410 million annually, a move critics say is putting a dent in revenues to the tune of $335 million so far this year.
Lawmakers and state officials argued against listing more specific information on the rebates by saying taxpayer information is confidential. Fisher, though, said if the matter had gone to court, the information would have become public record, and the public would have had a better indication of how the state’s franchise tax was faulty.

“Maybe it was cheaper to change the law,” Fisher said. “But still, these are people threatening to sue the state, and they got $1.5 billion in refunds. Tell me who they are, tell me how much they got.”
Rep. Jeremy Faison of Cosby, chairman of the House Republican Caucus, defended the law Tuesday by saying every recipient of the “significant tax cut” is listed on the state site for the public to search and save.
“I believe in transparency, and so do my fellow Republicans. That’s exactly why the House made sure the public has easy access to this information,” Faison said via text message.
Only one Republican, Rep. Gino Bulso of Brentwood, voted against the bill, and only one Democrat, Rep. Johnny Shaw of Bolivar, voted for the bill last year. Otherwise, the measure passed along party lines with supermajority Republicans supporting it.
Democratic Rep. Sam McKenzie of Knoxville said Tuesday the list doesn’t provide enough transparency and called it a “self-serving” measure “to keep the rich folks rich” and hurt working-class Tennesseans. He added that the policy enables businesses such as Lee Company to hide behind the refund ranges, even though they could have received much more than $10,000.
“It’s obvious that they’re ashamed of it. If they’re not ashamed of it, they wouldn’t allow it to sit out there for just 20 or 30 days,” McKenzie. “It’s an indictment.”
Democratic Rep. Caleb Hemmer of Nashville echoed those comments, saying the ranges of money are “worthless” as far as transparency when Fortune 500 companies are lumped in with mom-and-pop businesses.
“They didn’t want to put targets on some people’s backs, but they’re asking for pretty significant (refunds), $2 billion of tax revenue in a very odd and unique situation, and I think the more transparency the better,” Hemmer said.
Democratic lawmakers, Rep. John Ray Clemmons and Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville proposed an alternative bill last year that they said would have enabled the state to avoid a lawsuit and continue to collect the business tax. Republican lawmakers declined to consider it. Yarbro’s law firm, Bass, Berry & Sims, received a refund.
Several Senate Republicans declared a conflict of interest when voting for the bill in March 2024, including Sen. Shane Reeves of Murfreesboro, CEO of TwelveStone Health Partners, which is listed as receiving a refund.
Reeves said via text message Tuesday he was “comfortable” with the reporting ranges in regard to the franchise and excise tax law and said they “seemed like a fair compromise.”

Even-steven. That was the intent of delegates from the seven basin states in 1922 when they met near Santa Fe to forge a compact governing the Colorado River.
But what exactly did they agree upon? That has become a sticking point in 2025 as states have squared off about rules governing the river in the drought-afflicted and climate-changed 21st century. The negotiations between the states, according to many accounts, have been fraught with tensions. Becky Mitchell, Colorado’s lead negotiator, delivered a peek into that dispute at a forum on May 22 in Silverthorne along the headwaters of the river.
The Colorado River Compact was a quid pro quo. California, in particular, but also Arizona, was ready to see the highs and lows of the rivers smoothed out. They, as well as Nevada, wanted a giant reservoir in Boulder Canyon in Nevada near the small town of Las Vegas, which then had a population of 2,300. Those Southwestern states couldn’t do it alone, though. They needed the federal government to build the dam later called Hoover. For that, they needed the support of Colorado and the three other upper-basin states.

Colorado, represented by Delph Carpenter, and the three other headwaters states realized that they had best reach a compromise, as they would more slowly develop the rivers. If the doctrine of prior appropriation that they had all adopted within their own states prevailed on the Colorado River, the water would be gone by the time they found need for it.
This was the foundation for Article III of the Colorado River Compact. It apportions 7.5 million acre-feet in perpetuity for the exclusive beneficial consumption by each of the two basins. On top of this 15 million acre-feet, they knew there would be water lost to evaporation, now calculated at 1.5 million acre-feet annually, plus some sort of delivery obligation to Mexico, which later turned out to be 1.5 million acre-feet.
In Santa Fe, delegates had assumed bounteous flows in the river, as had occurred in the years prior to their meeting. And so, embracing that short-term view of history, they believed the river would deliver 20 million acre-feet.

It has not done so routinely. Even when there was lots of water, during the 1990s and even before, as Eric Kuhn and John Fleck explained in their 2019 book, “Science be Dammed,” troubles ahead could be discerned. And by 1993, when the Central Arizona Project began hoisting water to Phoenix and Tucson, the river ceased absolutely to reach the ocean.
Then came the 21st century drought. Those framing the compact understood drought as a temporary affliction, not the multi-decade phenomenon now perplexing the states in the Colorado River Basin.
Nor did they contemplate a warming, drying climate called aridification. Similar to drought in effects, it is rooted in accumulating atmospheric gases. Unlike drought, it has little to no chance of breaking.
Now, faced with creating new rules governing the sharing of this river, delegates from the seven states are at odds in various ways, but perhaps none so much as in their interpretation of compact’s Article D. It says that the upper-division states “will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to be depleted below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre-feet for any period of ten consecutive years.”
The lower division states have so far received 75 million acre-feet over every revolving 10-year period. The upper-basin states have not fully developed their apportionment, although Colorado has come close. In the last 25 years, the upper-basin states have been using 3.5 million to 4.5 million acre-feet. The lower-basin states that a decade ago were still using 10 million acre-feet have cut back their use to 7.5 million acre-feet.

Lake Powell serves as a water bank for the upper basin states. The storage in 2022 had declined to 22%, although a good snow winter in 2022-23 restored levels somewhat. Today, the two reservoirs are at a combined 34% of full.
“That means 66% empty,” said Mitchell at the forum along the Blue River in Silverthorne at a “state of the river” forum organized by the Colorado River Water Conservation District.
Mitchell, an engineer by training, has a large on-stage presence. She’s not one to mince words, sometimes straying into the colloquial. This outspokenness is more evident when she speaks exclusively to a home-town crowd. Silverthorne certainly counted as one.
Shared risk is at the heart of the dispute. Colorado and other upper-basin states want the lower-basin states to accept that the river will not always satisfy all needs.
“How do we handle drought? We know how to do that in the upper basin, and most of the people in this room know that you get less,” said Mitchell, Colorado’s representative on the Upper Colorado River Commission. “That hasn’t been the case in the lower basin.”
The two basins differ in three fundamental ways. One is the pace of development. The lower basin developed quickly. The upper basin still has not used its full allocation. From the upper-basin perspective, that does not mean that the lower-basins states should expect something beyond a 50-50 split.
“The main thing that we got from the compact was the principle of equity and the ability to develop at our own pace,” said Mitchell. “We shouldn’t be punished because we didn’t develop to a certain number. The conversation now, she added, is “what does equity look like right now?”
Another difference is that the upper basin has thousands of individual users. Sure, there are a few big ones, like Denver Water and the other Front Range transmountain water diverters who collectively draw 400,000 to 450,000 acre-feet annually across the Continental Divide. The lower basin has just a handful of diverters, and the diversions are massive.
Also different — as alluded to by Mitchell — is that the lower basin has the big reservoirs lying upstream. The largest is Mead, with a capacity of almost 29 million acre-feet, followed closely by Powell at a little more than 25 million acre-feet. Mead was created expressly to meet needs of irrigators and cities in the desert southwest.

Powell was created essentially to ensure that the upper-basin states could meet their delivery obligations. Mitchell shared a telling statistic: More water has been released from Powell in 8 of the last 10 years than has arrived into it.
Upper-basin states must live within that hydrologic reality, said Mitchell. If it’s a particularly bad snow year in the upper basin, the farms and ranches with junior water rights and even the cities can get shorted. The lower basin states? Not a problem. They always get their water — at least so far. But the two big reservoirs have together lost 50 million acre-feet of stored water.
“We’re negotiating how to move forward in a way different place than we were negotiating 20 years ago,” said Mitchell.
Upper-basin states have managed to deliver the 75 million acre-feet across 10 years that the compact specifies, but what exactly is the obligation? That has long been a gray area.
At a forum two days before Mitchell spoke in Colorado, her counterpart in Arizona, Tom Buschatzke, reiterated at a conference in Tucson that they see the compact spelling out a clear obligation of upper-basin states to deliver 75 million acre-feet plus one-half of the water obligated to Mexico.
What if the water isn’t there? That’s the crux of this dispute as the upper and lower basin states negotiate in advance of a September deadline set by the Bureau of Reclamation.
In theory, if the situation were dire enough, Colorado could stop all its post-1922 diversions to allow the water to flow downstream. But is that what those gathered in Santa Fe in the shortening days of November 1922 had in mind?
Will lawsuits toss this into the court system for resolution? That process might take decades and, if it ended up at the Supreme Court, it might not yield a nuanced outcome. Mitchell didn’t address that directly, although she did say everybody on the river wants to avoid litigation.
The situation described by Mitchell and other upper-basin proponents is perhaps analogous to a divorce settlement. The settlement may call for a 50-50 split of all earnings between the partners, but what if one becomes destitute and has no money to pool?
Upper-basin states do have reservoirs to help buffer them from short-term droughts. Altogether, however, they don’t come close to matching the capacity of Powell.
Again, from the perspective of upper-basin states, California and Nevada have a sense of entitlement. Not that the upper basin states are angelic, said Mitchell. It’s because they have no choice.
“I say we use three to four million acre-feet less than our apportionment. It varies. You know why? Because hydrology varies. And so we respond to hydrology. It’s all based on snowpack and it’s all gravity. Most of it is gravity dependent. We don’t have those two big reservoirs above us like the lower basin does. We don’t have those reservoirs to equal out the flows or allow us to overuse. We have to live with variable hydrology, and we take cuts every single year.”
Upper-basin states want a willingness in this settlement for agreement that focuses on the water supply, not the demand. “Common sense would tell you, maybe Mother Nature should drive how we operate the system.” That, she said, is the bedrock principle of the proposal from the upper division.
With plentiful snowfall, greater releases from Powell might be possible, said Mitchell, and in times of extreme duress, water from Flaming Gore and perhaps the Blue Mesa and Navajo too. She said there might be room for greater conservation measures in the upper basin states.
But there must be “real work happening down in the lower basin,” she said.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator).The Louisiana Senate approved last-minute amendments to a bill that would shield the personal information of state lawmakers, statewide elected officials and public service commissioners from being shared with the public. 
In its original state, House Bill 681 by Rep. Marcus Bryant, D-New Iberia, would have added retired district attorneys, assistant district attorneys and district attorney investigators to an existing law that shields certain personal information of “protected individuals” from public disclosure. Existing law currently only lists judges, retired judges, current and retired judicial commissioners and hearing officers as protected individuals. 
Bryant’s bill passed the Senate as amended on a unanimous vote and has to return to the House for approval of those changes. The bill is scheduled for a final vote Wednesday. 
Tacking on the amendments with no opportunity for public input is troubling to government watchdogs. 
“While it’s reasonable to protect certain sensitive information about elected officials, quietly adding these provisions to a bill about district attorneys and other judicial officers, without public debate, is not the right way to do it,” Steven Procopio, president of the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, said in an emailed comment. “Especially when the law threatens violators with jail time” 
The law shields home addresses, phone numbers, personal email address, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, federal tax identification numbers, bank account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, license plate numbers, marital records and date of birth. 
An official’s church, the school or daycare of their child attends and the employment location of their spouse, children or dependents would also be shielded. 
The existing law creates a process for protected individuals to have their personal information taken down from public view and allows for them to sue if their request is not followed. Violators can be charged with a misdemeanor and could face jail time.

John Cavanaugh is throwing his hat into the ring Wednesday and running for Congress in Nebraska’s 2nd District.

The Omaha-based lawmaker joins one high-profile local candidate in PAC co-founder and small business owner Denise Powell, along with Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis.
The winner of the May 2026 Democratic primary will try to do what former Omaha State Sen. Tony Vargas fell short of doing so two times — becoming the first non-Republican to represent Nebraska in Congress since the late former U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford served in early 2017.
Cavanaugh said he is banking on his record “of being a leader in the Legislature” to separate himself from Powell.  He said he has a record of standing up for “working people” and protecting access to reproductive health care, something he plans to continue to do in Congress if elected. Bacon is anti-abortion in a district where a majority supports abortion rights. 
An Omaha name
The Cavanaugh name also holds weight in Omaha, as John is part of a state political dynasty. His father, in the late 1970s, held the congressional seat that he hopes to win, and his sister, State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, serves in the statehouse with him. 
Cavanaugh’s pitch: “The country is in crisis. [We] need strong leadership to help us correct course from this chaotic president and Congress.”

The attorney and former Douglas County Public Defender points to his experience in government as a contrast to Powell’s campaign. Powell has argued people want a fresh face in political office. She said she would prioritize protecting Medicaid and Social Security, vote to ensure the federal government does its part to boost quality K-12 education and push back against the Trump administration.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report has rated the Omaha-based 2nd District seat held by U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., as a Republican toss-up. National and state Democrats are using the recent Omaha mayoral race as evidence of growing voter “energy” against President Donald Trump and political fuel for the congressional midterms.
But the fundamentals of the district haven’t changed. It remains Nebraska’s most politically divided and diverse district, with a slight GOP tilt. The 2nd District contains Democratic-leaning Douglas County, home to Omaha, Republican-leaning slices of western Sarpy County, largely suburbs and exurbs, and rural Saunders County.
A complex district
The 2nd District voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 and former President Joe Biden in 2020 after voting for President Donald Trump in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012. It backed then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama in 2008.

Bacon has fended off Democrats in close races five times in previous years and bucked the “blue dot” voting trend in the past two presidential elections. The retired Air Force brigadier general is a reliable Republican vote on most matters. But he has again stepped into the national spotlight as one of the few House Republicans willing to criticize the Trump administration.
Bacon hasn’t announced a decision yet on whether to retire from Congress, though he said that decision would come this summer. Nebraska Democrats, who view Bacon’s seat as vulnerable with him in it or not, have multiple candidates to choose from. Republicans could have a 2nd District primary regardless of what Bacon decides.  
Former 2022 GOP gubernatorial candidate Brett Lindstrom has told people in conservative political circles that he might be interested in a bid if Bacon retires. Another candidate that has been discussed is Dan Frei, who lost a bid to challenge Bacon in the 2024 GOP primary.

Dems keep eyeing NE-02
If Cavanaugh emerges from the Democratic primary, he would be the second Democratic-aligned state senator to run against Bacon, following Vargas. 
Cavanaugh said the difference between Vargas and him is that he was born and raised in Omaha and has a “stronger record of being a leader in the Legislature.”
Bacon has already criticized Cavanaugh’s voting record early this year, saying that outside political groups would easily use it to highlight his “left-wing votes.”
Cavanaugh said the biggest motivation for him to run is that the federal government is currently populated by “people who are self-interested and self-dealing.”

“That starts with the president and includes Congress, but we saw it in the Legislature this year,” Cavanaugh said. 
Cavanaugh spent much of the most recent legislative session arguing against efforts by the  GOP-majority in the officially nonpartisan Legislature to resist ballot measures passed by Nebraska voters, including new laws requiring paid sick leave, raising the minimum wage, repealing school vouchers, and legalizing medical marijuana. 
He was often one of the Democratic-aligned lawmakers filibustering the majority’s proposed changes to what voters approved. 
“I don’t shy away from a fight, but I’m not trying to be combative with people just for the sake of being combative,” Cavanaugh said. “We need that kind of principled strength representing us in Congress.”

This year, 11 states decided not to offer the federal program, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service. All 11 non-participating states — Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee and Wyoming — are led by Republican governors.
A 12th Republican-led state, Oklahoma, will offer the program only to tribal nations.
“Recognizing the importance of ensuring children have access to nutritious meals year-round, [West Virginia] opted to participate in this federally funded initiative to combat food insecurity among its youth,” Angel Hightower, a communications specialist for the state Department of Human Services, said in a statement.
The federal program provides families with $120 in grocery benefits per each eligible school-age child during the summer.
The Department of Human Services estimates the program will benefit 165,000 children in the state this year. Most existing participants received their first benefits by June 1, Hightower said. The state will continue processing new applicants through Aug. 20.
Those with school-age children who already receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid or  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) are automatically enrolled in the program.
Families are also eligible if their child attends a school that participates in the National School Lunch Program and the household makes up to 185% of the federal poverty level. For 2025, a family of four can make up to about $59,000 and be eligible for the program.

(Courtesy of CPW)It’s been a week of bad news for supporters of Colorado’s voter-mandated efforts to reintroduce gray wolves.
 
Connecting the news in Colorado to the big picture.

Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials announced Friday that agents had shot and killed wolf 2405, a yearling male belonging to the first litter of wolf pups born in the state since reintroduction, after a series of livestock attacks in Pitkin County. That news was followed Monday by CPW’s announcement of the death of a recently reintroduced wolf, 2507-BC, in northwest Colorado on May 31.
The latest confirmed death means at least five of the 15 wolves relocated from Canada in January have now died. Two of the animals traveled north into Wyoming, where wolves are largely unprotected under federal and state laws; one was killed by federal officials after livestock attacks, and the other is widely assumed to have been legally hunted — Wyoming wildlife officials have invoked a hunter confidentiality law when asked for details. The causes of death for three wolves found dead in Colorado are all under investigation by CPW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Roughly 20 other adult or yearling gray wolves remain alive and in the wild across the state, and advocates and CPW officials hope that an unknown number of pups born this spring can soon be confirmed and added to the total.
But for now, with a small population working to establish itself in the early stages of the program, the deaths of one-third of the individuals reintroduced this year have pushed Colorado wolves’ survival rate below a critical threshold outlined in CPW’s formal reintroduction plan.
Citing research derived from other states’ wolf management plans and the federally-led effort to restore wolves to Yellowstone National Park in the 1990s, that plan, adopted by the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission in 2023, anticipated that survival rates for reintroduced wolves would range between 70% and 85% in the early years of the program. Early survival rates were listed among the benchmarks CPW said it would use to measure “short-term success.”
“A survival rate of less than 70%” for reintroduced wolves within six months of release, the plan says, “would initiate protocol review.”
“An unusually large number of losses during the first year of releases or following any modification to established protocols will prompt a full review of management procedures,” the document continues. “To assure high initial post-release survival, the project may be suspended at any time until likely cause(s) of problems are identified, and acceptable solutions can be implemented to resolve the problem(s).”
CPW spokesperson Travis Duncan confirmed to Newsline Tuesday that the agency would review its procedures, but not until causes of death for the animals are established.
“Out of an abundance of caution, CPW will assess the mortalities of wolves translocated in 2025 to determine if any translocation protocols should be modified,” Duncan said. “This cannot occur until final determinations from the USFWS necropsies have been made on the cause of the mortalities.”
A decades-old benchmark
The 70% target in CPW’s plan comes from a 2015 technical report by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife assessing that state’s wolf population. The Oregon report, in turn, cited three previous studies from wildlife biologists who found that wolf populations can be sustained with mortality rates as high as 25% to 30%. Crossing that threshold, the report’s authors wrote, results in an “increased risk of conservation failure and biological extinction.”
The target also roughly aligns with benchmarks set by planners of the first-ever managed wolf reintroduction program, undertaken by the USFWS in and around Yellowstone National Park beginning in 1995. Federal officials projected that the restoration effort would be successful if overall mortality could be limited to 20% to 10% from authorized killings of wolves due to livestock conflicts and another 10% from “natural causes, accidents, or illegal killing.”
The 1990s efforts near Yellowstone met or exceeded those expectations, successfully reestablishing sustainable wolf population in two different areas ahead of the predicted schedule of three to five years. In the Yellowstone area, 24 of 31 relocated wolves survived the program’s first two calendar years, along with 19 of 23 their pups, for a total mortality rate of 20%. In a parallel effort in central Idaho, wolves fared even better. Although no pups were born within the first year of reintroduction, 30 of 35 relocated individuals survived the program’s first 20 months, a 14% mortality rate.
CPW biologists will have a better understanding of the state of reintroduction once the number of pups born in Colorado in 2025 is confirmed. The agency says it’s monitoring four “potential dens” of breeding pairs.
But it’s clear now that Colorado’s restoration effort is falling short of the successes experienced in the northern Rockies in the 1990s: Including three deaths confirmed in 2024, eight of the state’s first 25 relocated wolves have died, a mortality rate of 32% — with more than half of calendar year 2025 left to go.
The state’s plan calls for winter releases of 10 to 15 wolves annually in the program’s first three to five years, with an initial target of a stable population of at least 50 animals within the state. Without a turnaround in survival rates and pup production, however, that timeline could be in jeopardy.
“CPW is developing plans for the coming year’s translocation efforts, so Colorado’s wolf population will continue to grow, leading toward a self-sustaining population,” the agency promised in a press release this week.

Facebook’s parent company Meta locked in 20 years of nuclear power on Tuesday from Constellation Energy to help meet the tech giant’s surging energy demand for artificial intelligence and its other power-intensive computing needs.
“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, said in a statement.
The agreement, which calls for Constellation to provide Meta with 1.1 gigawatts of power from its Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, is the latest in a slew of deals tying large tech companies to nuclear energy.
Google signed the first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors (SMRs) developed by Kairos Power in October. Amazon anchored a $500 million investment into X-energy Reactor Co.’s research and development of SMRs and is working with Dominion Energy to advance nuclear development in Virginia.
Microsoft entered into a power purchase agreement with Constellation in September to restart the energy company’s Three Mile Island nuclear unit in Pennsylvania. The 20-year deal is slated to contribute to Microsoft’s goal of matching the power its data centers use with carbon-free energy.
Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center, about 160 miles southwest of Chicago, was slated to close in 2017 after years of financial losses. But a zero-emission credit program saved the plant after legislation in Illinois provided financial support into mid-2027.
The agreement announced Tuesday with Meta takes effect in June 2027, when the state’s taxpayer credit program expires. It essentially replaces the credit program and ensures long-term operations of the plant without ratepayer support, according to Constellation.

“This partnership keeps Clinton at the forefront of clean energy while securing jobs and driving local growth,” said Illinois state Rep. Sally Turner, a Republican representing the 44th district, which includes Clinton. “It’s the kind of smart, private investment that strengthens communities without adding taxpayer burden.”
The Clinton power purchase agreement is set to preserve more than 1,000 local jobs and deliver $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the Baltimore-based energy company. Bobby Wendell, an official at a unit of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said in a statement that the agreement will deliver a “stable work environment” for workers at the plant.
The Energy Center generates enough clean electricity to power some 800,000 homes, according to Constellation. The deal with Meta will relicense and continue the operations in Clinton, while expanding its output by 30 megawatts from its current 1,121 megawatts. The financial details of the deal between Meta and Constellation were not disclosed.
The power purchase agreement comes as nuclear regains traction. Some see the energy source as an answer for the increasing power demands from data centers and AI as long as the technology can scale.
A coalition of large energy users like Amazon, Google, Dow and Meta pledged in March to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. Financial institutions like Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also endorsed the commitment for nuclear expansion.
Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said the deal with Meta ensures prior mistakes aren’t repeated by allowing a valuable energy plant to shut down as demand soars.
“Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards,” Dominguez said.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)It’s still unofficial, but with 89% of the vote in early returns there’s little doubt: Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy is likely the next county executive.
Braveboy, standing beside her parents, and sporting matching outfits with her boyfriend, Will Anderson, told a crowd of several hundred people at an election night watch party at SoBe Restaurant and Lounge in Seabrook that her victory represents unity for Maryland’s second-largest jurisdiction.
“This is the first time in a very long time that we have a united executive and legislative branch,” Braveboy, 50, said. “Everyone who has been elected to serve, we have all agreed that we are going to work together to serve you and not ourselves.”
One of the first priorities in the office, Braveboy said, is simply cleaning up the county.
“Your roadways, the trees that need to be trimmed, the hedges that need to be cut back, the grass that needs to be mowed,” she said. “I will prioritize that because this county should look as beautiful as the people in this room.”
According to election returns from the county’s special general election, as of 10:41 p.m. Tuesday night, the Democrat had received 27,505 or 89% of the votes, against her Republican opponent Jonathan White, who garnered 3,024, or 10%. There are still thousands of votes to count — more than 62,000 ballots had been cast by last Thursday in early voting — but Braveboy backers were confident declaring victory.
Among those to celebrate and congratulate Braveboy’s victory was Attorney General Anthony Brown (D), the first person to declare an early victory.
“We got a new leader in Prince George’s County,” Brown said. “We got a county executive who’s going to be focused on public safety, public education, public health and economic development opportunity. The people of Prince George’s County [have] spoken tonight.”

Some of the others to congratulate Braveboy included Del. Joseline Pena-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), County Council Chair Edward Burroughs III (D) and former Del. Darryl Barnes.
A few remarks even came from one of Braveboy’s special primary election opponents, At-Large Councilmember Calvin Hawkins.
“Most of you in this room, if not all of you, supported her to be the next county executive. I was one of those that thought I should be the county executive,” Hawkins said. “Aisha Braveboy, tonight belongs to you and Prince George’s County.”
Braveboy’s Republican opponent, White, 51, a retired Air Force veteran, said in an email less than five hours before the polls closed Tuesday that he sought the executive position because “people are tired of promises that never turn into progress.”
“I understand that Prince George’s County has long been a Democratic stronghold, and I respect the history and values that many residents associate with that affiliation,” he said. “But I believe voters are ready to look beyond party labels, especially when the issues affecting our communities are getting worse, not better.”
But the voters overwhelmingly chose Braveboy to fill out the remaining two-year term of former County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who stepped down in December to take her U.S. Senate seat.
Besides the voters, Braveboy had the state’s biggest cheerleader to back her: Gov. Wes Moore (D).
The state’s attorney won in a crowded special primary election among nine Democrats, including Hawkins, who was endorsed by Alsobrooks, and former County Executive Rushern L. Baker III, who had the endorsement of state treasurer and county resident Dereck Davis (D).
The county’s chief administrative officer, Tara H. Jackson, who has been acting county executive since Alsobrooks stepped down, chose not to seek the seat.
County Council seat
In terms of working with the County Council, three council members backed Braveboy’s candidacy: Burroughs, Vice Chair Krystal Oriadha and Councilmember Wala Blegay.
Voters in Tuesday’s special election also chose another Braveboy supporter for a council seat: former school board member Shayla Adams-Stafford, received 2,583, or 92% of the votes against GOP challenger Fred Price Jr., who received 189, or 7% of the votes in the special election for an open District 5 council seat.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Adams-Stafford will fill the seat vacated last year by Councilmember Jolene Ivey, who won an at-large seat and then briefly sought the Democratic nomination in the county executive race. She withdrew her candidacy, but still came in fourth place. By withdrawing, Ivey spared county residents the prospect of another special election for her at-large council seat.
Adams-Stafford will represent the area that includes Cheverly, Colmar Manor and Glenarden.
“We are in a challenging position when it comes to several of the large projects we were hoping would stay in the county,” Adams-Stafford said in an interview at SoBe Restaurant. “Having a unified voice, or a cohesive voice around these projects from members of the council and the county executive, I think that really helps our position when we’re looking outward to bring business here and to bring new ideas here.”
The county’s Board of Elections is scheduled to have votes certified by June 13. Swearing-in of the new county executive and new council member is scheduled for June 19, the federal holiday of Juneteenth, also observed by the state and county, when government offices will be closed.
Braveboy’s selection ends this year’s special primary and general elections that cost about $4.2 million, or $2.1 million each.
But her selection by voters won’t cost taxpayers anything because the county’s circuit court judges will select a replacement to serve out the remaining two years of her term.
One person interested in the state’s attorney position is County Councilmember Wanika Fisher (D), who worked as a prosecutor in the state’s attorney’s office in 2017 and then served as a state delegate from January 2019 to December 2022.
“You can’t live out your best dreams, or the things you want from your family or yourself or your business, without having safety and justice,” Fisher, who turns 37 this month, said in an interview Tuesday. “I really am excited to get my hands fully engaged in what that office has to do with when it comes to our criminal justice system and making sure that Prince Georgians are protected.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Aisha-Braveboy-and-parents-6-3-2025-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-06-04 06:07:29.356442

(LRC Public Information photo)A great darkness has descended upon the Democratic Party of Eastern Kentucky. All but banished from the hills and hollows they call home, Democrats are searching for a path to political relevancy that seems increasingly narrow and increasingly unlikely. 
Despite what seem to be some positives for Democrats, state Sen. Robin Webb — one of the longest serving Democrats in the Kentucky legislature — changed her party affiliation from Democrat to Republican. This comes even as  popular Democrat Andy Beshear is serving his second term as governor amid  talk that Eastern Kentuckian Rocky Adkins, a Beshear aide, could run to succeed him. Meanwhile, a bonafide Democratic challenger, Prestonsburg attorney Ned Pillersdorf, is considering a run against Republican U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers in the 5th Congressional District.
Webb is simply the latest in a long line of prominent Appalachian Democrats who have decided to join the swelling ranks of the Republican Party of Kentucky. Most of these conversions have been explained as a product of the Democratic Party no longer representing the values of the politician in question. More cynical political observers ascribe this mass exodus from the region’s ancestral party to simple self-preservation: long time politicians fearful of losing their preciously held jobs at the very heart of Trump country. 
Regardless of the reasons, these now common party switches are not a positive sign for the Democratic Party. Nor are they the only evidence that Appalachian Democrats should be worried. Despite Beshear’s relative success across Eastern Kentucky in the last gubernatorial election and the mounting number of enthusiastic liberal activists in the region, Democrats have failed to make significant headway of any kind in the region. A reality made all the more stark by Elliot County, Kentucky, breaking its 144 year support for the Democratic Party in the 2016 election for president.  
After 2024, an outside observer cannot help but conclude that all the fervor of local activities and all the efforts of a relatively popular governor do nothing to boost the chances of the Democratic Party in the Kentucky mountains. So is all hope for the Democratic Party lost in Appalachia? Is there simply no immediate future left for the party of Rocky Adkins in his native region? The short answer is “quite possibly.” Yet, as is often the case, the long answer is both more complex and more truthful. 
The long answer is that the situation is bad for Eastern Kentucky Democrats. Nor is any attempt to sugarcoat this fact with hopeful news coverage and opinion pieces likely to improve circumstances. To solve a problem requires first a frank admission of the facts as they are and not as anyone may wish them to be. From these hard realities, a solution may emerge and a path to two-party competition in the region becomes, if not likely, at least possible. 
First and foremost, Kentucky Democrats must admit that the average Appalachian voter does not trust the Democratic Party anymore. The brand has been greatly damaged and no blunder in the Trump administration is likely to provide a miracle realization among the populace that will change this fact. Voters in the region feel that the Democratic Party has abandoned them in favor of various ill fated social crusades that do little to better society and certainly have done little to solve the great troubles that plague the Appalachian mountains. 
As an obvious consequence of this, Appalachian Democrats simply must give up any and all attempts to appeal to voters through the methods and messages of the national Democratic Party. There should be no more attacks in Johnson County by the Kentucky Democratic Party chairman on Republican attempts to end deeply unpopular D.E.I. programs. Democratic officials should also acknowledge that abortion and LGBTQ issues are simply not the cross to die on in a largely conservative region. Nor should the party persist in its continued and constant veiled attacks upon a president whose popularity remains rock solid across the region. 
Instead, Democrats should focus on their historic strength in the region — the economy. They should offer solutions to the housing and jobs crises that face Eastern Kentucky. They should make “putting Eastern Kentucky back to work” and other local issues the heart of their message. As Republicans tie themselves to the newly popular national party,  they should break free from Harris and Schumer to develop a uniquely Appalachian brand of liberal economics. The social liberalism can be left to Louisville and Lexington. 
Second, Appalachian Democrats must face the reality of a changed Appalachia and party system. Union voters once formed the heart of the Democratic Party in the region. However, many of these voters feel that Democratic policies undercut their jobs and have hollowed out the unions. Whether this is true or not is beside the point; it is how voters feel and Democrats must acknowledge that older working class miners are unlikely to be the backbone of their party, though they should of course continue to angle for their support. 
Instead, Democrats should target those in the region who tend to be most skeptical of Trump and the policies of the newly constituted Republican party — public school teachers, small business owners, and the young. Though most of these groups have historically voted Republican, things are changing in this country and seizing upon this reality is to the advantage of Eastern Kentucky Democrats. 
All of this advice is not given to “save” the state from the Republican Party or because I fear the Democrats are the only avenue to creating a better commonwealth. This advice is not even offered by someone who is currently a member of the Democratic Party. Instead, I offer this frank counsel because as a citizen and political scientist, I understand that both parties are strongest when they are faced with a formidable and influential opposition. Iron sharpens iron, and two party competition creates the best sort of policy. Kentucky is very close to losing this vital check on political authority — that is, unless rural Democrats step up their game.

As budget talks heat up in Washington, Southside Richmond resident Dana Wyatt is bracing for impact. After years of waiting for a housing choice voucher — a federally-funded program that operates like a rent coupon for qualifying tenants —  she now fears she could lose it and once again become rent-burdened. 
This is because a series of White House budget requests sent to Congress in May proposes deep cuts for housing programs that Virginia has long relied on to help struggling renters, first-time homebuyers, and those who are unhoused and in need of shelter. Federal housing funds also support organizations that fight housing discrimination. 
“It’s like a smack in the face,” Wyatt said.
Even after finally receiving her voucher last year, Wyatt found it didn’t offer much “choice” at all. She said multiple landlords turned her away, highlighting what she called the irony of the program’s name.  Her case is now being investigated by Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME), a Richmond-based housing advocacy organization. 
She worries not just for herself, but for others who could lose critical safety nets if the federal government slashes its housing support to state and local agencies. 
That’s a concern that U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, plans to raise with her congressional colleagues. 
If enacted, the Trump administration’s budget would eliminate or reduce funding streams from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including Community Development Block Grants, the Fair Housing Initiative Program, and the vouchers that people like Wyatt depend on. 
The housing cuts are among other proposed changes to federal agencies like HUD, as Congress also explores cuts to Medicaid — which supports health insurance for low-income and disabled residents. The wishes from the White House are part of President Donald Trump’s plan to reduce taxes across all income levels. 
McClellan emphasized that while Trump and his Republican allies in Congress may celebrate the tax cuts for the “wealthiest few at the federal level,” states and localities will be forced to make up for lost federal funds — often by raising taxes themselves. 
“It’s all just going to flow downhill,” McClellan said. “States and localities are going to have to raise taxes.”
The budget proposals are moving on parallel tracks in Congress. While Trump’s “big beautiful bill” —  a reconciliation package that includes Medicaid cuts — has passed the House and awaits Senate deliberation, his formal request, which includes housing aid cuts, is already under review in the Senate. 
During his 2024 reelection campaign, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, a sweeping policy blueprint published by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Still, the Foundation had praised  Trump’s first-term record and many of the current budget proposals mirror the project’s recommendations. 
Chapter 15 of the project, which focuses on housing, calls for  Congress to “consider a wholesale overhaul of HUD that contemplates devolving many HUD functions to states and localities with any remaining federal functions consolidated to other federal agencies.”
Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME) spokesman Lance Warren called the requests from the Trump administration a “radical reshaping of the social safety net.”
In practical terms, Warren said, it would leave localities holding the bag on “promises made” — from vouchers and downpayment assistance to homelessness services. 
“The federal government is pulling the rug out from communities like ours even as they claim to be setting the table,” he said.
 What HUD helps with in Virginia

Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, and Virginia Housing Alliance Policy Director Isabel McClain discuss policy in McClellan’s district office in Richmond on June 2, 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)
Nearly 200,000 homes in Virginia receive some form of support from HUD, according to an analysis from the Virginia Housing Alliance. About 50,000 of those residents use vouchers like Wyatt’s. 
Beyond programs for renters or first-time homebuyers, localities in Virginia also rely on federal funding to meet the temporary housing needs of residents.  Nearly 6,000 Virginians receive housing and support in HUD-funded shelters. In the 2024 fiscal year, HUD allocated nearly $60 million for homelessness services in Virginia, while the state contributed about $30 million.
Other streams of federal housing funding also enable housing organizations to work with vulnerable populations. Thomas Okuda Fitzpatrick, director of HOME, expressed concerns about the long-term viability of some of them.
“HOME will be around to fight the fight, but we have partners around the country that are unsure what their outcomes are going to look like,” he said. 
To offset the $550,000 cut his organization is facing, Fitzpatrick explained that HOME has scaled back some office operations to trim costs. 
Laura Dobbs, a policy director with HOME, also shared anecdotes of clients served by the organization — assistance that could be jeopardized for others like them if HUD cuts come to fruition. For instance, she explained how HOME and Commonwealth Catholic Charities advocated for an unhoused military veteran who had been denied housing vouchers. From sleeping in a tent behind a movie theater to his legal battle to obtain a voucher, he’s now celebrating a year living in his Richmond apartment, Dobbs said. 
Likewise, a Community Development Block Grant supported a fund through HOME that helped with downpayment assistance for a Black first-time home owner. Reports have indicated disparities in homeownership for people of color due to a variety of factors, including the lingering impact of historically racist housing policies. Though the individual was able to afford her monthly mortgage payments, the upfront cost required to purchase a home had been a barrier until she was able to access down payment assistance through HOME. 
This is because HOME’s Investment Partnership program both supports first-time homebuyers and  localities’ efforts to build or preserve affordable housing units. Localities also utilize Community Development Block Grants for a variety of infrastructure projects, ranging from maintaining existing public housing units to creating other types of affordable housing.
 What could happen if cuts are enacted?

While federal lawmakers like McClellan continue to push for or against the Trump administration’s proposed funding cuts, Virginia’s state lawmakers are bracing for the potential fallout. 
Last month, Gov. Glenn Youngkin carved out $900 million from Virginia’s budget surplus as a “cushion” for uncertainties at the federal level. Meanwhile, members of the legislature’s appropriations committees have pondered whether they will need to reconvene for a special session later this year to address federal funding shortfalls — or if those issues will dominate the 2026 legislative session.
It’s possible lawmakers will focus on how to allocate the surplus Youngking withheld during negotiations over the most recent state budget. 
A member of the House of Delegates Appropriations committee, Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, is working to determine what he and his colleagues might need to address. 
“What’s troubling is that even before this potential cut was announced, we were in a housing crisis at all levels,” he added. 
Though local governments have direct influence over housing supply and affordability through tools like zoning codes and development approvals, state lawmakers from both parties have explored what levers they can pull to support or encourage local efforts. Many of those proposals, however, did not survive this legislative session — either failing in committee or falling to Youngkin’s veto pen. 
Wyatt, the Richmond resident, is flustered by the proposal from the White House but remains hopeful that her state and local officials can keep their promises to constituents like herself. 
“I just hope that everything turns out okay,” she said.

Rare is the time when a state legislator – through the power of his own personal, painful narrative – changes the minds of colleagues.
Jerrauld C. Jones, given that platform on the floor of the Virginia House of Delegates in January 1999 as he discussed the Confederate battle flag, displayed an oratory so gut-wrenching, so authentic, that he swayed opposing delegates to his side. There’s nothing I can compare it to in the General Assembly since that moment.
Jones, a 70-year-old Norfolk native and son of civil rights attorney Hilary H. Jones, died Saturday. Today, he will be memorialized. 
I don’t mean to lessen his sterling lifetime of achievements – including being among the first Black students to integrate Ingleside Elementary School in 1961.
He later earned bachelor’s and law degrees. In addition to being a state delegate from 1988 to 2002 representing the state’s 89th District anchored in his hometown, he later directed the state Department of Juvenile Justice. He then was appointed a juvenile and domestic relations court judge, and then a circuit court judge. He retired from the latter post last year because of health problems.
That moment in 1999, though, was an inflection point in his career. People across the commonwealth unfamiliar with his background and determination were introduced to him in a dramatic way.
(Full disclosure: Jones’ wife, Lyn Simmons, and son, Jay Jones, and I have long attended the same Catholic church in Norfolk. Simmons is a juvenile and domestic relations district judge, and Jay Jones is a former delegate and current Democratic candidate for state attorney general.)

I was an editorial writer at the (Newport News) Daily Press in 1999. I remember seeing television accounts of Jerrauld Jones’ speech as he explained why Virginia shouldn’t give its imprimatur by placing the Confederate flag on state license plates.
I couldn’t find footage of Jones’ impassioned comments that day; a House of Delegates official told me video archives don’t go back to 1999. News articles can’t truly capture Jones’ gripping explanation of how – for African Americans – the flag represented fear, intimidation and white supremacy.
 But those news stories will have to do:
The Sons of Confederate Veterans had wanted the flag symbol on a specialty license plate. Jones, a Norfolk Democrat and head of the legislative Black caucus, relayed his first memory of the flag to colleagues. When he was just 6, returning with other Black children and their parents from a field trip, they saw the flag being waved in a field next to a burning cross at a Ku Klux Klan rally,  The Washington Post reported.
“The fear in that bus was so great you could smell it,” said Jones. “I saw the stark fear in my mother’s face as she looked out that window. … All we could do was hope and pray that we would not be molested because of that symbol of hate and violence.”
A year later, he and his brother attempted to enroll at Ingleside Elementary School. “We not only were told, ‘Ni–er stay out, ni–er go home’ – that we would dare try to integrate their schools – but we were greeted with waving Confederate flags,” he said.
And later, he brought his point home: “And now, some want to put that symbol of pain on the cars of Virginia.”
The Post noted that when Jones rose to speak, many delegates were paying their usual scant attention to business. By the time Jones was halfway through his 20-minute teachable moment, though, “a respectful silence had settled over the room.”
The House approved by voice vote an amendment allowing the words “Sons of Confederate Veterans” on the plate, but not the logo. Jones later received hate mail, and the SCV went to federal court to restore the flag.
No matter: Jones’ courage, persuasiveness and representation of African Americans were on full display that day a little more than a quarter-century ago. That incident was a microcosm of his lifetime of leadership and service.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called attention to the memo from the State Budget Office Wednesday, estimating the losses anticipated for Michigan. The Republican-championed spending bill cleared the U.S. House in May, with Whitmer warning in a news release that if the bill, backed by President Donald Trump, makes it through the U.S. Senate, 42 million Americans who rely on food assistance could go hungry.
“No one should go to bed hungry in Michigan or anywhere in [the] wealthiest, most powerful country in the world,” Whitmer said in the news release Wednesday. “In Michigan, we will fight to make sure our kids and families are fed, but we need Republicans in our congressional delegation to step up for their own constituents who need SNAP and Medicaid to survive. If these cuts are signed into law, more Michiganders will go to bed with a pit in their stomach. That’s unacceptable.” 
The memo from the State Budget Office, or SBO, says it reviewed the potential impacts of the cuts with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, or MDHHS and found that it was unlikely that the state could backfill the impacted food assistance programs without devastating education, public safety and Medicaid spending.
About 15% of Michigan’s population, or nearly 1.5 million residents, rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which is on Congress’ chopping block, the SBO memo said. More than 59% of the state’s SNAP recipients are families with children and nearly half of state recipients are for working families.
Members of the food insecurity, religious and other equity groups joined in chorus, offering statements of condemnation for the proposed cuts to food insecurity programming in the Wednesday news release from Whitmer’s office.
The federal plan is “cruel and unconscionable”, Pastor Richard R. White III, President of the Council of Baptist Pastors of Detroit & Vicinity, said in a statement.
“These cuts will rip vital support away from countless Michiganders—children, seniors, working families, and the most vulnerable among us—at a time when they need it most. For those we serve, who already struggle to put food on the table, this is not just a policy decision—it is a moral failure,” White said in the statement. “This decision is a direct assault on the dignity and survival of millions of Americans. We call on all people of conscience to oppose these cuts and demand policies that uplift, not abandon, those most in need.” 
More than 39% of SNAP recipients have family members who are elderly or living with a disability and more than half a million of Michigan’s children receive SNAP benefits, according to the SBO.
Food pantries and food banks in Michigan will see even higher demand for nutrition assistance than what they already struggle to serve, representatives of Feeding America West Michigan and Kalamazoo Loaves and Fishes said in the governor’s news release.
“Many are already facing higher costs at the grocery store, along with the growing price of housing, childcare, and healthcare. More families will be skipping meals, falling behind on rent, and giving up other essentials to try and make ends meet,” Kalamazoo Loaves & Fishes said in a statement.

Among the most important public policy developments in North Carolina over the last several decades was the rise of one of the nation’s strongest networks of consumer advocacy nonprofits.
Together with elected leaders from both major parties, these advocates helped make North Carolina a state to avoid for predatory lenders who target consumers with high interest loans and fees and abusive collection tactics.
Indeed, the successes in this area were so numerous that following the Great Recession, they helped inspire the establishment of a federal government agency known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Unfortunately, as you might expect, laws and lawyers that target scammers and predators are anathema to President Trump, and he and Republicans in the U.S. House are working hard to gut or abolish the agency.
The bottom line: Last week, a coalition of activists and small business owners pleaded with Senator Thom Tillis to help protect the agency. Their simple message: stand with the people of North Carolina, not the billionaires. Let’s fervently hope he was listening.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Thursday brings a major deadline: the final day in which the House and Senate can pass remaining legislation. And Republicans in both chambers will be pushing to achieve a long-sought priority and finally approve a “parental bill of rights.” 
In past years, those votes have failed, often defeated by a handful of votes in the House. This week, the House and the Senate are considering two separate bills: House Bill 10 and Senate Bill 72. Each looks slightly different from past versions. 
Here’s what to know. 
What are the bills intended to do?
Supporters of the bills say they are meant to give parents a toolkit to assert control over their child’s education in public schools. The laws outline a number of rights the parents have over that education. 
Many of those rights already exist in law, such as the right for a parent to choose whether to send their child to a charter school, private school, or to home school them; to learn about school disciplinary procedures and class curriculum; to opt their child out of sex education courses by providing alternative instruction; to receive a report card; to review medical records; and to exempt their child from immunization with a doctor’s note or because of religious beliefs. 
Other provisions of the bills would be new. School boards would be required to develop policies to promote parental involvement in school around homework, attendance, and discipline. They would also be required to pass policies making it easy for parents to examine instructional materials and to withdraw their child from any lesson or material being taught. 
And the bills would clarify in law that “no school may infringe on the fundamental rights of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, health care, and mental health of his or her minor child.” 
But the legislation has inspired fierce pushback from teachers and LGBTQ groups, who say it puts too many burdens on teachers and staff, and that it could force them to divulge to parents details about students’ sexual orientation or gender identity against the students’ will.
Do this year’s bills require teachers to tell parents about a student’s sexual orientation or gender identity?
Unlike past attempts at a parental bill of rights, this year’s bills do not explicitly require school staff and teachers to divulge to inquiring parents details about their child’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Some bills in the past have included that explicit language, sparking opposition from LGBTQ rights groups and driving some Republicans to vote against them on the House floor. 
But this year’s versions of the legislation do include a catch-all phrase that opponents argue achieves a similar result.
Language in a floor amendment to SB 72 expected to be brought forward by House Speaker Sherman Packard Thursday provides parents the right to “inquire of the school or school personnel and promptly receive accurate, truthful, and complete disclosure regarding any and all matters related to their minor child, unless an immediate answer cannot be provided when the initial request is made.” If an immediate answer is not available, the school employee must provide one within 10 business days. 
The bill provides an exception to providing the information if there is a “compelling state interest” against doing so, and it defines that interest as “an actual and objectively reasonable belief, supported by clear and convincing evidence, that the infringement upon parental rights is necessary to prevent the child from being abused,” under the state’s abuse laws.
HB 10 includes similar language.
Republicans say the requirement is necessary to prevent teachers from withholding information from parents and to allow parents full information about their children. Democrats and LGBTQ advocates say the requirement that the disclosure “complete” could be difficult to follow, and that the standard that must be met to constitute a fear of abuse, “clear and convincing,” is too high to meet in most situations.
How would the bills affect health care services for students?
While Republicans broadly support the parental bill of rights, they have disagreed over one key area: medical care for students. 
A version of SB 72 recommended by the House Children and Family Law Committee would have included language requiring parents to consent in writing before any biometric scans are conducted by a medical provider on a child, or before any DNA or blood is drawn. That version would also give parents the right “to make health care decisions unless otherwise provided by law” and “to be physically present at any health care facility providing care.”
However, Democrats and advocates had raised concerns that the medical provisions would violate teenagers’ health care and reproductive rights by impeding their ability to receive birth control and pre- and post-natal care without getting parental permission. And House Republican leadership appears aware: The floor amendment from Packard expected to be introduced on Thursday would strike those parental medical rights from the final bill. 
Meanwhile, both of this year’s House and Senate versions of the bills include language to protect confidential conversations between children and counselors. Both bills protect school counselors, psychologists, nurses, or other health care providers from being required to disclose information about children to parents that “was reasonably expected to be privileged.” 
What could be the consequences of noncompliance for schools or teachers? 
Past parental bill of rights legislation has made teachers personally accountable for failing to follow the law, in some cases opening teachers up to litigation or potential disciplinary action by the State Board of Education against their license. But this year, the House and Senate bills do not include direct consequences for teachers.
The bills do provide that a parent who claims a violation may sue the school district for injunctive relief or for damages. 
What should be expected on Thursday?
In their current versions, the two bills up for a vote Thursday — HB 10 in the Senate and SB 72 in the House — are largely identical. Both bills include parental rights over medical care that have attracted debate. 
But Packard’s floor amendment, which removes those medical rights, would make SB 72 more moderate, and potentially more palatable for Gov. Kelly Ayotte to sign. 
Should the House Republican caucus vote to pass that floor amendment, as well as the underlying bill, SB 72 would return to the Senate, which would decide next week whether to accept the moderating changes and send the bill to Ayotte. 
But if conservative-leaning House Republicans join with Democrats to reject the floor amendment, SB 72 and HB 10 could head to the governor’s office in their most robust form yet.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P2203005-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 06:07:29.356442

(Screenshot from NCGA video feed)Back in Raleigh after a weeklong break, North Carolina lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a bill that changes how the state oversees its investments.
House Bill 506 would create a five-person board to oversee the state’s $127 billion pension fund. It marks an expansion of a responsibility currently held solely by the state treasurer.
The House unanimously agreed to the Senate’s changes to the bill Tuesday, sending it to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk. Stein, a Democrat, has said he supports the measure; so has Treasurer Brad Briner, a Republican. It received bipartisan support from lawmakers.
Four of the five members of the board would be appointees. Two will be appointed by the heads of the House and Senate. Stein and Briner will also appoint one member each; their appointees would be subject to approval of the legislature.
Members of the board will serve staggered six-year terms. They must have “expert knowledge of investments” and a minimum decade of experience in the field.
The bill is one of multiple attempts by lawmakers to reform the state pension fund. The system has a $16 billion deficit, Briner has told lawmakers. Another bill, also backed by Briner, would allow the state to invest up to 5% of the pension fund in digital cryptocurrencies.

Utah is among several Western states seeking to reduce federal land ownership. (Photo by Utah News Dispatch)Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
The ‘balance sheet’
In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.

Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”

Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
Housing arguments
The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
Trump wants to log more trees. He’ll need states’ help.

In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”

Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
The costs of management
In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
Western states’ budgets, industries rely on federal lands. So does wildlife.

“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)After a campaign promise to bring in outsized federal dollars for Maine, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins won reelection during Trump’s first term, overcoming a record amount of spending against her and defying public polls. At the start of the president’s second term, Collins rose to the helm of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the first time a Mainer has chaired one of the upper chamber’s most powerful committees in 92 years.
However, Maine’s longest-serving member of Congress has reached this pinnacle of authority as President Donald Trump is attempting to flip the system on its head. His administration, by Collins’ own admission, has unjustly rescinded congressionally appropriated funds, at times singling out Maine in what are widely considered retaliatory actions over the state’s defiance of his executive order rolling back transgender rights.
During Trump’s second term so far, Collins, a Republican, has bucked the executive periodically, particularly with attempts to rein in tariffs by reasserting congressional control and voting against a budget framework passed by the Senate in April because of possible cuts to Medicaid, the state-federal health program for low-income people and some people with disabilities. Though, in the budget currently being considered, she is supportive of adding work requirements to limit Medicaid eligibility.
Some of her constituents want to see more public pushback.
“I focus on results, not rhetoric,” Collins said in an interview. “My goal is not to get on Fox News and MSNBC and rant and rave.”
Outlining her strategy for Maine Morning Star, Collins said she’s had success restoring some funding largely due to conversations outside of public view, relying on her long-developed relationships.
“It is far more effective for me to, for example, restore the funding that the administration wants to cut for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, LIHEAP, which is so important to the state of Maine, than it is to go make a fiery speech to anywhere that doesn’t result in any change,” Collins said.
But some constituents argue a piecemeal approach to restoring funds will ultimately be ineffective as overall democratic checks and balances are tested.
Collins’ public use of power
During Trump’s first few weeks back in office, Collins said she hoped the courts would side with Congress if the president’s attempts to control spending were litigated.
Now, with numerous cases in the courts, Collins said, “some of the actions taken by the administration have and will be overturned in court, and others Congress will overturn through the appropriations process.”
She added, “When I disagree with the actions of the administration, I have not hesitated to intervene.”
Collins said she consulted with the Trump administration in order to restore the U.S. Department of Agriculture grants to the University of Maine, renegotiate the Maine Sea Grant, secure an exception to the hiring freeze at Acadia National Park and reverse the cancellation of a decades-old program that allows parents to register their newborns for a Social Security number while at hospitals. Though Collins’ spokesperson told Maine Morning Star that Social Security Administration Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek told the senator it was an error but reporting later revealed that he deliberately sought to punish Maine after Gov. Janet Mills’ heated exchange with Trump over the state’s transgender protections.
But some Maine voters argue Collins should be using her seniority — as the seventh most senior member of the Senate and the most senior Republican woman — for more than piecemeal fixes.
Falmouth resident Anne Scheer — who carried a sign during a Tax Day protest in Augusta that read “Where’s Susan?” — said she wants the senator to rally her caucus to stand up for democracy, adding that she doesn’t think that has to be an anti-Trump message.
“She needs to talk with her fellow Republicans and say, ‘This is enough,’” Scheer said.
Cape Elizabeth resident Jerry Kaufman, an independent who protested against Collins in Biddeford in April, said he’d vote for Collins if she could convince her colleagues to confront the president to say “stop the foolishness.”
“Show some leadership and bring some people along with you,” Kaufman said.
At that same protest, Biddeford resident Anthony Burgess, a registered Democrat who voted for Collins once in 2014, criticized her statements of concern and disappointment about some of the Trump administration’s actions as lacking conviction.
He said independent U.S. Sen. Angus King’s attendance at the “Hands Off” rally in Portland in April demonstrated for him a refusal to cow to Trump.
“Her vote is the mechanism of government but she has a platform that she could be speaking from,” Burgess said.
When asked what her response is to those who say she should be doing more to ensure the separation of powers remains, Collins pointed to her questioning officials in subcommittee hearings.
One main purpose of subcommittees is to hold hearings on spending proposals during which members can directly question agency heads. Collins has questioned several, including U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the proposed elimination of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
“We’re actually holding these subcommittee hearings at a breakneck pace to evaluate spending requests and reductions, as well as to assess compliance with congressional intent and enacted laws,” Collins said.

Exercising private influence
However, Collins said the public does not see what she feels is her most efficient tactic.
“My goal is to get things fixed and to get problems solved, and I do that through the federal hearings where I’m laying the foundation for restoration of the cuts in biomedical research, which is an extraordinarily high priority for me,” Collins said, as an example. “But also I do it privately by calling up Cabinet members.”
Collins said she is so far largely approaching her qualms with the administration through these one-on-one conversations.
This tactic has burned her at times in the past, notably when Collins voted for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after she said he gave her private assurances he wasn’t a threat to Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion ruling that he later voted to overturn.
More recently, ahead of the deadline to avoid a government shutdown, Collins said she started texting with Trump’s billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency. That outreach does not appear to have gone as planned, at least for the immediate outcome.
While Collins initially said she was “absolutely” opposed to a full-year stop gap approach, she told Politico that Republican leaders instructed her to start writing a plan for that approach anyway. The version that passed, drafted by House GOP leadership, was ultimately pushed through with limited input from spending leaders of either chamber.
But in other cases, she’s touted success that she’s had with these conversations that happen behind closed doors, such as with the restoration of the USDA funding and renegotiation of the Maine Sea Grant.
“Because I have these relationships with the president’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and with Cabinet members, I have been able to restore funding that was in jeopardy,” Collins said.
Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine, sees this as a strength unique to Collins.
“Given that she’s the only Republican member of the current Maine delegation and she’s the only person with a committee chair, I think she’s better positioned to have those communications than any of the other members,” Brewer said.
But while Collins sees these behind-the-scenes negotiations as the most effective way to restore funding that, as she puts it, has been arbitrarily and unfairly cut from Maine, when it comes to attempts to gut entire programs, “that’s going to take legislation,” she said.
Republicans’ ‘big, beautiful bill’
The sprawling budget bill is the main vehicle where such attempts are currently being made.
Cokie Giles, a registered nurse at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, protested with National Nurses United outside Collins’ office in Portland in March to demand the senator oppose the possible cuts to Medicaid in the budget.
While Collins often talks about her ability to work across the aisle, Giles said, “Well, work on your own side, and don’t let these cuts go through.”
After Collins, citing concerns about possible Medicaid cuts, was one of two Senate Republicans to vote against the budget framework that the chamber passed in early April, Giles told Maine Morning Star she was pleased but not confident the senator’s opposition would remain as budget debates continues, nor that her vote would make a difference in the end.
Late last month, the U.S. House narrowly approved the massive tax and spending plan. The legislation now heads to the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are expected to rewrite much of it, now taking into consideration the more detailed budget plan Trump released on Friday. The bill will then have to head back to the House for final approval, with a goal to get it to the president’s desk by the Fourth of July.
As passed by the House, the 1,116-page package combines 11 bills. Among its many components, the current plan would overhaul Medicaid, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years under the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.

Collins did not provide specific red lines that would lead her to not support the budget package, but she described Medicaid as critically important for Maine’s health care system and a vital resource for many seniors, low-income families, disabled patients and those who cannot work. She told Maine Morning Star she “cannot support proposals that would create more duress for our hospitals and providers that are already teetering on the edge of insolvency.”
However, Collins is supportive of placing further limits on program eligibility, specifically “work requirements for able-bodied men and women who are capable of working and do not have obligations that preclude them from participating in the workforce,” she said.
As passed by the House, people who are between the ages of 19 and 65 would be required to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month to be eligible. The language has numerous exceptions, including for pregnant people, parents of dependent children and people who have complex medical conditions, among others.
Under these requirements, 34,000 Mainers would be expected to lose their Medicaid coverage, reducing federal funding by $215 million, according to the progressive Maine Center for Economic Policy.
Maine Gov. Janet Mills warned in a radio address on Friday about these cuts, as well as others that would limit access to the Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces.
“If you receive health care through MaineCare or CoverME.gov, which is the Affordable Care Act, I encourage you to contact Members of Congress to share what that coverage means to you,” Mills said. “They need to hear your story.”
Some shared their stories at a protest against Collins organized by the Maine Democratic Party in Bangor on Saturday, which drew almost 200 attendees who demanded the senator block the health care and other program cuts in the budget.
“In 2020, [Collins] told us that her seniority would protect us, that chairing Appropriations would give her the power to defend Maine’s interests,” said Shawn Yardley. “Her party now controls the White House and both chambers of Congress, but the cuts and the cruelty keep coming.”
While Collins emphasized some possible future impacts on MaineCare at the federal level, she said, “the state has not been perfect on this issue.” The senator called out the Maine Legislature for being unable to reach a compromise on its state budget.
“The state is holding up more than $100 million in emergency supplemental funding that would draw down nearly $400 million federal funds,” Collins said.
Maine Senate Republicans held out their support for the supplemental budget plan, and later the two-year budget, because they’d wanted it to include structural reform to Medicaid — notably the work requirements Collins is supportive of adding on the federal level.
Last month, the Maine House failed to secure enough support to get the now already allocated Medicaid funding out sooner. Some Republicans, though not ultimately enough for passage, supported that effort, arguing the state needs to pay its bills owed to providers, but others called it a blank check they wouldn’t sign.
With Maine hospitals already struggling to keep services available, state groups are calling on Collins in particular to reject federal health care cuts as well as cuts to childcare and food assistance in a digital ad campaign launched this week by Family Values @ Work Action, a national network of state and local coalitions aimed at promoting family-friendly workplace policies.
“This package takes food and medicine from the mouths of Maine families to fund tax cuts for the wealthy,” Destie Hohman Sprague, executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby, said in a statement on Monday.
Among many other components, the federal budget bill proposes cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, through expanded work requirements and shifting some program costs to state governments. Maine would also lose federal matching funds as a penalty for providing coverage to some immigrant populations.
The budget plan would also raise the debt limit by $4 trillion.
“We have an enormous deficit and debt,” Collins said, “and we do need to evaluate programs.”
As the Senate negotiates what to keep and do away with in the “big, beautiful bill” that represents the heart of Trump’s domestic agenda, how Maine’s senior senator chooses to use her influence, whether in public or not, will be put to the test.

A new state law aimed at expanding gas and nuclear power plants in Ohio may also provide opportunities for solar developers — if they can overcome other policy and political barriers.


Solar industry advocates say House Bill 15, signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in mid-May, contains several technology-neutral provisions that could benefit clean energy projects, including property tax breaks for siting them on brownfields and former coal mines. The law also loosens restrictions on behind-the-meter electricity generation and lowers the overall tax burden for new power plants.


“This is just smart economic development. We need the energy,” said Michael Benson, board president of Green Energy Ohio, whose members include a variety of clean energy companies. In his view, a market-based approach should work in favor of renewables and battery storage, which can generally be deployed more quickly and cheaply than power plants that burn fossil fuels.


Much of the public discussion around the legislation focused on its repeal of coal plant subsidies mandated by HB 6, the 2019 law at the heart of Ohio’s ongoing public corruption scandal. HB 15 also will end the use of ​“electric security plans,” which let utilities add special charges to customer bills without reviewing all revenue and expenses in a full rate case.


But many of the measures in HB 15 are meant to encourage new electricity production in the state.


“We should open the market to dispatchable energy generation to address future energy shortages,” the bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Roy Klopfenstein (R-Haviland), said in his February testimony, in which he also noted growing energy demand from data centers and other large electricity users, and energy supply issues raised by grid operator PJM Interconnection. The term ​“dispatchable” is often used to refer to power plants that can be turned on or off as demand requires, as opposed to solar or wind without battery backup.


Most of the law’s incentives for new energy production are technology-neutral, however.


Under HB 15, new electricity production on brownfields and minelands designated as priority investment areas will be exempt from property taxes for five years. Grants of up to $10 million each will be available to clean up or prepare the sites for construction. And the Ohio Power Siting Board will speed up its review of energy projects in those areas.


“It’s a huge opportunity,” said Rebecca Mellino, a climate and energy policy associate for The Nature Conservancy in Ohio. Last year the organization estimated that Ohio has more than 600,000 acres of minelands and brownfields suitable for renewable energy production. The sites often have good access to roads and transmission lines, too.


As Mellino sees it, solar in priority areas would avoid objections raised by some people about displacing farmland. And counties with renewable energy bans could presumably modify them to allow development in priority investment areas without affecting other parts of their jurisdictions, she suggested.


The law also removes a restriction that has required behind-the-meter generation to be located on the premises of the customer who is using the power. The change might allow data centers to tap into gas-fired backup generators on an adjacent property, for example. But it could also create new opportunities for clean energy-powered microgrids, in which a group of customers share solar panels and a large battery.


“That is significant, all by itself,” because it provides more flexibility, said Dylan Borchers, an energy attorney with law firm Bricker Graydon in Columbus, Ohio. Just as importantly, the law ​“allows essentially a portfolio approach for customers and energy resources.”

In other words, multiple businesses could form a shared ​“self-power” system with equipment for electricity generation or battery storage on adjacent land or on premises controlled by one or more of them. Such a system could include numerous generation or storage facilities, allowing a cluster of data centers, factories, or other large energy users to combine multiple behind-the-meter resources, whether they be natural gas, solar, batteries, or small nuclear when it becomes available.


The ability to combine resources means customers wouldn’t necessarily need lots of land to add renewable energy, said Benson. ​“If you want the most power quickly and cleanly, you can use rooftops and parking lots and build out a lot of small-scale generation.”


The law also reduces the overall tax burden for new electricity production. Local governments may collect less revenue but still welcome the jobs and other spending that come with new energy investments. And less stringent requirements might even benefit some communities when new power generation is sited, Borchers suggested.


Ohio’s current tangible personal property tax rates have been so high that companies have often used ​“payments in lieu of taxes,” also known as PILOT programs, to avoid getting walloped by huge tax bills as soon as energy production starts. But counties face somewhat strict requirements for how they must allocate PILOT payments. Developers that take advantage of the lower tax rates available under HB 15 may have more financial flexibility to be able to fund some projects that local governments want most, such as a new fire station or community center, Borchers said.


Taken together, the provisions in HB 15 promise to make it easier to build more solar in the state, industry representatives say.


The governor and legislature saw ​“the urgent need to expand energy generation as Ohio confronts rapidly increasing demand and the threat of escalating costs and supply shortages,” said Will Hinman, executive director for the Utility Scale Solar Energy Coalition of Ohio. ​“House Bill 15 is a critical step towards addressing these challenges by reducing barriers to energy development — including utility-scale solar projects.”


 Ohio is still not a level playing field for clean energy

The law still requires projects to meet multiple criteria to benefit from its provisions. For example, power-generating facilities and transmission lines exceeding certain thresholds may need approval from the Ohio Power Siting Board. The state’s director of development must approve local governments’ designations of priority investment areas. And self-power systems have to be independent of the main power grid.


The biggest downside is that the new law left in place a 2021 statute, Senate Bill 52, which requires utility-scale renewable energy developments to get local approval, said Molly Bryden, a climate and sustainability researcher with think tank Policy Matters Ohio.


Under that earlier law, 34 of Ohio’s 88 counties have banned new solar generation in all or part of their territories. Even where the local law doesn’t bar a new project, local officials can still block projects before a developer even seeks a permit from the Ohio Power Siting Board. A county representative and a township representative also get to vote with state siting board members on whether facilities get a permit, even for some projects that were in the grid operator’s queue before the 2021 law.


Another law took effect in early 2023, letting local governments limit small solar and wind projects that connect to the grid but don’t otherwise fall within the scope of the 2021 law.


Requirements of the 2021 and 2023 laws don’t apply to generation fueled by natural gas, coal, or nuclear power. And Ohio’s high court has ruled local governments can’t ban or regulate gas wells and related infrastructure or even enforce broader zoning laws that would prevent such development.


Lawmakers also cut out provisions from an earlier version of HB 15 that would have allowed community solar development. Community solar lets residential customers save money by sharing the electricity from a local solar array, which doesn’t have to be on their own property.


“There’s still a real need for permitting reform,” Bryden said.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)The U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a list of “sanctuary jurisdictions” — a term for towns and cities that have policies hindering local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials — that included Lebanon and Hanover Thursday, but by the end of the weekend, it had pulled that list offline.
In unveiling the list (which has been archived online by third parties), DHS demanded Lebanon and Hanover, as well as communities in 34 other states and Washington D.C., revise their policies. The list was mandated by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in April requiring DHS to produce and publicize such a list.
Soon after its release, however, law enforcement officials nationwide pushed back. National Sheriffs’ Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahue called the list an “unnecessary erosion of unity and collaboration with law enforcement” on Saturday, and said it “not only violated the core principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with fellow law enforcement, but it also has the potential to strain the relationship between Sheriffs and the White House administration.”
In a statement to States Newsroom, DHS didn’t answer questions as to why the list was removed.
“As we have previously stated, the list is being constantly reviewed and can be changed at any time and will be updated regularly,” a DHS spokesperson said. “Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens.”
The saga came after New Hampshire officials themselves demanded the policies be re-written. In May, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed two anti-sanctuary city bills — House Bill 511 and Senate Bill 62 — into law. When they go into effect in January, the bills will require New Hampshire cities and towns to comply with Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers “if safe to do so,” prohibit policies that would ignore federal immigration-related directives and authorities, forbid local police and sheriffs from investigating the citizenship status of someone in their custody — unless that person is under investigation for violating New Hampshire law — and take away state or local governments’ authority to prohibit their police or sheriffs from entering into voluntary agreements with ICE.
At the bill signing ceremony in May, Ayotte declared, “there will be no sanctuary cities in New Hampshire.” Legislators at the ceremony said they’d identified between nine and 12 communities with sanctuary city laws that hinder law enforcement from working with federal immigration authorities.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AyoteBeforeSigningMay222025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 05:02:10.161580

Ohio House lawmakers got a stark warning Tuesday from a leading cybersecurity firm: potential threats are changing “dramatically” in terms of “sophistication, speed and complexity.”
The presentation came on the heels of lawmakers introducing a bill requiring municipalities to develop their own cybersecurity policies.
What’s in the bill?
House Bill 283 is a response to wave of cyber-attacks aimed at relatively low-level government agencies. The bill’s co-sponsor, state Rep. Haraz Ghanbari, R-Perrysburg, explained in April last year, the state auditor reported at least 23 cyberattacks against government offices in the last 12 months.
“In Licking County,” Ghanbari added, “just one attack resulted in the theft of more than $700,000.”
The measure directs local governments to review their systems and identity risks and detection strategies. The also have to develop training programs and create plans for repair, and response and in the event of an attack.
Ghanbari’s co-sponsor, state Rep. Adam Mathews, R-Lebanon, said locals would have to inform state safety officials within seven days and the state auditor within 30.
“This will ensure prompt and accurate information is relayed to the proper authorities involved in the response,” he said.
The proposal also puts added pressure on local response to ransomware attacks. Under the proposal, Matthews said, municipal governments would be prohibited from paying a ransom unless it “formally and out in the open” approved legislation to that effect.
“This requirement bolsters transparency and ensures constituents are both aware of the incident’s occurrence and have an opportunity to provide feedback on the best use of their taxpayer dollars,” he said.
Threat potential
Thomas MacLellan from the cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, told lawmakers that governments, agencies and businesses aren’t defending against a random hacker.
“Ransomware is now a business,” he said. “It is a business where they actually have help desks.”
And just as the sophistication of attacks has grown, so has the speed.
“In 2021, it took about nine days to exfiltrate data,” he said of bad actors removing information. “In the latest attacks now leveraging artificial intelligence, it literally only takes hours.”
Beyond these kinds of ransom attacks, where an actor holds critical data or access hostage in exchange for money, MacLellan described several other threats, including attackers exploiting industrial control systems.
“Those are the things, the switches that turn on things that are connected to the internet,” MacLellan said, “that turn on bridges and dams and traffic lights and hospital systems.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIn terms of preparing for attacks, he suggested state lawmakers get a security firm on retainer. “You need a bat phone,” MacLellan said, “to be able to pick up and say, we need some help, because we are overwhelmed, we’ve been hit by something.” Notably, Palo Alto Networks could be the one on the other end of that phone line.
He also argued the state needs to be aggressive about understanding and monitoring its exposure — what MacLellan termed “attack surface management.” A computer, router or other piece of hardware running out-of-date software could be a vulnerability, he said, and organizations need to make sure to find and fix those problems.
MacLellan added that some states have begun developing joint security operations, effectively a state-run cybersecurity team to protect state and local governments in the event of an attack. He repeatedly argued the biggest challenge in cybersecurity is workforce; centralizing talent could allow for greater reach and impact.
State Reps. Ismail Mohamed, D-Columbus, and Ron Ferguson, R-Wintersville, asked HB 283’s sponsors about a statewide approach to cybersecurity planning.
“Why isn’t there a centralized place,” Mohamed asked, “instead of requiring each subdivision to have their own cyber program?”
Ghanbari and Matthews said they would leave the finer points up to local governments to maintain local control and allow greater flexibility.
Highlighting a well-publicized cyberattack against Columbus last year, Rep. Christine Cockley, D-Columbus, asked about the cost prevention compared to the cost of response and recovery. She noted the city has faced significant costs investigating what happened and providing safeguards for people impacted by the breach.
MacLellan acknowledged he didn’t have hard and fast numbers to offer, but said “when you begin to look at the cost of remediation versus the cost of actually putting together a good system, the delta is pretty significant.”

Susan Collins visited with first responders in Clinton, Maine and reviewed plans for an upgraded facility built with the help of $2 million secured in Congressionally Directed Spending. (Photo via Sen. Susan Collins/ Facebook)Editor’s Note: This story is part of a series about U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ role during the second Trump presidency. 
As Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins approaches three decades in Congress, the self-described moderate’s balancing act has meant she’s angered both the left and right. However, even Mainers otherwise critical of Collins commend her ability to secure federal funding for Maine.
“I think her big goal has been what it always has been and that’s delivering economically for the state,” said Jim Melcher, a professor of political science at University of Maine Farmington. “I think [that] really interests her a lot more than being an ideological vote, honestly, for anybody.”
Though, the bounds of that unifier are now being tested by the Trump administration. 
Since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts that have been widely interpreted as retaliatory.
Some Mainers say these terminations underscore why Maine needs Collins, one of Congress’ most senior members and top appropriators. Others argue the executive’s actions reveal a crack in Collins’ power.
When asked whether she believes she can still ensure Maine receives both the funding it’s owed and continued appropriations for new initiatives, Collins did not hesitate to say, “I do.” 
Her record
Both Republican leaders of the Maine Legislature, Sen. Trey Stewart of Aroostook County and Rep. Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor, said, without a doubt, that Collins should not face a primary challenger. Why? Federal funding. 
“I think it’s absolutely insane to vote out Susan Collins, who brings so much money into the state of Maine,” Faulkingham said. 
In fiscal year 2022, Congress reinstated earmarks, formally referred to as Congressionally Directed Spending in the Senate, where individual members have the ability to request funds for specific projects in their home states. Collins has secured more than $1 billion for Maine using this method since. 
Collins secured more than $200 million for 105 projects in fiscal year 2022, more than $308 million for 108 projects in fiscal year 2023, and more than $577 million for 231 projects in fiscal year 2024. Her 2024 total was the most secured by any senator that year. 
Throughout the years, these have gone toward initiatives related to infrastructure, medical services and affordable housing, among others. 
The University of Maine System received $125.45 million from Congressionally Directed Spending secured by Collins between fiscal year 2022 and 2024, according to Chief External and Governmental Affairs Officer Samantha Warren, who called the funding “transformational.”  
Though, Warren added, these earmarks don’t reflect all of the funding that Collins has helped funnel to the system, both since the earmark process was restored and before, noting Collins’ longtime championing of investments for Maine’s public universities including through need-based federal Pell grants and TRIO programs. 
Another key funding source outside the earmark process is defense spending, which Collins has helped secure for Maine-based contractors such as Bath Iron Works and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. 
“Do you think we’re going to be building ships at Bath Iron Works if we have a freshman legislator in the Senate? No, I don’t think so,” Faulkingham said.

When asked whether the General Dynamics-owned contractor has any concerns about Collins being able to continue to deliver in light of other congressionally appropriated funds being rescinded, David Hench, communications principal for BIW, pointed to her track record. 
“Senator Collins’ leadership as a member and now chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee has been invaluable in not only providing resources for our national defense, but in helping to address the transportation, housing and childcare needs of our state and workforce,” Hench said.
When asked the same, Kate Dufour, director of advocacy and communications for the Maine Municipal Association, a nonprofit state municipal league, described a similar working relationship between its members and the senator.
“Collins is a strong proponent of municipal government and has done much during her career to ensure that Maine has access to federal revenues, which reduce the burdens placed on the property taxpayers,” Dufour said. 
Several other major benefactors of Collins’ earmarks declined to comment on her performance as a top appropriator, including Jackson Laboratory and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, or did not respond to requests for comment, including Maine Medical Center.  
When asked about her record of delivering for the state, Collins also pointed to her ability to work with both parties to advance legislation that aids many Mainers, and Americans more broadly. For example, she pointed to her co-authoring of the Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law earlier this year under former President Joe Biden, which she said she spent more than two decades working toward. The Act restored full benefits for millions of public sector workers. 
A breakdown
The funding process has been upended during Trump’s second term, challenging Collins’ otherwise steadily growing appropriations power. 
The continuing resolution from GOP leadership this winter cut earmarks for community projects. Collins had secured nearly $361 million in earmarks this year before they were removed from the resolution, which she said she ultimately supported to avoid a government shutdown. 
While it appears earmarks will return in bills this year to fund projects for fiscal year 2026, Mark Brewer, chair of the political science at the University of Maine, said he doesn’t think anyone can actually say whether that will consistently be the case moving forward. 
“Really, a lot of the things that we thought for years and years that had been norms for how things are done in Washington are not at the moment,” Brewer said.
How the White House implemented that stopgap bill demonstrated another breakdown of normal procedure, defying precedent in vetoing certain emergency spending allocations made by Congress. Collins warned the Trump administration in a letter then that the move could strain its working relationship with the Appropriations Committee.
State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, a moderate Republican who has crossed paths with Collins when she previously held state-level positions and on campaign trails, said the senior senator has long focused on being institutionally responsible, an objective he also shares.   
On the state level, Bennett has argued the Legislature has ceded too much power to the governor and on the national level that Congress has ceded too much to the president. Calling Congress “barely functional on a good day,” Bennett said of Collins, “I think it’s difficult for her to find a normal process that is inclusive in this chaos.” 
When asked whether Collins is charting the most effective path amid that chaos, Bennett said, “I think we’re going to find out. I don’t have any advice for her. I think you’d have to be sitting in her seat in order to see what avenues she has.”
Collins has touted her behind-the-scenes conversations with officials as the most effective means to restore funding so far. Maine has been subject to both the Trump administration’s across-the-board slashes as well as targeted terminations.  
For example, in late February, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notified the University of Maine that it was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, which has helped finance statewide research, strengthen coastal communities and support thousands of jobs over more than five decades.
While one of 34 grants across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country, Maine’s grant was the only one terminated. 
The funding cut came about a week after Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complied with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports. Since then, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts.
On March 4, independent U.S. Sen. Angus King and Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine sent a letter to Vice Admiral Nancy Hann demanding she immediately reverse the decision. But when Hann announced on March 5 that the grant would be renegotiated, she credited conversations with Collins and her staff. The University of Maine also credited the renegotiation decision to Collins.
“We are deeply appreciative of Senator Collins’ leadership and relentless advocacy on behalf of Maine Sea Grant and the hard-working Mainers it has long served,” UMaine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy said in a statement.

Values versus funding 
Collins lost Saco resident Sandy Katz’s support on issues of principle, and while not enough to gain her vote, Katz said, “The funding is the one thing she does well.”
Values and funding, however, are becoming increasingly entwined, as exemplified by Trump’s attempt to force compliance with his executive order through cuts.
On principle, Collins is against transgender athletes playing in women’s sports, but when it comes to funding, she criticized the president’s attempts to rescind federal dollars for Maine schools. 
Trying to find her balance between the two has also been challenged with her votes on Trump’s Cabinet picks. She voted for the vast majority of nominees, confirming 20 and voting against two: Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Kash Patel. 
Regarding Hegseth, Collins said, “I think his difficulty in managing the department effectively has shown that my judgment was correct on that.” Since his confirmation, Hegseth has been involved in a spate of security scandals over his use of the open-source, encrypted messaging app Signal. 
Regarding Patel, Collins said, “I felt particularly at this time, but at any time, we need an apolitical FBI director and I did not think that Kash Patel was based on his writings.” Patel has authored children’s books and been involved with projects that promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories.
Concerning the Cabinet picks Collins supported, one confirmation in particular stuck out to political scientist and writer Amy Fried: Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought. 
Vought, an architect of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint to overhaul the federal government, has said he doesn’t believe Congress has the final say on federal spending. 
When asked whether he would comply with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which clarifies that presidents don’t have the legal authority to ignore Congress on federal spending, Vought responded, “No, I don’t believe it’s constitutional. The president ran on that view. That’s his view, and I agree.”
Collins told Maine Morning Star she gives deference to presidential Cabinet picks regardless of party. 
“Despite my disagreements with [Vought], which are pretty profound when it comes to the Impoundment Act, he is clearly well qualified for the position,” Collins said. “He previously served as both deputy director of OMB and as director of OMB. So when I’m evaluating Cabinet nominees, I, in general, base my decision on whether or not the person is qualified for the job, not on whether I agree with all of their positions.”
Fried argued Collins’ vote for Vought undermines her own power.
“Her big claim was ‘I will be able to help the state of Maine because someday I’m going to be chair of the Appropriations Committee,’” Fried said. “Well, if the Appropriations Committee isn’t deciding what money goes where, then that just renders that whole thing null and void.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Male legislators in Kansas use women as political pawns and defy the will of voters.
In Kansas, the go-to move for some members of the Legislature is to ignore the will of the people and criticize, restrict or oppress the personal, legal behaviors of women.
Even with their recent increase in pay, certain state House and Senate members still advocate for rushing through the session despite their own colleagues being critical of this action, or they promote bills contradictory to voters’ wants and needs. 
In the most recent legislative session, women were used as political pawns by inexperienced legislator Sen. Patrick Schmidt, a Democrat, who gambled on women’s health care rights because he viewed himself as some kind of political mastermind and champion for women. 
To be clear, most women do not view men who voluntarily attempt to make their lives harder as their champions.
Other legislators, like Republican Rep. Pat Proctor, who recently announced his bid to oversee our state’s elections, scrutinized the legal voting behavior of young women he claimed he was watching.
Proctor is captured in a video Loud Light posted to Instagram stating: “There’s, like, all these, like, women, like 20- to 30-year-old women who, you know, that you never saw at the polls before.”
He adds: “They’re stealing it far and square.”
To be clear, it is your fundamental right to vote regardless of your gender or sex as long as you are registered appropriately, according to the laws of your state. If these women were not registered, they would not have been allowed to vote. They stole nothing.
It is beyond concerning that Proctor, who also can be seen here discussing how he’s chipping away at issues regarding voting rights, does not appear to respect the right to vote, particularly as for young women.
These women were exercising their fundamental rights guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. That legal activity alone does not merit the personal monitoring or the hysterical outcries of a state representative.
In Kansas, women face extreme challenges that are unlikely to change without meaningful policy designed to promote the health and well-being of all women, especially women of color. The Status of Women in the States report paints a bleak picture for the women of Kansas.
Research on the project’s website indicates women in Kansas are not projected to see equal pay until 2074, 30% of women work in low-wage jobs, and women disproportionately experience mental health issues in comparison to their male counterparts. These numbers are even more staggering when we examine the effects on women of color.
Where are the bills addressing these issues?
Women endure so much, both publicly and privately, and Kansas women deserve legislators who view them as whole people, not dehumanized versions of an archetype produced by a patriarchy bent on subjugating women for their benefit.
Women have held the hands of their sisters in the aftermath of rape by men who see us as objects for the taking.
We have offered shelter and washed the blood off of our sisters when they’ve been beaten by men who claim to love them.
We cook meals to nourish other women’s families in times of illness or crisis.
We work multiple jobs, we clean messes we didn’t make, we appease, we follow orders, we submit out of fear or survival, we carry the emotional loads for our households and communities — a woman’s walk is never to be understood until you walk it.
The beautiful, innocent women of Kansas deserve better.
Perhaps, moving forward, members of the Legislature should consider consulting with the women they are so hyper-focused on regulating in an inappropriate, terrifying way. What these legislators might find is that policies designed to burden women are unfair and unimaginable to most of the decent, good-hearted women and men Kansas is known for. That is, if legislators are truly interested in helping women.
The forced positioning of women as pawns in elected officials’ political games is wicked and vile. Either support us appropriately, or leave us alone.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Republican budget bill the U.S. House approved last month includes a surprise for the 40 states that have expanded Medicaid: penalties for providing health care to some immigrants who are here legally.
Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.
Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.
Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.
It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”
West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.
Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”
“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.
There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized if immigrants qualify for the program, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.
The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.
By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.
“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”
The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.
“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”
Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.
Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.
Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.
Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.
“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”
Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.
“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”
Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.
“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.
Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.
Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.
“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.
California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.
“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.
If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.
“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.

When my son was diagnosed with a neurological disability, I worried about the ways he might struggle, not only physically and emotionally, but academically. I found peace in knowing that Ohio’s public schools would support him through protections provided by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). 
What I didn’t expect was the depth of care, commitment and expertise his public school teachers would bring. They see him. They celebrate his brilliance, advocate for his growth, and make sure I am part of a team.
This is why it is devastating to watch our state systematically strip resources from public education while funneling hundreds of millions of dollars more into private and charter schools that are not held to the same standards. This isn’t just a financing shift. It’s a shift in values.
Early in my career, I worked in charter schools, and while that experience shaped me as an educator, it also exposed me to harsh realities. I saw how poor accountability led to inefficiency and blatant disregard for students. These schools prioritized profit over people, with faceless management sending impersonal directives from beach homes in Florida. 
I watched students be discarded for not fitting an image and dedicated educators penalized for speaking up. My experiences confirm these are not the schools that best serve Ohio’s children, yet our state continues to prioritize them over public schools that educate all students – no exceptions.
Our public schools don’t pick and choose. They don’t push out students who need more support. They don’t quietly ignore civil rights protections like IDEA. My child thrives today because of this commitment, but I worry—for how much longer?
Proposed education budget changes feign a preference for school choice, but reflect a deeper truth: Ohio is abandoning its responsibility to educate all children. 
Underfunding public education puts supports like my son’s at risk. As an educator and a parent, I know what questions to ask and what rights to fight for, but many parents do not. Without the legal oversight and rules public schools must follow, too many students with disabilities may receive inadequate support, or be denied support, and their families may not even realize it. My child, and every child, deserves an education that meets their needs, not one that depends on whether a school chooses to serve them. 
Voucher and charter schools are not bound by the same transparency, equity, or admissions requirements as public schools. They can, and do, exclude students of color, LGBTQ+ students, students in poverty and students with disabilities, further damaging how these students feel seen and valued in the world. Yet, they’re receiving hundreds of millions more in taxpayer dollars.
Meanwhile, public schools are expected to do more with less. Because Ohio refuses to fund public education fully, districts are forced to rely on local property taxes. When those levies fail, as they did recently in my own communities of Twinsburg and Stow-Munroe Falls, students pay the price. Teachers stretch their resources, families scramble for support, and achievement gaps widen, particularly for rural and urban districts already struggling.
I’m proud to be Ohio’s Teacher of the Year, but this title means little if I don’t speak up. My colleagues in my district, the educators so tenderly caring for my baby in his, and those across the state working every day to make public schools places of learning, belonging, and possibility for every child can’t do it alone, and shouldn’t have to.
Ohio’s children deserve better—all of them.

Nine soldiers were killed in August, 1944, in the fight to liberate Gathemo.","The aftermath of the battle between the 28th Division and German troops in Gathemo, France, in August, 1944. (Screenshot from National Archives film)The liberation of Gathemo, France, won’t be found in many history books about the Second World War.
After all, it was one town among hundreds on a map that needed to be taken from the occupying Germans in the slow, methodical, grinding Battle of Normandy that began on D-Day: June 6, 1944. That’s when the Allies landed soldiers on five beaches and airborne troops dropped behind enemy lines as part of the war to wrest Europe from Nazi Germany.
Public perception may condense what happened after the invasion into simple terms: The Allies landed, established a beachhead and the fight was over. Tragically, it did not all end in a matter of days and the cost was steep – nearly 210,000 Allied casualties, and around 400,000 German losses.

Throughout the summer, the Allies pushed the German Army back through tiny villages, cities, farmland, hedgerows and plains in a war of attrition. U.S., British, Canadian, and other allied forces gained ground – sometimes only in mere yards — each day. 
By August, the Germans were retreating and desperately attempting to avoid becoming encircled. Gathemo soon found itself in the midst of the maelstrom.
For the first time in the war, Pennsylvania’s own 28th Infantry Division was leading the way to try to liberate the town, flanked by the veteran 4th and 29th divisions.

The men and women of Gathemo have never forgotten the men who wore the red keystone patch – dubbed the “bloody bucket” by the Germans – on their shoulders. 
Nearly 81 years later, the community will show its gratitude on Saturday by unveiling a memorial honoring nine men from the 28th who gave their lives so Gathemo could be free and  are renaming a street after the division.
At a time when international relations are tense and some American leaders are questioning alliances in Europe, the gesture is a reminder of how deep the bond runs between the French and their liberators. And the commemoration that will take place Saturday began because one man wondered what happened to his great-uncle in the war. 
He could never have imagined where his search would lead.  
‘Filling in the blanks’ 
Fifty-year-old Shaun Nadolny doesn’t have any ties to Pennsylvania.
The assistant airport operations manager for Milwaukee County in Wisconsin is a self-described history lover, whose grandfather Leo Nadolny fought in the Pacific Theater with the Marines against the Japanese.
Shaun Nadolny’s dad, born four years after the war ended in 1949, was named after Leo’s brother Jerome Francis, who was one of nine men killed in Gathemo. The two brothers never knew each other’s whereabouts while in combat, so Leo didn’t learn about Jerome’s death for nearly a year. 
Letters from his parents informing him about the loss weren’t reaching him, so tragically, he kept asking about his brother when writing home.

Like most families at the time, the Nadolnys didn’t know much about Jerome’s service, except that he died in France. A family member has the Purple Heart that was issued posthumously.
“I’ve learned a lot about my grandpa, Leo, because in about 2001, I sent a letter to the government saying, ‘As part of the Freedom of Information Act, I was wondering if you could share his military file.’ And they did,” he said.
The packet arrived about 18 months later and provided him with a window into his grandfather’s wartime experiences – where he fought, the battles he survived and even the ships he was transported on in the Pacific. 
“It kind of led me down this path about his brother Jerome, that we knew nothing about. We just literally had a picture of his cross on his grave over in Brittany (France), and a picture of him. That’s all my dad ever had,” he said. “He just knew that, ‘Hey, I was named after my uncle who I never met who was killed over in France.’”                                                                                                        
About a decade ago, he wrote the government again with a request for Jerome’s military file. He wasn’t as fortunate this time around. The records were believed to have been destroyed in a fire at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis in 1973. It was one of up to 18 million service members’ files lost. 
He did receive some basic information: Jerome’s draft enrollment card and where he was originally buried in France before his remains were repatriated in the Brittany American Cemetery.
Another key detail came from a picture of Jerome’s grave marker. He served in the 109th Infantry Regiment, as part of the 28th Infantry Division. Prior to the war, the 28th was a Pennsylvania National Guard unit based at Fort Indiantown Gap in Lebanon County. It was nationalized by the federal government in February 1941. 
“I just started kind of looking into that unit in that division,” Nadolny said. “A friend said, ‘Hey man, you’re kind of at a dead end with this research on your great uncle. You should look at a 28th Infantry Facebook group or a family group, because you’re not going to get anything more from the government.’”

So in the group, he ended up in touch with a Frenchman, Christophe Clement, who works in logistics. But, his real passion is World War II history. When he was 15 or 16, he would ride his bike from cemetery to cemetery to make sure the graves of Allied soldiers were well kept. He’s studied in Canada to be a historical adviser and volunteers with the Mike Pride Mobile Museum. Clement’s Facebook page is filled with pictures and videos – historical and current – of his efforts to keep the memory of Allied soldiers alive.
But, he has always felt a connection to the men wearing the keystone symbol on their uniforms and helmets. His hometown of Senlis was liberated by the division. During WWI, a soldier from the 28th died there and another five were killed in the same area during the second worldwide conflict.
Clement connected Nadolny with a retired lieutenant colonel from the 28th – Corey Angell, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and who has a passion for documenting the history of his beloved unit. 
Angell soon was able to add a few more pieces to the puzzle for Nadolny – Jerome’s company, his death from a gunshot wound and how he was identified by his paybook. 
“So, they kind of started filling in just some of the blanks,” Nadolny said. “And all I ever was doing for the last 15 years was just learning a little bit more about my family history.”
‘Just another guy’ 
Clement had an idea after corresponding with Angell and Nadolny – to build a memorial to the 28th’s fallen in the nondescript town of Gathemo in Normandy. The idea blew Nadolny’s mind. He figured his great-uncle was just a typical grunt doing his job. After all, he wasn’t part of the D-Day landings or some super soldier that earned a chestful of medals.

“He’s just another guy. He came after the invasion, and was killed very early in – Aug. 12,” he said. “Nothing heroic about it.”
Nadolny didn’t want his relative to be singled out, so Clement did some digging and learned the names of eight other members of the 28th who were killed in the fight to liberate the townspeople from four years of German occupation.
“When you search for information about soldiers or about combat actions or whatever, it really is like a police inquiry,” Clement said, speaking through a translator.
Clement is an old pro at working to honor the memory of Allied soldiers who paid the ultimate price on French soil. About a dozen years ago, he started working to create monuments to members of the 28th around his part of France. 
He will turn 40 on Saturday, the same day as the ceremony, which will have special significance because Clement says it will be the last monument he helps build. Organizing the tributes is becoming increasingly complicated, said Clement, who has worked to preserve the memory of 15 members of the Bloody Bucket who were killed in France during the world wars and an estimated 400 other Allied soldiers.
The Battle
 The 28th Infantry Division didn’t enter the conflict until about a month-and-half after D-Day – July 22, 1944 – and landed at Omaha Beach. At that point, the Allies were building  momentum toward a breakout inland.
The division found itself in hedgerow country (known to the French as “bocage”).
The fighting across the terrain  – made up of farm fields broken up by a series of overgrown hedges and trees that towered above walls of dirt that could reach up to six feet in height— was slow, brutal and hindered any sustained advance.
Six days after arriving on French soil, the 28th suffered its first casualty when an officer was seriously wounded. 
But its biggest test to come was in Gathemo, beginning on Aug. 7.
“The 28th Division troops got their first experience in hedgerow warfare during the fighting at Percy and Hill 210, but they faced a far more intense test a week later at Gathemo and Hill 288, just outside the town,” said Walter Zapotoczny an author, Army veteran, former command historian of the 28th Infantry Division and president of the 28th Infantry Division Association.

Jerome Nadolny and his fellow soldiers in the 109th regiment were among the first American troops moving toward the town around 6:30 a.m. Waiting for them, according to Zapotoczny, was at least half of the German 84th Infantry Division, an 88-mm anti-tank battalion, the 84th Division artillery and other enemy forces.
After hours of heaving fighting and nightfall approaching, three battalions of the 28th dug in – without much forward progress. But, the Germans weren’t done. As the Allies had learned through Africa, Sicily, and Italy, their enemy utilized the counterattack as a favored tactic. 
Major Paul F. Gaynor, who was commanding the regimental anti-tank company described what happened next:  

Three German tanks accompanied by more than 100 infantrymen came out of Gathemo. The tanks were equipped with searchlights which were used to illuminate the area where the men were digging in. Direct fire from the tanks’ guns and machine guns at ranges of 60 to 75 yards caused heavy casualties. The accompanying infantrymen, who were equipped with a large number of automatic weapons, took advantage of the confusion. 
Bazookas were quickly brought into action (by U.S, troops)….the tanks and their infantry support withdrew to Gathemo upon meeting this resistance.”

The next day didn’t yield much gain in ground. The 28th advanced another 300 to 400 yards. The Germans may have been in retreat, but continued to fight tenaciously. It wouldn’t be until the morning of Aug. 10 that American troops entered the town, and by the afternoon Gathemo was liberated. 
“The battle of Gathemo caused the greatest losses and the most resistance up to that point in the 28th Division’s experience,” Zapotoczny added,  “It was at Gathemo that the 28th Division endured its most brutal battle of the Northern France campaign.” 
The cost in and around Gathemo was the lives of nine members of the 28th, including three from Pennsylvania:



















































 
An estimated 235 men were wounded. 
 On Aug. 19, the 77-day Battle of Normandy came to an end with the Germans in full retreat and tens of thousands captured when the Falaise pocket was closed by Allied troops.
“Although not directly involved in the fiercest fighting at Chambois, where Polish and Canadian forces sealed the pocket, the 28th Division’s aggressive advance helped prevent German units from escaping to the east or regrouping, effectively pressing the western and southern flanks of the pocket,” Zapotoczny said.
A mere 10 days after the German defense of Normandy collapsed, the men of the Bloody Bucket were taking part in the liberation day parade throughout Paris.

Tracking down the relatives
As plans for the dedication ceremony took shape, Cory Angell, the retired 28th Division officer, continued to try to reach as many families of the nine soldiers killed in Gathemo as possible to give them a chance to attend in-person or watch it online. 
He spends his spare time researching photos and videos throughout history of the men and women who served in the country’s oldest Army division. 
“We’re kind of a small group, right? A lot of people just retire and move on. There’s some of us that are just diehards and I’m one of them,” Angell said. “I’m an old soldier, retired from the division which I grew up with. Really, the beginning and end of my career was in the division wearing the keystone patch.”
Since Pvt. Irwin S. Fox was from Pittsburgh, he turned his attention to trying to find his relatives. 
Military records show Fox enlisted in the Army on Jan. 9, 1944, just months before the invasion. He was assigned to the 110th Infantry Regiment with the 28th Division. 
Angell started by Googling the names of the nine soldiers. With Fox, he was able to make a connection to Pittsburgh. He then reached out to the Heinz History Center, who put him in touch with the Pittsburgh Jewish Genealogy Society. 
“The guy said, ‘Last I can tell, that family moved to Columbus, Ohio. Let me put you in touch with a guy for Jewish history in Columbus, Ohio.’ And that’s how they go, ‘Yeah, we got him. Here’s her phone number.’”
Soon, he was on the phone with Evelyn Fox Weiner, Irwin’s 89-year-old niece.
“What was a real joy to me and I hope that all those that are involved can really appreciate it when we do find the family members, the three that we found have been amazed and thrilled,” Angell said. “People are like, ‘What? You’re kidding me.’”
‘My grandmother became a Gold Star mother’
Fox was a first-generation American. His grandfather was from Ukraine and his grandmother grew up in Latvia. He graduated from Schenley High School in Pittsburgh’s North Oakland neighborhood. His mom, dad, sister and brother eventually moved to Squirrel Hill. He was married to Josephine Greenberg. A picture from 1944 shows a striking couple – Josephine sporting a knee-length skirt and a clean-shaven Irwin in uniform with his right arm casually, but firmly around her hip.  
He was 29 when he died in combat. 
“He was very loving and nice,” said Weiner. “He was revered enough that my family had another son who was named after him.”
His namesake, Irwin S. Fox, is 77-years-old and lives in Phoenix, Arizona, with his wife. 
He didn’t know much about his uncle until about 1964, when he came across some old photos.
“All I knew was that he was killed shortly after D-Day. I didn’t know any of the details until I saw the gravestone,” Fox said. The headstone is marked with his uncle’s date of death, Aug. 13, 1944. “I just knew from history that he was in hedgerow country in France.”


Irwin Fox and his wife recorded a message on a record to his parents, after Passover in the spring of 1944. The audio and photos were provided to the Capital-Star by his namesake, Irwin S. Fox. (Audio slideshow produced by Tim Lambert)
Fox’s death in Gathemo hit the family hard and Weiner isn’t sure her grandmother ever recovered from the loss of her youngest child.
“I remember the Blue Star in the window in their apartment and their home at that time, if you had somebody in the service, it was a small banner,” said Weiner, who still has the telegram from the War Department informing the family of his death. “Then my grandmother became a Gold Star mother after he was killed.”
When the war was over, families had to decide whether to bring the remains of their loved ones home or whether they would remain buried in Europe. Fox’s mother chose to have his body returned to the U.S. 
In March 1949, he was buried at Shaare Torah Cemetery in Whitehall in Allegheny County. 
A family photo dated Sept. 15, 1964, shows his mother standing in front of his grave marked by an American flag. Her graying hair peeks out from her yellow headscarf and she’s wearing a long, black coat. Her hands are clasped and her face is grief-stricken.
“I think that’s the most poignant picture I have,” Irwin Fox said.

The family is grateful to have learned a little bit more about Irwin’s short time in France, but will not be able to make the ceremony.
“It meant enough, and Irwin was revered enough, then when we found out about it, which was only two weeks ago, that there were 15 members of our family that were ready to go to France, really, to be there at that dedication, that’s how quickly we all wanted to be there to honor and to share what we could with him,” Weiner said. “Due to logistics and complications due to travel, it’s not happening. We all revered Irwin’s service to the United States and what he did and the sacrifice that he made. It totally changed several generations.”
She and Irwin are touched by the gesture of the people of Gathemo. 
“The people actually cared what Americans did and the sacrifice they made (It) had an effect on the world. That is wonderful,” Irwin said. “It kind of renews in me to want to make a difference in the world.”
Weiner said it’s gratifying that the town is remembering the soldiers who died to liberate it from the Germans.
“It never replaces a life, but does it give hope or meaning or set something up for generations to come,” she said.
 ‘Such a rewarding feeling’ 
The next puzzle piece was tracking down another fallen soldier with Pennsylvania connections.
Not much is known about Pfc. Merritt Boyle’s military service. He was from Chinchilla, Lackawanna County, and served in the 109th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Infantry Division.
He’s buried at the Shady Lane Cemetery in Dixon City.

Angell had a lead on another namesake – 53-year-old Merrit Boyle of Old Forge,, who trains athletes, owns a gym and does life coaching.
It turns out, though, that Merrit doesn’t really answer his phone.
So Angell reached out to the 109th Infantry Regiment Association in Scranton and one of their members just showed up at Boyle’s doorstep. 
“I came back from walking my dogs and I locked both doors and I’m setting up my schedule for the day and I heard a banging on the back door. I’m like, ‘Who the hell is banging on my back door?’” he said. So, I’m looking at him and he said, ‘Are you Merrit?’”
The two talked for about 90 minutes about the division, about where Merritt was killed and the upcoming ceremony. The talk started to fill in some blanks for the younger Boyle. 
He had heard some stories about the man he was named after – like how he loved his country and was only in France a short time before his death. 
Like, how his grandmother, Marjorie, who was Merritt’s mother, asked her daughter, Mary, to name one of her children after her fallen son. 
“They weren’t planning on having another kid. I’m the youngest by six years, so I was kind of like a surprise,” he said. “Marjorie went to my mom and said, ‘Look, it would mean a lot for me to keep his legacy alive,’ because Merritt was a very special person to her. You could tell just from talking to her, telling me stories, and I remember sleeping over at her house and she’d be telling me great stories on how he was always into trouble.

The twist is they spelled his name wrong on his birth certificate. As his namesake, he has one “T” in his name. 
“I love that I have that legacy. I’ve always felt a connection to him when I pray at night, I always have that connection that there’s someone watching me,” Boyle said. “That’s why it was such a rewarding experience to find out a little bit more of his history and I learned a lot from talking to many people that were very helpful and getting me up to pace with some of the details of where he was and what happened.”
Boyle said his uncle didn’t get a chance to live his life. 
“I feel him live through me in many regards. …  That I was named after him and (in) his honor and that just hearing how they spoke of him, it made me want to do better,” he said. Merrit does have a wooden carving Boyle made when he was in service and the flag that was put over his coffin when his remains were returned to Pennsylvania. 
He is grateful to know his uncle’s memory will live on in the land where he fell.
“We kind of sometimes today get caught up in the politics and the cynicism a lot of times of Republican or Democrat, all this kind of stuff. To see 80 years later that there’s still appreciation for what those great men did gives such a rewarding feeling,” he said.

The foundation is a private nonprofit organization that raises funds for the Atlanta Police Department, helps with police recruitment and serves as the driving force behind the controversial 85-acre training facility that opened earlier this year after mass protests and crackdowns from the state.
The plaintiffs, Atlanta Community Press Collective and Chicago-based research center Lucy Parsons Labs, had first requested records regarding the training center back in 2023. The requested records included APF board meeting agendas and minutes, budget documents, emails between foundation officials and Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, and various contracts. However, they received no response from the APF, even as the foundation provided records to news outlets like the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and WSB. 
In a 12-page order released Friday, Judge Jane Barwick ruled that the APF’s decision to withhold the records violated Georgia’s open records laws, stating that “records ‘maintained or received by a … private person or entity in the performance of a service or function for or on behalf of an agency’ are subject to the Open Records Act.”
As a result, “APF was under a duty to provide records to ACPC and Lucy Parsons Labs pursuant to the Open Records Act,” the ruling reads. “Under the authority explained in this Order, no exemptions applied.”
Barwick also emphasized that public records could not be withheld on the basis of which person or group requested them.
“Let the record also be clear that the identity of the requestor does not determine whether records are characterized as public,” she wrote.
However, she declined to award attorneys’ fees to the plaintiffs, reasoning that the police foundation did not “knowingly and willfully” violate the Open Records Act. During a two-day bench trial in April, APF President and CEO Dave Wilkinson testified that he viewed responding to the records requests as voluntary, since he did not believe that the private nonprofit was subject to Georgia’s open records laws. He also argued that releasing unredacted records could endanger the individuals named in those records by exposing them to harassment and threats from protestors.
The press collective applauded the ruling, but condemned the multi-year battle it took to gain access to the records.
“While we’re pleased with the result of the lawsuit, we’re frustrated that it required a lawsuit to confirm what we already knew to be true: the Atlanta Police Foundation should be responsive to records requests regarding its operations for and on behalf of the City of Atlanta,” the community press collective said in a statement on the ruling. 
Joy Ramsingh, an attorney who represented the plaintiffs in the suit, also criticized the police foundation’s initial refusal to provide the records.
“The fact that APF continued to fight even though the law was so clearly established against them, I think shows bad faith,” Ramsingh said. “I think it shows a very political mindset on their part as opposed to a willingness to comply with the law.”
The police foundation also applauded the ruling, saying it “welcomes and celebrates Judge Barwick’s court ruling as a clear affirmation of our role, our structure, and our ongoing commitment to public safety in Atlanta,” and that they plan to “fully comply” with the plaintiffs’ record requests.
Georgia’s shifting public records landscape
The issue of public access to government records has been an ongoing issue across the state in recent months. Last August, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that private contractors working for public entities are still subject to open records laws, and can be sent requests for public records they may possess. The ruling reversed an appeals court decision that government transparency advocates argued would shield certain public records from disclosure.
The case also prompted new legislation aimed at clarifying Georgia’s existing public records law. Under Senate Bill 12, which was signed into law by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp earlier this year, requests for public records that involve a private entity must now go through the local governmental agencies that contracted with those third parties. Though a last-minute amendment sought to restrict public access from records of police officers’ stops, arrests and incident responses, legislators in the House ultimately reversed the changes before advancing SB 12 to the governor’s desk.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 04:15:55+00:00,CT Mirror,CT Senate sends new biennial budget to Lamont’s desk,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-senate-budget-approved/,The CT Senate OK'd a budget that prioritizes children and relies on accounting maneuvers to comply with the constitutional spending cap.,"The Senate gave final approval late Tuesday to a biennial budget that prioritizes children, dramatically scales back a pledged boost to health care providers who treat the poor and relies on accounting maneuvers to comply with the constitutional spending cap.
The Democratic-controlled Senate voted 25-11 along party lines to adopt the $55.8 billion two-year budget, which now heads to Gov. Ned Lamont for his expected signature. But the plan still may be tweaked before the General Assembly adjourns at midnight Wednesday because of problems with a related hospital tax increase.
The package, which the House approved minutes after midnight Tuesday, would boost funds for nonprofit social service agencies two years from now and increase taxes on corporations.
It also eases aggressive state spending controls used since 2017 to build reserves and pay down pension debt faster than ever before.
The budget, which would spend $27.2 billion next fiscal year and $28.6 billion in 2026-27, needed at least 22 votes to pass in the 36-member Senate. That’s because changes to state budget controls must be approved in each chamber by at least a three-fifths margin. 
Lamont, whose administration negotiated the deal, praised it immediately after the Senate wrapped its 10 hour, 40-minute debate shortly before midnight.
“This is a balanced, sensible budget that is under the spending cap, provides predictability and stability for residents, businesses, and municipalities, and holds the line on taxes while keeping us on a sound fiscal path,” the governor said. “While other states are increasing taxes and cutting services, economic analysts are pointing to Connecticut as an example of a state that has worked hard to maintain fiscal stability and make the smart decisions that are critical for economic growth.”
Analysts project Connecticut will be poised to continue saving hundreds of millions of dollars annually to continue paying down its hefty pension debt at an accelerated pace.
A new child care fund and a $200 tax break for poor families
“The budget is, in my opinion, a great investment in children,” Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said as she opened Tuesday’s debate. “It’s the best investment in children in our state’s history.”
That involves taking about $220 million from this fiscal year’s $2.4 billion surplus and creating a new fund to pay for future increases in early childhood development programs.
Legislators could spend up to 12% of that fund each year — outside of the traditional budget and spending cap — to support a child care industry weakened greatly by the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic.
Sen. Julie Kushner, D-Danbury, co-chairwoman of the Labor and Public Employees Committee, said the initiative, which is expected to add more than 16,000 affordable child care slots by the early 2030s, would be like a major salary increase for many Connecticut families.
“It’s going to make an enormous difference in their lives,” she said.
Democratic legislators decided the state couldn’t afford a new income tax credit that covered middle-class households with kids. Credits of $600 and $150 per child were projected to cost more than $300 million and $80 million per year, respectively.
But lawmakers did order $250 in new relief for working poor families, which would cost about $35.5 million per year.
Connecticut has about 195,000 low-income households that receive the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program to help the cover basic needs and increase savings. That credit is worth 41.5% of the federal EITC’s value, meaning it adds an average of $1,061 to a qualifying household’s Connecticut income tax refund, according to nonpartisan analysts. 
The new budget stipulates EITC-eligible households with children or other dependents would receive the additional $250. Most filers that receive the EITC have children and earn between $50,000 and $63,000 per year.
Osten noted children also would benefit from the budget’s municipal aid package.
It bolsters the Education Cost Sharing program, the chief grant to support K-12 school districts’ operating costs, by $90 million next fiscal year. 
It not only continues a $40 million increase special education grants ordered earlier this fiscal year but builds upon it, appropriating another $30 million in each of the next two years.
The budget sends a message to Connecticut’s working families, said Sen. Herron Gaston, D-Bridgeport. “You matter. You count, and we are investing in you,” he said, adding, “This budget proves government can still work for the people when the people demand it.”
‘The greatest sin in this budget’
But minority Republicans said the budget is fatally flawed, undermining the spending cap and other budget controls launched eight years ago that ended a string of deficits and tax hikes, built reserves and reduced pension debt.
On paper, the budget narrowly complies with a spending cap that tries to keep most budget growth in line with household income and inflation.
But one accounting gimmick was needed to launch the new child care fund. Another maneuver uses a one-time payment into the teachers’ pension to increase the spending allowed under the cap formula. And a third underfunds contractually guaranteed health care for retired state employees by almost $230 million across two years. 
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield noted that the final budget would spend nearly the same next fiscal year than would a late April proposal from the Appropriations Committee.
But while that committee plan was set to exceed the spending cap by about $200 million, the final budget is reported to be narrowly under the limit by $1 million or 1/240th of 1% of the General Fund.
“If that isn’t budget gimmicks, tell me what is?” he said.

“It’s really a shell game,” said Sen. Heather Somers of Groton, ranking Senate Republican on the Appropriations Committee. Regardless of whether such moves are legal, they violate “the spirit of the [fiscal] guardrails,” she said.
Those budget controls have added an unprecedented $4 billion to state reserves since 2017 while another $8.6 billion in surplus has been used to reduce pension debt.
But critics say those surpluses, which have averaged $1.8 billion since 2017 — equal to 8% of the General Fund — weakened education, human services, municipal aid and other core programs.
The new budget reduces the savings program that has driven the bulk of those surpluses — a mechanism that has barred lawmakers from spending, on average, $1.4 billion per year in income and business tax receipts. It specifically reduces that savings benchmark by $600 million per year.
“We are breaking our promises to Connecticut residents, and that is perhaps the greatest sin in this budget,” said Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, ranking GOP senator on the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, who also protested tax hikes in the budget.
The package would generate an extra $340 million over the coming biennium through adjustments to the corporation tax.
Senate Republicans have been warning for nearly two weeks, since it became clear that Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, would agree to ease savings rules, that reckless spending and tax hikes were on the horizon
“Once you break the rule once, you can break it again,” Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton, said during Tuesday’s debate. “It’s like that first potato chip, right? You eat it and then you can have another and another and another.”
Fazio tried to amend the budget to reduce state income tax rates on poor and middle-class filers, predicting it would save households an average of $650 per year at a annual cost of at least $250 million to the state.
To help pay for it, Fazio said, the state should end Medicaid coverage for undocumented adults and children, which analysts say costs Connecticut about $58 million per year.
But the rest of Fazio’s tax break would be paid for by weakening another budget cap, one that forces the legislature to design its budget with a built-in surplus.
Given Fazio’s “greatest sin” statement, Osten questioned why the GOP would defend some budget caps but weaken another to pitch a tax cut.
Osten also said refusing medical coverage to undocumented residents wouldn’t save as much as some hope, since those residents likely would turn to hospital emergency rooms, which cannot refuse treatment to anyone under state law.
“It’s easy to play the sympathy card,” said Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott. “We should no longer have a bright neon sign suggesting Connecticut is the place [undocumented residents] should come to.”
Osten responded: “I guess I just look at children in the world as needing health care, and I think we should support all of them.”
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said Connecticut needs to ease its spending controls because “heartless” cuts in federal aid to states being considered by the Republican-led Congress and President Donald Trump’s administration could cost Connecticut hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue.
“We are fortunately in a better position than many other states,” because Connecticut saved so effectively over the past eight years, Looney said.
Human services, higher ed feel the budget pinch
Democrats also said the budget, which increases spending 4.6% next fiscal year and another 5.3% in 2026-27, reflects many hard choices.
Payments to doctors and other providers who treat Connecticut’s poor grow by a much smaller amount than legislative leaders pledged shortly after the 2025 session began in January.
The budget allocates $15 million to boost Medicaid rates for most providers next fiscal year. The extra funding would grow to $45 million in 2026-27. 
But leaders initially proposed spending an extra $300 million to providers by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year. The state has adjusted such rates in comprehensive fashion since 2007.
The hundreds of community-based nonprofits that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored services to people with developmental disabilities or facing mental health or addiction issues also had to settle for less.
Nonprofits, which sought an extra $264 million to compensate for decades of state payments that haven’t kept pace with inflation, got no general rate hike in the first year of the new budget and $76 million extra in the second.
The biennial package also includes $34 million in the first year and $66 million in the second year for nonprofits that run group homes for residents with developmental disabilities. But the funds for those nonprofits must be used to increase caregivers’ wages. 
The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed last month to suspend planned strikes at more than 190 group homes and 51 nursing homes after Lamont pledged to boost funding for caregivers in these two service areas.
Lawmakers also included an extra $30 million in the second year of the new budget specifically to bolster nonprofits serving clients with mental health and addiction issues or providing counseling to formerly incarcerated people reentering society.
Meanwhile, public colleges and universities, which entered the current fiscal year with considerable reserves, receive less funding in the new budget.
The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, which includes community colleges, four regional universities and online Charter Oak State College, would receive the same funding from traditional state resources next year that it got this year.
But legislators also had given CSCU $140 million in federal pandemic grants this fiscal year, and those funds won’t be available in 2025-26. 
The new state budget also would reduce overall aid next fiscal year by $58 million for the University of Connecticut’s main campus in Storrs and its regional campuses and by $55 million for the health center. Their funding would drop in 2026-27 by another $15 million and $4 million, respectively.
A last-minute adjustment to the tax hospital tax
Despite the Senate’s vote, the legislature’s work on the next state budget likely won’t be completed until Wednesday, the last day of the regular 2025 session.
That’s because Lamont, following a meeting Tuesday morning with hospitals, agreed to slice $90 million off a $375 million tax increase included in the new budget.
The hospital levy is a tax in name only. Connecticut currently collects $820 million yearly from the industry and then redistributes those funds, plus more, back to hospitals. This back-and-forth arrangement, which most states employ, helps Connecticut qualify for hundreds of millions of dollars yearly in federal Medicaid reimbursements.
Back in February, Lamont proposed boosting the tax by $140 million, projecting it would result in Connecticut gaining $94 million in annual Medicaid revenue.
But its future is uncertain with Congress and the Trump administration looking to cut Medicaid spending dramatically. 
Still, Connecticut officials said the wisest course was to seek one more increase before Washington potentially caps this program or orders reductions. And if a $140 million increase might leverage $94 million, a $375 million hike could trigger more.
But hospital officials told Lamont on Tuesday they fear any increase over $285 million might exceed current federal limits on the provider tax program.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said legislative leaders had other bills expected to be debated Wednesday that could be amended to support a revision to the hospital tax rate.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0603_SR_Session_043-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 01:03:57.948928

As a Trumbull resident who owns a single family home, I want to be clear: I do >not feel threatened by the idea of welcoming more neighbors to our wonderful town. For me, it’s just the opposite: adapting underutilized areas and adding more homes, including more affordable homes, is a win-win for the town and its residents.

Thomas Broderick
For those unfamiliar with Reservoir Avenue, the area is already the site of numerous homes and businesses, including multiple apartment complexes. In one direction it leads to Bridgeport, the largest city in the state, and in the other direction you reach Trumbull Center in mere minutes. If anywhere makes sense for new apartment homes, it’s Reservoir Avenue.
Rather than fear-mongering, what Reservoir Avenue needs from the Planning and Zoning Commission is less zoning and more planning. 
This area contains numerous Trumbull residents: where are the plans to build continuous sidewalks (or bike lanes!) safely connecting the area to our center? Where are the bus shelters so people waiting for Greater Bridgeport Transit Bus 6 aren’t standing unprotected on the open grass? We should see these new housing proposals as an opportunity to make sound, strategic decisions about growing Trumbull while actually planning for its future.
I know some of my fellow Trumbull residents think the apartments will take services away from current folks, but the town has studied this and found that it’s not the case. We can also look at calls to the police department and other emergency services and see that the apartments are not straining those, either. Instead, the new apartments are providing new places for recent grads, downsizers, divorcees, and anyone who wants to come to Trumbull and grow our tax base. And in a town with a slowly-dying mall, the apartments are stepping in to staunch the loss of tax revenue as our economy changes and the mall loses value.
From an altruistic perspective, the more people that get to live in a town like Trumbull, the more people that have access to all the opportunities we have to offer. And from a selfish perspective, new residents are new taxpayers, new employees, new customers, and new friends and neighbors. Fortunately, we don’t have to choose between altruism and selfishness, we can do both. Some things in life are truly positive sum, win-win, and permitting new homes is one of those.
Building more homes isn’t a punishment for our town —it’s an incredible opportunity. We can continue to see nearby apartment homes as a threat, or we can envision the new family we’ll invite to our backyard barbecue. We can think of new kids as a risk for Trumbull’s current students, or we can think of the lifelong friendships they’ll make. And we can think of new neighbors as potential drains on services, or we can see them for what they actually are: future taxpayers who will contribute to our town.
I have a positive vision of Trumbull where everyone who contributes to our community can make a home here, but you don’t have to share my worldview to think more homes will be good for our town. The data supports doing what’s right and welcoming more neighbors to Trumbull.
More housing—including more affordable housing—is good for our current residents, good for our tax base, and good and the future families that will call our wonderful town home.

Participants in this program need nursing home level of care but are able to remain in their homes with the assistance they receive from the program.
The State Funded Home Care Program served approximately 4,100 individuals in 2024. The state estimates that this proposal will cut an estimated $400,000 in FY ’26 and $500,000 in FY ’27, from the state budget.
To qualify for the State Funded Home Care program, individuals must be 65 or older, at risk of nursing home placement, and meet the financial eligibility criteria set by the state. Individuals accepted into the program can receive help at home for critical activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing, eating, taking medications and bathing. The cost for providing these services must be less than 50% of the cost of nursing home care. Currently, persons served by the program pay a flat 3% of their monthly costs of care. The budget proposals increase the cost from 3% to 5%, with a cap of $175 per month. The average out-of-pocket cost sharing will increase from $46 to $114 a month.
This increase may seem small to many of us, but through our work with low-income seniors, CT’s Legal Services Programs (CT Legal Services, Greater Hartford Legal Aid and New Haven Legal Assistance) are acutely aware that many low-income elders are working with very narrow margins in their budgets. With recent and ongoing increases in the price of food, energy and health care, any additional cost may be overwhelming. Frail elders may fail to apply or drop out of the program or opt not to receive preventative medical care in order to keep their out-of-pocket costs down.
This would be a shame. Connecticut has worked hard to support elders living in their homes in the community. The State-Funded Home Care Program is an important part of this effort.
Individuals without this service will have an increased risk of falling, being injured or becoming ill. These events can and do lead to emergency room visits, hospitalizations and nursing home stays – some of them permanent.
The consequences of not having adequate levels of home care are costly in both human and economic terms. Aging in place is what people want. It is also extremely cost effective for Connecticut’s taxpayers. Keeping the current 3% cost sharing rate will allow elders to continue to maintain their homes, pay their bills and stay out of hospitals and nursing homes.

The Democratic nominee received 67% of the unofficial vote Tuesday against five opponents, including a police officer who ran as a Republican and four independents – a businessman with ties to south Jackson anti-violence efforts, a 27-year old musician and frequent city council public commenter, a child care development specialist and a conservative talk radio host who publicly dropped out of the race but still appeared on the ballot.
The general election held June 3 did not come with a possibility of a runoff, meaning whoever secured the most votes won, even if they lacked a majority of votes – a requirement only in primaries.
With an 82% Black population that votes heavily Democratic, Jackson’s general elections aren’t typically competitive. Despite chatter that a white businessman named Rodney DePriest was on Horhn’s heels, Tuesday was no exception. Horhn would have avoided a runoff anyway. Political newcomer DePriest had won 28% of the counted ballots Tuesday night.
About 21% of registered voters visited the polls Tuesday, roughly on par with turnout in the primary.

The senator was favored in the race after he claimed victory over incumbent Mayor Chokwe Lumumba in the April primary, winning almost 50% of votes in a field of 12 Democratic candidates and then besting Lumumba nearly 3-to-1 in a head-to-head runoff.
During the primary, Horhn faced accusations that he was a pawn for white business interests and buoyed by northeast Jackson Republicans, a sliver of the electorate, switching sides to vote in the Democratic primary. But it wasn’t convincing to the majority of Jacksonians across the city who continued to support him in the runoff and general. 
The 2025 municipal election marked Horhn’s fourth attempt at the mayor’s seat after he ran unsuccessfully in 2009, 2012 and 2017. His campaign slogan was “Jackson is ready.” 
The lifelong Jacksonian, now 70 years old with more than three decades of legislative experience, argued during his campaign that he was the best man to both secure outside resources for Jackson’s poorly maintained infrastructure and fight state efforts to strip the city of local control.
“I’ve been the go-to guy in the Senate when it comes to fighting that stuff,” Horhn told Mississippi Today in April. “I’m not all of a sudden going to change my stripes and hand over the city.”
Horhn, son of a labor organizer and public school cafeteria worker, served the state as a program manager at the Mississippi Arts Commission, State Film Commissioner, federal state programs director for the Governor’s Office and State Tourism Director before becoming a state senator in 1993. Among the legislative accomplishments he’s touted during this race are securing $85 million for the downtown convention center, $20 million for the Westin Hotel, and $20 million for the JSU Metro Parkway. 
Horhn has focused his campaign on the need to restore basic services and functionality back to the city. 
“I’ve chaired the Senate Economic Development Committee in the past. I’ve worked on economic development for the past 32 years as a member of the Senate,” Horhn said during a candidate forum in northwest Jackson last week. “But let me tell you something, we’re not going to have economic development if we don’t clean the city up. We’re not going to have economic development if we don’t restore trust in our city government. We’re not going to have economic development if we don’t have a plan. And so those are going to be the things that I’m going to focus on.”
During his victory speech at The Plant venue in west Fondren, Horhn said that his team is working on a comprehensive plan that lays the groundwork for goals his administration hopes to accomplish in the next three, five and even 10 years.
“Talk is cheap,” he said. “It is now time for action.”

“I’m gonna say we won, but I mean obviously it’ll probably be contested, I mean it could be contested by the other candidates, and that’s their right to do when you have a really tight vote,” he said. “But for the time being it appears that I won.” 
As of Tuesday night, Foote stands at 1,738 votes with Greene at 1,728, according to an unofficial count that includes in-person absentee votes. Democrat Jasmine Barnes, an auditor at the Mississippi Department of Transportation, is in third with 1,713 votes, a drop off from the 2,465 votes she claimed in the April 1 Democratic primary. 
There will be no runoff as Foote does not need a majority of the vote to win, only a plurality. In Mississippi, municipal general elections do not feature a runoff. 
Election officials will process mail-in ballots until up to five days after the June 3 election, meaning it’s possible the race will not be called until next week. The number of affidavit ballots was not known as of Tuesday night. 
The Ward 1 race was considered the most competitive, with seasoned politicos struggling to predict the outcome due in part to recent demographic changes in northeast Jackson. As of last year’s redistricting, the ward, long considered the city’s “white Republican bastion,” was recorded as having fewer white residents than Black. 
“I’m just thankful for all the voters who showed up and thankful to the competitors for the race that they ran,” Greene, an entrepreneur who runs an online reselling business, told Mississippi Today from a call outside her house, which she said was full of neighborhood kids.

LaDarion Ammons, Barnes’ campaign manager, said that Barnes is in good spirits but they plan to wait until receiving the number of affidavit ballots before making a decision on whether to concede. 
“We think it’s too close to call right now,” he said. 
Foote, the founder of a financial services company, has represented the ward as the council’s lone Republican since 2014. He ran as an independent this year. 
“What a nutty finish,” he said in the parking lot of Bravo, where he got together with a few friends to watch the results.
Foote said he thought the race would be close, so he stopped by the city clerk’s office yesterday to see how many absentee ballots had been filed. The clerk told him there were about 800 for the city and 187 for Ward 1 — 89 of which ended up going to him, he said. 
“I gotta give a special thanks to the people who went to the trouble of going down to City Hall, filling them out and turning it in so they still had their vote even though they were gonna be out of town,” he said. 
Despite leading with a plurality, Foote said he thought Mississippi should change its laws to force a runoff after a general if no candidate gets a majority of the votes, because that would make governing easier for the victors. 
“In this case, I only have 33.6% of the vote and that’s not exactly a resounding majority to say I speak for the citizens,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20185525/3X0A4608.jpg,,,2025-06-04 00:00:19.337635

We need laws and regulations that enable us to thrive —not just survive — and give us a fair shot at growth and sustainability. 
The post Cannabis reform bill is important step forward appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","WE ARE A group of owner-operators of minority-owned, women-owned, social equity, and economic empowerment cannabis businesses from across the Commonwealth and have deep concern about our ability to survive under the currently outdated laws and regulations.  Massachusetts once stood at the forefront of cannabis equity reform. We were the first state to create a social equity program. However, businesses like ours urgently need relief and support to survive in an incredibly challenging market. We’ve built businesses that hire from our communities, reinvest locally, and model what social equity and economic empowerment can look like, but we’re barely surviving due to oversaturation and oversupply. We need laws and regulations that enable us to thrive —not just survive — and give us a fair shot at growth and sustainability. With the current limit of three licenses for any owner, we cannot structure models for growth or provide financial security for small owner-operated businesses. We also cannot raise capital based on the negative narrative around the market. The numbers don’t work unless you’re a vertically integrated or multi-state operator with better profit margins in neighboring states. That’s why we support the recent redraft legislation, titled An Act Modernizing the Commonwealth’s Cannabis Laws, released by the House members of the Joint Committee on Cannabis Policy. We commend House leaders for recognizing the harsh reality that many of us operating businesses in Massachusetts are closing, and for putting forth changes that will give us breathing room and a future. This bill offers something we have not seen in a long time — a policy that actually reflects the realities of running a cannabis business in today’s market. One of the most important reforms it includes is the gradual increase of the retail license cap from three to six. Lacking the ability to scale, we’re permanently disadvantaged in every negotiation with landlords, investors, and suppliers. The current cap stunts our businesses before they can grow. Without bankruptcy protections, some of our businesses will need to go into receivership, and some may even need to file for personal bankruptcy — losing homes and livelihoods. Increasing the license cap gives struggling businesses the option to sell and protect personal, family, and community assets.  The bill also embraces equity joint ventures and employee ownership, paving the way for new investment dollars to come back into the local cannabis market. This gives social equity businesses a path to new sources of capital to stabilize and scale their businesses while traditional sources are still out of reach. Critical guardrails requiring audits of business ownership and strict enforcement of the license caps are also included in the bill. These reforms ensure that changes to the licensing structures will uplift the people and communities they were meant to benefit. The legislation also increases the adult-use possession and purchase limits from one ounce to two — which is seemingly small, but incredibly impactful. It is a necessary step that will help consumers access safe, tested products, boost legal sales, and chip away at the illicit market that undercuts us. Finally, this bill ends the mandatory vertical integration requirements in the medical cannabis program. We need to allow all small and disadvantaged businesses to participate in the medical market without requiring them to control the whole cannabis supply chain or demonstrate that they have capital resources of at least half a million dollars. For medical patients in cities like Boston and Springfield, vertical integration requirements are a huge barrier to access to medical cannabis, which is sold tax-free. This change opens the door for those purchases for those with medical needs in communities with large populations with limited disposable income. This legislation is not a perfect bill, but it delivers meaningful, immediate, and enforceable reforms that will help small, minority-owned cannabis businesses survive today and grow tomorrow. We didn’t enter this industry to be shut out from realizing the original intent of the first social equity and economic empowerment programs in the nation. We entered it to lead and build businesses that reflect our communities and repair decades of harm. This bill gives us a chance to do that.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE – After years of political upheaval, court battles and legislative tugs-of-war, the plan to build a new men’s prison in Lincoln County south of Harrisburg is dead.
Members of the Project Prison Reset work group spent more than eight hours at the Capitol on Tuesday running through possible site locations, building designs, budget needs and public comments before voting unanimously to scratch the original site from its list of replacement options for the aging state penitentiary in Sioux Falls.
Also gone? The former Citibank site in Sioux Falls, a patch of land outside of Huron, a former cheese plant in Grant County – and more than $50 million in cash, spent to prepare the Lincoln County site for a prison that now won’t be built.
The members set a $600 million cap on a penitentiary replacement, budgeting for between 1,500 and 1,700 beds – about the same capacity as the original Lincoln County site, but $125 million under that version’s guaranteed maximum price.
The legislature spent three years dumping money into an incarceration construction fund in the run up to February, the month lawmakers balked at the Lincoln County project’s location and price tag. The project needed but couldn’t secure two-thirds majority support. The failure spurred the creation of the prison reset group by Gov. Larry Rhoden, who’d pushed for the Lincoln County prison.
Now, the task force has asked the state’s contractor, JE Dunn, to study a site in Mitchell, another near Worthing, and state-owned land on the grounds of the Mike Durfee Prison in Springfield and at the penitentiary in Sioux Falls.

House Speaker and task force member Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, said the new parameters are a “departure” from the original plan, but a “necessary step” to find consensus.
“The Legislature has already said we don’t need that big of a prison, we don’t want to spend that much money all in one big shot,” Hansen said.
‘You need to build beds now’
In a report presented to the group Tuesday, consultants with Phoenix-based Arrington Watkins Architects projected that the state’s total prison population will grow by 31.7% by 2036 — from 3,926 in 2025 to 5,172 in 2036. That’s largely driven by the state’s truth in sentencing law, which requires people convicted of violent offenses to serve between 85% and 100% of their sentences, depending on the category of their crime.
Even without considering projected growth in prison population, the consultants said, every correctional facility in South Dakota is beyond its capacity now. The state needs more than 1,500 beds to deal with current capacity issues at Durfee and the penitentiary are needed immediately.
“You need to build beds now,” said Mike Quinn, managing principal at Arrington Watkins.
Report: Tough-on-crime policies could push prison construction costs as high as $2.1 billion

The parameters set Tuesday significantly restrict the project’s scope, said Vance McMillan, senior vice president of JE Dunn. That includes additions to existing facilities or building cheaper, steel-celled options that’ll last 50 years. The original campus-style prison was meant to stand for 100 years.
“A hundred years is out the door with the new budget challenge, in my opinion,” McMillan said.
That “not really” a responsible use of taxpayer funds, Senate Majority Leader Jim Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, told South Dakota Searchlight. But it’s politically necessary.
The $600 million cap is more “palatable,” he said, since it’s roughly the amount of money the state has on hand to fund the project already.
“We have nearly 800 inmates living in a medieval setting,” Mehlhaff said, referencing the penitentiary in Sioux Falls, which opened in 1881 and predates statehood. “We have to do something to correct that as soon as possible.”
Lawmakers prefer building on existing Corrections land
The state engineer and contractors are expected to present designs that meet the new parameters by the task force’s July 8 meeting. Legislators will convene for a special session at the state Capitol on July 22.
JE Dunn will present options, but McMillan said they might not be able to pull together many details in five weeks.
Open process and publicity draw wide range of offers for state prison site

Members of the task force, especially the lawmakers, want to build on or expand upon existing prison sites. Increasing capacity on land the state already uses for prisons avoids the public’s general distaste for a new location, said Rep. Karla Lems, R-Canton. Lems was an outspoken opponent of the original Lincoln County site.
“You take some of the heartburn away,” she said. “Then you just deal with the money.”
JE Dunn representatives said the state could expand capacity at Springfield with new dorms or barracks facilities for around $55 million. A barracks would fit another 420 minimum security beds in an open space filled with bunkbeds.
Members also considered building a compact facility on unused acres at the state penitentiary and adding a second floor to the Jameson Annex in Sioux Falls.
Options to build on existing DOC land is limited and more costly, because it would limit a construction workforce to non-felons, take more time to get in and out of the site, and impact operational hours, said Sen. Ernie Otten, R-Tea. JE Dunn representatives estimated it’d cost more than $130 million to build 192 beds on top of the facility.
“Modifying Jameson is a no-go,” Otten said.

Mitchell leaders pitch site as leading contender
Business and local government leaders from Mitchell enthusiastically pitched their site to the task force. The city brought letters and resolutions of support and said  a prison would drive economic growth.
The site got a tepid recommendation from consultants because it’s about an hour’s drive from Sioux Falls. It’s also located next to several possible escape routes:he interstate, the James River and a railroad. 
The Mitchell City Council unanimously approved a resolution supporting the prison being built in Davison County. 
But division is already surfacing in the community. Mitchell residents voiced concerns at its Monday city council meeting. According to reporting from the Mitchell Republic, some residents are concerned about the prison’s location, parolees released in the city, property taxes and a lack of a citywide vote on the matter. 
Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, said she listened to the city council meeting and said residents are “just becoming aware of the proposal.”
City officials plan to hold community forums to increase awareness, educate residents about the impacts, and listen to concerns from community members.
The DOC plans to survey its staff to determine if they’re willing to commute to Mitchell or Worthing.
The Worthing site in Lincoln County received a slightly more positive response from consultants, but the only speaker during public testimony who spoke to the location raised concerns about drainage and flooding at the site.
Members remain skeptical of budget restraints, administrative oversight
Several members said they’d vote for the budget restrictions and new plan, but added they might not be able to support a decision next month.
Rep. Tim Reisch, R-Howard, is a former Department of Corrections secretary. He aired “serious operational concerns” about the current administration’s handling of the prison in recent months and years due to recent suicides, overdoses, attacks on correctional officers and gang activity.
Reisch recalled walking through the minimum custody unit during a penitentiary tour and observing that of 230 inmates in the unit, “only nine of them had jobs, and the rest of them were sitting around watching Oprah Winfrey every day.”
“These are inmates that are getting ready to go out and rejoin society,” Reisch said, “and we are failing them.”
Venhuizen told reporters after the meeting he believes it would be easier to manage such issues in a more modern facility.
Sioux Falls Democrats Sen. Jamie Smith and Erin Healy both expressed hesitancy. The budget could limit space needed for rehabilitation and education efforts, they both said.
Healy emphasized that her “number one goal” is to build a safe prison with proper rehabilitation space.
“We absolutely need to ensure that our responsibility for taking care of people is of our greatest concern,” Healy said.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)After the Maine House of Representatives worked until 10 p.m. on Monday, when the Senate reconvened just after 5 p.m. on Tuesday there were bets on how long it would take to get through the remainder of the chamber’s work. 
It ended up being one hour, four minutes and 32 seconds. “Take that, two-hour camp,” Senate President Mattie Daughtry joked.  
A lot of consequential decisions were packed into that last hour, pushing legislation closer to its final disposition than just hours earlier. Here are some takeaways from Tuesday: 
Both chambers
As the chambers move through votes, they often pause as lawmakers interject to voice opinions or request clarity on an issue or bill. 
One such request came Tuesday from Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) regarding LD 1626, which would establish annual training requirements for schools to provide education technicians and support staff. 
“The reason we tabled this — I don’t even know what day we tabled it on, yesterday, they all blend together — was because the fiscal note currently reads that there is the potential for a mandate,” Stewart said, referring to the requirement such a change would put on schools. 
The fiscal note of the bill currently states that, as written, this would be an unfunded mandate. So, if passed, the bill will inevitably land on the appropriations table, where bills backed by the full Legislature are placed to vie for remaining funds after the budget is set. 
While the bill initially passed the Senate and House without a roll call vote, Stewart said that support was with the expectation that a more complete funding picture would be available before enactment votes. The bill was tabled without enactment.
Sometimes enactment votes are crucial, most often with emergency legislation, which needs a two-thirds vote in both chambers. 
For example, while the House enacted LD 1323, an emergency measure to prohibit the use of neonicotinoid pesticides and the use and sale of neonicotinoid-treated seeds, the Senate failed to enact it with a 22-9 vote. This leaves the bill in nonconcurrence, meaning it will bounce between the chambers until they can agree, or not and then the bill dies. 
Other nonconcurrent matters after Tuesday’s votes: 
The House voted against LD 544, aimed to create parity in the taxation of medicine by exempting sales of cannabis for medical use, bucking the committee recommendation. But Sen. Craig Hickman, co-chair of the committee, moved that the Senate accept the majority report and pass the measure. His motion prevailed 17-15, which now sends the bill back to the House in nonconcurrence. 
Another example is a bill (LD 723) that would direct the Maine Criminal Justice Academy to study the feasibility of establishing a nonresidential law enforcement training program. The House failed to finally pass the bill on Tuesday, while the Senate did finally pass it. While the lower chamber attempted again on Wednesday to secure enough votes for final passage, it failed to do so with a  71-74 vote.
The chambers also failed to agree on LD 1255, which would limit eligibility for the free community college program, which Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) described as placing a one-year “guardrail” on free community college, and argued “it’s protecting the taxpayers of Maine.” The House insisted on its position rejecting the bill, which the Senate supported. 
In revisiting a matter that had sat unfinished for almost a month, the House rejected LD 588 — a move that goes against the recommendation of the Labor Committee. The bill seeks to grant agricultural workers the right to engage in concerted activity. The bill then headed back to the Senate in nonconcurrence, as it had passed the upper chamber 21-13 in late April. Later Tuesday evening the Senate insisted on its position. 
Current law prohibits the sale of a beverage to a consumer in a container composed of one or more plastics if the basic structure of the container, exclusive of the closure device, also includes aluminum or steel. LD 1582 seeks to establish a definition of “closure device.” The House passed the bill but on Tuesday the Senate voted it down. 
The chambers also can’t agree on a bill submitted by the the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (LD 402), which would move the Natural Areas Program from the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, among other technical tweaks. The House passed the bill with one amendment, while the Senate passed it with another. 
The House followed the Senate by passing LD 598, which would require some pay for employees who report to work and the employer cancels or reduces the number of hours in their scheduled shift. But the bill is now in nonconcurrence because the House further altered it with a floor amendment introduced by Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford). 
Though Drinkwater said he was skeptical of this bill when it was introduced to the Labor Committee, he said he received a call from a relative who is employed by the local public works department who said he could benefit from it because he is often called in on nights and weekends. The amendment, which committee co-chair Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) said she likes, would add an exception to the definition of “employee” for an employee of a public employer who is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
The chambers also can’t agree on LD 277. The bill originally sought to repeal restrictions on  certain places of business from being open on most Sundays but an amended version is being considered that would instead alter restrictions for grocery stores on Thanksgiving Day.

Growing tables
The number of bills on legislative “tables” now abound. 
As mentioned earlier, the appropriations table, which is managed by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee that sets the budget, is where bills that need to be funded are placed for that committee to decide how to appropriate remaining money.
For example, LD 820, which proposes an amendment to the Constitution of Maine to establish the right to hunt and fish, was placed on the table by the Senate on Tuesday after being supported by both chambers. Such a change would ultimately have to be approved by voters, and all ballot measures have associated costs. 
The House took back its initial vote against LD 331, which would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure timely MaineCare reimbursements for hospital cost reports. While the Health and Human Services Committee opposed the bill, the Senate passed it and the House on Tuesday receded and concurred. It also cleared enactment in the lower chamber, securing the two-thirds vote needed to pass as an emergency measure, but the Senate placed it on the table. 
Other bills placed on the table include: LDs 34, 366, 434, 496, 876, 896, 996, 1226, 1287, 1588, 324, 1279.

Mike Dunleavy. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development is proposing new rules that could reduce the amount of money that local governments are able to contribute to their neighborhood school districts.
The new rules, contained within emergency regulations published Monday, would redefine a municipality’s “local contribution” — the amount of money a school district can receive from a city or borough — to include “services provided at no charge to a district by the city or borough.” 
That would mean that any time a school activity takes place at a city-owned pool or library, the city would effectively have to charge the school district rent, subtracting rental fees from the amount of money it normally gives to the school district for instruction.
Monday’s announcement comes toward the end of the fiscal year for school districts, many of which are already cutting programs and closing schools because of flat state funding. 
A formula increase approved this spring by the state Legislature over Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s opposition would provide only a small year-over-year funding increase, and the governor could end up vetoing that increase anyway. The state budget isn’t due back from the governor until later this month.
The Department of Education did not respond to requests for comment about the proposal on Tuesday.
If approved by the state school board — something that could take place as soon as Wednesday — the regulations could become quickly effective. Although Dunleavy has announced a freeze on new regulations, the education department already sought and obtained a waiver exempting this new rule from the freeze.
The state education department has been discussing proposals similar to Monday’s rule change for almost a year. 
The new rule is being driven in part by the state’s choice to use $81 million in federal “impact aid” for schools as a replacement for state funding.
Impact aid is distributed to states to compensate for federal land that is non taxable and doesn’t contribute to local property taxes, which typically benefit local schools.
Alaska is the only state in the country to use that federal money as a replacement for state money, rather than an additive. As a result, the state must pass what’s called a “disparity test” — it looks at how much is spent per student at each of the state’s school districts, then removes the bottom 5% and top 5%. The difference between the remaining schools can be no more than 25%.
This year, the federal government warned that the state had failed the disparity test and failed a similar “equity test,” putting the $81 million in impact aid at risk.
The state could have sought to fix the problem by increasing education funding, but it now appears to be reducing funding instead.
Other states send the impact aid to local schools directly, noted Nils Andreassen, director of the Alaska Municipal League, which represents cities and boroughs.
“To further reduce local contributions while taking $81 million from local school districts is pretty incredible to me,” he said.
Making things more difficult for local school districts, he said, is the fact that the change would be retroactive to fiscal year 2025, which ends June 30.
“I think the local governments and school districts would have to go back and re-evaluate all their local contributions,” he said. “It could be problematic, moreso for some than others. … It’s going to be anybody who’s close to the cap. It’s Juneau, it’s probably Anchorage, but also anybody who provides other types of support for districts. I’m thinking Sitka, who just took over the pool. It’s those kinds of things they’re going to be looking for.”
Frank Hauser, superintendent of the Juneau School District, said he’s still trying to understand the pending change, but his first impression is that it could cost the district as much as $2.1 million.
“Why is this (regulation) going through when there’s been a freeze on everything else?” he said.
DEED commissioner Deena Bishop told the state school board on Tuesday that “the local contribution issue started with a headline that said a district is funding outside the cap.”
That alerted the department to a possible problem with impact aid, she said.
“That really is the basis for this. It is an equalizing factor in our formula,” Bishop said, adding that the regulation change will be “shoring up” the limits on local contributions.
“The reason we were proposing these changes … is to help put some siderails to ensure that future tests don’t fail,” said Lori Weed, school finance manager for the Department of Education.
Assistant attorney general Susan Greenlee Sonneborn said the emergency regulations are needed now because school districts are approaching the end of their fiscal year and want the new limits to take effect before the fiscal year ends.
“We believe that by getting this regulation in place within this fiscal year, we’ll limit our exposure to the chances of failing the disparity test for 2027, based on fiscal year 2025 data,” she said.
The state school board is scheduled to take public comment on the regulation change and other items on its agenda starting at 8:25 a.m. Wednesday, and it is scheduled to vote on the proposal before 11 a.m.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/240315-Deena-Bishop-copy-1024x652.jpg,,,2025-06-03 23:01:57.433596
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 02:33:51+00:00,CT Mirror,"Relief on electric bills passes House, sent to governor",John Moritz and Janhavi Munde,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/ct-electric-rates-bill-house-pass/,"The bill will lower residential electric bills by roughly $100 a year, with small businesses and large consumers of electricity saving more.","The House of Representatives gave bipartisan approval Tuesday to legislation promising some relief for utility customers saddled with some of the highest electric costs in the U.S., fulfilling a key priority for members of both parties this legislative session.
Democrats and Republicans joined together to praise Senate Bill 4, which they said would immediately offer customers savings of 1 or 2 cents per kilowatt-hour off current electric rates. For most residential customers, that equates to $100 or more a year off their current electric bills, with even more savings going to small businesses and large consumers of electricity.
“While this is progress, energy costs are still going to continue to be high in Connecticut, and that requires a whole different conversation around producing energy,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. “But we can certainly build off of this [bill] to provide the kind of relief that I think a lot of families were demanding.”
The bill passed the House by a vote of 144-3, after getting a similar bipartisan show of support in the Senate. It now heads to Gov. Ned Lamont, who said he planned to sign it.
“Like many people, I think electric bills are too damn high, and this bipartisan bill is a first step in addressing a complex issue that is the result of policy decisions made years ago by legislators in both parties that have continued to impact our utility rates,” the governor said in a statement. 
The final draft of the legislation did not become publicly available until Monday evening, after several weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations between Lamont’s office, lawmakers and other key stakeholders.
Republicans initially had pushed for a much more expansive — and expensive — energy package that would have spent roughly $1 billion a year to eliminate the public benefits charge entirely from customer’s bills. That proposal died in the Energy and Technology Committee after failing to gain support from Democrats, who argued it would force unpalatable cuts to other state services.
The ranking Republican on that committee, state Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien, said that her colleagues in the minority party were eventually brought into the negotiations as Democrats began to coalesce around a plan. 
“I think this has been an up and down process along the way, and many of you know we weren’t necessarily in the process at the very beginning,” Marra said. “But it is also fair to say that we were brought to the table to have discussions at the end. So I think there’s a lot of bipartisan input.”
Two Republicans and one Democrat were among those who voted against the bill in the House. One of those, state Rep. Bill Buckbee, R-New Milford, said he was concerned that borrowing money to pay for portions of the public benefits charge would “come back and bite us.” 
“I hope I’m wrong, I hope we’re not going to get back here in two years and have to fight this again,” Buckbee said. “But I don’t think it’s going to do what it needs to do for the ratepayers.”
The only Democratic ‘no’ vote came from state Rep. Minnie Gonzalez, D-Hartford, who told a reporter afterward she was “not interested” in discussing her position on the bill.

The last round of changes to the bill on Monday prompted some hand-wringing from House Democrats, especially after environmental advocates said the final draft included a much steeper reduction in incentives for renewable energy sources than they had been led to believe would be in the bill.
The bill made wood-burning biomass facilities, which burn refuse wood to make electricity, ineligible for the highest class of renewable energy credits — a policy supported by environmental groups — but also reduced the amount of credits that electric suppliers must purchase on behalf of customers over each of the next five years.
“We are backing off from the renewable portfolio, and that makes me sad,” said state Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, who nonetheless voted in favor of the bill. “We used to be a leader in the United States, and we won’t be after this.”
Advocates did succeed in paring back an earlier version of the bill that would have removed an additional $750 million over five years from the public benefits charge to pay for energy efficiency programs. While the bill would have allowed the state to borrow the money to continue those programs, critics argued the plan would have put them at risk of being cut once the money ran out.
“I think there was a really robust conversation about energy efficiency this session, where we were really beating the drum,” said Connor Yakaitis, the deputy director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters. “The cheapest or fastest way to save money on your bills is the energy that you don’t use.”
The total amount of savings from the bill was still subject to some speculation and back-of-the envelope math on Tuesday, though most estimates ranged in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
State Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, who led passage of the bill in the Senate, estimated it would save customers $800 million over three years. Jonny Dach, the governor’s energy policy advisor, said it would save ratepayers $350 million a year. 
“It’s not mission accomplished, but it is a powerful example of what the state can do when Democrats and Republicans get in one room with one other and with experts and stakeholders in and out of government to prioritize good policies and families’ budgets,” Dach said in a text message. 
A large chunk of the savings is the result of a plan to use state bonds to pay down the cost of certain public benefits programs, prompting some Republicans to deride them as “fake savings” because they will be paid back by taxpayers, with interest. 
The bill also allows utility companies to securitize costs related to storm damages and the rollout of advanced metering technology. Other savings would come from cost-cutting measures for the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, renewable energy credits and the low-income discount rates offered by utilities.
Jamie Ratliff, a spokeswoman for Eversource, said in a statement that customers could expect to see an average savings of $4 a month strictly off the public benefits portion of their bills. Lawmakers in both parties have estimated higher savings.
“Other aspects of the legislation will need to play out, and it’s unclear at the current time what the bill impact will be, such as the changes to energy procurement,” Ratliff said. “There is higher risk to purchasing power more frequently on the day ahead spot market that could lead to savings or continued cost volatility. We look forward to continued work with policymakers to achieve the best result possible for customers.”
United Illuminating, the state’s other electric utility, released a statement in support of the bill upon its passage in the Senate Monday.
Taren O’Connor, a spokesperson for the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, PURA, released a statement on Tuesday afternoon saying, “We’re encouraged to see so many people focused on the important issues before PURA and grateful to the legislature for its leadership and engagement on this critical issue.”
The legislation also accomplished an aim of both Republican and Democratic lawmakers who wanted more independence for PURA by moving it out from under the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for all but administrative purposes.
On Monday, legislative leaders also announced a “handshake” agreement with Lamont to fill two vacancies at PURA that have existed since the authority’s board was expanded to five members in 2019. 
The passage of S.B. 4 caps a year of widespread voter frustration over the cost of electricity in Connecticut. Republicans ran heavily on their criticisms of Democrats’ energy policies in last year’s elections — though Democrats ended up gaining seats in the legislature. During this week’s debate, several lawmakers read letters from their constituents complaining about the costs of their electric bills. 
Earlier in the session, lawmakers also fought over the re-appointment of PURA Chairwoman Marissa Gillet, who was ultimately confirmed largely along party lines. 
That debate followed a lawsuit brought by both of the state’s utilities in January, accusing Gillett of wielding unilateral control over the authority and issuing hundreds of decisions without the input of her fellow commissioners. Gillett refuted those charges and the case remains pending. 
“Frankly, in the past year, the rhetoric has gone way overboard,” said state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, who serves as co-chair of the Energy and Technology Committee and was one of the principal authors of the legislation.

(File/Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Specia to the SC Daily Gazette)A 24-year-old Bishopville City Council member will be the newest legislator at the Statehouse.
Democrat Keishan Scott cruised to victory Tuesday over former Sumter County GOP chair Bill Oden.
Scott received almost 71% of less than 3,700 votes cast in a special election for a state House seat representing all of Lee County and parts of Kershaw and Sumter counties, according to unofficial results from the state Election Commission.

“This victory is not mine alone, but it belongs to all of the people … that got out and exercised their right to vote,” Scott said to cheers at a victory speech broadcast on his Facebook speech.
Scott is the youngest person to be elected to the Statehouse since Rep. Brandon Newton, a Lancaster Republican, won as a 22-year-old in 2016.
But the youngest person in at least modern times to be elected to the Legislature is former Sen. Sherry Shealy Martschink. The Mount Pleasant Republican was elected to the House in 1970 during her junior year at the University of South Carolina, only 14 days after her 21st birthday.
Scott, who won his first election to city council in 2023, will take over the seat vacated by Rep. Will Wheeler, a Bishopville Democrat who announced his resignation in January, just three days into this year’s legislative session.
His surprising resignation left the rural district without a representative for the entirety of this year’s session.
“I can promise you that every day I go into the Statehouse, I will carry the people with me,” Scott, a preacher, said to the crowd moments before leading a prayer. “Because certainly, it’s about people more than politics.”
The election means nothing changes with the Republicans’ supermajority advantage in the House.
But it does restore the number of Democrats in the 124-member chamber to 36.
Wheeler ran unopposed in four of his five elections. The only time he faced GOP opposition was in 2022, when Republicans gained supermajority status in the chamber. The 2024 elections gave Republicans a supermajority in the Senate too.
Oden, who recently concluded four years as head of the Sumter County Republican Party, said in a text to the Daily Gazette he “lost tonight” but “had a ball running.”
“God has something better in store for me,” he added.
Scott’s victory ensured the Democratic Party didn’t lose another seat in the Statehouse.
In an endorsement video posted on Scott’s Facebook, U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn emphasized Tuesday’s election was a must win for Democrats.
Electing Scott “will be the beginning of a Democratic comeback here in South Carolina.” Clyburn said. “Irrespective of where you live, how old you may be, whatever gender you may be, this is about the future of Democrats in South Carolina.”
Lee County had issues with counting votes in November’s election and recount for a state Senate race that ousted Hartsville Democrat Gerald Malloy, who ultimately conceded ahead of his scheduled challenge.
The state Election Commission sent staff to Lee County to help during the primary, as well as Tuesday’s special election, commission spokesperson John Catalano told the SC Daily Gazette.
In April’s primary, Scott defeated Carl Whetsel, a retired chiropractor and Bishopville City Council member, by 11 votes after a recount.
In the unofficial count done days before, Scott only won by 10 votes. An automatic recount was required under state law since the winning margin was less than 1%.
With Tuesday’s landslide victory, he can officially focus on making a difference in Columbia next year.

MAYSVILLE — On a sun-splashed Tuesday morning, former Kentucky Democratic Party Chair Jerry Lundergan, along with his wife, Charlotte, and several others, heaved shovelfuls of dirt heavenward to break ground for a multimillion-dollar religious garden and 70-foot cross at Saint Patrick Cemetery.
Lundergan, a well-known Lexington entrepreneur who owns several companies in the food services and  hospitality industry and emergency disaster services, wants to turn six acres in the front of the historic cemetery in the village of Washington in his hometown of Maysville into a religious site that he thinks may attract tens of thousands of people each year.
The project will feature a replication of the Garden of Gethsemane near Jerusalem where the New Testament says Jesus prayed the night before his crucifixion. It will contain life-size bronze statues of Christ and the main characters in the 14 Stations of the Cross. They are representations of events in Jesus’ life on his way to his crucifixion. The planned cross will stand seven stories high.

Lundergan is aiming at a completion date of early next April for Easter services and envisions tens of thousands of visitors each year. A minimal fee may be charged but nothing  like the admission prices at the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter in Northern Kentucky that sometimes go over $100, he said.
Lundergan noted that any proceeds would go to maintain the garden and cemetery and support Saint Patrick Church.
Lundergan acknowledged Tuesday that the project will cost several million dollars. No tax dollars are to be used, he said, but the state may sell to the church at appraised value 2 ½ acres of surplus land in front of the cemetery — on what is known as old U.S. 68— to be used for parking.
The bishop of Covington, the Rev. John Curtis Iffert, has leased land to Lundergan, who plans to give the entire garden to Saint Patrick Church once it is completed.
Lundergan unveiled the first Station of the garden at the groundbreaking ceremony that attracted about 120 people. It shows Jesus speaking to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who presided over the trial of Jesus and ultimately ordered his crucifixion.
Reto Demetz, an Italian sculptor who designed the statues, was on hand to talk about his work.
Other professionals involved in the project are Lexington landscape designer John Carman of the CARMAN firm and Betty Vento of Mentor, Ohio, who is an expert on religious statues.

But the day belonged to Lundergan, who thanked his wife and their five daughters for their support and said they were fulfilling a dream. Daughter Alissa Lundergan Tibe moderated the hourlong ceremony.
He recalled how he visited the cemetery as a boy with his parents, who attended St. Patrick’s Church, and where he was baptized, married and someday will be buried in its cemetery.
He spoke of his love for the church and Maysville.
His comments received a standing ovation.
The Rev. Augustine Aidoo of Saint Patrick Parish prayed that the project becomes “a beacon of hope” while several public officials touted its potential economic development effects as well as its religious message.
Maysville Mayor Debra Cotterill said the project’s “economic implications are enormous” with many visitors. It is to have a welcome center with a gift and snack shop that will be on the site where the groundbreaking was held.
Mason County Judge Executive Owen McNeil predicted the project “will attract visitors from around the globe,” and state Rep. William “Buddy” Lawrence, R-Maysville, said it will attract national and global attention.
David Cartmell, mayor of Maysville for 20 years and now a city commissioner, said the project will become “iconic” for the region.  “This is a big, big day in Maysville,” he said.
Lundergan plans to post a website soon keeping interested people informed of the development of the project. He said it could be reached by searching for Gethsemane Garden Maysville.

Kennedy Jr. in April to detail the tribal nation’s priorities to improve access to health care and clean water. They also advocated for the preservation and reestablishment of U.S. government programs that have far-reaching impacts for their nation. (Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News)WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. — Navajo Nation leaders took turns talking with the U.S. government’s top health official as they hiked along a sandstone ridge overlooking their rural, high-desert town before the morning sun grew too hot.
Buu Nygren, president of the Navajo Nation, paused at the edge with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Below them, tribal government buildings, homes, and juniper trees dotted the tan and deep-red landscape.
Nygren said he wanted Kennedy to look at the capital for the nation of about 400,000 enrolled members. The tribal president pointed toward an antiquated health center that he hoped federal funding would help replace and described life for the thousands of locals without running water due to delayed government projects.
Nygren said Kennedy had already done a lot, primarily saving the Indian Health Service from a round of staffing cuts rippling through the federal government.
“When we started hearing about the layoffs and the freezes, you were the first one to stand up for Indian Country,” he told Kennedy, of his move to spare the federal agency charged with providing health care to Native Americans and Alaska Natives.

But Nygren and other Navajo leaders said cuts to federal health programs outside the Indian Health Service are hurting Native Americans.
“You’re disrupting real lives,” Cherilyn Yazzie, a Navajo council delegate, told KFF Health News as she described recent changes.
Kennedy has repeatedly promised to prioritize Native Americans’ health care. But Native Americans and health officials across tribal nations say those overtures are overshadowed by the collateral harm from massive cuts to federal health programs.
The sweeping reductions have resulted in cuts to funding directed toward or disproportionately relied on by Native Americans. Staffing cuts, tribal health leaders say, have led to missing data and poor communication.
The Indian Health Service provides free health care at its hospitals and clinics to Native Americans, who, as a group, face higher rates of chronic diseases and die younger than other populations. Those inequities are attributable to centuries of systemic discrimination. But many tribal members don’t live near an agency clinic or hospital. And those who do may face limited services, chronic underfunding, and staffing shortages. To work around those gaps, health organizations lean on other federally funded programs.
“There may be a misconception among some of the administration that Indian Country is only impacted by changes to the Indian Health Service,” said Liz Malerba, a tribal policy expert and citizen of the Mohegan Tribe. “That’s simply not true.”
Tribes have lost more than $6 million in grants from other HHS agencies, the National Indian Health Board wrote in a May letter to Kennedy.
Janet Alkire, chairperson of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the Dakotas, said at a May 14 Senate committee hearing that those grants paid for community health workers, vaccinations, data modernization, and other public health efforts.
The government also canceled funding for programs it said violated President Donald Trump’s ban on “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” including one aimed at Native American youth interested in science and medicine and another that helps several tribes increase access to healthy food — something Kennedy has said he wants to prioritize.
Tribal health officials say slashed federal staffing has made it harder to get technical support and money for federally funded health projects they run.
The firings have cut or eliminated staff at programs related to preventing overdoses in tribal communities, using traditional food and medicine to fight chronic disease, and helping low-income people afford to heat and cool their homes through the Low Income Home Energy Program.
The Oglala Sioux Tribe is in South Dakota, where Native Americans who struggle to heat their homes have died of hypothermia. Through mid-May the tribe hadn’t been able to access its latest funding installment from the energy program, said John Long, the tribe’s chief of staff.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute at the Seattle Indian Health Board, said the government has sent her organization incomplete health data. That includes statistics about Native Americans at risk for suicide and substance use disorders, which the center uses to shape public health policy and programs.
“People are going to die because we don’t have access to the data,” Echo-Hawk said.
Her organization is also having trouble administering a $2.2 million federal grant, she said, because the agency handling the money fired staffers she worked with. The grant pays for public health initiatives such as smoking cessation and vaccinations.
“It is very confusing to say chronic disease prevention is the No. 1 priority and then to eradicate the support needed to address chronic disease prevention in Indian Country,” Echo-Hawk said.
HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said Kennedy aims to combat chronic diseases and improve well-being among Native Americans “through culturally relevant, community-driven solutions.”
Hilliard did not respond to questions about Kennedy’s specific plans for Native American health or concerns about existing and proposed funding and staffing changes.
As Kennedy hiked alongside Navajo Nation leaders, KFF Health News asked how he would improve and protect access to care for tribal communities amid rollbacks within his department.
“That’s exactly what I’m doing,” Kennedy responded. “Making sure that all the cuts do not affect these communities.”

Kennedy has said his focus on Native American health stems from personal and family experience, something he repeated to Navajo leadership. As an attorney, he worked with tribes on environmental health lawsuits. He also served as an editor at ICT, a major Native American news outlet.
The secretary said he was also influenced by his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, and his father, U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who were both assassinated when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a child.
“They thought that America would never live up to its moral authority and its role as an exemplary nation around the world if we didn’t first look back and remediate or mitigate the original sin of the American experience — the genocide of the Native people,” Kennedy said during his visit.
Some tribal leaders say the recent cuts, and the way the administration made them, violate treaties in which the U.S. promised to provide for the health and welfare of tribes in return for taking their land.
“We have not been consulted with meaningfully on any of these actions,” said Malerba, director of policy and legislative affairs for the United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund, which advocates for tribes from Texas to Maine.
Alkire said at the congressional hearing that many Native American health organizations sent letters to the health department asking for consultations but none has received a response.
Tribal consultation is legally required when federal agencies pursue changes that would have a significant impact on tribal nations.
“This is not just a moral question of what we owe Native people,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said at the hearing. “It is also a question of the law.”
Tribal leaders are worried about additional proposed changes, including funding cuts to the Indian Health Service and a reorganization of the federal health department.
Esther Lucero, president and CEO of the Seattle Indian Health Board, said the maneuvers remind her of the level of daily uncertainty she felt working through the covid-19 pandemic — only with fewer resources.
“Our ability to serve those who are desperately in need feels at risk,” Lucero said.

Kennedy Jr. speaks to Navajo Nation leaders and community members after hiking with officials to hear about their health priorities. “I’m going to give you my commitment today that I am available and listening to you,” Kennedy said. (Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News)
Among the most pressing concerns are congressional Republicans’ proposed cuts to Medicaid, the primary government health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities.
About 30% of Native American and Alaska Native people younger than 65 are enrolled in Medicaid, and the program helps keep Indian Health Service and other tribal health facilities afloat.
Native American adults would be exempt from Medicaid work requirements approved by House Republicans last month.
After Kennedy summited Window Rock with Navajo Nation leaders, the tribe held a prayer ceremony in which they blessed him in Diné Bizaad, the Navajo language. President Nygren stressed how meaningful it was for the country’s health secretary to walk alongside them. He also reminded Kennedy of the list of priorities they’d discussed. That included maintaining the federal low-income energy assistance program.
“We look forward to reestablishing and protecting some of the services that your department provides,” Nygren said.
As of mid-May, the Trump administration had proposed eliminating the energy program, which remains unstaffed.

(Photo courtesy of University of Florida)In a stunning move, the panel that oversees Florida’s state university system voted against hiring Santa Ono as the next president for the University of Florida during an extended special meeting Tuesday.
The State University System Board of Governors voted against Ono in a 6-10 vote that followed hours of contentious questioning and debate where Ono was grilled over his past positions on diversity equity and inclusion.
The vote comes a week after UF trustees approved Ono, the immediate past-president of the University of Michigan and sole finalist for the job, which would have paid him a $3 million annual package that included $1.5 million base salary
After conducting a months-long search, UF remains without a permanent president. Former UF President Kent Fuchs has been serving as interim president since former President Ben Sasse resigned last year.
Approving Ono was the only item discussed during the board meeting, which ran nearly two hours longer than originally scheduled. Some members compared the vetting to a court interrogation.
Members mainly asked about Ono’s changing stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and how he could carry out Florida’s agenda denouncing DEI, but delved into other topics, like a Christian’s interpretation of original sin and Gov. Ron DeSantis’ COVID-19 response.
“It’s insidious that it feels like pushing a rope uphill when we establish these policies, if a president doesn’t really believe in those policies,” Board of Governors Vice Chair Alan Levine said during the meeting in Orlando. “And it’s a powerful position, you can be an inhibitor, or you can help advance. And so I guess so much of your record reflects your deeply held beliefs, that you have been an advocate of DEI up until recently.”

Ono supported diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the University of Michigan, one of the top-ranked public institutions in the country, guiding its “DEI 2.0” initiative and touting benefits of such programs but ultimately closed DEI offices earlier this year.
“It looks to me like you got rid of the program because you needed to do what you had to do with the president’s orders and the funding issues. But you didn’t really push to get rid of DEI,” Levine said.
Ono replied with an answer he uttered several times, that he began looking at DEI when he took office at Michigan, rather than an immediate decision after Trump’s executive order.
Ono told UF trustees last week that he developed his new stance on DEI in the last year and a half after talking with students and other members of the university community. Before, he wasn’t an expert on the topic, which had been universal in higher education, he said, and told trustees his conviction is “rock solid.”
Ono said he mirrors Florida’s evolution with accepting, and then rejecting, DEI.
“For anyone who believes Dr. Ono’s earlier views on DEI, views that many university leaders and civic organizations once shared, are disqualifying despite his evolution and the changes made under his leadership at Michigan, I would remind you that this body adopted DEI strategic priorities as recently as 2020. Like Michigan, the Board of Governors has evolved since,” BOG member Charles Lydecker said, adding that Ono’s previous positions on the topics governors were concerned about “are not meaningfully different from those previously held by this board.”
“The real question is this: Should we punish someone for evolving beyond a view this very body once held, especially when that person has already led one of the nation’s most prominent universities to a different course, a course that mirrors our own?” Lydecker said.
Lydecker added that “There is something fundamentally unjust about cancel culture, and to cancel Dr. Ono would not only be unjust, it would be a setback for the University of Florida.”
‘Forum to interrogate’
The degree of vetting from governors Tuesday was not typical, and is the first time the Board of Governors has rejected a president, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
“I’ve been on this board for five, six years, and we have never used this as a forum to interrogate. And in this case, it feels to me patently unfair,” Lydecker said after former House Speaker and now-BOG member Paul Renner put documents in front of Ono about his past.
At one point, BOG member Eric Silagy asked if any of the governors had expressed interest in the UF presidency.

  UF Board of Trustees Chair Mori Hosseini (Photo via UF)
Mori Hosseini, the chair of the UF Board of Trustees, said yes.
He acknowledged Renner reached out to him asking about the job.  Renner insisted that he reached out to to Hosseini before he was on the BOG. Renner said he would not take the UF job if offered now that he’s on the BOG.
Renner did not recuse himself, although, and voted against Ono.
Ono told the BOG he had made 12 commitments, which include ideological neutrality, solely merit-based hiring and admissions, keeping the university aligned with state government, and upholding state laws and university regulations. He said he asked for those provisions to be included in his contract.
“Doctor, your recent reversal on an entire architecture of ideology is nothing short of incredible,” BOG member and former House Speaker Jose Oliva said. Oliva also voted against Ono.
Hosseini, stood by Ono’s candidacy, and sat next to him during the “interrogation.”
“The bottom line is that Dr. Ono is globally recognized as one of the most respected leaders in higher education, and we are lucky to have him,” Hosseini said.
Ono was previously president of the University of British Columbia and the University of Cincinnati.
GOP pushback
The GOP pushback mounted high enough to reject Ono, who had already stepped down as Michigan’s president.
U.S. Rep. and GOP gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds posted to X questions related to DEI that he encouraged BOG members to ask, and Rick Scott did the same, Monday evening releasing a statement and questions concerning Ono’s commitment to protecting Jewish students.
After the vote, Scott called the vote “the right decision,” and U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis said “I’m happy to see the system work.”
Donald Trump Jr. posted to X “WTF! Have the decision makers at @UF lost their minds!???” calling on BOG members to vote against Ono.
U.S. Rep. Greg Steube sent a letter to BOG members, asking them to reject Ono, “and find a suitable replacement who truly represents Florida values.” After the UF trustees’ meeting last week, Steube said “I’m not sold” on Ono “walking back his woke past.”
The governor’s office appoints six of 13 of the university trustees at each institution and 14 of the 17 BOG members.
“The Board of Governors has a strong history of affirming presidential nominees who received unanimous approval from their university boards to continue this practice sends a message that the Board of Governors values the opinion of their colleagues with the state university system and does not yield to outsiders who post out of context sound bites on social media,” Hosseini said.

Duff could not say why the Mystic Aquarium in Stonington would be getting $795,000 over the next two years, but he knew exactly why the Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk would be getting $1.6 million.
He asked for it.
The $55.8 billion budget for the biennium that begins on July 1 is both a statement of priorities for Connecticut and an exercise as old as the definition of politics: It’s the art of determining who gets what, when and how.
The money for the two aquariums, which sit 88 miles apart at opposite ends of I-95, were line items in a $35 million appropriation for tourism over the next two years. 
“I do think it’s not equitable,” said Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, whose district includes Stonington, home of the Mystic Aquarium. “I’m not trying to put one against the other in any way, shape or form.”
Duff said in an interview he would have “no beef” with Mystic getting as much money as the aquarium in Norwalk, but he does not apologize for his success in getting more money for the one in his district.
“I advocate for the aquarium in Norwalk, and that’s my job,” Duff said.
Other attractions getting significant funding included $546,626 in each of the next two years for the Connecticut Science Center in Hartford and $400,000 annually for Beardsley Zoo in Bridgeport.
Somers, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, quizzed the committee’s co-chair, Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, about the criteria for the tourism grants and hundreds of other types of grants earmarked for local youth sports leagues, community organizations, theaters, clubs and social groups.
The United Way of Greenwich is getting $40,000; the YMCA of Northern Middlesex County, $142,000; the Boys & Girls Club of Waterbury, $80,000; the Hispanic Coalition of Greater Waterbury, $20,000.
How do groups get on the list?
“That was something that’s been repeatedly asked of me,” Somers said. ”They had to get on there somehow. What’s the best way to be included in Sec. 33 in the future?”
Sec. 33 of the budget is a list of 204 one-year “youth services prevention” grants that range from $2,500 for the Yellow Farmhouse Education Center, Inc., a culinary program in Stonington, to $1 million for youth justice reentry services. They are sprinkled around the state.
Some have a regional or even statewide footprint. Others have a local impact, like the $10,000  grants for the Little League, Babe Ruth League and a soccer club in New London or the $50,000 grants for the Police Athletic League and Hartford Stage in the capital city, whose delegation includes the speaker of the House.
They were the only two senators in the chamber for their colloquy about how earmarks get in the budget.
“It’s a good word,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said of “earmark.” 
It conveys the ability of individual legislators to put their mark on a small piece of the budget.
“I think a lot of those organizations are what people see as key to the life and the vibrancy of their individual communities,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. “And what seems like a small amount of money for a very small organization is probably a lot to them to allow them to continue to develop services or to offer services.”
There is $30,000 for the Connecticut chapter of the Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America, Inc., $60,000 for the Milan Cultural Association and $35,000 for the Asian Pacific American Cultural Coalition. All are related to services for and by South Asian and Asian Pacific communities.
“Do doctors really need $30,000 to have an association? They don’t make enough money? They can’t support their own organization without tax dollars?” asked House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. “So I really scratch my head with that vetting process.”
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, a physician born in Pakistan and trained in the U.S., said in an interview he was behind those earmarks, which will help the recipients expand suicide prevention services among minorities with high rates of suicide.
On the Senate floor, Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, said the groups might be providing valuable services, but the process for awarding the grants is ad hoc and seemingly primarily driven by knowing a lawmaker.
He noted that one organization in Bridgeport was the recipient of two grants.
“How was this number determined?” he asked.
“It was determined by the people who applied for it, not by the organizations,” Osten replied.
“I assume we mean lawmakers,” Sampson said.

Chandler, who tried to hide from photographers, was sentenced to consecutive life sentences without a chance for parole for 50 years. (Pool photo Evert Nelson/Topeka Capital-Journal)WESTMORELAND — Family and friends of the late Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness sat in a courtroom gallery Tuesday for sentencing of Dana Chandler to consecutive life sentences without an opportunity for parole for 50 years for shooting the couple to death while they slept.
It was an emotional closure to a legal odyssey that began July 7, 2002, with the murder of Chandler’s ex-husband, Sisco, and his fiancee, Harkness, in Topeka. The murders fractured the respective families and frustrated investigators until Chandler was charged in 2011 after detectives built a case anchored in circumstantial evidence.
Chandler’s first conviction in the double-homicide was overturned by the Kansas Supreme Court due to prosecutor misconduct that culminated with disbarment of an attorney. A second trial ended in a hung jury. The third — moved to Pottawatomie County in search of an objective jury pool — led to a conviction in March on two counts of first-degree murder.
Chandler’s daughter Hailey Seel, who was 17 at the time of her father’s death, faced her mother in court to offer a personal accounting of the torment she endured for a majority of her life.
“I truly see her now as the evil killer,” Seel said. “I hate it. I don’t want to call you evil killer, but I can’t live in a fairy tale.”
She urged Shawnee County District Court Judge Cheryl Rios to have mercy on Chandler if the defendant expressed remorse after decades of denying responsibility for the deaths.
Chandler, who held a handful of papers against the left side of her face throughout the proceeding in an attempt to block the view of photographers, delivered about two hours of combative and bombastic remarks after condemned in victim impact statements by Seel and her brother, Dustin Sisco, and others who knew the deceased couple well.
Chandler’s minutia-filled presentation, which featured a series of comments denying guilt and revealed her intent to appeal, included allegations Judge Rios as well as Topeka prosecutors and police investigators, witnesses at trial and even a court reporter engaged in unethical behavior to bring about the convictions.
“I have always maintained my innocence,” Chandler said. “I continue to maintain my innocence. I was not in Topeka, Kansas, on July 7. I never owned or possessed a 9 millimeter firearm. What is happening in this courtroom is a grave injustice.”
Rios ordered exactly what Deputy District Attorney Charles Kitt requested — a pair of consecutive life sentences with a minimum of 25 years in prison on each count before eligible for parole.
Rios said she didn’t personally know the victims, but said she saw them through the eyes of witnesses who took part in the sentencing hearing.
“I understand that there are no words that this court can say to change what happened, to bring back Mike and Karen, to be able to live all those missed moments,” Rios said. “I understand that there is no justice in that sense.”
The murders without a clear perpetrator and the resulting courtroom drama was presented to a national audience by “48 Hours.” Lack of physicial evidence connected Chandler to the crimes raised doubts, but Chandler’s behavior did raise suspicions.
Shawnee County prosecutor Jacqie Spradling nevertheless won the initial 2012 trial, but did so by lying to the jury about nonexistent evidence. The state Supreme Court overturned that conviction and disbarred Spradling from the practice of law.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Hailey-Seel-daughter-to-chandler-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 21:03:14.611521

(Photo by Lauren Harrison, Colorado State University)On the morning of July 23, 2024, visitors to Biscuit Basin, about 2 miles northeast of Old Faithful Geyser, had to scramble for safety as a hydrothermal explosion occurred from Black Diamond Pool. The plume from the explosion rose 400–600 feet into the air, was visible for miles, and threw rocks that destroyed the nearby boardwalk and littered the landscape with debris.
The rock ejected by the explosion was made up of glacial debris, sandstone and siltstone, all of which are part of the geological deposit that makes up the immediate subsurface. None of the rhyolite bedrock was found, indicating that the explosion was rooted at very shallow levels (probably within 100 feet of the surface).

The main debris field (within dashed yellow line) has a gray appearance. (Photo by Joe Bueter/Yellowstone National Park) 
Also present in the debris was impermeable silica that was probably lining the hot water conduits feeding Black Diamond Pool. Silica is dissolved in much of the water that feeds Yellowstone hot springs and geysers, and as that water nears the surface and cools, the silica precipitates out as a solid. It can coat the conduits and, because it is impermeable, can seal the system.
This can cause pressure to build and might eventually lead to an explosion, like the one that occurred on July 23, 2024.
In the weeks and months following the explosion, scientists from several institutions collaborated to install temporary monitoring stations around Black Diamond Pool, including trail cameras, seismometers, acoustic sensors and electromagnetic instruments. The cameras often recorded changes — for example, that new rocks had been ejected from the pool — and the seismometers and acoustic sensors detected several dozen eruptions from the pool.
Some of the eruptions were associated with surges of water that knocked over seismic nodes and moved them from their original locations or partially buried them in silt.
At least two small eruptions, expelling water, mud and small rocks 20–30 feet into the air, were witnessed since the July 23, 2024, explosion. One occurred on Nov. 5, 2024, while scientists were collecting gas samples. Another took place on Jan. 3, 2025, and was observed by a tour group that was passing by the area.

Since the July 23, 2024, explosion, Biscuit Basin has been closed to public visitation as Yellowstone National Park assesses damage and the potential for future hazardous events. To aid with the assessment, on May 14, 2025, Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientists installed a new webcam in Biscuit Basin. Static images from the camera are publicly available at https://www.usgs.gov/media/webcams/biscuit-basin-webcam, with images updated every 15 minutes.
The camera is a temporary deployment installed on the damaged boardwalk, so the picture is somewhat tilted due to the slope of the boardwalk itself. Nevertheless, the view of Black Diamond Pool is clear, and the camera has pan, tilt and zoom capabilities that allow the frame to be adjusted if activity warrants.
Because the deployment is not intended to be permanent, the camera might fail due to problems with power or telemetry systems. If this happens, we will work to get the camera back online as soon as possible. The camera is intended to operate at least throughout the summer of 2025, and if warranted may be hardened to last throughout the winter months.
Bandwidth at the site is not sufficient at this time to support live streaming, but video is being recorded on site. If the static images document the occurrence of an event (based on the appearance of new rocks or wet ground, for example), video can be downloaded for analysis. If any such events are captured, we’ll be sure to post video clips to the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory website.
We hope that this new view is of interest to the public, and we are confident it will provide a new perspective on activity at Black Diamond Pool that will be useful for the ongoing assessment of hazards from the area. Many thanks to Yellowstone National Park for supporting this deployment, which was completed under research permit YELL-2025-SCI-5842.
Biscuit Basin remains closed due to the damaged caused on July 23, 2024, as well as hazards posed by potential future hazardous hydrothermal events. So for those who would like a current close-up view of Black Diamond Pool, check out the observatory’s new camera!

(Photo by Travel South Dakota)Hunters bagged more pheasants last fall in South Dakota than they have for 13 years, the state department of Game, Fish and Parks said Thursday.
More than 1.3 million roosters were harvested during the 2024 pheasant hunting season, the department said, with another 380,000 harvested within defined shooting preserves.
“The 2024 South Dakota pheasant season was absolutely spectacular,” South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden said in a press release.
South Dakota, the governor said, is “truly the greatest state to pheasant hunt.” The state saw more roosters harvested in two weeks of October 2024 than any other state during their entire season, the release says.
South Dakota’s postseason pheasant harvest figures come from 15,000 random surveys of resident hunters and 13,000 nonresident hunters, the Mitchell Daily Republic reported Tuesday. Questions include the number of days hunted, areas hunted and how many birds were harvested are all part of the survey.
Pheasants Forever launches new initiative to expand outdoor access in South Dakota

More than a million birds have been harvested in each of the past five years in South Dakota, but Upland Game Biologist Alex Solem of the parks department told the Republic that 2024 stood out.
“Our over-winter survival was absolutely phenomenal,” Solem told the Mitchell publication. “It was certainly evident just driving around this spring, tons of roosters crowing everywhere, lots of hens selecting those roosters for mating purposes.
Pheasant hunting is an economic engine for South Dakota. Pheasants Forever, a private conservation organization, put the financial impact of the 2023 pheasant season on the state’s economy at $281 million.
The release from Game, Fish and Parks on Tuesday did not include a financial impact estimate of the 2024 pheasant season, instead focusing on bird harvest numbers. Hunters averaged approximately nine birds per hunter, said Kevin Robling, secretary for the parks department.
“Habitat and access have been a top priority for the department, and that has played a key role in both abundant bird numbers and ample locations for hunters to target them,” Robling said in the press release.
Landowners and farmers partner through habitat programs to open conservation land, using programs offered by the State of South Dakota, the federal government, and multiple conservation groups.
Pheasants Forever partnered with the state in 2023 to pay landowners additional stipends for enrolling land in conservation programs, with the goal of adding 10,000 acres a year.
In the press release on the 2024 pheasant harvest, Robling pointed specifically to the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) on the James River and Big Sioux River valleys, which provides the benefits of the long-standing Conservation Reserve Program, but also ensures access for hunters. 
“These CREP lands are directly in the primary pheasant range and provide high quality grassland habitat and access as well,” added Robling.
The 2025 pheasant season in South Dakota will take place Oct. 18 to Jan. 31, 2026.

But the amended version passed with bipartisan support.,"A bill that increases consumer protections for mobile home residents was stripped of any references to rent caps or fee limits and passed the House of Representatives on Tuesday evening.
Lawmakers spent hours discussing House Bill 5428 last week, only to end debate without a vote after Republicans opposed limits to annual rent increases. After Democrats amended the bill, it passed with bipartisan support 132-16.
“This bill will still deliver critical consumer protections to some of our most vulnerable residents in Connecticut, so I urge my colleagues to support this bill and stand up for Connecticut’s manufactured home communities,” said Rep. Rebecca Martinez, D-Plainville, the bill’s proponent.
The House proposal would require park owners to disclose any ancillary fees, such as extra costs to own a pet or have a washer and dryer, ahead of time, and increase relocation payments for residents from $10,000 to $20,000 if the owner sells the park with the intent to turn it into something else, among other measures.
It would also require that park owners test the power of fire hydrants on their properties and report the results to fire marshals, a measure added in the wake of two fires at parks in East Hartford that were difficult to control because the hydrants didn’t have enough water pressure.
In recent years there has been a push from homeowners to get legislation passed that would limit rent increases and address other quality of life and safety concerns at mobile home parks.
The parks are typically occupied by people 55 years and older and are a lower-cost way to buy a home.
“The revised version, as I understand it, eliminates many of the concerning pieces,” said Rep. Steve Weir, R-Hebron. Weir was one of the most vocal opponents of the bill last week, but Tuesday voted in favor.
In its earlier form, the bill would have limited annual rent increases to 2% of rent plus any increases in the annual consumer price index and provide a process for park owners to appeal that limit in particular cases. It also would have limited ancillary fees to $15 annually.
As debate went on last week, Democrats decided to pull the bill from consideration, and leadership said they realized it was going to be talked about for a long time. As the session draws to its Wednesday close, the minority party has more power by talking longer and limiting the number of bills that get passed or killing bills entirely with the promise of a filibuster.
The bill is part of a larger push over the past few years to improve the quality of life and limit housing cost growth at mobile and manufactured home parks, which are typically occupied by seniors. In most mobile home parks, the resident owns the actual structure but not the land it sits on.
Land rents have risen for Connecticut residents over the past few years as more investor-owned and large companies purchase the parks.
In 2023, Connecticut lawmakers passed a law that aimed to make it easier for residents to buy their parks. If a property goes up for sale, resident associations must be offered the chance to match any offers and purchase their park.
But residents have said owners have found ways around that law by creating complicated purchasing structures or selling the parks as part of a package of several properties.
The bill next heads to the Senate for a vote.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4443-2-1024x665.jpg,,,2025-06-03 21:03:14.611521

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)EXIRA — “We did run out of water at our house … and that’s not the first time we’ve had dry pipes,” Emmy Benton said to State Auditor Rob Sand at the Exira Public Library during a discussion about recent water system shortages and boil advisories. 
Sand listened to the concerns as part of a gubernatorial campaign swing through rural Iowa, but problems for Exira, and other customers on Regional Water Rural Water Association’s system, have been ongoing for several years.

Tom Kallman, the association’s general manager, said since the flood of 2019 water tables in the region have been 10-12 inches below average, and the persistent drought conditions have meant no replenishment for groundwater stores.
Customers in the system have been on water conservation advisories during most of this time, and since May 14 have been on advisories to boil all drinking water after shortages created a loss of pressure from the systems. The recent advisory has led to frustration with the system, especially in Exira. 
Boil advisories for almost all of the system have been lifted following negative sampling results, and Regional Water is now looking to a nearly completed pipeline connection to Council Bluffs to adequately supply water to the system.  Exira officials and residents, however, are skeptical that this will be the end of their water-related problems. 
Hindsight on a stressed water supply
Exira officials allege Regional Water oversold the system, which has led to their perennial water issues. 
Kellman said “that was not the case” but that drought conditions in eight of the last 10 years have created a situation which no one predicted.
“If they had known (then) what you know now, 20 years later, they would have probably made a different decision,” said Kellman, who has been with the association for nearly four years, referring to previous management.

Regional Water Rural Water Association has 2,600 connections and serves around 750 square miles in Shelby, Pottawattamie, Audubon, Cass and Harrison Counties.
 Exira is the newest addition to the system, according to Kellman, and came on in 2005 after an engineering study revealed it would be more cost effective for the town to join the rural water district than to rehabilitate its failing water treatment system. 
Meg Andersen, Exira’s city clerk, said the city of 763 people could not fund a solution without the help of funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development office which were only available if the city decided to join Regional Water, to which they signed a 40-year agreement. 
“You have no option,” Andersen said. “And now all of a sudden, we’re realizing this is an unsustainable source.”
But the past three years, especially, have left the town frustrated with their perennial water issues.
“We’re not trying to fight — we want to make sure that the people in this town have water,” Andersen said. “It’s a right and a basic human need.” 
Connecting to Council Bluffs
Kellman said the system has relied almost entirely on its shallow well field, which has made the most sense, given that the region does not have a surface-water source sufficient enough to tap. The association explored drilling a deep well, but found it would require drilling down between 2,000 and 3,000 feet, with just a 40% chance of striking water.
The other option, which the system decided to pursue, involves an 18-mile pipeline to connect with the system in Council Bluffs and pump water into Regional Water’s system. 
Kellman said the pipeline project was approved for federal funding and construction began last October. A temporary pump for the station is projected to be completed on or about June 11th and will bring some respite to the wells and customers in the system. The permanent pump for the system should be completed by October 2025. 
“We’ll be able to serve everybody without having to be in any kind of water restrictions,” Kellman said of the expected result of the pipeline project. 


Kellman said drought was the primary reason the wells are no longer able to meet demand, but he also pointed to the consistent use and installation of drainage tile to agricultural fields as part of the problem. 
He said tile is great for farmers, as it drains excess water from their fields, but in doing so, it stops the natural process of water filtering through the soil to replenish the stores from which utilities can draw water. 


Council Bluffs has an abundance of water, as its source is the Missouri River. 
Andersen said that while the town of Exira hopes the Council Bluffs project will be successful in alleviating their water problems, she is skeptical. 
“The questions we’ve asked in the past three years — we have never been given transparent, clear, concise answers to, and they change,” Andersen said. 
Her mistrust of the association has been exacerbated by a lack of clear, or consistent communication between Regional Water and the city.
“We’re told ‘you have to communicate,’ but they don’t even give us a call when we get put into a boil advisory,” Andersen said. 
She said the association has also given conflicting answers on how Exira rates would be impacted by the pipeline expansion, which makes it difficult for a city with slim margins to plan its budgets. 
“We’ve said we want to work towards a solution, to negotiate these things, but it doesn’t seem like much is coming to the table from the other side,” Andersen said. 
Since the town is locked into a 40-year contract with Regional Water, and its own water treatment facility has been sold, Exira is left with few options. The city sent a demand letter to Regional Water and is exploring legal options to leave the contract. 
Sand says “Exira matters” 
In the meantime, some residents, like Benton, who lives west of the city limits, have decided to reactivate their own wells. 
Other residents, like Claire and Blake Asberry, wonder whether they’ll be able to realize their plans of opening a coffee shop and mercantile in town, or if they’ll be able to find tenants for the adjoining apartments when potable water is a question.

Sand, a Democrat from Decorah, listened to the experiences of the Exira residents and said it should be a crisis to which state leaders pay more attention. 
“Exira matters,” Sand said. “I think anyone in Iowa that’s facing problems like this should have their problems fixed. Government is supposed to work for everybody.” 
Sand took issue with the expensive steps city officials said they would have to complete in order to change the current situation. 
“Instead of prioritizing the process, prioritize the people,” Sand said. 
Kellman said customers have been under water restrictions for the “better part of three years” and he understands the frustration. 
“It gets old after a while, and I get that because I’m on this system,” Kellman said. “It’s not our intention to try and deny people water. On the contrary, we want everybody to have as much water as they need, as much water as they would like.” 
The towns impacted by the May 14 boil advisory included Avoca, Persia, Panama, Portsmouth, Westphalia, Kirkman, Tennant, Earling, Exira and Brayton.
While boil advisories for all of the impacted towns aside from Panama and Portsmouth had been lifted as of Tuesday afternoon, the customers are still under “level yellow” water-use restrictions which means they are asked to avoid watering lawns, washing cars, filling pools, cleaning streets or sidewalks, and school physical education activities that require showering. 
Kellman said the system is “almost there.” 
“I’d love for people to be able to fill their pools in their backyard for their kids,” Kellman said. “At some point we’re going to be able to do that, and it’s a lot closer now than it was two years ago.” 
Andersen said the Council Bluffs pipeline would be a “best-case scenario.” 
“We haven’t had a best-case scenario in over three years,” Andersen said. “We’re not opposed to it working — we’re looking for a solution that ensures sustainability and longevity of a safe water source for the city.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)State officials celebrated on Tuesday the groundbreaking of a $1 billion modernization project of Green Bay Packaging’s decades-old Kraft plant in Morrilton, Central Arkansas’ largest capital investment, according to the governor. 
The plant’s $1 billion reinvestment will see key equipment replacements and infrastructure upgrades, along with expansions. The plant will add 35 new jobs to its existing 620 person workforce in Conway County as well. 
The multi-year project includes the acquisition of about 300 acres of land for future investments and expansion, according to an Arkansas Economic Development press release. 
Headquartered in Wisconsin, Green Bay Packaging is a manufacturing company consisting of shipping container plants, a folding carton facility and a sawmill facility, among other things, according to the release. Green Bay Packaging has five facilities in Central Arkansas, including the Kraft Paper Mill, which could have its production capacity more than doubled by the project.
Company executives touted the efficiency and sustainability of the plant’s future, telling attendees at Tuesday’s groundbreaking that they would produce 90% of the plant’s needed power thanks to the new investments.

Brad Harville, general manager of Green Bay Packaging’s Arkansas Kraft Division, pointed to the cold snap of 2021 as a major reason why self-sufficient power generation was so important for the company, noting that they were beholden to the energy generation of others.
“We learned that an arctic blast is not simply a cup of ice cream from Sonic,” Harville said. When the power grid struggled to meet demand, it affected plant operations, and “we were a slave to whatever was available,” he said.
The company plans to install a new turbine generator, which will help provide power and cut greenhouse gas emissions, according to the release.
The project will use the most modern available technology, which will allow the company to continue making “the finest quality” material at a “competitive price with a sustainable footprint,” Harville said.
Green Bay’s CEO, Will Cress, said he was present at the plant’s groundbreaking decades ago as a boy, and didn’t “really understand the significance” of it at the time.
“But now that we’ve had 60 years of good times, mostly good times, here in Arkansas, and the impact that we’ve had in Arkansas and the impact that Arkansas has had on our company is not lost on me today,” Cress said. 
He added that the investment will have a “long-lasting impact” on the local community, the state and his company. 
“In a situation like this, there’s no end to the thank-yous that you have to deliver,” he said.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders was in attendance Tuesday, along with multiple state legislators, Department of Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward and Department of Commerce Secretary Hugh McDonald. She highlighted the state’s business-friendly policies and taxes while thanking Green Bay for its decision to revamp its Kraft plant.
“Our administration and our team are moving quickly to make sure we tell the Arkansas success story,” Sanders said. “They [Green Bay Packaging] need a partner that is just as flexible as they are. Arkansas has made clear we will be that partner. It’s not just in government, where we’ve cut taxes in the past two years.

(Photo courtesy of University of Florida)In a stunning move, the panel that oversees Florida’s state university system voted against hiring Santa Ono as the next president for the University of Florida during an extended special meeting Tuesday. 
The State University System Board of Governors voted against Ono in a 6-10 vote that followed hours of contentious questioning and debate where Ono was grilled over his past positions on diversity equity and inclusion.
The vote comes a week after UF trustees approved Ono, the immediate past-president of the University of Michigan and sole finalist for the job, which would have paid him a $3 million annual package that included $1.5 million base salary 
After conducting a months-long search, UF remains without a permanent president. Former UF President Kent Fuchs has been serving as interim president since former President Ben Sasse resigned last year.
Approving Ono was the only item discussed during the board meeting, which ran nearly two hours longer than originally scheduled. Some members compared the vetting to a court interrogation.
Members mainly asked about Ono’s changing stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and how he could carry out Florida’s agenda denouncing DEI, but delved into other topics, like a Christian’s interpretation of original sin and Gov. Ron DeSantis’ COVID-19 response. 
“It’s insidious that it feels like pushing a rope uphill when we establish these policies, if a president doesn’t really believe in those policies,” Board of Governors Vice Chair Alan Levine said during the meeting in Orlando. “And it’s a powerful position, you can be an inhibitor, or you can help advance. And so I guess so much of your record reflects your deeply held beliefs, that you have been an advocate of DEI up until recently.”

Ono supported diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the University of Michigan, one of the top-ranked public institutions in the country, guiding its “DEI 2.0” initiative and touting benefits of such programs but ultimately closed DEI offices earlier this year.
“It looks to me like you got rid of the program because you needed to do what you had to do with the president’s orders and the funding issues. But you didn’t really push to get rid of DEI,” Levine said. 
Ono replied with an answer he uttered several times, that he began looking at DEI when he took office at Michigan, rather than an immediate decision after Trump’s executive order. 
Ono told UF trustees last week that he developed his new stance on DEI in the last year and a half after talking with students and other members of the university community. Before, he wasn’t an expert on the topic, which had been universal in higher education, he said, and told trustees his conviction is “rock solid.”
Ono said he mirrors Florida’s evolution with accepting, and then rejecting, DEI.
“For anyone who believes Dr. Ono’s earlier views on DEI, views that many university leaders and civic organizations once shared, are disqualifying despite his evolution and the changes made under his leadership at Michigan, I would remind you that this body adopted DEI strategic priorities as recently as 2020. Like Michigan, the Board of Governors has evolved since,” BOG member Charles Lydecker said, adding that Ono’s previous positions on the topics governors were concerned about “are not meaningfully different from those previously held by this board.”
“The real question is this: Should we punish someone for evolving beyond a view this very body once held, especially when that person has already led one of the nation’s most prominent universities to a different course, a course that mirrors our own?” Lydecker said.
Lydecker added that “There is something fundamentally unjust about cancel culture, and to cancel Dr. Ono would not only be unjust, it would be a setback for the University of Florida.”

‘Forum to interrogate’
The degree of vetting from governors Tuesday was not typical, and is the first time the Board of Governors has rejected a president, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
“I’ve been on this board for five, six years, and we have never used this as a forum to interrogate. And in this case, it feels to me patently unfair,” Lydecker said after former House Speaker and now-BOG member Paul Renner put documents in front of Ono about his past.
At one point, BOG member Eric Silagy asked if any of the governors had expressed interest in the UF presidency.

Mori Hosseini, the chair of the UF Board of Trustees, said yes.
He acknowledged Renner reached out to him asking about the job.  Renner insisted that he reached out to to Hosseini before he was on the BOG. Renner said he would not take the UF job if offered now that he’s on the BOG.
Renner did not recuse himself, although, and voted against Ono.
Ono told the BOG he had made 12 commitments, which include ideological neutrality, solely merit-based hiring and admissions, keeping the university aligned with state government, and upholding state laws and university regulations. He said he asked for those provisions to be included in his contract.
“Doctor, your recent reversal on an entire architecture of ideology is nothing short of incredible,” BOG member and former House Speaker Jose Oliva said. Oliva also voted against Ono. 
Hosseini, stood by Ono’s candidacy, and sat next to him during the “interrogation.”
“The bottom line is that Dr. Ono is globally recognized as one of the most respected leaders in higher education, and we are lucky to have him,” Hosseini said. 
Ono was previously president of the University of British Columbia and the University of Cincinnati.

GOP pushback
The GOP pushback mounted high enough to reject Ono, who had already stepped down as Michigan’s president.
U.S. Rep. and GOP gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds posted to X questions related to DEI that he encouraged BOG members to ask, and Rick Scott did the same, Monday evening releasing a statement and questions concerning Ono’s commitment to protecting Jewish students. 
After the vote, Scott called the vote “the right decision,” and U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis said “I’m happy to see the system work.”
Donald Trump Jr. posted to X “WTF! Have the decision makers at @UF lost their minds!???” calling on BOG members to vote against Ono. 
U.S. Rep. Greg Steube sent a letter to BOG members, asking them to reject Ono, “and find a suitable replacement who truly represents Florida values.” After the UF trustees’ meeting last week, Steube said “I’m not sold” on Ono “walking back his woke past.”
The governor’s office appoints six of 13 of the university trustees at each institution and 14 of the 17 BOG members.
“The Board of Governors has a strong history of affirming presidential nominees who received unanimous approval from their university boards to continue this practice sends a message that the Board of Governors values the opinion of their colleagues with the state university system and does not yield to outsiders who post out of context sound bites on social media,” Hosseini said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-05-27_BOT-Meeting-Santa-Ono-20-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 20:05:07.359343

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Striking Butler Hospital workers may not have a job to return to if and when their strike ends, according to an email sent by the psychiatric hospital’s president on Monday.   
Butler President and COO Mary E. Marran informed the hospital’s roughly 800 unionized members of SEIU 1199 NE that while management “will continue to work toward a fair and respectful resolution” in bargaining talks for a new contract, the hospital “must also ensure that we fulfill our commitment to providing safe, high-quality care to our patients.”
That means hiring permanent replacements to fill the roles left empty due to the striking workers’ absence, Marran wrote in her email Monday and confirmed in a followup statement supplied Tuesday to media outlets.
“We sincerely hoped this step would not become necessary,” Marran wrote. “However, as we are now into the third week of SEIU 1199 NE’s strike, we believe this action is essential to ensure continuity of patient care and maintain the stability of our services.”
Marran added that, to comply with federal law, “striking employees who have been permanently replaced will not return to work once the strike ends.” Instead the hospital will add those workers to a “preferential hire list,” Marran wrote, and they can apply for open positions as they become available. 
Workers have been on strike since May 15, protesting what they allege are unfair labor practices as they rally for better wages and workplace protections in their search for a new set of contracts. Four different contracts covered a range of SEIU 1199 NE  members working at Butler, including mental health staff, nurses, clerical workers, and custodial and dietary employees.
All four of the contracts expired on March 31, and negotiating talks stalled first on May 7, prompting workers to head to the picket line about a week later.
Marran maintained that the hospital will “welcome employees back to work at any time,” a sentiment she’s offered since the strike began. 
Butler began hiring temporary labor shortly after the strike began. Raina C. Smith, a spokesperson for Care New England, which owns the Providence hospital, told Rhode Island Current last week that the cost for temporary replacement labor was already “millions.”
All four of the contracts expired on March 31, and negotiating talks stalled first on May 7, prompting workers to head to the picket line about a week later.
Last week, negotiators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) arrived in Rhode Island to help the two parties reach an agreement, but two marathon negotiating sessions on May 29 and May 30 yielded no results. 
The two parties are set to reconvene at the bargaining table Wednesday, with the FMCS participating once again.
“We are well aware that Butler is using all tactics available to them to break us but what they are actually doing is making us stronger,” Dawn Williams, a registered nurse in the hospital’s intensive treatment unit and a member of the union’s negotiating committee, said in an email Tuesday. 
“We are headed into negotiations tomorrow with the hope that we will come out with a fair contract but we are willing to stay out for as long as it takes to get the dignity and respect our staff and patients deserve,” Williams said.
Plans to hire permanent replacements were confirmed the same day striking workers marched on Care New England’s Providence headquarters to demand a new contract. Two days earlier, on May 31, employees’ health coverage ended, and workers have begun signing up for insurance via the state marketplace, according to the union.
 Marran published a statement Tuesday to the ButlerInfoForYou.org website that has served as a landing point for the hospital’s perspective on the negotiating process. She wrote that she understands the “emotions behind the strike — your calls for change come from a place of care, of wanting Butler to be better for you, for our patients, and for the future.”
“I respect your voices,” said Marran, who wrote that she worked as an occupational therapist at the hospital four decades ago. “But advocating for what matters is most effective when rooted in common interest, not division.”
The hospital’s most recent proposals have been regularly uploaded to the website. Marran summarized management’s four-year offer, including pay raises — up to 40% for the lowest-paid staff — and a no-premium health plan option with partial health savings account funding for the first three years. The most recent offer also stipulates no pension changes for current employees plus a new retirement benefit for future hires, according to Marran.
Amelia Abromaitis, a spokesperson for SEIU 1199 NE, did not immediately have a copy of the union’s counterproposals to share on Tuesday.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)After years of stalling at the committee level, legislation banning the sale and manufacturing of assault-style weapons in Rhode Island starting in July 2026 is headed to the House floor for the first time in legislative history.
The House Committee on Judiciary voted 12-6 Tuesday to advance the amended bill by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, for consideration by the full chamber on Thursday.
The historic vote drew rare attendance from Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and House Majority Leader Christopher Blazejewski, who used their ex-officio role on all House Committees to participate in the vote. All of the state’s general officers have already expressed support for the bill. 
“This is a very historic and important bill,” Shekarchi told reporters after the meeting. “It’s a bill that accomplishes what we wanted to do: To take these weapons off the street.”
Knight’s bill would prohibit the sale and manufacturing of assault-style shotguns, handguns, and rifles beginning July 1, 2026. Violators of the proposed ban would face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and forfeiting their assault-style weapons.
The bill applies to any semiautomatic firearm that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least one attachment such as stocks, pistol grips, and barrel shrouds.
Certain .22 caliber rimfire rifles and Olympic-style target pistols would remain exempt from the proposed ban.



How the committee voted on the proposed assault weapons ban
Yes votes came from Chairman Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat; Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat; Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat; Rep. Edith Ajello, a Providence Democrat; Rep. José Batista, a Providence Democrat; Rep. Justine Caldwell, an East Greenwich Democrat; Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat; Rep. Cherie Cruz, a Pawtucket Democrat; Rep. Matthew Dawson, an East Providence Democrat; Rep. Leonela Felix, a Pawtucket Democrat; House Majority Leader Christopher Blazejewski, a Providence Democrat; and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat.
No votes came from Rep. David Bennett, a Warwick Democrat; Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat; Rep. Marie Hopkins, a Warwick Republican; Rep Thomas Noret, a Coventry, Democrat; Rep. David Place; a Burrillville Republican; and House Minority Leader Michael Chippendale, a Foster Republican.



Knight said the latest definition was based on feedback the committee received during the bill’s initial hearing on March 29. But lawmakers — both Republican and Democrat — still voiced numerous concerns with the amended legislation Tuesday, while gun rights advocates in yellow T-shirts listened silently in the audience.
Rep. David Bennett, a Warwick Democrat, asked if there were any carveouts for orthopedic pistol grips. No, Knight responded.
“That’s too bad,” Bennett said.
But Knight said gun owners can still purchase firearms with any of the outlawed features if they are purchased ahead of the proposed ban, along with any firearm passed down through a family.
Firearm owners can voluntarily register their weapons with state and local police in order to receive a certificate of possession. Knight’s original bill had mandated that grandfathered weapons be registered, which Second Amendment advocates called unconstitutional.
The voluntary certification did not appease House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale, a Foster Republican. He argued that certification would be necessary to prove ownership in the event of a police arrest.
“That sounds like a registry with a different name,” Chippendale said.
Rep. Thomas Noret, a Coventry Democrat, said he was concerned that the bill could criminalize people who post photos of themselves with guns they don’t own on social media.
“That mere second that they possess it — it could potentially ruin their lives,” he said.
Knight responded that law enforcement already uses social media posts as evidence and that police always have the discretion to not file charges. 
Rep. David Place, a Burrillville Republican, argued that passing the bill will not reduce gun violence, and suggested it would disproportionately penalize people of color.
“No one that looks like me is going to be sent to jail for this bill unless I fire on somebody who comes to my door,” he said. “We move this bill out of fear at the expense of individual liberty.”
Rhode Island Republican Party Chairman Joe Powers called Knight’s legislation “a political Trojan horse.”
“It’s designed to look like public safety, but it’s nothing more than government overreach wrapped in fear-mongering,” Powers said in a statement. “They’re hoping you won’t notice your rights being stripped away, one inch at a time.”

Gun safety advocates celebrated the committee’s vote.
“Our advocates and partners have worked tirelessly for more than a decade in the name of public safety and we are thrilled to have made it this far in the legislative process,” Melissa Carden, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence, said in a statement.
Tony Morettini, legislative chapter lead for Moms Demand Action, said he’s hopeful the bill will clear the full House.
“A chamber passing it sends a big message,” he said.
That message, he said, will be directed across the rotunda to the Rhode Island Senate where the proposal remains uncertain. 
Companion legislation filed in the Senate by Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, has 23 additional sponsors, including Senate President Valarie Lawson. 
DiPalma’s bill was heard by the Senate Committee on Judiciary on May 14 where it was held for further study. Three Democrats who serve on the committee voiced opposition to the proposal during the initial hearing on DiPalma’s bill.
Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat and federal firearms dealer, has also voiced opposition to banning assault-style weapons as initially drafted.
Lawson did not immediately respond to request for comment on where the proposed ban lies on her list of priorities.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has appointed a former Utah Attorney General’s Office attorney to fill a new role that will be a key decision-maker over which government records do — and don’t — become public. 
Cox picked Lonny Pehrson, who most recently worked as records counsel for the Utah Attorney General’s Office, to be the first director of the state’s newly created Government Records Office. His nomination will be subject to consent from the Utah Senate. 
“We look forward to the Government Records Office streamlining the appeals process and helping Utahns get timely answers to their records requests,” Cox said in a prepared statement. “Lonny Pehrson’s legal expertise and commitment to good governance make him the right person to lead this important effort.”
Pehrson said he’s “honored” for Cox’s nomination “and truly appreciate the trust and responsibility it entails.” 
Utah lawmakers look to dissolve, replace State Records Committee. Here’s why that matters

“I look forward to establishing the Government Records Office which will better facilitate access to government records in accordance with the law,” Pehrson said in a prepared statement.
Earlier this year, the Utah Legislature voted to approve SB277, which dissolved and replaced the 30-year-old, seven-member State Records Committee with a single decision-maker. At the time, the bill’s sponsor, Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, said the change is meant to address “inefficiencies,” cut down on wait times for records decisions, and replace the State Records Committee with someone with more “legal experience.” 
Critics, including media professionals, argued the move would consolidate too much power with one person and lead to less transparency. The Society of Professional Journalists awarded the Utah Legislature its annual Black Hole award for the passage SB277, along with another, HB69, which made it difficult for people who challenge the government over public records denials to recoup their attorney fees. 
Pehrson, in his new role, will now decide appeals to records requests that have been denied. He’ll be responsible for adjudicating records appeals hearings and supervising the Government Records Ombudsman and staff. 
“He will also serve as a resource to citizens and governmental entities regarding government records management, ensuring lawful access to records and information, and leading a team that conducts statewide training in records and information management,” a news release issued Monday by the Division of Archives and Records Service said. 
‘Disregard for transparency’: Utah Legislature’s public records laws earn it a ‘Black Hole’ award

Pehrson, in his previous role as records counsel for then-Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, argued against releasing Reyes’ calendar in response to requests from local news outlets KSL and The Salt Lake Tribune. 
The State Records Committee ultimately sided with reporters, and in February a judge ruled that Reyes’ work calendar should be released. The same day as the judge’s ruling, however, the Utah Legislature passed a bill to allow elected officials and government employees the ability to keep their calendars — including work meetings — private moving forward. 
Reyes didn’t seek reelection last year after concerns surfaced over his past relationship with  the embattled anti-trafficking nonprofit Operation Underground Railroad and its founder, Tim Ballard. Earlier this year, a legislative audit of Reyes’ administration concluded that “insufficient transparency” resulted in “a lack of accountability for the position of the attorney general.” 
State leaders, however, applaud Pehrson as an expert in Utah’s public records law, the Government Records Access and Management Act (GRAMA).
Kenneth Williams, director of the Utah Division of Archives and Records Service and state archivist, said in a statement that his department is “thrilled” to welcome Pehrson. 
“I have worked with Lonny for several years and know that his expertise in records law and dedication to public service will be invaluable as we continue to ensure appropriate and reliable access to government records for the people of Utah,” Williams said.

She told […]","The number of children in foster care in Kansas has steadily declined in recent years, reaching its lowest number in the past five years, according to recent data from the Department for Children and Families that was presented to a legislative oversight committee on June 2, 2025. (Kansas Department for Children and Families)TOPEKA — A 6-year-old boy in Kansas’ foster care system has spent 48 nights in an office and 40 nights in a hospital in the past three months.
“And most likely will be in my office again tonight,” said Brenda Watkins, president of EmberHope Connections, the contracted foster care agency in Sedgwick County.
She told lawmakers on the child welfare oversight committee Monday that the boy, who entered EmberHope’s care in early February, is one of 15 children in recent months who have spent at least one night in an office.
Children spending nights in offices, called failure to place, were explicitly barred under the settlement that came out of a 2018 lawsuit on behalf of Kansas foster children against three state agencies. The agreement outlined benchmarks that state agencies and foster care contractors, including EmberHope, must meet.
Foster care in Sedgwick County, home to Kansas’ most populous city, has proved more challenging than in the rest of the state. It has the most foster care providers, the most congregate care and the most foster families, but fewer than 50% of foster kids are in stable places, Watkins said.
EmberHope, despite making initial progress, has been unable to reduce its failure to place numbers.
It previously asked the child welfare committee to help fund a study to figure out how to expand foster care capacity in Sedgwick County, “but now we urge the committee to assist with finding and funding immediate solutions,” Watkins said in written testimony.
EmberHope took over as the area’s contracted case management provider in July after the Kansas Department for Children and Families ditched Saint Francis Ministries, which was plagued with accusations of fraud and inadequate resources. Saint Francis still serves parts of Kansas as one of the state’s five contractors.
EmberHope serves the largest number of foster children in the state. As of March 30, more than 5,600 were in foster care, according to DCF data. From January through March, EmberHope served 1,770 kids. The organization inherited a “pretty bad situation,” said Brenna Visocsky, campaign director with advocacy and research organization Kansas Appleseed.
“But things need to change,” Visocsky said Tuesday in an interview.
Wichita is home to the highest population of families in the state experiencing poverty, and Visocsky questions what dynamics are causing so many to be placed in foster care in the first place.
“Some kids are experiencing some really significant behavioral struggles, and I worry that too often when we have conversations about those kiddos, we’re putting onus on those children, to some degree,” Visocsky said.
Instead of an overwhelmed system, Visocsky would like to see preventative measures so families can get what they need before their children enter the system. Bolstering access to social services such as parenting classes, food assistance, mental health services and housing support can accomplish that, she said. Addressing needs now, Visocsky said, has the potential to halt generational cycles of trauma and poverty.
Kansas Appleseed was involved in the 2018 class action lawsuit against state agencies. It has also been involved in legislative advocacy including the creation of the Office of Child Advocate and supporting the SOUL family program, which allows foster children who are at least 16 years old to select a trusted adult as a caregiver, expanding options for care.
However, foster home and care facility options are dwindling in Sedgwick County, heightening the state’s placement crisis. Some facilities have implemented admission holds or decreased services, Watkins said. Those losses are deepened by inadequate staffing, a lack of social workers, an “extreme concern” for staff and child safety, a rise in cost in liability insurance, long mental health wait lists and inadequate mental health care access.
“It is very difficult to find high-quality staff who have the knowledge, skills and tools to be successful with these youth and to want to endure what a typical day may look like, you know, working with some of these kids,” Watkins said.
Some committee members and agency heads were sympathetic and eager to facilitate improvements for children in EmberHope’s care, but existing strategies to address some of the organization’s challenges are continuing to unfold.
More than half of the children who spent nights in an EmberHope office between January and March were 12 years old or younger, signaling a decrease in the ages of children EmberHope is unable to place.
“Certainly, we are very worried at this point about some of the trending that we are seeing,” Watkins said.
Another troubling signal was a higher-than-normal bounce rate. Bouncing refers to unstable placements, in which children bounce from place to place each night.
Typically, between 30 and 40 kids daily are in unstable placements. In recent weeks, it’s been about 60 kids, which is the highest number EmberHope has seen since its contract began last July.
New referrals and emergency removals are also on the rise, Watkins said. 
“We are concerned that the placement crisis is worsening across the state,” she wrote in a report to the committee, “most significantly in Sedgwick County.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-03-at-6.06.49 PM-1024x529.png,,,2025-06-03 20:05:07.359343

House Appropriations Chairman John Bear takes inspiration from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal jobs and spending. 
The post Wyoming Freedom Caucus plans on ‘DOGE-ing’ state budget appeared first on WyoFile .","Several months into the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal jobs and spending, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus is taking inspiration from the Department of Government Efficiency as it sets priorities for the legislative off-season that’s now underway. 
“DOGE-ing Wyoming’s budget by identifying unconstitutional and wasteful spending” sits at the top of the further-right group’s list of priorities, according to an April press release.  
In the months between sessions, known as the interim, much of the Legislature’s work is accomplished as lawmaker committees meet to work through topics with stakeholders, gather public testimony and draft committee bills. In odd-numbered years, legislators also begin crafting the state’s next two-year budget. That’s one area in particular where the Freedom Caucus would like to use DOGE as a model. 
“I think there’s a huge desire to see waste, fraud and abuse tracked down and eliminated,” House Appropriations Chairman Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, told WyoFile. Bear previously chaired the Freedom Caucus. 
“It’s only natural that a bureaucracy would have waste, fraud and abuse. And if we try to turn a blind eye to it as a government, it does a disservice to the taxpayers,” Bear said. 
While the Appropriations Committee will dedicate its interim meetings to other topics ahead of December and January’s budget hearings — including sales and use tax distribution, developmentally disabled waivers and funding for wildfire response, prevention and management — Bear said he’s already got a few ideas “as far as DOGE-ing the budget.” 
“I think that there’s some really low-hanging fruit there,” Bear said, pointing to cuts the House proposed earlier this year before the Senate, in an unprecedented move, announced it would not pass a supplemental budget in the 2025 session. 
Model government 
Trump’s DOGE has faced legal challenges and been criticized for its lack of transparency. For months, it has remained unclear, for example, how many Wyoming-based federal workers have been fired or incentivized to leave their jobs. Reviews of the purported savings also found the claims were often riddled with errors.
Bear said he expects greater transparency at the state level since the same branch “doing the DOGE-ing, if you will” also holds the purse strings, as opposed to the executive branch calling the shots in Washington. 
“We’ll make it really clear to people where our cuts are going to be in the [next] budget,” Bear said.

Meanwhile, the lawmaker with the most experience on the Appropriations Committee said he’s skeptical of the value of state lawmakers seeking to imitate the federal government. 
“I think it’s insulting, frankly,” Jackson Democrat Sen. Mike Gierau told WyoFile. “It’s just stealing a bad idea from Donald Trump and trying to impose it on Wyoming.”
Lawmakers have done a quality job of making “government as lean and efficient as we can make it,” Gierau said, adding that political buzz words like “DOGE” obscure that spending wisely can save money in the long run. 
“Think about early childhood education. Study after study after study shows when we spend on early childhood education, we save on K-12 education. It’s a fact,” he said. 
Gierau also pointed to spending on mental health services as having a savings ripple effect. 
“It also helps the general welfare and health and wealth of our citizens,” he said. “People expect that from their government. They expect that. They expect to have those types of services available to them.” 
What else to expect 
Bear pointed to the recent past to explain where he’d like to focus DOGE-like efforts in Wyoming.
“You can look at the supplementary budget that [the House] put together and get a clue,” Bear said. 
In particular, Bear pointed to eliminating funds for the Cheyenne arboretum and the governor’s energy matching dollars, as well as cutting vacant positions. 
“One of the most glaring things I see is vacant positions,” Bear said. “For instance, in the Department of Health, there are 388 vacant positions, or at least there were during the last session.” 
By eliminating vacant positions throughout state government, Bear said, “we’re not affecting any communities, or employed state employees. We’re talking about positions that have been vacant for a long, long time.”

But it’s not that simple, Gierau said, adding that vacant positions allow agencies to move money around more nimbly to address falling compensation rates. 
When state agencies saw record-high turnover rates in 2022, Gov. Mark Gordon successfully called on lawmakers to increase compensation for state employees.
“We stopped the trend of massive turnover. We slowed it down. We’re certainly not anywhere close to no turnover,” Gierau said. “But now we’re starting to fall behind again.” 
‘Research’
When the Appropriations Committee meets later this month in Gillette, Bear said “you won’t see anything about the budget,” or DOGE-ing it, in the agenda. 
“At this point, it’s simply research,” Bear said. 
That research took him across the state — at the invitation of Gierau — to Teton County to attend a county commission meeting where a housing development was being discussed. 
Bear said he’s also been keeping an eye on the Legislature’s Education Committee, while three other Appropriations Committee members attended the University of Wyoming’s budget hearings in May. The latter is another area that “requires more study,” Bear said. 
The Legislature provides UW with a block grant, affording a kind of budget flexibility to the state’s one four-year public university. That varies from other state agencies, where lawmakers have more line-item spending oversight. But that arrangement with UW is worth revisiting, Bear said. 
“I’m very interested in knowing whether we would get better information if each college had to come before the [Appropriations] Committee [to present] what the money is being spent on,” Bear said. 
At UW’s budget hearing, Sheridan Republican and Freedom Caucus member Rep. Ken Pendergraft weighed in with his thoughts on spending at UW and the state at large.

“What I think we’ve done to ourselves as a state is we’ve got ourselves spread far too thin. We’ve got ourselves trying to do too many things, and quite frankly, we’re doing some of them half ass,” Pendergraft said.
At the time, UW Police was presenting its budget request to the trustees, which Pendergraft described as “critical” and in need of being “properly funded.” 
Pendergraft then urged the trustees to “look around the rest of the university and say, ‘What is not critical?’” 
“I think that’s where we’re at as a state. I think that’s where the university is. And nobody, like I said, nobody wants to tell anybody, ‘Hey, we’re going to shut you down,’ but we may well be confronted with that on every level,” he said. 
The Joint Appropriations Committee will meet June 23 and 24 in Gillette.

Adoption this week of a new official city flag in Missoula means the rest of the state can display Pride flags in public buildings — despite a new law meant to restrict such displays.
On a 9-2 vote Monday night, Missoula City Council passed a resolution to adopt the Pride flag — as well “as flags representing portions” of the Pride flag — as an official flag of the Garden City.
The action by the city follows Gov. Greg Gianforte’s signing of House Bill 819, which regulates which flags can be flown or displayed on government property. The law prohibits nongovernmental and “politically charged” flags.
But a stipulation in the law says any public building can display the flag of “any county, municipality, special district, or other political subdivision within the state.” Since Missoula adopted the flag as its city flag, it opens up the possibility for other communities to also display the Pride flag.
Rep. Braxton Mitchell, a Columbia Falls Republican who sponsored the bill, vowed in an email he would seek to change the law. He also said he believes it’s likely the law will not be challenged in court.
“We will amend the law next session to make sure no city can make a political symbol their official flag,” Mitchell wrote. “If they want to fly that flag, they can do it at home, not on the taxpayer’s pole.”
Council member Jennifer Savage, who sponsored the ordinance, said in an interview that Pride flags were starting to come down in schools as a result of HB 819. Missoula County Public Schools had previously said it would follow state law.
For Savage, the mother of a queer daughter, the flag being displayed meant something else, too.
“When I see a Pride flag, I think that my kid is safe in that place,” Savage said. “I think it symbolizes inclusion. I think when a public school teacher flies it in their classroom, it says to students, this is a safe place for you. And it also signals to other students that hate won’t be tolerated there.”

The law includes carveouts, such as for the Gadsden flag, law enforcement flags, school flags, and the flag of any nation recognized by the United States. Similar laws in Utah and Idaho prompted Salt Lake City and Boise to adopt Pride flags as city flags in response to state legislation.
Savage said her inbox was flooded with Missoulians concerned over the law. Fellow council member Daniel Carlino said he hadn’t seen Missoulians turn out to a city council meeting all year quite like they did on Monday night.
The council took public comment for around an hour prior to voting to approve the change.
“I think it was important that Missoula did what we can to fight back when the state and federal government are trying to attack the LGBTQ+ community,” Carlino said on Tuesday.
Missoula did not have a city flag prior to Monday night, Carlino said. There was some confusion about whether more than one city flag was allowed, though Savage said other flags could be brought before council for consideration.
In a comment posted on Facebook, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Missoula City Council “should be ashamed.”
“Last night, nine members of the Missoula City Council made clear their top priority is flying a divisive pride flag over government buildings and schools — all while ignoring the city’s housing affordability crisis, raising taxes by 17% because of over spending, and refusing to take firm action to end encampments in the city,” Gianforte wrote. “Missoulians deserve better, and fortunately, two council members voted against imposing this divisive, far-left agenda on their community.”
Mitchell stated during his bill’s Senate hearing that he’d seen Black Lives Matters and Pride flags in his classrooms growing up, and said he did not feel those issues should be pushed in schools.
“Leave it to Missoula to turn their city flag into a Pride flag. Nothing says ‘unity’ like politicizing public property,” Mitchell said in a statement. “The ultra far left Missoula City Council and their mayor are completely out of touch with reality and the values of the vast majority of Montanans. Taxpayer owned property should represent everyone, not just the loudest political movements of the moment. The Pride flag, like any other political symbol, has no place replacing a city’s identity.” 
He added situations like this are exactly why he pushed the law.
“We resoundingly passed HB 819 to stop governments from hijacking public property to push ideology,” Mitchell said. “If this resolution passes, it only proves how necessary HB 819 is, and I’m sure it won’t be good for Missoula’s local economy either.”
Missoula City council members Sandra Vasecka and Bob Campbell voted against the measure. Councilor Campbell said he had a request for the people who said the flag makes them feel safe.
“Stop and think for a minute whether or not that’s true for everyone in the community, whether or not that the flag is the cure, the be all, the end, to feel safe,” Campbell said to council on Monday night. “And I propose that’s not always the case.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/FullSizeRender-preview-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-03 20:05:07.359343

Credit: Michael MolineA federal judge blocked on Tuesday the state’s enforcement of a 2024 state law requiring social media platforms to delete accounts of kids 15 years old and younger.
The preliminary victory for the two trade associations representing social media giants comes after U.S. District Judge Mark Walker had dismissed the suit in March because the companies had not proven they would be affected. However, Walker barred the state from enforcing the law on Tuesday (HB 3), writing that it stifled minors’ First Amendment rights and that there were other avenues to combat mental health concerns associated with the use of social media.
“Assuming the significance of the State’s interest in limiting the exposure of youth to websites with ‘addictive features,’ the law’s restrictions are an extraordinarily blunt instrument for furthering it,” Walker wrote.
NetChoice and Computer & Communications Industry Association, representing companies including Google, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube, filed the suit against the law in October and the former Attorney General Ashley Moody had agreed not to enforce it while the parties waited for a decision from Walker on whether to temporarily block it or allow fines of up to $50,000 per violation.
The attorney general’s office will appeal Walker’s block to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, said Jeremy Redfern, the attorney general’s director of communications, in an email to Florida Phoenix.
“Florida parents voted through their elected representatives for a law protecting kids from the harmful and sometimes lifelong tragic impacts of social media,” Redfern wrote. “These platforms do not have a constitutional right to addict kids to their products.”
Walker disagreed with the state’s argument that parental control features weren’t enough to protect kids from addictive features and that the law only prohibits kids from having accounts and doesn’t restrict access to the content altogether.
“While it is true that at least one of these platforms, YouTube, does not require users to be account holders to passively view some content, all require users to hold accounts in order to share one’s own content—in other words, to speak,” Walker wrote.
CCI’s president and CEO, Matt Schruers, celebrated the ruling.
“This ruling vindicates our argument that Florida’s statute violates the First Amendment by blocking and restricting minors—and likely adults as well—from using certain websites to view lawful content,” he wrote in a press release.

(Photo by Clark Kauffman/Iowa Capita Dispatch) Smoke from the fires currently ravaging the Canadian wilderness arrived at Iowa’s northern border Monday night and will likely impact air quality throughout the state in the coming days. 
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources has announced an air quality alert across Iowa that will be in effect until 6 a.m., Thursday, June 5. During this time, Iowa DNR expects the air to contain an unhealthy amount of hazardous airborne pollutants from the wildfire smoke.
“It’s like predicting snowfall,” said Todd Russell, one of the ambient air monitoring staff at Iowa DNR. “It’s difficult to tell how much smoke is up there, how much smoke will reach the ground and how long it’s going to last.”
Russell said the decision to put the alert in effect came after observing levels of particulates “multiple times the federal standard” in northern Iowa towns, such as Emmetsburg, for several hours. Areas near the Minnesota border are still seeing high levels of particulates, he said. 
Based on several models of smoke movement that mirrored the changes the Iowa DNR observed on Monday night, Russell says his “conservative” estimate is that the smoke will remain at least through Wednesday evening.
According to AirNow, a central hub of EPA air-quality information at state and national levels, individuals with lung or heart diseases, children, teenagers, pregnant women, adults over the age of 65 and people more likely to be outside for extended periods are at risk of more severe health effects caused by the smoke. However, AirNow recommends everyone reduce their exposure. 
“Stay away from it if you can and minimize your exercise or intake of that smoke if you can’t get away from it,” Russell said. 
As of June 3, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center reports 213 active fires, of which 106 are “out of control.” The area burned by these fires since the start of 2025 is greater than 4.8 million acres of land. The National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho announced 150 federal firefighters would be mobilized to help suppress fires in Alberta and Manitoba provinces.
Minnesota and Wisconsin have similar alerts in effect currently.

Lincoln-based Hoppe Development started out with a blank 35-acre canvas on which it plans to grow an entire mixed-income neighborhood inside a more massive 440-acre multi-use development.

The private developer with help from a nonprofit partner will plant a variety of affordable housing types among Tallgrass’ 600 dwellings — a feat that required competitive applications to gain funding from multiple governmental and other sources.
But perhaps the most atypical element is the location — the Tallgrass neighborhood is rising in Papillion, a suburban city in one of the fastest-growing and wealthiest per capita counties of the state, rather than in a more common inner city setting where most housing for lower income residents is concentrated. 
Jake Hoppe, the company’s chief executive, said the venture represents a newer approach to building affordable housing in Nebraska — one that integrates affordable units at a larger scale within a specially designed mixed-income suburban neighborhood. A similar Hoppe-led development launched a couple of years ago in Lincoln.
 Mixed-income success

His company points to research that shows lower-income families have greater success in breaking the cycle of poverty when living in an area with broader access to jobs, schools and opportunity, and amidst a mix of peers and lifestyles.

Said company principal Fred Hoppe: “If we are going to address the affordable housing challenges of our communities, we have to build affordable housing at scale alongside market rate housing, in highly desirable areas of town with strong schools and supportive community infrastructure.” 
Jake Hoppe is among a lineup of state and national experts set to speak — at a two-day Reignite2Unite symposium beginning June 4 — about successes and innovative efforts aimed at growing affordable and diverse housing across Nebraska.
Organized by the Omaha Municipal Land Bank, Spark CDI and Front Porch Investments, the conference at Omaha Marriott Downtown builds on the inaugural Reignite event last year, which offered tools and information to help emerging developers transform infill properties into community assets.

Rothstein collaborated with her father, Richard Rothstein, on the book that is a sequel to his “The Color of Law,” a groundbreaking history of how the U.S. government imposed racial segregation on neighborhoods nationwide.
In an interview with the Nebraska Examiner, Rothstein offered examples of policies that helped other communities improve access to affordable housing. 
Among them: zoning reform that allows a broader range of housing sizes and types in a neighborhood; inclusionary housing policies that call for a certain percentage of new construction projects to be affordable; property tax abatements in return for affordable units, and nonprofit community land trusts that provide affordable housing in perpetuity by owning and leasing land to income-eligible people who live in houses built on the land.
 Countering segregation

This year’s conference comes as officials continue to address what’s been called a “crisis” shortage of affordable housing options in Nebraska, with too many households “cost-burdened” by spending more than 30% of their income on housing.

State officials have said rising housing costs have impacted the state’s competitive edge and hampered its ability to fill open jobs. A study led by the Nebraska Investment Finance Authority and released in 2023 identified a goal to create, by 2028, at least 35,000 affordable and attainable homes across the state for low- to middle-income earners, which authors said would reduce the number of needed housing units by about a third.
Rothstein said she was heartened to hear of the Tallgrass project she views as an inroad to counter segregation. Building affordable housing in suburban areas often faces the NIMBY (not in my backyard) battle from people who fear such projects could lower property values, she said. 
In the case of Tallgrass, Hoppe said NIMBY so far has not been an issue, as the developer controls the tract on which it and partners have plotted out the mix and styles to blend as a neighborhood. He said a key was buying the large undeveloped property early on, allowing his team to design from the ground up. 
“We’ll be our own neighbor,” he said.











If we are going to address the affordable housing challenges of our communities, we have to build affordable housing at scale alongside market rate housing, in highly desirable areas of town with strong schools and supportive community infrastructure.


– Fred Hoppe, Hoppe Development



Habitat for Humanity of Omaha, with a $7 million assist from Cobalt Credit Union, is partnering with Hoppe in building 30 for-sale row houses that Habitat will make available for income-eligible buyers at the Tallgrass site. 
Habitat’s Lacey Studnicka, who also will speak at the Reignite event, said the nonprofit has a dominant presence in northeast Omaha but provides homeownership opportunities to lower income families in five counties. She said its first new-build project in Papillion came as home prices were rising and teachers, laborers and others were being priced out of the area.
“Partnering with Habitat for Humanity of Omaha to bring affordable housing to Sarpy County reflects our shared belief that everyone deserves a place to build their life and their dreams,” said Cobalt CEO Robin Larsen.

Site preparation also has started at Tallgrass for 198 rental units affordable to families at 60% of the area median income and below. Those dwellings are funded through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program administered by NIFA and the Community Development Block Grant program administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.
Ahead are other phases that include upscale market-rate apartments with a fitness center and swimming pool accessible to the whole development, as well as more for-sale homes funded in part by the Nebraska State Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
 Page from playbook

Hoppe said his team took a page from the playbook of purpose-built mixed-income housing areas steered by Seventy Five North and Canopy South. A difference is that those are inner city infill developments in the eastern part of Omaha, whereas Tallgrass took the model to a greenfield in the suburbs.
Helping get Tallgrass off the ground was an initial $2 million low-income loan from the nonprofit Front Porch’s “innovation fund.” Hoppe said the boost triggered the purchase of land at Papillion’s 72nd Street and Capehart Road, inside the larger Oak Leaf subdivision. 
At least one challenge, Hoppe said, is ensuring that supportive services are available for families that otherwise likely would live in older, more established neighborhoods, where child care options are more familiar and public transportation is more accessible.
He said his company has been exploring ways to respond to service gaps. A future elementary school “hopefully will be responsive to the needs of the neighborhood” as well. A commercial town center and walking trails also are planned.

The developer had looked at economically thriving Elkhorn as a potential site, but Hoppe said his team chose Papillion partly because of Amazon and other warehouse jobs available in the vicinity. 
Judging from Hoppe Development’s similarly designed Lincoln Foxtail Meadows development — which is 650 units and built in a cornfield near a church — Jake Hoppe anticipates a positive response and outcome for Tallgrass. 
Each is expected to take five to seven years to build out.
“It’s been great,” he said of the first few phases so far in the Lincoln mixed-income neighborhood, supported by various state and federal affordable housing funds and city-approved tax-increment financing. “No one can tell who lives in an affordable or market rate unit.”




Former Omaha hotel property is training ground for new developer, future affordable housing site

OMAHA — A vacant downtown Omaha hotel property with an assorted and sometimes sketchy past, is set to be demolished to make way for a $16 million mixed-income residential property.
A unique element of that venture is its team: Lincoln-based Hoppe Development, seasoned in the affordable housing field, paired up with Omahan Donell Brown, who is learning the industry.

Such alliances, which help increase diversity among real estate developers, is a goal of this week’s Reignite2Unite symposium and related efforts by organizers Spark and Omaha’s Municipal Land Bank. 
The conference is expected to draw 250 people over two days starting Wednesday.
Brown is a participant in Spark’s co-development apprenticeship that aims to set up budding developers with a project site and experienced team to give them more of a running start.
Brown recently completed a single-family home project and said he was eager to absorb the expertise of developers accustomed to assembling funding sources for more complicated projects.
With the 2211 Douglas St. project, Brown said he is dealing with a gamut of federal, state and city officials. He’s become aware of how to raise a score on a low-income housing tax credit application and plan a “community engagement strategy.”
“It’s pushing the limits of what I know and have done before to keep me growing and learning things,” said Brown. 
Jake Hoppe, CEO of Hoppe Development, said the plan is for the former hotel property, once the 402 Hotel and EconoLodge, to be razed. Most recently, the structure was used by Together Inc., as a non-congregate shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Together Inc. and another nonprofit, Omaha-based Front Porch Investments, sought proposals to redevelop the site. Hoppe Development was selected and received the property for free. 
The plan is a new residential building of about 70 units, about half affordable housing for seniors and the rest units at market rate. The development team expects to apply for tax-increment financing and low-income housing tax credits. 
Hoppe said adding Brown to the team adds a new perspective. Brown said he appreciates learning “method to the madness.”

Conservation groups argued in federal court that a forest management project comprising 1,241 acres of timber harvest east of Helena may violate several federal statutes, but the government lawyers said rules were followed and the timber sale has economic and public interest benefits. 
Three conservation groups, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Native Ecosystems Council and the Council on Fish and Wildlife filed suit against the U.S. Forest Service in the U.S. District Court in Missoula against the Wood Duck Project and seek a preliminary injunction to halt work. 
On Tuesday, they argued their case before Judge Dana Christensen, alleging the project violates the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Forest Management Act, that the government had failed to include data showing possible negative impact on wildlife, and that the Forest Service had ignored points of concern from the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
“This is not just a procedural claim. It is a hard look at substantive environmental protections,” Rebecca Smith, counsel for the conservation groups, said during arguments on June 3.
Smith argued two species in particular would be harmed by the logging project — elk and grizzly bears — due to an increased density of temporary roads constructed. 
As part of the forest management project, two companies were awarded timber sales. 
One company, Sun Mountain Lumber, which was awarded 356 acres of timber sale, filed as a party to the lawsuit, claiming substantial harm if the project is halted. 
Sun Mountain Lumber began its operations on the sale last fall, constructing several miles of temporary road and cutting 199 acres of lumber, according to court documents. Its operations are expected to resume around mid-June.
Judge Christensen raised the timing of the lawsuit as a potential issue to the plaintiff’s claims. 
“I don’t understand, when we’ve got an (environmental assessment) that was issued in April of 2024, a contract that was awarded to Sun Mountain on September 17 of 2024, why we had to wait until logging activities are about to resume up there… and come into this court and seek temporary relief?” Christensen said. “That concerns me.”

The Wood Duck Project is located in the Townsend Ranger District of the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest in the Big Belt Mountains. The total project area is roughly 70,000 acres, of which there will be 1,241 acres of commercial logging, 15 miles of temporary road construction, 10 miles of road reconstruction and 8 miles of road reconditioning. 
A portion of the temporary roads will be constructed in elk wintering grounds, according to the project plan, which the plaintiffs argue will decrease elk habitat effectiveness. 
“90 to 95% of the elk in this hunting district are already being displaced from public National Forest lands because of poor (habitat) elk security. And these are areas that would otherwise provide good elk habitat if there was security,” Smith said, quoting from comments made by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks about the project. “There is nowhere in the project (environmental assessment) that the Forest Service disclose to the public that the current status of this area is that already 90 to 95% of elk are being displaced.”
The plaintiffs also challenged the logging project on the basis of affecting grizzly bear habitat connectivity. Although there is no known population of grizzlies in the Big Belts, the area provides a possible route between grizzlies in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, centered around the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area, and Yellowstone National Park. The plaintiffs argued that increased road density harms that connectivity. 
“(Part of the project area) already has a road density of 2.6 miles per square mile. That is far and away, a road density level that is too high for grizzly bears,” Smith said. “…It’s not really possible for the Forest Service to say that it’s maintaining connectivity for grizzly bears in this area.”
But Assistant U.S. Attorney Abby Nordhagen Cziok, said the plaintiffs were mischaracterizing their arguments as a “false choice between logging, and elk and grizzly bears.”
“Really this entire case is meant to work towards vegetative desired conditions, and that means ensuring that there’s health in the forest, making sure that the trees are resilient to changes in the environment, like fires, drought, disease,” Cziok said, adding that the species of concern would ultimately benefit. 
In her arguments, Cziok said the plaintiffs had failed to show they would suffer irreparable harm from the logging, the last-minute timeline showed a lack of urgency, and the Forest Service’s environmental assessment had correctly weighed possible harms to wildlife. 
Cziok added the logging project was substantially changed during the public processes that accompany an environmental assessment, including in response to comments by FWP, cutting it from a 3,000-acre logging operation to one half that size. 
“Really, the project we are considering today is not the same project that Fish, Wildlife and Parks wrote to the Forest Service about. It’s a very different project,” she told the court. “Importantly, at the beginning of that letter Fish, Wildlife and Parks said, ‘We are generally in favor of this project.’ That’s because this project seeks to maintain a healthy, diverse forest.”
Tyson McLean, attorney for Sun Mountain Lumber, said the company has made significant investment in the Wood Duck sale, could lose up to $3 million in revenue if the sale is halted, and that the harvested lumber would support operations of the company’s lumber mills for months. 
At a time where lumber mills in Montana have been closing due to labor shortages and low lumber prices, timber sales like Wood Duck are essential to the remaining mills, McLean said. 
“Sun Mountain employs approximately 65 people at its Livingston mill whose livelihoods would be jeopardized by the delay or cancellation of harvest activities,” he told the court. “Sun Mountain is unable to pivot and find another viable option to replace the raw material that they are planning on or the volume of timber from the Wood Duck timber sale.”
“It’s too late,” McLean said.
Smith, on behalf of the conservation groups, said at the end of arguments that because the Sun Mountain timber sale was partially completed, the plaintiffs would be open to allowing the remaining 143 acres to be logged, and would seek an injunction against the remaining timber sales. 
Christensen said he would work to deliver an expedient ruling due to the impending restart of Sun Mountain’s operations, but again took issue with the plaintiff’s last-minute actions in the case. 
“I do not like getting motions for temporary restraining orders days or weeks before a project is to recommence where logging has already taken place, when this claim could have been brought 10 months ago,” Christensen said. “I am getting overwhelmed with requests for temporary restraining orders — overwhelmed — and every time a temporary restraining order is filed … that takes priority over everything else that I’m doing. And when I have a case where the issues could have been brought before me months ago that now has found its way into a temporary restraining order, I’m concerned.”
Two of the conservation groups were previously successful in halting a large-scale logging project near Townsend in 2024, settling a suit with the Forest Service. The settlement allowed the government to proceed with a project tens of thousands of acres smaller than originally proposed.

After her husband, Walter Stone, died in 1959, she supported herself and her family by teaching creative writing, publishing poetry books and winning literary awards. She was Vermont’s poet laureate from 2007 until she died in 2011.Ruth Stone’s poetry is known for its seamless blend of domestic themes and cosmic strangeness. Chard diNiord of the Guardian said her poetry has “a tragic/comic register few other American poets have struck, often reminiscent of Emily Dickinson’s double-edged verse, only in a more conversational style.”Ruth Stone’s legacy is carried on by her granddaughter and current Vermont poet laureate Bianca Stone. She says her poetry is very much shaped by her grandmother’s.“I look to her poems all the time,” said Stone. “And I feel like my poems speak to hers so much.”During her life, Ruth Stone cultivated a community of poets, often hosting workshops and poetry readings at her house.Ruth Stone.

It continues to provide support for a grassroots literary community through poetry workshops, public readings and other events.Bianca Stone is not the only family member involved. Her husband, poet Ben Pease, is the nonprofit’s executive director. Both have worked on the house’s continued improvement and larger mission.Bianca Stone is deeply passionate about maintaining the house as a space for writers and local artists to share their work.“It’s very collaborative,” she said. “It’s like the team’s making it together. It keeps changing and deepening, and we’re just discovering so much.”Pease added, “Part of our mission is encouraging everyone who’s working with us to take things that they like personally and incorporate that into outreach to the community.”Their community now extends far beyond the physical house. The couple offers a free online poetry workshop every Tuesday night. The Zoom format has allowed them to work with poets beyond Vermont.Aimée Algería Barry, a tai chi instructor from Philadelphia, has been joining the online workshop for four years.“One of the most amazing things about working with Bianca and Ben is that you’re dealing with two people living the poetry life,” Barry said. “They’re very dedicated to poetry, and yet there’s this humbleness and generosity that is constantly in action.” “I feel like I’m getting an MFA just from being with them and learning from them,” she said.Ruth Stone House plans to host more in-person events this summer, including its Beer & Broadsides poetry readings. They are informal, open mic–style events where folks gather and listen to a local poet’s work.Ruth Stone House in Goshen.

That way, everyone can take a free broadside home with them.Local poet Ben Aleshire, who is also a photographer and printer, said he loves getting involved at Ruth Stone House. He has run the letterpress at Beer & Broadside events.“There’s a poetry reading, but there’s also other stuff going on,” Aleshire said. “It’s just a really magical little event.”Aleshire said he’s grateful that there’s a non-institutional, informal center for poetry in the state. He appreciates the casual, easygoing nature of the Ruth Stone House.“Academics are welcome, of course, but it’s mostly like neighbors and friends and, you know, fellow travelers who come out of the woodwork,” Aleshire said.But cultural institutions like Ruth Stone House are threatened by a loss of federal funding. Because the National Endowment for the Arts is being targeted by the Trump administration, Stone and Pease are worried their nonprofit won’t receive key awards in the future.“A lot of the grants that we were gonna apply for are federally funded,” said Stone. “And things like the NEA are very precarious right now.”Stone and Pease had hoped to use future grants for scholarships for writers to come to retreats and classes, for payments for featured guests on the “Ode & Psyche Podcast” and for printing and freelance costs for their literary publication, ITERANT.With or without the money, Bianca Stone said poetry survives because poets are driven to write, especially in this political moment.“I feel radicalized by it,” Stone said. “I feel motivated by it. I don’t feel defeated by it, but I feel sad about it.”“Somehow,” she said, “poetry endures anyway.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  In Goshen, two generations of poet laureates converge.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bianca_Stone_her_husband_Ben_Pea-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-03 19:04:39.495603

Delaware homeowners looking to cut energy costs this summer can now take advantage of expanded energy efficiency incentives, thanks to a new announcement from Energize Delaware.
“As supply costs increase for all Delawareans, we heard from our trade allies that expansion of this limited time offer would drive energy efficiency, reduce utility bills, and improve home comfort,” said Drew Slater, Executive Director of Energize Delaware.
The nonprofit is increasing bonus incentives by 25 percent through September 30 for its Home Performance with Energy Star and Assisted Home Performance programs.
The offer is available to all Delaware residents and aims to boost participation in energy-saving home upgrades amid rising utility costs.

“As supply costs increase for all Delawareans, we heard from our trade allies that expansion of this limited time offer would drive energy efficiency, reduce utility bills, and improve home comfort,” said Drew Slater, executive director of Energize Delaware. “We know the cheapest, cleanest energy is the energy we don’t consume.”
The Home Performance with Energy Star program promotes a comprehensive approach to improving a home’s energy efficiency, comfort, and safety.
Participation begins with a Home Energy Assessment, during which an expert auditor evaluates a home and delivers a detailed report outlining energy-saving opportunities, costs, and potential return on investment.
The organization has also expanded its Home Energy Counseling and Checkup service, a one-hour assessment offered at no additional cost, to all Delaware residents.
Since the original incentives were introduced earlier this year, Energize Delaware has reported a 45 percent increase in home energy assessments and a 56 percent rise in completed projects.
More than 200 additional Home Energy Checkup and Counseling appointments have led to energy savings of over 194,000 kilowatt-hours from January through May—an amount equivalent to taking roughly 40 homes off the utility grid.
Energize Delaware offers a variety of programs designed to help residents lower their carbon footprint through energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions.
“We know the cheapest, cleanest energy is the energy we don’t consume and we’re working hard to share these programs ahead of higher utility bills this summer,” Slater said.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-03-at-6.47.56-PM.png,,,2025-06-03 19:04:39.495603

Those returning to work include “most” employees who worked within the RHD before April 1, which is when reduction in force notices were issued throughout multiple NIOSH divisions as a result of the new federal Department of Government Efficiency’s cost-saving measures. 
Many of those workers were slated to be terminated on Monday, the same day NIOSH director John J. Howard signed and filed the certification in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.
The certification was entered to meet requirements in a preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Irene Berger last month. That injunction came from a class action lawsuit filed on April 7 against the federal government and led by Harry Wiley, a Raleigh County coal miner. 
In May, Wiley’s attorneys argued in a hearing that the closure of the CWHSP by DOGE meant responsibilities mandated by congress for coal worker health and safety were illegally going undone, robbing Wiley and other coal miners of their hard-fought rights. The federal government argued that the stoppage at the CWHSP and other NIOSH divisions was only temporary as the federal Department of Health and Human Services worked through a “reorganization.”
Berger ruled in favor of Wiley and the other coal miners. She ordered that all RHD employees return to work and that the division — including the CWHSP — continue all work congressionally mandated by the federal Mine Safety and Health Act. If there are future moves to “reorganize” the agency, Berger ordered that there must be “no pause, stoppage, or gap in the protections and services mandated to be performed by the RHD.”
That work includes providing free black lung screenings and certifying black lung x-ray results for miners like Wiley who have been diagnosed with black lung disease so they can exercise their Part 90 rights. Part 90 allows miners who have black lung to be transferred to a different, less dusty part of a coal mine without facing repercussions from their employers. NIOSH is the only agency that can certify test results for miners to receive a Part 90 transfer.
In the certification declaration on Monday, Howard said that the agency is once again accepting test results necessary to certify Part 90 transfer requests.
But other work, according to the certification declaration, has yet to return completely.
Howard wrote that NIOSH was “working through” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the federal DHHS to “fully restore” several of the RHD’s functions.
Those functions include reestablishing contracts necessary for RHD to offer, review and manage chest x-rays through its mobile clinic; promoting events to alert miners of the free testing opportunities and ensuring funding can be accessed and spent for the agency to meet its requirements.
On Tuesday, according to WV MetroNews, Sam Petsonk — one of several attorneys representing the miners in the case — told “Talk of the Town” on WAJR Radio that it’s critical for all CWHSP services to return as soon as possible.
“They say they’re trying. They say that they understand the court has ordered them to do this, but they have not restored the X-ray reading programs, the mobile unit that travels around the coal mines,” Petsonk said. “… We are experiencing hundreds of layoffs across the mining industry right now. This is just the moment where miners often look to see what kind of lung damage they have so that they can take stock before they find their next job. And we really need these programs right now, and we don’t have them.”
The CDC estimates that about 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
And the resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before. This is due to miners, because of a lack of easily accessible coal, being forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone than their predecessors in order to reach what little coal remains.
 Other fights unfold against federal DOGE cuts 

While the RHD employees are back to work, other fights are continuing against the federal government’s cuts. Workers and those affected by the services they provide have been decrying the cuts for weeks now, saying they’ll leave people in certain industries — including mining, firefighting and more — vulnerable to preventable accidents and illnesses.
Some of these fights, like that for the CWHSP, have already proven successful.
Last week, following continued pushback from black lung organizations and other mining advocates, the Trump administration reversed its plan to close 34 Mine Safety and Health Administration offices nationwide. Those offices employ mine inspectors whose jobs are to ensure that coal mine operators are meeting industry standards known to lower the risks of accidents and injuries for coal miners. 
But other battles have proven more difficult.
In Pennsylvania, workers at the Pittsburgh-based Mining Research Division within NIOSH — which studies the best ways to prevent injuries, illnesses and death in coal mines — are still slated to be terminated. 
Several of the services that are now going undone at NIOSH as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are congressionally mandated through the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. 
Multiple labor unions — including the United Mine Workers of America — filed suit on May 14 against DHHS and the federal government.
They’re using similar arguments to Wiley’s attorneys, which proved successful in getting services started back up: since the cuts are stopping work that is required by Congress, they say, they are illegal and should be reversed.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NIOSH-mobile-unit.jpeg,,,2025-06-03 19:04:39.495603

Jeff Landry's desk. (Getty Images)Louisiana lawmakers gave final approval to legislation Tuesday to limit the amount of money nursing home residents and their families receive from lawsuits over injuries, neglect and wrongful deaths. 
Senate Bill 134 has been one of the most controversial bills of the legislative session. Advocacy organizations for seniors and people who are disabled made it a top priority to defeat the bill, saying it would protect nursing homes owners who keep their residents in dangerous situations. 
“We are supposed to protect the elderly – not somebody who is trying to make more money off the elderly,” said Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, who opposed the bill. 

Supporters insisted the proposal was not just about nursing homes and would protect a variety of medical facilities from frivolous lawsuits. But Louisiana’s powerful nursing home owners were the primary backers of the bill and made it the focus of their legislative agenda this year. 
“We’re going to have those health care facilities turning in their keys because they can’t do business in this state anymore” if these lawsuits continue, Wes Hataway, policy director for the Louisiana Nursing Home Association, said at a legislative hearing last month. 
There are more than 60 lawsuits pending against nursing homes across the state that could be limited by the legislation. They are being brought by residents and families, often alleging a loved one developed bedsores or injuries from repeated falls while living at a facility.  
The lawsuits allege the nursing homes and their management companies don’t hire enough staff to watch the residents adequately, instead prioritizing lower costs and maximum profits. 

The bill would limit the damages that can be recovered from such a lawsuit. It would bring many of the lawsuits nursing homes currently face under the state Medical Malpractice Act, which caps awards at $500,000.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Recently, lawsuits against Chateau St. James Rehab and Retirement in Lutcher and Heritage Manor West in Shreveport over infected bedsores that contributed to residents’ deaths had produced awards worth millions of dollars, far more than the legislation would allow. 
Nursing home owners are among the state’s biggest political donors and one of the most influential industries at the Louisiana Capitol, focusing many of their contributions on state lawmakers and governors. 
A handful of legislators also have direct ties to the nursing home industry. 
Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, and Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, are part of the 10-person ownership group of Acadia St. Landry Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Church Point. Their nursing home currently faces a wrongful death lawsuit. 
The nursing home industry pushed for this bill particularly hard, employing extra lobbyists and recruiting other influential groups such the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry and the Louisiana Hospital Association to support the proposal. 

The legislation passed easily, with a 58-37 vote in the House Tuesday and a 26-11 vote in the Senate last month. Gov. Jeff Landry could still attempt to block the legislation from passing into a law with a veto however. 
Legislators opposed to the bill attempted to water down the legislation by adding an amendment that would block a nursing home from being put under the $500,000 medical malpractice cap if it was poorly rated by the federal government.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 

The U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services give nursing homes ratings of one to five stars based on factors such as facility inspections and staffing. The proposed amendment would have permitted lawsuits carrying greater risk to be brought against those nursing homes receiving one- or two-star ratings. 

“Don’t we want our seniors, our family members, our grandparents …to be in a safe space?” asked Rep. Stephanie Hilferty, R-New Orleans, who sponsored the amendment on the House side. 

Backed by AARP and other advocates for seniors, similar amendments failed in both chambers, with the Senate voting one down 20-16 and the House voting one down 57-39. 
Louisiana has some of the worst-rated nursing homes in the country, with approximately two-thirds of the facilities receiving one- and two-star ratings, according to Hilferty. She said those poorly-rated nursing homes make up 50% of such facilities in Metairie, which she represents in part, and more than 70% of nursing homes in Baton Rouge. 
Rep. Michael Melerine, R-Shreveport, defended the nursing home industry on the House floor, saying the facilities might face challenges with keeping residents healthy because of Louisiana’s high rates of obesity and diabetes. He also said the state’s general shortage of nurses contributes to low staffing at the facilities. 
“You cannot address this without addressing the shortage of registered nurses,” he said. 

Melerine’s law partner, Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, is one of the sponsors of the legislation.

Rusty Black, left, and Karla May for a Tuesday hearing on two special session spending bills. (Rudi Keller/Misssouri Independent)The first two days of the special legislative session called by Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe to allocate state money for Kansas City sports stadiums, disaster recovery and unfinished spending bills have gone as well as could be expected.
The Missouri Senate is poised for Wednesday debates on all the legislation Kehoe wants passed. And that’s when the legislation will move from friendly committees to a chamber compromised by clear Republican factional lines and simmering Democratic anger.
Some of the potential problems could be solved by which bills go first. The simplest bill would alter the rules governing the Missouri Housing Trust Fund so it could use $25 million included in an appropriations bill to fund home repairs and other assistance in areas hit by natural disasters this year.
The biggest gripes about that plan is that the money is too little and spread too thin — federal disaster declarations have been sought for 37 counties so far this year — to do a lot of good. The biggest disaster of the year, and one that has yet to receive a presidential directive allowing federal aid, is a May 16 tornado that carved a 22-mile path across the St. Louis region, damaging or destroying 16,000 structures including hundreds of old brick homes in North St. Louis.
People are sleeping in cars to protect their damaged property while they work to rebuild and wait for help, said state Sen. Brian Wililams, a University City Democrat.
“I’m having a severe challenge with even entertaining this, because I don’t know how anyone would be able to go back home and look at their neighbors,” Williams said.
The bill with the biggest obstacles would use tax money collected from the economic activity at Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City to finance renovated or new stadiums. The bill is estimated to divert almost $1.5 billion from state revenues over 30 years.
State Sen. Kurtis Gregory, a Marshall Republican and a former NFL player, is sponsoring the bill. The damage it will do to Missouri’s national image to lose one or both teams, especially the Chiefs, is as important as the transfer of the economic value to Kansas, Gregory said during a hearing of the Senate Fiscal Review Committee.
Kansas is offering to pay 70% of the cost for new stadiums, an offer that is “very viable,” Gregory said, and must be answered by the end of the month.
“I firmly believe these are Missouri’s teams, and if Missouri doesn’t have an offer on the table for the teams to even consider, that will speak for itself and how we view then what they bring to our state and our economy,” Gregory said.
Lobbyists for the teams would not commit to staying in Missouri if the legislation is passed. That, said state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, is hard to take for residents of eastern Missouri who remember that Chiefs owner Clark Hunt supported moving the Rams from St. Louis to Los Angeles.
“There was a real begrudgement about whether we were going to root for the Chiefs after the ownership team voted to remove the Rams from this from our side of the state,” said Coleman, a Republican from Arnold.
Along with the stadium financing, Gregory’s bill includes expanded tax credits for major amateur sporting events and a tax credit of up $5,000 for insurance deductibles paid as a result of disaster damage.
The bill where Kehoe’s plan could make its biggest political gains is the spending bill. It is mirrored on a construction spending package that the Missouri House refused to consider for a final vote during the regular session. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee approved two versions Tuesday. One, based on Kehoe’s requests, has all the non-general revenue items but only $50 million of the more than $300 million in general revenue spending.
Kehoe said he left out the general revenue items because he is concerned about the trend of little growth in state revenues. He cut in half a line item to support a new research reactor at the University of Missouri, leaving $25 million and using the other half for the disaster relief funding.
Some lawmakers have called the cut a broken promise to the university. University President Mun Choi, who attended the hearing on the spending bill, said he is happy with the $25 million and the remaining funds will be welcome next year as the multi-year project progresses.
“I am not upset at all,” Choi said. “I am grateful that the governor and the legislature are considering supporting this very important project here today. There are many other competing interests, especially with the disaster relief in St. Louis, and I really feel for the St. Louisians that are affected.”
The other version of the bill is exactly the same as the bill the House spiked. It includes more than 60 projects added by lawmakers, with money to rebuild a sheltered workshop that burned in December and provided needed upgrades at eight hospitals around the state.
While many members worried about disaster recovery or the earmarked projects have said they are ready to consider the stadium legislation after those bills are finished, the members of the Missouri Freedom Caucus who have signaled they oppose stadium funding are against it as a government subsidy to wealthy owners.
During testimony against the bill, Patrick Tuohey, a senior fellow at the Show Me Institute, summed up why conservatives oppose the bill.
“What’s happening here is that the teams want to use Kansas, and want to use fear of losing the teams, to vacuum up as much state subsidies as they can,” said Touhey, who wrote an op-ed about the issue published by The Independent earlier this week. “And then they are going to come to Jackson County and Clay County and do exactly the same thing, pit them against each other, and try to vacuum up as much public subsidies from taxpayers as possible,”

Under the newly approved appointment of Kara Alnasrawi, the restructured Community and Economic Development Office — or CEDO 2.0 as officials called it — will expand to include the city’s business and workforce development functions and the Church Street Marketplace, effective July 1.Currently the director of the Department of Business and Workforce Development and the Church Street Marketplace, Alnasrawi said she looks forward to creating a comprehensive economic development strategy, with community and interdepartmental support, that can give the city a road map to the future. According to recent projections, the city needs to build 7,000-10,000 new units of new housing within the next 25 years.“We need to be thinking ahead and taking the skill set that we have in house and making sure we’re deploying it appropriately so we can still support our community,” Alnasrawi said.Part of the first phase of the mayor’s ModernGov initiative announced last month restructuring CEDO involves shuffling staff and programs and eliminating 25 positions (including seven vacancies) — five from the Community and Economic Development Office and two from the workforce development office. The reimagined office is expected to provide better housing solutions — such as creating a senior housing adviser position next year — and be more collaborative with other departments, including the mayor’s office, to address the city’s complex housing, safety and economic challenges, Mulvaney-Stanak said.A chart outlining the restructuring planned for Burlington’s Community and Economic Development Office, as part of Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak’s ModernGov initiative. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerThis includes filling a position that has been vacant since June 2024 to focus on public-private partnerships, creating a third workforce development manager, increasing community networking capacity, and seeking more focus on equity and alternative criminal justice solutions.A key component of city government, the community and economic development office has changed often over its more than 40 years of existence to develop strategy, stimulate investment, address housing needs, manage waterfront development, and manage grants.Now it needs to evolve again to handle the “transition, evolution and innovation” needed to take Burlington into the future, the mayor said. “We need CEDO to be strategic, and we need it to be impactful,” Mulvaney-Stanak said.Kara Alnasrawi is the new director of  Burlington’s Community and Economic Development Office. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerThe reorganization is a much-needed “bold step,” said Ward 2 Progressive City Councilor Gene Bergman. He said it fixes a mistake of the previous Weinberger administration that took economic development work out of CEDO’s purview.“It acknowledges that the Church Street Marketplace is integral to our overarching economic well-being,” he said, and allows the city to reimagine downtown and the waterfront in relation to it.Although it’s a rocky road for businesses downtown due to ongoing construction, Mark Bouchett, owner of Homeport and chair of the commission that oversees the Church Street Marketplace, said he is excited about the “rays of hope” visible with the rising tower in CityPlace development and the new hires and relocation of staff announced by the mayor to better align with the city’s vision of the future.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Burlington mayor outlines restructured city department with a focus on housing, safety and equity.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/CEDO-1-1024x728.jpg,,,2025-06-03 19:04:39.495603

Legislators have put off final adjournment until they reach a deal on education reform.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: In the Vermont Legislature, it’s now a game of hurry up and wait.","Senate and House members of the education reform bill conference committee meet at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, May 28. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“It’s complicated.”That’s what I told a group of friends over the weekend when they asked me, with some concern for my sleep schedule, whether the Legislature had adjourned at the end of last week. Because while legislators say most of their work is done for the year, this year’s landmark policy effort — reforming how the state’s schools are funded and governed — is still a work in progress.House and Senate leadership, and Gov. Phil Scott’s administration, have said they need a bit more time to work out a deal on the education bill, H.454. They’ve now set their sights on June 16, the day that legislators had previously set aside for votes to override potential Scott vetoes, to reach a consensus on the education bill, along with several other bills left outstanding. Until then, the plan is to hold brief floor sessions featuring little, if any, real business — known as “token sessions” — in order to essentially head off final adjournment until a deal is reached.“We did not get to the finish line, but that’s alright,” Baruth said Saturday, addressing nobody in particular as he presided over an empty Senate chamber during a token session. “It’s an extremely complicated area of policy work.”The Senate held another token session Tuesday, while the House did the same Monday.As for the real work — in the conference committee for H.454 — there were small signs of activity following Friday night’s dysfunction. Over the weekend, Baruth, Scott and House Speaker Jill Krowinski issued a rare joint statement in what appeared to be an effort to reassure Vermonters they “remain committed to working together to find a path forward in the coming weeks that achieves better outcomes for our kids at a rate taxpayers can afford.” Scott has previously said he won’t let legislators go home until they put a bill on his desk.Tuesday afternoon, the conference committee members from the House sent a letter to their Senate colleagues — CCing Scott’s team — outlining a tentative plan. House members will bring forward a “further proposal to consider next week,” allowing time for legislative staff and the administration to work through the plan’s details. The new proposal will address “the remaining areas of disagreement,” the representatives wrote, and they said they would be available June 12 and 13 — next Thursday and Friday — to meet and deliberate in the publicly-accessible conference committee. As of Tuesday late afternoon, it was not immediately clear whether that schedule would work for the Senate. Beyond H.454, there are several other bills lawmakers expect to take action on later this month. That includes H.480, the miscellaneous education bill, which has a measure that would ban cell phone use in schools. The legislation could, also, provide a vehicle for education-related policy that doesn’t wind up in the ed reform bill. It’s currently on the House’s calendar for action.There’s also S.51, now sitting on the Senate’s calendar, which includes tax benefits for low-income families, workers and veterans, as well as retirees and people receiving military pensions. In a conference committee late Friday, Senate members sided with the House’s version of the bill, leaving out a previous proposal for an unpaid caregiver tax credit.And there’s another bill on the House calendar that would, broadly, require people to attach a disclaimer to AI-generated content featuring political candidates that they publish within 90 days of an election. The bill, S.23, which has already passed the Senate, is up for third reading.As for your favorite Statehouse newsletter, we’ll be back in your inbox when the full Legislature return for a complete day of action — and sign off, for good, whenever they do.— Shaun Robinson, with reporting from Ethan WeinsteinOn the moveGov. Scott on Monday signed the state’s annual transportation funding and policy bill, H.488, into law. The legislation lays out new rules for conduct along Vermont’s rail trails and paves the way for the state’s largest public transportation agency, Green Mountain Transit, to transfer much of its service in rural areas to other providers, among other changes.— Shaun RobinsonScott also approved H.401, a bill that broadens exemptions for small home-based food manufacturers from annual fees and other requirements. The law, which goes into effect on July 1, increases the exemption threshold for cottage food producers from $10,000 in annual sales to $30,000 per year. Those businesses that fall under the new cottage food producer definitions who want to take advantage of the exemptions will need to attest to meeting training requirements set by the Vermont Department of Health. — Kristen FountainVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. KudosI’m an AI skeptic.

The Pownal Center Community Church argues their continuous use of the property should grant them ownership, but the town says the church has no valid claims to the worship site. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Centuries-old church takes Pownal to court over property rights.","The Bennington County Courthouse in Bennington seen on Sept. 8, 2022. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIn a small town in the southwestern corner of the state, the ownership rights to a historic church property are in dispute. The Pownal Center Community Church sued the town on April 4 to clarify property rights to their place of worship and associated land. Attorney Evan Chadwick, who represents the church, wrote in the civil lawsuit filed in Bennington Superior Court, asking for any uncertainties of legal ownership be resolved in favor of the church. The town’s lawyer Robert Fisher responded with a motion on May 7 to dismiss the lawsuit, stating that the church failed to offer a sufficient argument for its ownership of the property. According to the lawsuit, Pownal was first chartered in 1760 by the Province of New Hampshire Gov. Benning Wentworth, and a piece of land — a glebe — was set aside for the Church of England.  The Pownal Center Community Church, also known as Union Church, was established around January 1790. No town records for the property title exist from that time, the suit states, and the selectboard affirmed the building would be used for worship in 1850.The town ceased using the church’s basement for meetings by 1991, and erected Pownal’s current municipal office in 2021, according to the lawsuit. Chadwick argued that the church has held legal title over the property since 1790, had never relinquished claim to it and has maintained insurance on the property since 1980. He said the church should be granted property rights under Vermont’s adverse possession law,   which allows someone to claim ownership after occupying the property for at least 15 years, even without purchasing it.Chadwick also asserted that the church qualifies for a prescriptive easement, citing the congregation’s continuous use of the building for over 15 years as grounds for legal access and use. Chadwick wrote the church congregation and predecessors have occupied the property since 1790 for religious activities, congregational gatherings, maintenance and other uses that lessen the town’s ownership interests.According to the suit, the town obtained a deed to a portion of the property called the “carriage shed” on the southwest corner of the premises in 1905, and refused to sign a quitclaim deed for the carriage shed property in 1976. But, the town agreed with the church at the time that they “held no title interest” to the property, according to the lawsuit. Chadwick declined to comment on the lawsuit this week, and the church could not be reached for comment. Fisher wrote in the May 7 motion that the church has not offered evidence that they hold a perpetual lease, title or ownership interest in the property “by deed or right,” and the church’s claim to the property through adverse possession and prescriptive easement is “clearly barred” under the timeline of Vermont statute on recovery of lands. Fisher also asserted that “assuming the property was granted as a glebe land,” the property title would belong to the town. Pownal town officials declined to comment on the matter, but the selectboard members acknowledged the lawsuit at a special meeting on April 24. “We would like to be clear that the town has never had any intention of dispossessing this church,” Board Member Jeannie Alexander said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Centuries-old church takes Pownal to court over property rights.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/bennington-8-20220908.jpg,,,2025-06-03 19:04:39.495603

Hardy Police Chief Scott Rose was investigated by the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations and state police after the Sharp County Sheriff’s Office requested help with the case at the end of March, according to the release.
Investigators interviewed Rose on Monday at the FBI office in Jonesboro and subsequently arrested him. He was transported to the Sharp County Detention Center where he was booked, and then transported to the Independence County Detention Center. 
Rose has been charged with second degree sexual assault, sexual indecency with a child and endangering the welfare of a minor — all felonies. He was also charged for providing a minor with alcohol, a misdemeanor.
The state police release said the investigation was “active and ongoing.”
A statement on the Sharp County Sheriff’s Facebook page said Sheriff Shane Russell “received information regarding serious allegations involving Chief Rose” on March 31, prompting an investigation.
“During initial interviews with individuals believed to have first-hand knowledge, investigators found that much of the early information appeared unsubstantiated and based on rumor,” the statement said. “However, after interviewing the alleged victim and her family, disclosures were made detailing incidents of sexual contact and other forms of abuse that had not been previously reported.”
The sheriff’s office requested the assistance of other agencies given the gravity of the accusations, and to ensure impartiality and transparency, according to the statement.
​​“I want to extend my sincere gratitude to the Arkansas State Police, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their professionalism, diligence, and unwavering commitment throughout this investigation,” Russell said in the office’s statement. “Their joint efforts were vital in ensuring a thorough, impartial, and just process. This case underscores the critical importance of interagency cooperation in addressing allegations of such a serious and sensitive nature.” 
According to the city of Hardy’s website, its interim chief of police is Michael Himschoot.

The state’s largest outbreak in more than 50 years now includes 81 cases, with more than 80% in Lea County, just across the state line from Gaines County, Texas, where the outbreak began. Since mid-February, health officials have recorded measles infections in seven counties: Lea, Eddy, Chaves, Curry, Doña Ana, Sandoval and now, San Juan.
NM measles cases rise to 78, with possible exposures at Santa Fe and Albuquerque Walmarts

The San Juan County case was a child under 4 years old, who had one dose of the measles vaccine, and contracted the infection on a domestic flight.
“Travel can increase the risk of exposure,” said NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham in a written statement. “Whether you’re traveling within the U.S. or abroad, before you go make sure you’re up to date on your vaccines.”
The Farmington exposures occurred at the on the following days and times:

10:30 p.m.-4:15 a.m. Monday, May 26 and Tuesday May 27: emergency room of the San Juan Regional Medical Center at 801 West Maple Street.
2- 4 p.m.: Wednesday, May 28: emergency room of the San Juan Regional Medical Center at 801 West Maple Street.
8:15-10:30 a.m. on Friday, May 30: San Juan Regional Medical Center Health Partners Pediatrics Clinic, 407 South Schwartz, Suite 102

In the state’s Southeast corner, an adult with an unknown vaccination status potentially exposed others in an Hobbs at the following location:

8:45 – 11:30 a.m on Tuesday, May 27: NorLea Hobbs Medical Clinic,1923 North Dal Paso Street.

Measles symptoms are generally milder in people with a vaccine, according to the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and vaccination decrease the risk of spreading it to other people.
Measles symptoms develop between one to three weeks after exposure. Symptoms usually start with fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, followed by the spotty red rash on the head that spreads across the body. People can pass measles to someone several days before and after the rash appears.
NMDOH urges anyone with measles symptoms to stay home to prevent further spread and call the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-796-8773 for further information in English or Spanish about symptoms, testing or vaccines.
Health officials said the best prevention is two doses of the vaccines, which are offered at no cost at 19 public health clinic offices around the state. Clinic locations can be found on the state’s measles webpage.

Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, left, speaks during the Interim Joint Committee on Education meeting. Beside her is Rep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, June 3, 2025, in Frankfort. (LRC Public Information photo) FRANKFORT — A group of Kentucky lawmakers was briefed Tuesday on a slew of changes to federal education funding coming out of Washington.
During the first meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Education, Kentucky senators and representatives heard about proposals to cut the federal education budget and some pauses in funding under the Trump administration from Tara Thomas, government affairs manager for the AASA, The School Superintendents Association. 
Tuesday marked the start of interim committee meetings for state lawmakers this year. In the months ahead, committees of senators and representatives will hear presentations to gather information to use in the 2026 legislative session. That’s when legislators will debate and finalize the next two-year state budget. 
In recent months, the Kentucky Department of Education and Robbie Fletcher, the state’s education commissioner, have sent public warnings about how losing funding, particularly dollars previously promised as COVID relief, will jeopardize projects in Kentucky schools. About two weeks ago, the U.S. Department of Education (USED)  denied a $10.6 million request to extend COVID relief funding submitted by KDE on behalf of school districts. 
Thomas told lawmakers that the federal Education Department  has denied some extensions for projects that were not related to services “directly provided to students.” Some examples include projects for improving building ventilation or the environment of the schools or supporting professional development programs. 
Thomas said Kentucky may have to consider if it wants to fund some of these denied requests for education programs and resources itself. Elementary and secondary education receives the biggest chunk of Kentucky’s General Fund budget and is one of the most polarizing issues. 
“If Kentucky has some of those programs … you had extensions for and no longer have it, I think the state’s going to have to determine if they want to continue those programs or not,” Thomas said. 
Other topics during the presentation included a review of the Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” moving through Congress and the Trump administration’s recently released budget request for the next fiscal year. The budget bill includes a tax credit scholarship for a nationwide “school choice” program. Kentucky voters rejected a constitutional amendment last November to allow the General Assembly to fund nonpublic schools with public money. 
As the committee was pressed for time with other presentations during the meeting, Rep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, was the only lawmaker to ask a question of Thomas. Camuel asked for clarification about if the tax credit allowed for states to create reporting requirements to show how “funds are being spent, how they’re using the federal tax credits.” 
Thomas said that as of right now, the proposal has been a straightforward tax credit, but “going to the administration’s deferral to states, I would imagine that they might allow for implementing additional accountability standards if that’s what the state wants to do.” President Donald Trump previously signed an executive order to move the U.S. Education Department’s  main functions to the states. 
Committee co-chairman Sen. Steve West, R-Paris, said the briefing was intended to be a snapshot of the changes in federal policies and how they will affect Kentucky.

(Photo courtesy of Julie Stauch for All Iowans)Democrat Julie Stauch published a resume and cover letter Tuesday for a job she hopes Iowans will hire her for in 2026 — the Iowa governor’s seat.
Stauch, 68, is a former Democratic political operative who has worked on the Iowa caucus campaigns for Democratic presidential candidates including Pete Buttigieg in 2020, Bill Clinton in 1996 and Michael Dukakis in 1988. She has also worked on state campaigns, including Democrat Mike Franken’s 2022 U.S. Senate race against U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, as well as having served as chief public affairs officer for Planned Parenthood of the Heartland.
A handful of other Democrats, including State Auditor Rob Sand, have also joined the race to become the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in 2026. The Republican primary field is also expected to be contested following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she will not seek reelection, with U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra and Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, announcing exploratory committees for a run in 2026.
Republicans have held a trifecta of control at the Iowa Capitol for several years, and Iowa has had a Republican governor for more than a decade. In an interview with the Iowa Capital Dispatch Tuesday, Stauch said she believed 2026 will see a change in party control because of growing dissatisfaction and disagreements within the Republican Party, pointing to issues like the use of eminent domain in carbon sequestration pipeline projects.
She said Iowans are looking for change, and she believes there’s more appetite for non-GOP candidates in the upcoming state elections than in previous recent cycles.
“This is a huge change here coming at us,” Stauch said. “… People don’t trust anybody. They don’t trust any institutions. They don’t trust any political party.”
Stauch said she believes her campaign is a way to address voters’ concerns because she is coming into the field as a person who can both argue on behalf of Iowans’ top interests, while also having experience on working across the aisle to get important measures moved forward.
Stauch said her launch of a resume and cover letter, available on her campaign website, was a way to build trust. On her website, she allows for Iowans to submit requests for “interviews” in the style of job interviews during a hiring process, where she plans to meet with Iowans and talk about her qualifications to become governor and learn about their top concerns.
“I’m really taking this seriously about I’m applying for a job,” Stauch said. “And I’m interviewing with all the different people who are the decision makers on a job, to find out what they want to see, if we can work together… because that’s how we have to we have to build trust.”
Though Stauch has years of experience in politics, this is her first time running as a candidate. The West Des Moines Democrat said her top issues heading into the campaign are improving Iowa’s water quality, supporting public schools, addressing current problems in Iowa’s health care system and protecting eminent domain. However, she said her goal on the campaign trail was learn what issues Iowans want their governor to champion.
“If Iowans would come back and say they don’t care about any of the things that I care about, I would make their (top issues) the priority, because that’s what the governor’s supposed to do,” Stauch said. “And we have had 15 years of governors that really don’t care about the people of Iowa.”
Sand, the only Democrat to currently hold statewide elected office in Iowa, is currently considered a frontrunner in the race to become the 2026 Democratic nominee for Iowa governor. Stauch argued that her campaign is offering a different approach on how to “connect and and get to know Iowans” from Sand’s campaign that could offer a model for other Democrats in future elections.
She also said she believes having candidates compete in primaries is an overall benefit for the party, serving as a way to have candidates hone their messages and get more members of a party registered to vote ahead of the general election.
“Think about caucus years and how all that competition inside a party — whether it’s Democrat or Republican –all that competition builds your numbers, builds your base, builds your enthusiasm, and you get more people turning out in the general,” Stauch said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/juliestauch-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-06-03 19:04:39.495603

SPRINGFIELD — Heading into the end of the legislative session, consumer advocates, renewable energy industry groups and environmental advocates were hopeful about a bill that would have overhauled Illinois’ energy industry.

It would have been the largest energy reform in years, touching almost every part of the state’s electricity sector. Some said it would have been as significant as the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act — the law that requires fossil-fuel burning power plants to shutter by 2045.

But lawmakers declined to take up the bill, kicking the can down the line on energy reform for the second time this year after initially punting on the issue during the January lame duck session.

“It was a confluence of factors,” Christine Nannicelli, a Sierra Club organizer and longtime environmental advocate, told Capitol News Illinois. “To a certain extent, it was a product of running out of time.”

Lawmakers had a fairly large to-do list going into the final day of the legislative session, including approving the multiple bills that make up the state’s annual budget and a large reform package dealing with public transit in northern Illinois.

That transit legislation was also a high priority for environmental groups and labor organizations — both of which were central to the fight over energy reform.

In addition to environmentalists and labor, the bill was being negotiated by representatives of the governor’s office, major utilities and representatives of the renewable energy industry.

The push for an energy reform package grew out of a growing sense of concern that the state won’t be able to meet its ambitious climate goals. The rise of power-hungry data centers has placed significant demands on the electric grid at a time when the supply of electricity is stagnant or falling.

This situation has already led to higher prices. This month, prices on residential electric bills are increasing by an average of $10.60 per month for Commonwealth Edison customers in northern Illinois and by $45 per month for Ameren Illinois customers downstate.

While lawmakers couldn’t do anything to stop those increases, the prospect of prices staying high for longer has frustrated some advocates.

“We’re gonna lick our wounds,” Anna Markowski, who works on Midwestern issues for the Natural Resource Defense Council, said in an interview.

Signals that negotiations were heating up — and possibly breaking down — came two weeks before session ended on Saturday. A proposal from environmental groups to impose new costs on data centers drew fierce public criticism.

A letter urging Gov. JB Pritzker to oppose the proposal was released by a coalition of interest groups including the AFL-CIO, Climate Jobs Illinois, Illinois Manufacturers’ Association and Constellation Energy — the last of which operates all the state’s commercial nuclear power plants. A similar letter was signed by several economic development officials from around the state.

The provision, which would have required data centers and other large electric customers to fund new energy developments to offset their demand, was dropped from the bill shortly after.

While the data center provision drew the most public controversy, other parts of the bill were being negotiated until the last minute, reflecting a lack of consensus among activists, industry groups and other stakeholders.

The bill was also set to outline a battery storage incentive program, similar to how the state incentives solar energy. Advocates for the would-be program said it would spur historic levels of private sector investment in renewable energy.

The bill would have required 6 gigawatts of energy storage developments over the next decade, with half by 2030. This is in line with recommendations from an Illinois Commerce Commission report that lawmakers commissioned earlier this year in anticipation of this bill and in line with an analysis done by the Union of Concerned Scientists last year.

Nannicelli said this provision was opposed by some labor organizations, contributing to the demise of the bill. As of Saturday afternoon, the bill drew overall opposition from at least one union, although several others indicated via “witness slips” that they were neutral on the bill.

""These are critical issues to get right for consumers and working families that shouldn’t be forced by a deadline,” Joe Duffy, executive director of the labor-affiliated group Climate Jobs Illinois, said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing conversations over the summer to take the time needed to get it right.""

That program also drew serious concerns from some industrial groups. The Illinois Manufacturers Association worried the rate increases to pay for the battery program would have cost businesses too much.

An estimate from the American Petroleum Institute, who represents businesses that operate refineries, pegged the cost of the program over the next 11 years at about $9 billion.

“My main argument at the macro level is that it’s very expensive for very little return,” Jim Watson, who handles API’s efforts in Illinois, said Saturday. “And it does little to address capacity issues.”

An analysis from the Solar Energy Industry Association, a solar trade group, found the savings from a battery storage program would outweigh the costs, saving consumers money in the long run.

A solar industry insider said lawmakers will “stay at the table” to reduce energy prices as federal support is “incredibly unlikely” under the current political climate.

“Unfortunately, Illinois’ spring legislative session ended without a lasting solution to the continued and unprecedented energy cost increases that are taking money out of families’ wallets,” Lesley McCain, head of the Illinois Solar Energy & Storage Association, said in a statement. “While this was a disappointing conclusion to the session, we have every reason to believe leaders in Springfield remain committed to moving Illinois’ clean energy transition forward.”

Several other provisions of the bill drew significant attention as the pitch made its rounds in Springfield. One such aspect of the bill would have outlined an “integrated resource plan” process for the Illinois Commerce Commission.

This would have been a major shift at the ICC, giving the regulatory agency more authority over the state’s electric grid and more ability to alter the emissions-reduction goals of the state. Since the passage of CEJA in 2021, the ICC has become a primary enforcer of the state’s climate goals.

But, like other elements of the plan, it faced pushback from business groups. The Manufacturers’ Association was concerned that lawmakers would be ceding too much authority to state regulators.

While the bill contained several other provisions, another major issue on the table was lifting the state’s longstanding moratorium on new nuclear power developments.

Two years ago, the state loosened restrictions, allowing for the development of small nuclear reactors — the type that has only become possible in recent years thanks to technological breakthroughs. Those remain in the early stages of commercial development.

Ending the nuclear moratorium for large nuclear reactors was one of the least controversial issues in the bill. While some environmentalists were opposed, others did not feel strongly about it. Business groups were broadly in favor of it.

Like other aspects of the bill, it may return in a future legislative session. But for a broader reform package, it’s back to the drawing board.

Environmental and consumer advocates, union organizers, utilities and energy companies all indicated that negotiations would continue into the summer and that there is, broadly, a desire from lawmakers to move forward in some way to lower energy prices raised by data centers’ demand.

But what that could be, and when it might happen, is now up in the air.

“If you kick the can down the road, even a month, things could have pretty significant impact,” Nannicelli said. “We need to make a clear decision: who’s going to pay for these costs of unprecedented load growth that’s coming in large part from data centers?”

Jerry Neyer (R-Shepherd) testifies to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on his legislation offering tax credits on the purchase of sustainable aviation fuels, June 3, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonMembers of the Michigan House and Senate on Tuesday took up a set of mirrored proposals to establish incentives to produce more “sustainable aviation fuel” which blend traditional jet fuel with propellants sourced from biomass like corn, soybeans, cover crops, forestry residue and hydrogen.
Rep. Jerry Neyer (R-Shepherd), who sponsored House Bills 4424 and 4425, told members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that his legislation is aimed at bringing Michigan into the sustainable aviation fuel supply chain.
If passed, Neyer said the bills would grant farmers access to another revenue stream and encourage the expansion of ethanol production facilities and the construction of fuel blending facilities.
Sen. Joe Bellino (R-Monroe), who sponsored the Senate’s package alongside Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), explained to members of the Natural Resources and Agriculture Committee that the bills would simply allow aviation companies who choose to use the fuels to claim a tax credit.
“It’s not a mandate. It’s an open thing that if Delta [Airlines] wants to do it, Delta can get a tax break on how much fuel they buy and how much they decrease their CO2,” Bellino said. 
The proposals offer a $1.50 rebate on the purchase of fuel blends that cut carbon dioxide emissions by 50% compared to regular jet fuel, with an additional two cents per gallon for every additional 1% in emissions reduced, with the rebate capping out at $2 a gallon. After 2030, any fuel used to claim the credit must use in-state sources for the organic materials used to produce the fuel.

“Either our airline industry can either buy this product from out of state and have it blended out of state, or we can provide the opportunity here with this tax incentive there to allow our our farmers and our producers here in the state to participate in this market and get a leg up on the industry,” Neyer said. 
Additionally, with the Federal Aviation Administration working to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, these fuels are plug and play with existing fuel systems, Neyer said.
If approved, the program carries a 10-year expiration date, with Neyer telling the committee he hoped the credit would no longer be needed by that time. 
While testifying on the bill to the House committee, Sarah Gonzales, the director of state and local government affairs for Delta Airlines, assured members that the fuels are already in use, with California utilizing sustainable aviation fuels for a number of years and Delta flights out of Detroit utilizing the fuels for the first time this year. 
However, there is not enough of the fuel to meet demand for even a week, Gonzales said, noting that the current cost is two to 10 times that of traditional fuels.

With Minnesota, Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska, Washington, Iowa and California all passing tax credits for sustainable aviation fuels, Michigan is in danger of being left out of the economic benefits, Gonzales said. 
Although the packages won support from organizations like Clean Fuels Michigan and Corn Growers of Michigan with bipartisan support in both chambers, they were not without opposition.
Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers) spoke out against offering government incentives, arguing that these types of incentives take away from the market. 
“What you’re coming in here today is asking for not simply a promotion of this product, but it is still a peanut-level incentive of taking away from the free market and compelling taxpayers to fund and create a new atmosphere within the economy, further distorting the market,” Carra said. 
In response, John Delmotte, president of the Michigan Corn Growers Association, asked Carra to view it as an investment rather than a handout. 
During the Senate hearing, Nichole Keway Biber, the mid-Michigan campaign organizer for Clean Water Action, offered her opposition, arguing the incentives set aside $9 million in state funds that could be used to jump start lower-emission transportation solutions while supporting a status quo approach to energy.
While the emissions that come out of the pipe might be cleaner, the residual impacts on the environment from large-scale farming operations may outweigh those benefits, Keway Biber said.
“This is no time for false climate solutions that divert investments and focus away from achieving realer sustainability of healthy communities and waterways,” Keway Biber said.
As the House and Senate sit in deadlock, and Legislative leaders spar over the state budget ahead of the July 1 deadline, the packages showcase a sense of bipartisan, cross-chamber collaboration uncharacteristic of the current dynamic between the Democratic-led Senate and the Republican-led House. 
While the House and Senate Committees have yet to hold a vote on Neyer’s bills, he told the Michigan Advance that the package would not likely come to a vote on the House floor until after the budget is done. However, it stands a good chance given the interest in the Senate, he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2970-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 18:08:49.379282
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-03 22:00:37+00:00,CT Mirror,CT court stops feds from revoking immigration status for four students,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/ct-student-visas-revoked-court-injunction/,"Though the government restored the students' immigration status, attorneys argued the decision gave no assurance that restoration would last.","The U.S. District Court of Connecticut issued a preliminary injunction Saturday barring the federal government from revoking the immigration statuses of four Connecticut university students. 
The four students — Yan Du and Mengni He of Yale University and Elika Shams and Stephen Azu of the University of Connecticut — filed a lawsuit against the federal government in April after their immigration statuses were terminated, along with hundreds of other international students across the country. In Connecticut, at least 50 international students had their visas revoked. 
He, a Chinese citizen studying chemical and environmental engineering, and Azu, a Ghanian national participating in a year-long practical training program at UConn in actuarial science, both had been cited for traffic violations.
Du, a Chinese citizen studying experimental pathology, had his visa erroneously terminated by Yale (it was later restored). Shams, who is from Iran and pursuing a PhD in biomedical engineering at UConn, received a warning from TSA after arguing with an airline staff member. She also had a previous student visa canceled, and later reinstated, due to a “misunderstanding,” according to court documents. 
The court’s order noted that federal officials hadn’t given any reason the students’ immigration status records were revoked, but that information from the Department of Homeland Security indicated the students had been identified in the National Crime Information Center database, which includes information from federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as the FBI. 
[RELATED: CT students’ visas revoked: As details emerge, fears escalate]
The government restored the F-1 immigration status of all four students in late April. 
In response to the lawsuit, the government argued that an injunction was unnecessary, since the federal government had already restored the students’ immigration statuses and instated a new policy — on April 26 — that the government wouldn’t revoke immigration statuses again for the same reason.  
But attorneys for the students argued the government’s decision gave no assurance the visa restoration would last. 
“ We didn’t receive any information from the government that made us or our clients feel very comfortable that this wouldn’t happen again,” said Jaclyn Blickley, an attorney with the ACLU of Connecticut who is representing the students. 
District Judge Omar A. Williams agreed.  
“The April 26 Policy clearly does little to ensure that the challenged conduct will not recur. Taking the new policy at face value, ICE will not terminate Plaintiffs’ F–1 records based solely on the same challenged basis it originally invoked,” Williams wrote. “This leaves open the glaring possibility that, absent a preliminary injunction, ICE may invoke a new (but still improper) justification to terminate Plaintiffs’ records in the future.” 
Four other courts — in Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin and Michigan — have also issued preliminary injunctions against the Department of Homeland Security.
Chris Llinas, one of the attorneys representing the students, told The Connecticut Mirror that the injunction was necessary to protect students from the unpredictability of the federal government. 
He referenced a New York Times article quoting a Justice Department lawyer who said the government was looking at “a new system for reviewing and terminating” student visas. He also noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had announced he was pausing appointments for visa interviews while the government evaluates the social media accounts of visa applicants.  
Blickley, of the ACLU, said the injunction allowed the students to continue their studies and research without fear their statuses could be revoked again without warning. 
Llinas said because the termination is still part of their official records, the students could have problems if they try to apply for a green card, or if they leave and attempt to reenter the country. 
Judge Williams also said revocations of the students’ F-1 immigration statuses were not “authorized by statute or regulation.” Under U.S. law, international students can lose their immigration status only for certain reasons: failing to complete their course of study, working without authorization, giving false information to the Department of Homeland Security or being convicted of a crime resulting in more than a year in prison. The government can also revoke status “on the basis of national security, diplomatic, or public safety reasons.” 
The order concluded that it was “in the public interest” to protect the international student program in the face of the “uncertain and chaotic environment” created by the federal government. And Williams noted the students would suffer more without the injunction than the federal government would if it were imposed. 
“None of the plaintiffs has any criminal convictions, nor does any one of them arguably pose an articulable threat to the community (nor to any specific person within it),” Williams wrote. “In contrast, without injunctive relief, Plaintiffs’ [immigration] records remain in jeopardy, which threatens their lawful status, their liberty, and their academic and professional opportunities.”
The injunction applies only to the four students named in the lawsuit, but Llinas said the next step is to push to expand the order to cover all students in Connecticut who had their immigration statuses terminated — he estimated between 50 and 75 students in the state fall within that category. 
Blickley said she’s hopeful the court would grant the expanded injunction, since the four plaintiffs in this case had received a temporary restraining order — and, now, a preliminary injunction. 
“These decisions to me really reflect that the court understands the gravity of what happened to our four plaintiffs, and takes that very seriously,” she said. “I’m hopeful that the court will see all students in Connecticut as being in that same situation, that same boat with the same level of gravity.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/UConn-sheild.jpg,,,2025-06-03 18:08:49.379282

(Photo: John Partipilo)A split Tennessee Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of the state’s effort to cut the Metro Nashville Council in half, overturning a trial court decision in a battle between state and local governments.
The three-judge panel upheld a 2023 bill passed by the Republican-controlled legislature cutting the size of metropolitan government councils to 20, a move that would dramatically reduce the size of the Metro Nashville Council from 40 members — 35 from districts and five elected at-large.
The appeals court overruled a Davidson County Chancery Court’s decision that the state law violated two sections of the state Constitution, the home rule amendment that prevents the state from targeting specific local governments and a clause exempting metropolitan governments from a 25-member cap on legislative bodies.
“In resolving this dispute, we remember that it is our duty ‘to resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment,’” the decision states. 
The Court of Appeals rejected Metro Nashville’s argument that the law applies only to Nashville, thus violating Tennessee’s Home Rule law that prevents state lawmakers from passing legislation targeting a local government without its permission.
State appeals court ruling keeping Nashville’s 40-member council intact

While Tennessee has three counties that voted to form metropolitan governments, the law only requires Davidson County to shrink its council to comply. 
The Court of Appeals sided with the state in affirming the idea that though the law would only impact the current governing structure of Davidson County, two smaller counties that already have Metro Councils with fewer than 20 members will be required to maintain that compliance. Any counties that form metropolitan governments in the future would also have to comply with the law.
House Majority Leader William Lamberth, a Portland Republican, applauded the court’s decision in affirming constitutionality of the Small Government Efficiency Act.
“The action reins in excessive government growth while ensuring local municipalities across the Volunteer State remain accountable and responsive to their constituents,” Lamberth said in a statement.
The Republican-controlled legislature started targeting Metro Nashville two years ago with a spate of bills designed to give the state greater control of the local government, including reducing the size of the council. The conflict stemmed, in part, from the council’s decision to reject a move to lure the Republican presidential convention to Nashville.
Allison Bussell of the Metro Legal Department said, “We are understandably disappointed and concerned about the ruling’s implications on local sovereignty. But we are also encouraged by Judge Armstrong’s compelling dissent. We are digesting the ruling and considering our options.”
“The Home Rule Amendment of the Tennessee Constitution, in part, stands for the proposition that the size of the Metro Council is a decision for the voters of Metro Council,” said Vice Mayor Angie Henderson in a statement. “The General Assembly’s 2023 Small Government Efficiency Act was advanced purportedly to address the ‘efficiency and effectiveness’ of Nashville’s legislative branch.”
“For the last 60 years, this 40-member Council has capably and effectively served the interests of our constituents, who today number some 715,000,” Henderson said.










The obvious reason for exempting a consolidated government from the restriction on the size of its membership is to accommodate the far larger population of a consolidated government as compared to a single county or municipality.


– Judge Kenny Armstrong


Judge Kenny Armstrong of Memphis dissented from Judge Steven Stafford of Dyersburg and Judge Carma Dennis McGee of Savannah in the ruling.
Armstrong argued in his dissent that Metro Nashville, as a metropolitan government with home rule, qualifies for an exemption from state-set restrictions on its legislative body’s size.
“The obvious reason for exempting a consolidated government from the restriction on the size of its membership is to accommodate the far larger population of a consolidated government as compared to a single county or municipality,” Armstrong stated. 
This decision is a significant blow to Metro Nashville’s continued efforts to combat what city leaders have classified as unconstitutional state overreach. 
The Court of Appeals’ ruling runs counter to a slew of victories for Metro Nashville in related cases. Nashville’s legal department has also sued to block laws targeting the city’s authority over boards controlling Nashville sports stadiums, its convention center, the fairgrounds and the Nashville International Airport.
The Court of Appeals noted that its decision on the Metro Council case opposes a separate Court of Appeals ruling nullifying the state’s attempt to vacate the Metro Nashville Airport Authority and appoint new members. The court in that case concluded that the law, which applied only to Metro Nashville, violated the home rule provision. 
Tuesday’s ruling stated the airport case is “readily distinguishable” from the question of the Metro Council size statute, because the airport authority law was “unlikely” to apply to other counties in the future.

(Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s administration has reversed course on a plan to close more than 30 mine safety offices, something union leaders and advocates said would compromise inspectors’ ability to protect coal miner’s lives.
However, two field offices in Kentucky — in Prestonsburg and Beaver Dam — remain slated for closure, reports Bloomberg Law, as well as offices in Pineville in West Virginia and Mt. Pleasant, Pennsylvania.
Leases of the offices, which serve as bases for federal coal mine inspectors, were set to end this summer along with several other federal offices under a plan by the Department of Government Efficiency which until recently was led by billionaire Elon Musk.
Coal miners could pay for savings if inspectors lose offices on DOGE list, advocates warn

A spokesperson for the Department of Labor confirmed last week hat 34 Mine Safety and Health Adminsitration offices will be retained. They said the agency “has been working closely with [the General Services Administration] to ensure our MSHA inspectors have the resources they need to carry out their core mission to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthy workplaces for American miners.”
The reversal comes amid a push back from the Black Lung Association, the United Mine Workers of America, and others on what advocates called the Trump administration’s “attacks on coal miner safety.” In April, workers at the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety were put on administrative leave due to “reorganizations” at the federal level.
According to an analysis from the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, the MSHA offices that were slated to close performed more than 16,600 safety and health inspections — with more than 230 of those done in West Virginia — between February 2024 and 2025.
Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered workers from NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division back to work, ending a reduction in force that prevented coal miners with black lung disease from having the option to transfer to less dusty areas of the mine to prevent further illness and injury.
MSHA had delayed the implementation of a new silica rule aimed at protecting coal miners from the dust that causes black lung disease. The rule was set to be effective in April but will now be effective in August. 
“I’m happy they’re going to keep these MSHA offices open,” Gary Hairston, president of the National Black Lung Association, said in a news release. “We need these offices that are close to the mines so that MSHA can conduct safety inspections and respond to accidents in a timely way. Now we need MSHA to enforce the new silica rule, and we need Congress to give MSHA enough funding to do its job.”
In a statement Friday, the United Mine Workers of America, a labor union representing coal miners, said the organization is relieved by the decision but called on the Department of Labor to be transparent about which offices remain are still at risk, and to stop remaining efforts to reduce the government’s mine safety infrastructure.
“The idea that anyone would even consider shuttering dozens of MSHA field offices, most of which are located in remote mining communities, shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what it takes to keep miners safe,” UMWA International President Cecil E. Roberts said in the statement. “We’ve said from day one that cutting these offices would compromise inspectors’ ability to respond quickly to accidents, enforce safety regulations, and protect the lives of our members and their coworkers.”
In a statement Friday, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, and chair of the Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, said she was glad to hear that many of West Virginia’s MSHA offices will remain open.
“I have raised this issue directly with [Department of Labor] Secretary [Lori] Chavez-DeRemer because I was concerned about the impact these closures could have on mine safety and workers’ access to support,” Capito said. “Keeping these offices open is the right decision — and a win for miners, inspectors, and the communities they serve.”

The Pennsylvania Department of Education petitioned the court for control of the district in June 2019, as it struggled with poor finances and substandard student performance. 
Former Education Secretary Pedro Rivera said in a court petition at the time the district failed to achieve the goals laid out in its long-term recovery plan, which was approved jointly by the school board and the Department of Education in 2013.
Rowe said in a statement Tuesday the Harrisburg City School District was the first in Pennsylvania history to end receivership. State law requires the Education Department to apply for receivership when locally elected school officials are unable or unwilling to follow a financial recovery plan.
“This accomplishment is a testament to the dedicated school leaders who are committed to serving the learners in their community,” Rowe said. “When the district entered financial recovery in 2012, it was a very different district than the one we see today.”
Rowe credited Superintendent Benjamin Henry, the Harrisburg school board and the department’s appointed chief recovery officer Yvonne Hollins with “leadership, vision, and tenacity,” that led to the implementation of a financial model that is an example for other distressed districts.
In its 2019 petition, the Education Department described patterns of financial mismanagement and poor personnel decisions including the failure to hire a full-time chief financial officer and a qualified business manager, neglecting to cancel health benefits for dozens of former employees at a cost of $700,000, and hiring 37 teachers at the wrong salary step, leading to costly labor grievances from its teachers union,
Since the receivership was renewed in 2022, the superintendent and school board made significant progress in implementing its financial recovery plan. It updated school buildings and infrastructure through a capital improvement plan and maintained fund balances of at least 5% of annual spending for three consecutive years. It also passed three years of audits with no negative findings, the Education Department said.
“Their return to local control is an opportunity to put into practice everything they have learned about effective governance,” said Court-Appointed Receiver Dr. Lori Suski.

At no point did the detective engage his unmarked police vehicle’s lights or sirens, prosecutors said. Kebbabi, 24, was pronounced dead at the scene.
“The grand jury returned a charge that holds the defendant accountable for conduct that endangered Mr. Kebbabi, fellow officers, and every motorist on the road that day,” said Attorney General Matt Platkin.
An attorney for Campagna did not return a request for comment.
Under New Jersey law, the attorney general’s office is required to investigate deaths that happen during encounters with law enforcement, and it must present those findings to a grand jury, which decides whether to lodge criminal charges.
Though police are typically involved in at least some traffic fatalities under a variety of circumstances each year, it is rare for those incidents to result in criminal charges.
Campagna has been on the state police force since at least 2010 and makes almost $115,000 a year, state payroll records show.

Ron DeSantis' deputy chiefs of staff could become the next education commissioner. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal)Gov. Ron DeSantis recommended one of his top aides as the state’s education commissioner, replacing Manny Diaz Jr. following his appointment as interim president of the University of West Florida.
The Board of Education is scheduled to vote on Diaz’s replacement during a meeting on Wednesday. DeSantis’ support of Anastasios Kamoutsas, one of his deputy chiefs of staff, comes after his allies, including Diaz, backed him on X.
“Stasi Kamoutsas has delivered on important issues like parental rights, school choice, and fighting back against radical ideologies in education,” DeSantis said in a press release. “I am confident that he will continue to serve our state well as the next Commissioner of Education, and I thank Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. for his dedicated and productive service.”
The vote would come a week after the UWF Board of Trustees selected Diaz to lead the university temporarily after its president resigned amid DeSantis’ attempt to overhaul the institution, including through controversial trustee appointments.
Before joining the governor’s office, Kamoutsas worked at the Florida Department of Education as general counsel and chief of staff.
“Under my tenure, the Florida Department of Education will remain committed to student safety and success, empowering parents, and supporting teachers,” he said in the same press release announcing DeSantis’ official backing. “I look forward to working with the State Board of Education to ensure that Florida remains the education state.”
Diaz’s departure as commissioner three years after his appointment is part of a wave of DeSantis allies getting jobs in higher education leadership, including Florida International University’s selection of former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez on Monday. She was the only named finalist after Board of Trustees Chair Roger Tovar said the governor’s office had suggested FIU pick Nuñez.

Experts encourage simple changes such as planting native pollinator gardens and mowing less frequently to help fragile bee and insect populations bounce back this summer. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  How to support Vermont’s pollinators in your garden or backyard.","A bee lands on a black-eyed susan flower. Stock photo via PexelsPollinators play a substantial role in Vermont, with 60% to 80% of the state’s wild plants dependent on them to grow — but the typical American lawn may be helping drive them toward collapse. In 2024 alone, U.S. beekeepers lost an unprecedented 70% to 100% of their managed honeybee colonies. But in Vermont, native bees are under the biggest threat of decline, according to Leslie Spencer, a University of Vermont PhD candidate and Gund Institute fellow.Spencer and other researchers say grass-only yards that lack food and shelter for pollinators are part of the problem, in addition to pesticides and temperature fluctuations due to climate change.Lawn care campaigns like “No-Mow May” have grown in popularity, encouraging residents to pause mowing for a month to support insects emerging from overwintering. But protecting pollinators requires more than a single-month pause — it demands long-term, practical changes to how people manage their yards, according to Amber Jones, a staff biologist at the Vermont Center for EcoStudies.“I think the first step is cultivating a safe haven,” Jones said. “Our yards should be pollinator and animal habitats. They shouldn’t be bare wastelands for acres, if we can help it, because that just doesn’t benefit the wildlife.”Sustainable changes can include things like adding more native plants to your yard, constructing a pollinator garden or leaving some sections unmowed to help wildlife thrive. Here are a few ways Vermonters can make their gardens and yards more sustainable.Add native plants to your gardenA rule of thumb to follow when planting for pollinators is to add native species because these plants coevolved alongside Vermont’s hundreds of native bee and insect species, Spencer said.Native wildflowers as well as orchard and berry-producing shrubs provide nectar and shelter for bees and insects — and can beautify your garden in the process, according to the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department. Some flowering plant options include:Easier-to-grow starter plants such as goldenrods, milkweed and coneflower.
Popular wildflowers like native azalea, wild bergamot, violets and black-eyed Susan.
Shrubs like crabapples, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and roses.Determining your site conditions can help you assess what plants will grow best, but whether you have sand, clay, wet or dry soil in your outdoor space, native plants can grow. Most importantly, pollinator gardens should last year-round, Spencer said.“You want something that blooms each month of the growing season,” she said, from April all the way to the autumn frost.The Fish & Wildlife Department has a seasonal list of pollinator-friendly perennial species that includes each plant’s bloom months and height.Vermont Center for Ecostudies biologist Amber Jones and biologist intern Pia Carman count invertebrates collected from a lawn for the Upper Valley Backyard Tick Project. Photo courtesy of Gita YinglingSwap out grass for alternativesSome gardeners may want to consider replacing or supplementing a traditional lawn or turf grass with low-growing alternatives, which can be an easy way to make your yard more ecologically beneficial, according to the Vermont Wildflower Farm. In Vermont, these traditional lawns can be swapped out for a variety of native flowering groundcovers.Clover requires less watering and maintains a vibrant green color.
Selfheal is a low-growing purple-flowered plant that thrives in lawns and supports native bees.Wild strawberry offers food for pollinators and people with its flowers and edible berries.
Creeping thyme is a drought-tolerant herb and slow but effective ground cover.Some of these alternatives can grow in lawns without being planted, such as wild strawberry plants and violets. According to Jones, simply raising the deck of your lawnmower four inches high can preserve these plants even as they grow among turfgrass.Lawn alternatives can boost biodiversity while creating a visually appealing yard. In addition, they are resilient, often requiring less mowing, watering and chemical intervention than traditional grass, according to the North American Butterfly Association.Shrink your lawnIf opting to mow less, shrinking your lawn over time can also mitigate some of the invasive plants that can arise as a result, such as barberry, garlic mustard and even shrub honeysuckle. By watching out for invasives in concentrated areas, gardeners can quickly identify and remove them.Spencer said another option is to “soften the edges” of your lawn, or put perennial garden beds on the perimeter to reduce the amount of grass in your area. “Most of us aren’t using the entirety of our maintained lawn space,” she said. “So you can either put in perennial beds or stop mowing bits of your lawn to really create some sort of wild edges.”Canadian Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio canadensis) on Common Milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) in Vermont. Photo courtesy of Bernie Paquette on iNaturalist.Consider why you mowThe choice to cultivate a wilder, more biodiverse outdoor space also sparks curiosity about why mowed and manicured yards have become common practice, Jones said. Trimmed grass is part of a uniquely American homeowner aesthetic. With more than 40 million U.S. acres covered by lawns, they are the single largest irrigated crop grown in the country. An estimated two-thirds of Vermont’s population live in rural areas, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Grass-only lawns are common in these rural and residential spots, but they rely on pesticide and pollution-inducing fertilizer treatments while offering little to no food or habitat for wildlife, according to the National Wildlife Federation.Although lawns can be used for sports or recreation, Spencer pointed out the low biodiversity, which are a major drawback for wildlife. Pollinators need varied habitats, which gardeners should be mindful of all year, Jones said. In the fall, insects nest and hibernate in hollow stems and sticks. The leaf litter and debris we often clear or leafblow could be instead used by bees, caterpillars and overwintering insects, she said.“The lawn is not the only way to have a landscape,” Spencer said. “We put so many resources into creating a lawn because of this American status symbol that really permeates our residential culture.”Even for those who cannot alter their lawns, due to rental agreements or homeowners association rules, Jones and Spencer agreed there are other impactful ways to support pollinators. Spencer recommended planting native species in container gardens and advocating against pesticide use. “There are hundreds, if not thousands, of native pollinators that need protecting,” she said. “Most people don’t even realize there’s a whole world of insects right beneath our noses.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  How to support Vermont’s pollinators in your garden or backyard.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Black-Eyed-Susan-Bee-Native-Plants-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 18:08:49.379282
,DC,2025-06-03 21:45:20+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Elon Musk fumes tax and spending bill is a 'disgusting abomination'; GOP senators shrug,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/elon-musk-fumes-tax-and-spending-bill-disgusting-abomination-gop-senators-shrug,,"WASHINGTON — Billionaire and former Trump administration official Elon Musk published a flurry of social media posts Tuesday slamming the “big, beautiful bill” in Congress, but his criticisms were mostly ignored or brushed aside by Republican senators.Musk wrote that the “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination” and told the GOP lawmakers who voted for it in the House that they “did wrong.”“In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,” he wrote in a later post.But Musk’s frustrations largely fell flat.White House press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed Musk’s opposition, saying that President Donald Trump is well aware of his views on the legislation and will be moving forward anyway.Musk last week said he will continue to advise Trump despite stepping away from his official role as a special government employee who oversaw dramatic spending cuts as head of the U.S. DOGE Service.The tax and spending package would cut about $1.5 trillion in federal funding for several programs during the next decade, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to release its full analysis of the package Wednesday, including how changes made just before the bill went to the floor will impact state budgets and people’s access to safety net programs.‘We have a job to do’Leavitt’s comments came just before Republican senators were peppered with questions about Musk’s statements following a closed-door working lunch on Capitol Hill.Many disregarded Musk’s lobbying efforts during brief interviews, saying they don’t expect his opposition to affect Senate debate on the sweeping tax and spending cuts package that the House passed last month.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said that he and Musk clearly held differing opinions about the package, which he said was possibly based on Musk’s reading of analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Thune said that he expects the tax and spending cuts policies included in the package would “lead to significant growth” and that would lead to a reduction in the annual deficit.“My hope is that as he has an opportunity to further assess what this bill actually does, that he’ll come to a different conclusion,” Thune said. “But nevertheless, we have a job to do, the American people elected us to do. We have an agenda that everybody campaigned on, most notably the president of the United States, and we’re going to deliver on that agenda.”Thune added he expects the legislation “can be strengthened in the Senate in a number of ways,” though he didn’t detail exactly what those would be.‘We’ll see what President Trump does’West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said that Musk is “entitled to his opinion” and that GOP lawmakers are well aware that he’s “frank,” but that likely won’t sway them in the weeks ahead.“President Trump is the one that's going to be the biggest advocate, biggest influencer, in terms of how the Senate deals with this vote,” Capito said. “So no matter what Elon Musk or anybody else says — and I don't want to diminish him, because I don't think that's fair — it's still going to be second fiddle to President Trump. So we'll see what President Trump does.""Arkansas Sen. John Boozman said he doesn’t expect Musk’s tweets will have much of an impact on internal GOP debates about the bill.“He’s entitled to his opinion. I don’t think it will make any difference,” Boozman said, adding efforts to cut spending are already a central part of the GOP’s goals for the package.North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said the tweets won’t have any influence on which amendments GOP senators propose to the legislation.“No,” Tillis said, when asked about Musk’s overall sway.Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno said people raising concerns with the legislation need to give that chamber time to review what the House passed and figure out what they’re going to keep and what they’re going to change.“We have to refocus and remember that this bill, all along, wasn't supposed to solve every problem on Earth,” Moreno said. “This bill was about making certain that President Trump had the resources to secure our border, that was the biggest part of the election; to avoid a $4 trillion tax increase, that is something that Americans care a lot about; and to start a process of reducing government spending. So that's what we're doing.”‘Donald Trump is our president, not Elon Musk’Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said he didn’t have much of a reaction to the social media posts, while laughing, other than to say that Musk is ""entitled to his opinion.”Hawley said he doesn’t expect Musk’s lobbying efforts would have any impact on how GOP senators amend the bill, before sending it back to the House.West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice noted that Musk isn’t the president, when asked how the tweets might impact his deliberations on the legislation.“Y'all may like this or not like this, but you know, Donald Trump is our president, not Elon Musk,” Justice said.“And really and truly, I don't know of the disagreement that they may have with one another or what they have going on,” Justice added. “I really respect Elon Musk, and I think he did a great job and I'm very, very pleased with all the things that he uncovered. But with all that being said, I think we all should stand by our president.”‘All of us are a little frustrated’ Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said he hopes Musk’s attempts to influence lawmaking will yield more spending cuts than the $1.5 trillion in the House bill, though he didn’t say he’d oppose the measure if that doesn’t happen.“Well, I think all of us are a little frustrated. We're not getting as much cuts as we thought we would, but we could in the long run, because we're not done with it,” Tuberville said. “So I think that was a little bit of an encouragement.”Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said he shares Musk's skepticism about the legislation’s impact on the annual federal deficit and the rising national debt.But when asked how influential Musk has been at swaying Republican senators to oppose the package, Paul noted that anyone standing against the bill risks “the ire of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,” referring to the White House’s address.Paul said that if he and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who has also raised concerns about the way the package is written, can get the support of two more GOP senators, then they believe they can begin direct talks with Trump.“The president will negotiate if he needs to,” Paul said. He won't if he doesn't need to.”",,,,2025-06-03 18:08:49.379282
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-03 21:35:03+00:00,CT Mirror,Republican lawmaker cites explicit language during budget debate,"Ginny Monk, Laura Tillman and Angela Eichhorst",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/ct-budget-debate-explicit-language/,A book-banning provision within the CT budget prompted a lawmaker to read sexually explicit material on the House floor during debate.,"Editor’s note: This story contains graphic sexual language that some readers might find offensive. 
Debate on the biennial budget devolved into a culture war discussion about book banning on Monday night when a Republican lawmaker read sexually explicit material from books for young adults on the floor of the House of Representatives.
Children’s Committee ranking member Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, read excerpts from books she said can be found in Connecticut school libraries. The excerpts referenced oral sex and used vulgar terms for body parts and other sexual acts.
Monday night’s discussion was a continuation of a debate that began when the legislation, which attempts to prevent book banning, made its way through committee this session.
Dauphinais, a conservative Republican, has often raised concerns about pornography in libraries and cited specific books that have previously been considered for bans, many of them about sex education or coming-of-age stories that involve sexual situations and LGBTQ+ issues. 
Under the legislation, which passed the House early Tuesday morning as part of the biennial budget, school boards and library governing bodies would be required to create a policy for considering requests to ban books, and they would not be allowed to exclude a book solely because someone in a local community finds it offensive.
Those governing bodies would not be able to prohibit a book based on the background or viewpoints of the book or its author, and their policies would have to protect against discrimination based on race, religion or sexual orientation, among other provisions. 
Lawmakers who have advocated for the bill say these requirements would protect librarians from harassment and prevent small-scale fights that can lead to more widespread censorship in communities. They argue that most books that have historically been banned are about historically marginalized groups and that people have a choice when they walk into a library about which books they read and which they leave on the shelf.  
Dauphinais began her comments late Monday night by expressing frustration that House Democrats had inserted the bill’s language into the budget rather than allowing for debate solely on the issue. After describing some of the features of the legislation and her concerns, she warned anyone watching the debate — they are broadcast on CT-N — who might have children that there would be explicit language used, then listed some of the schools she said had the books in their libraries.
“Have you ever given logan a blow job,” she read from “l8r, g8r,” a coming-of-age story about friendship told in the form of instant messages between teenagers.
“Do you think that’s appropriate? I don’t,” she said.
“Are you gonna eat her pussy,” Dauphinais continued, this time reading from “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” a novel written from the perspective of a socially awkward teenager who befriends a girl with cancer.
At that point, Deputy Speaker Juan Candelaria, who was presiding over the House, banged the gavel and asked Dauphinais to stop “out of respect for others that might get offended.”
“You’re telling me that this language isn’t appropriate in this chamber,” Dauphinais said. “This is in elementary school libraries.”
She switched to a type of self-censoring, referring to a “blow mob,” and a “sock.”
“This was the first time we ever had sex without protection. I see what the homies mean, it do feel different,” she read from “Concrete Rose,” a coming-of-age story about Black boyhood and manhood.
Then, Candelaria, D-New Haven, told her to stop reading from the document.
She continued, spelling curse words and reading an excerpt describing a vagina.
“This is disgusting,” she said. “And this is what our children are looking at in our schools.” She spoke for about half an hour.
Rep. Larry Butler, D-Waterbury, gave a speech afterward condemning the language.
“I will tell you that in my 18 years here, I have never seen the demonstration of such vulgarity tonight, reaching the lowest level that I’ve ever seen in this chamber,” Butler said. “When we’re talking about books in libraries, that’s one thing. You could just mention a book.”
“Certainly we don’t have to stoop to those levels to disagree,” Butler added.
Democratic leadership on Tuesday said the discussion was a waste of time, particularly for lawmakers who worked on more substantive policy issues related to the budget.
“For the socially moderate, fiscally conservative Republicans that still exist in Connecticut, to know that your entire budget debate comes down to somebody who wants to make this a cultural issue and use words like that, it would probably anger me,” said Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford. “It loses sight and track of many of the things they were mentioning. There were some people who made fiscal points on the budget.”
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, complimented Candelaria’s professionalism at that moment.
“I think it just threw people off quite a bit to hear that kind of language being used on the floor,” Rojas said.
Asked about the debate, House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said including provisions about libraries in the bill was disrespectful.
“I know that the Democrats felt that that might have been disrespectful,” Candelora said of the sexually explicit language used by Dauphinais. “What was disrespectful was to have a budget bill that had a lot of policies that went well beyond the budget, and one of them being how libraries are going to be governed now.”
He went on to defend Dauphinais, saying she raised important points.
“If an elected official has the courage to stand at a podium and say what she said and takes ownership of it, I have no problem,” Candelora said.
But Dauphinais said on Tuesday that she believed the public deserves to know what kinds of books are in school libraries and how the bill would create rules that take away unilateral local control of their books and policies. 
“Perhaps they wouldn’t put these sorts of bills in the budget so we could have a really good qualified debate on the House floor with regard to the contents of the bill,” Dauphinais said. “They should be appalled that they’re in children’s libraries in schools, not appalled that I said it on the House floor.” 
Dauphinais said she got the information about the book excerpts she read Monday night from Take Back the Classroom, a group that identifies books with explicit materials and has a database of which schools across the country have those books. They’re part of a larger movement around parental rights that mostly comes from the right side of the political aisle.
Those groups argue that parents should have more control over what their children learn in school.
This isn’t the first time sexually explicit content has been mentioned during this session’s debate about book bans.
Speakers at a Committee on Children public hearing in February also quoted from sexually explicit literature. Several focused on passages from the sex-ed graphic novel “Let’s Talk About It.”
Leslie Wolfgang, director of public policy at the Family Institute of Connecticut, said with the passage of the bill, “[Parents] won’t be able to stop their 11-year old from reading” the sexually explicit content. She also showed the committee photocopied images of masturbation from the book.
Another speaker read a passage about other sexual acts, with photos from the novel containing genitalia displayed on her Zoom background. 
Throughout the February committee meeting, speakers categorized sex-ed material as “radical” and likened it to “grooming.” 
Children’s Committee co-chair Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, read sexually explicit passages from Ezekiel and Song of Solomon in the Bible as a counterpoint. He asked if passages such as “She was a prostitute in Egypt. There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emissions were like that of the horse,” would disqualify the Bible from being placed in school libraries. 
Ritter said Tuesday there are different expectations for what can be read in a book versus what should be said on the floor of the House of Representatives. He pointed to Mark Twain’s “Huckleberry Finn” as an example. The American classic uses racial slurs throughout the work, but Ritter said those aren’t words he wants to hear during debate.
“You have a lot of books that have a lot of bad words in libraries, from very famous authors,” Ritter said. “To try to draw that correlation to the expectation of decorum on the House floor, I think, is very different.”

Jeff Landry doubled down on Louisiana’s preparedness ahead of the 2025 hurricane season. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Hurricane season descends on Louisiana this year amidst a cloud of federal uncertainty. Despite fears over massive staffing cuts and the threatened dissolution of key agencies that help forecast hurricanes and support storm recovery, Gov. Jeff Landry doubled down Tuesday on his belief that Louisiana is prepared should a natural disaster strike. 
Landry said he had spoken at length with U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and didn’t anticipate any big changes – at least in the next few months. 
“I do not believe that the president or the White House has any intention of revamping FEMA while hurricane season is in play,” Landry said at a news conference held at the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.
“We are working closely with FEMA,” GOHSEP interim director Brig. Gen. Jason Mahfouz,  said, adding that federal assistance “has been validated and pledged to us” in the case of a storm overwhelming the state’s ability to respond. 
Uncertainty over FEMA’s ability to stand up a disaster response heightened Monday when the agency’s director, David Hutchinson, reportedly told staffers at a meeting that he was unaware the U.S. had a hurricane season. The White House said Tuesday that Hutchinson was joking.
In addition to FEMA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has also been the target of large staffing cuts since President Donald Trump returned to office. The National Weather Service and its National Hurricane Center are part of NOAA, a subagency of the Department of Commerce.
“I have not heard from anyone that those cuts are impacting the information that would flow up to the states,” Landry said. 
The turmoil in Washington, D.C., comes as the 2025 hurricane season is “very likely going to be another active year in the Gulf of Mexico,” state climatologist Jay Grymes said, adding that he was confident “our tropical coverage this season will be more than adequate for what we require.”
As the storm season starts, neighboring states Arkansas and Mississippi have experienced delays and denials in getting federal emergency aid declarations from President Trump after being hit by tornadoes in recent months. 
Still, the governor maintained his confidence in federal support should a storm hit, saying he believed the only change might be more “flexibility” with state control of disaster response should the need arise .
“The states have always maintained the first responsibility anyhow,” Landry said. “FEMA and the White House and our congressional delegation will ensure that Louisiana receives the resources it needs.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3106-1-1024x635.jpg,,,2025-06-03 18:08:49.379282

Ron Wyden, the committee’s top Democrat, slammed the nominee in remarks delivered ahead of the vote. Wyden said Long “has no tax policy experience, but he has lots of tax fraud experience.”“When he left office, he threw in with a bunch of fly-by-night operators selling tax deals that were sketchy at best,” Wyden said.Wyden highlighted contributions Long received to his dormant U.S. Senate campaign from officials at the Arkansas-based White River Energy Corps after revelations that Long was tied to the company and its sales of nonexistent tax credits.The Oregon Democrat said Long’s “scandals here are too big to ignore.”Long testified before the committee on May 20 and denied any wrongdoing.Long, who served in the House from 2011 to 2023 and previously spent multiple years as a talk radio host, told lawmakers on the panel that he plans to get rid of “stinking thinking” at the IRS and implement a “comprehensive plan” to modernize the agency and “invest in retaining skilled members of the team.”The agency has lost more than 11,000 employees, or 11% of its workforce, either through deferred resignations or mass firing of probationary workers since Trump began his second term, according to a May 2 report from the agency’s inspector general.Trump announced Long as his pick for the IRS post in December.",,,,2025-06-03 18:08:49.379282

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey State Police violated a suspect’s constitutional rights when troopers entered his driveway to attach a GPS tracker to his car under a warrant that only allowed them access to the man’s vehicle, an appellate panel ruled Tuesday.
The three-judge panel found officers violated state and federal constitutional protections by entering Maurice Johnson’s driveway to attach the tracker because the communications data warrant they obtained for the device did not authorize them to enter the property.
“The [warrant] did not expressly authorize entry onto the driveway. Nor did the State Police seek prior judicial authorization to enter onto defendant’s residential property when they abandoned the plan to install the device on a public street or parking lot,” the court wrote.
The court granted Johnson’s motion to suppress evidence gleaned from the improperly placed tracker.
GPS data obtained from the tracker revealed a pattern of stops consistent with drug dealing, authorities said, and eventually led police to a storage unit in Johnson’s name that held drugs, guns, and “a substantial sum of money,” the court said.
A lower court judge had rejected Johnson’s request to toss the fruits of the communications data warrant, finding that the driveway was not afforded Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches because it was unfenced, unlike the rest of the parcel.
The appeals court said the driveway, however accessible, was protected from unreasonable search and seizure.
“The fact the particular area where the subject vehicle was parked was not protected from the weather does not mean it was not protected from physical incursion under the United States and New Jersey Constitutions,” the panel wrote.
The judges acknowledged that police can have an implied license to approach a home’s front door — as any private citizen might — but said police officers veered away from the front door to plant the tracker, “thus exceeding the spatial boundaries of any ‘customary invitation’ that might be granted to a visitor such as a delivery person.”
An implied license, which allows people to, for example, knock on a front door or deliver a package without committing trespass, did not permit authorities to enter the driveway so they could put a tracker on Johnson’s car, they added.
“Simply put, installing a concealed GPS device is not something a visitor or delivery person would be expected and permitted to do,” the court wrote.
The state’s arguments, which compared officers’ actions to a private vehicle repossession, were unconvincing because the Fourth Amendment protects against state intrusion, not against private debt collectors, they added.
Portions of the warrant that left the manner of the tracking device’s installation to officers’ discretion likewise did not allow them to enter the driveway because both state and federal constitutions require warrants to “particularly describe” the locations they allow officers to search, the judges found.
“The [warrant’s] reference to the need ‘to minimize the chances of detection of the device by the person whose vehicle is the subject of this warrant’ was not some kind of code authorizing physical entry onto unspecified private property,” the court wrote.
Whether police sincerely believed the warrant allowed them to enter the driveway was irrelevant, the judges said.
A lower court discarded findings from a separate search warrant that authorized officers to look through Johnson’s home because officers did not knock and announce themselves before entering, as the warrant required. But the lower court declined to suppress evidence secured through the improperly applied GPS tracker.
The drugs, guns, and money discovered in Johnson’s storage unit formed the basis for the warrant authorizing a search of his home, according to Tuesday’s ruling.

DemasThe state of Michigan acted hastily and without regard to the wellbeing of local residents when it closed down one of two state-run juvenile justice facilities for young offenders, members of the criminal justice system in northern Michigan told state lawmakers Tuesday.
Losing the the Shawono Center in Grayling, which provided residential treatment for male juveniles ages 12 to 21 who committed felony criminal offenses, including criminal sexual offenses, has put communities in the northern portion of the state’s Lower Peninsula in danger, Roscommon County Prosecutor Michael Edwards told the Michigan House Child Welfare System Committee on Tuesday.
There is a critical need for more bed spaces in juvenile facilities, Edwards said. Last year, while there was a waiting list to get into Shawono, two Roscommon juveniles went on a crime spree, breaking into numerous vehicles and stealing firearms over the course of several months, Edwards said.
“The Shawono Center provided security to our communities. It was solace knowing that violent and dangerous juveniles are not free to roam our communities, while at the same time providing these troubled youths an opportunity to become productive members of society,” Edwards said. “Although there are private facilities available to house delinquent juveniles, most, if not all, refuse to accept violent juveniles.”
In 2024, when the juveniles were arrested, the Roscommon County Sheriff’s Office raised concerns with the lack of access to rehabilitative services for juvenile offenders, according to UpNorthLive.
“Due to the lack of secure facilities to place such youth, it continues to be difficult to stop these incidents from occurring within our community,” the sheriff’s office told UpNorthLive at the time of the arrests. “We foresee this to be an ongoing issue into the future as the juvenile system struggles without solutions.”

The closing of Shawono was announced by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, or MDHHS, in January, with the department saying the current 17 juveniles would be moved to the newer Michigan Youth Treatment Center in Macomb County. The department said the move would be completed by early summer, adding 40 more beds and 70 new jobs.
A news release from the announcement heralded the new Michigan Youth Treatment Center, or MYTC, as a “newer, more modern facility… that can better serve the youths and meet their treatment needs”.
“While the decision to relocate the services provided by the Shawono Center was difficult, transferring to Macomb County will allow us to serve more youths and help them become healthy and productive citizens,” MDHHS Director Elizabeth Hertel said in a statement. “I appreciate the hard work and dedication of the staff at the Shawono Center, and we will work to find positions for all staff who would like to remain with MDHHS.”
The hope was that moving services to southeast Michigan where the bulk of Michigan’s population is located would help the center maintain staffing numbers and resources, as well as increase family involvement with juveniles who are receiving care at the facility, the news release said.
But whereas the Shawono was more centrally located to all of the Lower Peninsula’s counties,   the move leaves kids and families in much of the state hours away from a state-run juvenile justice facility, Jacob Collini, a juvenile referee for Roscommon County courthouse said Tuesday.
Collini called on lawmakers to facilitate the reopening of Shawono and to consider amending state rules that were born from incidents of abuse and neglect in child caring facilities, notably the 2020 death of 16-year-old Cornelius Fredericks at the now-closed Lakeside Academy in Kalamazoo who died after being restrained by staff members.
“Some of these youth that are being placed … are extremely assaultive towards their caregivers, being their parents, school officials and even law enforcement, and one of the reasons that we place them sometimes is just as much for their safety as it is for the safety of the community,” Collini said. “We have had a great deal of success working with Shawono Center. The youth that return to the community from Shawono Center appear to be rehabilitated. Recidivism has gone down for youth that have been in Shawono center. Removing Shawono Center from Northern Michigan will likely have negative results.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_1191-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-06-03 18:08:49.379282

Jared Polis signed a bill Tuesday intended to improve to the Colorado Bureau of Investigations’ capacity to review sexual assault kits, which include DNA samples and other evidence from survivors.
Senate Bill 25-304 establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will review the effectiveness of the state’s medical, legal and criminal response to sexual assault and make victim-centered recommendations to the Colorado Legislature.  
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint members of the board, including representatives from state agencies and various organizations that advocate for sexual assault victims. The board will need to submit a preliminary report to the Legislature by Dec. 15.

Law enforcement agencies overseeing sexual assault criminal cases will be required to update victims on the status of their kit every 90 days. The bill also sets a 60-day turnaround goal for crime labs reviewing forensic medical evidence from sexual assault kits. The agency’s current goal is 90 days, which it expects to achieve in 2027. The estimated turnaround time for kits at the end of April was about a year and a half, with 1,369 kits in the backlog, according to a recently implemented data dashboard.
Colorado’s forensic services are facing a historic backlog of sexual assault kits due to reduced staff capacity and ballooning fallout from the discovery that a former CBI forensic scientist manipulated more than 1,000 DNA test results over her career. The backlog means delayed justice for survivors, as DNA evidence can often be critical for a criminal conviction.
The bill originally would have created a full-time position to oversee the state’s work to improve the kit review process, but it was amended to reduce spending given the tight budget year. Sponsors include Rep. Jenny Willford, a Northglenn Democrat, Rep. Meg Froelich, an Englewood Democrat, and Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat.

Snyder, an attorney, was tapped by the Trump administration in January to serve as the deputy administrator and director of the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services.
Snyder is resigning due to personal family matters, a source familiar with the situation told Mississippi Today on Tuesday. 
Caprice Knapp, former North Dakota Medicaid director, will take over as interim acting director of the Centers for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS), the nation’s public health insurance program for children, pregnant women and people who have low incomes or disabilities. 
“Drew has played an invaluable role leading our Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services as we began strengthening the programs to better serve the nation’s most vulnerable,” CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement. “Caprice is an incredibly talented leader and will help lead the Center through this transition, ensuring we continue building upon Drew’s efforts.” 
Snyder declined to comment to Mississippi Today. Politico first reported the news of his departure. 
Snyder led the Mississippi Division of Medicaid for nearly seven years and was the agency’s longest-serving director. He served under two Republican governors who successfully opposed expanding the Medicaid program to include working low-income Mississippians. 
Snyder also briefly led The Healthcare Collaborative, which represents dozens of hospitals that splintered off from the Mississippi Hospital Association. The Collaborative is housed under Capitol Resources, a powerful multistate lobbying firm that has donated thousands of dollars to Republican officials’ campaigns. 
Snyder’s resignation comes as the Medicaid program faces monumental changes under what Trump calls a “big, beautiful bill” of tax breaks and spending cuts, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives and will begin making its way through the Senate this week.

Free.,Senators object to Trump push to ax Education Department programs for low-income students,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/senators-object-trump-push-ax-education-department-programs-low-income-students,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. senators from both parties pressed Education Secretary Linda McMahon on Tuesday over the Trump administration’s proposal to eliminate funding for key programs administered by the Education Department for disadvantaged and low-income students.McMahon defended those and other sweeping changes outlined in President Donald Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget request — which calls for $12 billion in spending cuts at the department — while testifying before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies to outline the president’s proposal.Tuesday’s hearing followed the Education secretary’s testimony in front of the corresponding House panel in May. The House and Senate appropriations committees share jurisdiction over the bill to fund the department for the coming fiscal year.McMahon said the budget request takes a “significant step” toward her and Trump’s goal “to responsibly eliminate the federal bureaucracy, cut waste and give education back to states, parents and educators.”Senators blast move to eliminate programsBut the budget’s proposal to do away with the Federal TRIO Programs, which were funded at nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2024, as well as the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, or GEAR UP, which were funded at $388 million, garnered criticism from both Republicans and Democrats on the panel.While the Federal TRIO Programs include federal outreach and student services programs to help support students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, GEAR UP aims to prepare low-income students for college.Neither TRIO nor GEAR UP has “met most of its performance measures for a number of years” and states and localities are “best suited” to determine how to support the activities in the programs rather than the federal government, according to the summary of the department’s more detailed budget request.Sen. Susan Collins, chair of the broader Senate Appropriations Committee, said she “strongly” disagrees with the budget’s proposal to cut the TRIO programs.The Maine Republican, who co-chairs the Congressional TRIO Caucus, said she’s “seen the lives of countless first-generation and low-income students, not only in Maine, but across the country, who often face barriers to accessing a college education changed by the TRIO program.”Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, chair of the subcommittee, echoed Collins’ concerns about cutting TRIO and GEAR UP, and encouraged her panel to reevaluate those parts of the budget request.The West Virginia Republican said “my state, and many of our states, but mine in particular, I think, has a lot of first-time collegegoers, a lot of students that don’t have the aspirational goals either within their family, they’re not looking at how they can achieve education or a certificate or whatever, and that’s where I think these programs have been particularly useful.” McMahon said that while she “absolutely” agrees that there is some effectiveness in the TRIO programs, “these programs were negotiated at very tough terms in that the Department of Education has no ability to go in and look at the accountability of TRIO programs.”“It specifically eliminates our ability to do that, and I just think that we aren’t able to see the effectiveness across the board that we would normally look to see with our federal spending,” she said.Sen. Jeff Merkley fired back at McMahon’s claim, noting that there are benchmarks set and annual performance reports required for grantees.“Let me just say, your argument that there’s no studies, no accountability, is just actually wrong, and the fact that you’re coming here not even having looked at your own department’s studies of these programs in order to be informed about them is profoundly troubling,” the Oregon Democrat said.Education Department ‘responsibly winding down’The White House released new details on the proposed budget last week, and according to a summary, the $12 billion spending cut “reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down.”The more detailed request includes lowering nearly $1,700 from the maximum amount a student can receive annually through the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college.The budget proposal also calls for consolidating 18 grant programs for K-12 education and replacing them with a $2 billion formula grant that would give states spending flexibility. The document asks for a $60 million increase to expand the number of charter schools in the country.The proposal came as Trump has sought to dramatically redefine the federal role in education.The administration was hit with a major setback to its education agenda in May after a federal judge in Massachusetts ordered the Education Department to reinstate the more than 1,300 employees who were gutted through a reduction in force effort.The judge also blocked the agency from carrying out Trump’s executive order calling on McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department and barred the department from carrying out the president’s directive to transfer the student loan portfolio and special education services out of the agency.",,,,2025-06-03 18:08:49.379282

Effective immediately, the McCall, New Meadows and Weiser ranger district offices will temporarily close until further notice, Payette National Forest officials announced in a news release issued Tuesday.
No reopening timeline was announced.
The three temporary closures were announced less than two weeks after Sawtooth National Forest officials said they temporarily closed Sawtooth National Recreation Area offices in Stanley and Ketchum through June 16 due to staff reductions.  
Additionally, the Council Ranger District Office and the supervisors office in McCall are operating under new hours – from 8 a.m. to noon and 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, Payette National Forest officials said Tuesday.

Officials with the Payette National Forest said forest leaders are adjusting to losses in personnel due to retirements and deferred resignations.
“We have adjusted our hours to allow current staffing to best serve the many communities surrounding the Payette National Forest, with the overall goal of improvement to our public services while providing access to the outdoors that we all love,” Payette National Forest Forest Supervisor Matt Davis said in a written statement.  “The safety and enjoyment of our visitors remain top priorities, and we’ll steward the areas we can with available staff and resources.” 
As part of its effort to reduce the federal workforce, the Trump Administration offered a deferred resignation program to thousands of federal workers – including U.S. Forest Service workers – that allowed them to quit their jobs but continue to be paid through September, States Newsroom previously reported.

The temporary closures to U.S. Forest Service offices in Stanley, Ketchum, McCall, New Meadows and Weiser are arriving in conjunction with the kickoff to the busy summer recreation season on public lands in Idaho.
In recent years, Idaho has been experiencing record usage of public lands, campgrounds and trails. 
Some conservationists worry the reduction in U.S. Forest Service staff and cutbacks to offices won’t actually succeed in reducing government excess and waste. 
Instead, they worry it will make it harder to provide the public with information about fire safety, food storage requirements in bear country, directions to recreation sites, hazards such as bear activity or trail closures and help novice campers understand how to extinguish campfires and pack out their trash.
Josh Johnson, central Idaho director for the Idaho Conservation League, said countless people visit U.S. Forest Services offices every day seeking basic assistance. 
“To not have Forest Service staff available to support visitors, help them find out where they need to go, answer questions and respond to other issues is a problem and unfortunate,” Johnson said in a May 23 interview. 
“You can’t expect to eliminate as much forest service staff as you have and still provide essential services people are used to seeing …,” Johnson added.
With the temporary ranger office closures in place and new hours at other facilities, officials with the Payette National Forest are urging the public to visit their website for information about closures and the availability of recreation sites.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Republican budget bill the U.S. House approved last month includes a surprise for the 40 states that have expanded Medicaid: penalties for providing health care to some immigrants who are here legally.
Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.

In 2022, Maine extended Medicaid coverage, locally known as MaineCare, to children under 21 and pregnant people regardless of immigration status.

Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.
Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”
West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.
Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”
“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.
There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized if immigrants qualify for the program, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.










It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.
The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.
By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.
“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”
The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.
Need to go to the hospital? Texas and Florida want to know your immigration status.

“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”
Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.
Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.
Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.
Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.
“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”
Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.
“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”
More States Offer Health Coverage to Immigrant Children

Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.
“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.
Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.
Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.
“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.
California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.
“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.
If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.
“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.

Photo: Morgan Trau, WEWSThe Ohio Senate has announced its version of the state budget, one that provides a slight increase in public school funding, gives a $600 million grant to the Cleveland Browns for their new stadium and creates a flat income tax of 2.75%.
Senate President Rob McColley (R-Napoleon) and Finance Chair Jerry Cirino (R-Kirtland) announced their proposed amendments to the state’s biennial operating budget on Tuesday afternoon. House Bill 96, the number for the House’s budget bill, passed in April.
School funding
The senators increased the amount of money going to public schools compared to the House’s proposal. The Senate budget gives public schools about $100 million more than the House. Although it follows most of the House’s proposed budget –  which only gives schools about $226 million for school funding, or $550 million total – the Senate changed the funding “guarantee” amount. Right now, some districts have guarantees that a portion of their funding will not be reduced, even if their enrollment goes down.
However, to be fully funded, based on statistics from the Fair School Funding Plan from 2021, schools would need an additional $666-800 million, compared to the $226 million given by the House.
They also raised the House proposal’s cap on districts’ rainy day funds to 50%, instead of 30%. This would mean that the schools would have to refund anything above that back to the taxpayer in a method legislators want to use to provide property tax relief.
Browns
The Senate’s budget proposal still includes $600 million for a new Cleveland Browns stadium in Brook Park. However, the funding structure differs from what the Browns proposed and what the House approved earlier this year.
The House proposed borrowing $600 million by issuing bonds and repaying the debt, with interest, over 25 years, at a cost of about $1 billion. The Senate is proposing a $600 million grant for the stadium using unclaimed funds. That money is property of Ohioans held by the state, things like forgotten bank accounts, rent or utility deposits or uncashed insurance policies. The Ohio Department of Commerce’s website says the state is sitting on $4.8 billion in unclaimed funds.
The Senate believes the state will more than recoup that investment through sales tax, income tax and commercial activity tax revenues from the 176-acre Brook Park stadium district.
Flat income tax
The budget also includes a 2.75% flat income tax. This mirrors a bill currently in the House, which would eliminate the separate brackets of the non-business income tax. People making more than $102,400 would have their taxes reduced from 3.5% to 3.125% in 2025 and then down to 2.75% in 2026. The lower bracket would stay at 2.75%.
Next steps
Now, the Senate and House leaders will enter a conference committee, a closed-door negotiation period to create a final budget. Once a decision is made, both chambers must pass the combined bill. If it passes through both sides, it will be sent to Gov. Mike DeWine for review. In the past, he issued dozens of line-item vetoes on operating budgets.
Line-item vetoing is the ability for the governor to pick and choose which policies within a larger piece of legislation get to stay or must go.
DeWine is adamantly against giving the bond package to the Browns, and we have asked repeatedly if he plans to veto it. He says he hopes it doesn’t get to that point.
The budget must be passed by the end of June.

(Tom Koerner/USFWS/CC BY 2.0)The latest effort to expand hunting on Sundays in Pennsylvania passed a key House committee with bipartisan support Tuesday.
State Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny), sponsor of House Bill 1431, described the effort to repeal Pennsylvania’s Sunday prohibition on hunting as a “groundbreaking collaboration” of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau, Pennsylvania Game Commission, and multiple advocacy groups.
The bill passed by a 18-8 vote in the House Game & Fisheries Committee, with every Democrat voting in favor and four Republicans supporting. It will next be considered by the full House.
“In my busy family with four active kids, Sundays are often our only free day of the week,” Steele said. “Sunday could be an opportunity to educate our children about the great American tradition of protecting wild places and the deep connection to the land that comes through responsible and respectful hunting, a core value among hunters.”
Steele said when delving into the issue, she learned that farmers and wildlife biologists think expanding hunting on Sundays would reduce crop damage and help the state’s woods by better managing the deer herd.
“We must heed this call from so many so intimately connected with the land,” Steele said, while asking for support to end what she described as the state’s “archaic and harmful prohibition on Sunday hunting.”
Gov. Tom Wolf signed a law in 2019 to allow deer hunting on three Sundays: One during archery season, one during rifle season, and one selected by the Game Commission.
That law was sponsored by Sen. Dan Laughlin (R-Erie), who authored Senate Bill 67, a companion bill to Steele’s proposal.
Both Steele and Laughlin’s bills would require at least one member of the Pennsylvania Game Commission’s Board of Commissioners to have an agriculture background.
For years, Pennsylvania’s “blue law” prohibition of hunting on Sundays has been a hot-button issue. Supporters argue that expanding hunting on Sundays could help grow the sport, while organizations representing hikers and horseback riders have made the case that Sundays are best left without it, so they can enjoy the outdoors without concerns for their own safety from those hunting.
The House passed Steele’s proposal to repeal Pennsylvania’s Sunday hunting ban last June by a 129-73 vote, although it did not pass the Senate.
Laughlin and Steele told the Capital-Star earlier this year they’re optimistic this is the session the bill could get across the finish line.
State Rep. David Maloney (R-Berks), minority chair of the House Game and Fisheries Committee, voted against the proposal on Tuesday and spoke at-length about his concerns. He discussed his issues with the language about trespassing penalties, the requirement for a member of the agriculture community to be on the Game Commission Board, questioned the effectiveness of the law combatting crop damage and protecting forests, and free time.
“I don’t really buy into this idea that another weekend day is going to clear up all the woes of the sportsmen and the Game Commission,” Maloney said.
He added that he has never taken a position about whether or not he’d hunt on Sunday, but asked for a no-vote, believing the legislation “complicates the issue.”
In response to Maloney’s concerns, Steele emphasized that the bill is being backed by a wide variety of organizations that include the Pennsylvania Game Commission, the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, the Pennsylvania Federation of Sportsmen and Conservationists, and Hunter Nation.
The committee also unanimously approved House Bill 1507, authored by Steele, to allow out-of-state college students living in Pennsylvania to purchase a hunting license for the same price as residents.
Steele argued it could boost hunting participation in Pennsylvania. The Game Commission, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, and the Pennsylvania Federation of Sportsmen and Conservationists support the bill.
The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission also offers fishing licenses to out-of-state college students for the same price as residents, but Game Commission license fees must be approved by the General Assembly, according to a co-sponsorship memo.
“For a student surviving on ramen noodles … this could be a deciding factor between participating in the great American outdoor tradition or being priced out entirely,” she added.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/white-tailed-deer-1024x731.jpeg,,,2025-06-03 17:13:37.493134

The Union Gospel Mission of Yakima runs a homeless shelter, addiction recovery programs and medical and dental clinics. The mission wants only to hire employees who follow the biblical notions forbidding sex outside of marriage and between anyone other than a man and woman.
State law forbids hiring practices based on sexual orientation, with limited exceptions for religious organizations. 
Federal appeals court judges in Seattle heard arguments Tuesday in the case, which began in 2023.
The dispute serves as a First Amendment test of Washington’s anti-discrimination law and could land at the U.S. Supreme Court, where conservative justices have signaled interest in interrogating the statute. At least two other lawsuits over the law are also underway.
“The First Amendment does not allow the government to force a religious organization to hire someone who rejects its faith,” said the mission’s attorney Jeremiah Galus, from the conservative Christian law firm Alliance Defending Freedom.
The arguments at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came months after a federal judge in eastern Washington blocked the state from enforcing the law against the gospel mission. The attorney general’s office has said it has no plans to take action. 
The state appealed, leading to Tuesday’s court hearing.
The three-judge panel in a Seattle courtroom sounded skeptical of the state’s arguments. Judge Johnnie Rawlinson noted the courts’ history of respect for the right to practice religion without government interference.
“It’s really difficult to use a state law to negate those rights,” said Rawlinson, a Clinton appointee. “It’s a difficult challenge.”
The case began after the mission reportedly chose to take down two job postings focused on information technology and operations because of applicants with opposing beliefs on sexual orientation. The mission said the positions are “ministerial,” in line with a state Supreme Court ruling exempting such employees. 
The state agreed and argued that this makes the case moot. 
But Judge Patrick Bumatay suggested the opposite is true. By saying it won’t go after the mission for these employees, the state implies it could enforce the law when the group goes to hire for other positions, he said.
“It almost heightens the need for this pre-enforcement action,” said Bumatay, a Trump appointee who is openly gay.
Galus on Tuesday walked back the mission’s previous argument, acknowledging the two specific employees aren’t ministerial.
Washington deputy solicitor general Cynthia Alexander said the mission is trying to broaden the current exemption for ministers. 
“They want to be able to discriminate in hiring for any position,” Alexander told the panel of judges.
Attorneys general from 20 states, including Florida, Idaho and Texas, have urged the court to rule in favor of the Union Gospel Mission. The American Civil Liberties Union has sided with the state, arguing the district court’s ruling “would effectively strip an enormous number of employees of critical antidiscrimination protections.”
“That would include not only employees of religious organizations but also the thousands of employees of the religiously affiliated hospitals that account for nearly half of the hospital beds in the state and all those who work for the myriad religiously affiliated charities, among others,” the ACLU and Americans United for Separation of Church and State wrote in a court filing.
The panel made no ruling after Tuesday’s arguments. It could be months until they release one.
President Donald Trump appointed two of the three judges hearing the case, Bumatay and Judge Daniel Bress. 
Headed for the high court?
The Washington Law Against Discrimination prohibits employers from refusing to hire, firing or underpaying employees on the basis of race, national origin, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, among other grounds. 
The law exempts those with fewer than eight employees, as well as nonprofit religious organizations.
In 2021, the Washington state Supreme Court ruled that the religious exemption applies only to employees considered ministers. 
In that case, Seattle’s Union Gospel Mission asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the matter. The court declined, but Justice Samuel Alito took issue with the Washington decision, writing that it could conflict with the U.S. Constitution and “warrant review” in the future.
“The day may soon come when we must decide whether the autonomy guaranteed by the First Amendment protects religious organizations’ freedom to hire co-religionists without state or judicial interference,” Alito wrote.
“To force religious organizations to hire messengers and other personnel who do not share their religious views would undermine not only the autonomy of many religious organizations but also their continued viability,” the conservative justice continued.
Just over a year after the state Supreme Court ruling, Seattle Pacific University, a private Christian school affiliated with the Free Methodist Church, decided to keep its policy that employees follow the “traditional view on Biblical marriage and sexuality.”
Then-Attorney General Bob Ferguson launched an investigation into Seattle Pacific University’s hiring practices based on the new reading of the anti-discrimination law. In 2022, the school sued the state, arguing the probe from Ferguson, who is now governor, violated its constitutional right to religious freedom.
The following year, the Union Gospel Mission of Yakima got in on the action, filing its lawsuit against the state. 
At first, a federal judge in Richland dismissed the mission’s case, since the state had taken no action to enforce the anti-discrimination law against it. The 9th Circuit reversed that decision last summer.
A few months later, the same Richland judge, a Biden appointee, sided with the Yakima gospel mission, granting a preliminary injunction.
The Seattle Pacific University case is ongoing in federal court in Seattle, with a trial set for next April.
And that’s not the only other case pending on this issue.
Two weeks ago, the 9th Circuit heard arguments in the case of another religious nonprofit, called World Vision, that rescinded a Washington woman’s job offer after learning she was in a same-sex marriage. A federal judge in Seattle had ruled World Vision violated the state anti-discrimination law.
That appeal, before a different three-judge panel, is awaiting a ruling.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1481158690-700x525-1-1.jpg,,,2025-06-03 17:13:37.493134

(Photo: Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)North Carolina legislators are once again looking to put restrictions on kratom, which is currently unregulated in the state.
The House Regulatory Reform Committee on Tuesday advanced House Bill 468, which would require retailers to obtain licenses to sell kratom and prohibit sales to or purchases by people younger than 21. The bill now heads to the House Finance Committee.
According to the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, kratom is a stimulant at low doses and a sedative at high doses. It is derived from a southeast Asian tree leaf and sold in the United States as tea, powered in capsules, or as liquid. 
The DEA sought to temporarily ban kratom in 2016, but backed off after a public outcry. That year, North Carolina legislators sought in separate bills to ban kratom or limit sales to people over age 18. Neither of those bills became law. 
Last session, a proposal to regulate kratom died in the battle between the state House and Senate over legalizing medical marijuana. 
Kratom has been a factor in hundreds of fatal overdoses since 2020, according to the Washington Post and the Tamp Bay Times. A handful of states have banned it.
The committee debate Tuesday centered on provisions in the bill that would ban synthetic versions of the compounds that produce psychoactive effects. The argument centered on the compound known as 7-OH. 
  Rep. Jeff McNeely (Photo: NCGA video stream)
“At the time, we choose not to have any synthetic products on the market in North Carolina,” said Rep. Jeff McNeely (R-Iredell), the bill’s sponsor. 
Isaac Montanya, CEO of 7-OH producer Charlotte Extraction Labs, said the bill inserted itself into a turf war. He called its prohibition on synthetics “a sly way to regulate 7-OH out of the market.”
His company manufactures an ethical product, Montanya said. 
Jeff Smith, national policy director for Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, told the committee that people use 7-OH to ease opioid withdrawal. 
“Banning 7-OH would turn patients into criminals,” he said. 
Sheldon Bradshaw, a former chief counsel with the FDA representing the industry group Botanicals for Better Health and Wellness, called 7-OH “dangerous” and deceptively marketed. 
“It has no business being on store shelves and in products that are being labeled as natural kratom and marketed as herbal supplements,” he said. 
McNeely said the ban on synthetics addresses the part of the plant that’s going to be the most abused.
“We should have had kratom and cannabis regulated two years ago if not four years ago,” he said. “Because it’s been unregulated, we’ve allowed things to happen — good, bad, indifferent.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kratom.jpg,,,2025-06-03 17:13:37.493134

Here's what he says about State's hire.","Virginia head coach Brian O’Connor talks with officials before an NCAA baseball game against Wichita State, Friday, Feb. 23, 2024, in Jacksonville, Fla. (AP Photo/Gary McCullough, File)
Ty Grisham, John’s son, grew up going with his famous dad to the old Dudy Noble Field, sitting in the Left Field Lounge, gorging himself, he says, on “barbecue, crawfish and college baseball.”
“I thought that was the way college baseball everywhere,” Ty Grisham says.

Rick Cleveland 
Years later, Ty Grisham played baseball for Brian O’Connor, the new Mississippi State baseball coach, during O’Connor’s first two seasons at Virginia. Ty Grisham, who graduated from law school at Ole Miss, still lives and works as a lawyer in Charlottesville. So, yes, he seemed the perfect guy to talk to about State’s new baseball coach.
“Brian’s a first-class individual, savvy, intelligent, extremely thoughtful,” Ty Grisham said in a phone conversation Tuesday morning. “I live in Charlottesville, love college baseball and pull for Virginia, so I really, really hate to see him leave. It’s a tough loss for us, but at the same time it’s a home run hire for State.”
In this case, the numbers — and O’Connor’s resume — do not lie. In 22 years with O’Connor at the helm, Virginia has made the NCAA Tournament 18 times, won nine NCAA Regionals, played in seven College World Series, and won a national championship (2015). O’Connor’s overall record: 917-388-2, a winning percentage of better than 70%. Little wonder, at age 54, he already has been inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame.
“He’s just an incredible baseball coach,” Ty Grisham says. “He’s top five in the country if he’s not No. 1.”

Ty Grisham at Virginia in 2004.
Ty Grisham, an outfielder, was inherited, not recruited, by O’Connor. Dennis Womack, O’Connor’s predecessor, recruited the younger Grisham to Virginia from St. Anne’s-Belfield School in Charlottesville, where Grisham was a standout baseball and football player. Womack had a losing record over 23 seasons at Virginia. Things changed quickly under O’Connor, who had been an assistant under Paul Mainieri at Notre Dame.
“Things changed quickly. There was instantly an expectation to win,” Ty Grisham says. “You could just feel things shifting in the locker room. Brian was a gifted motivator. He was very thoughtful, but he was all about making us tougher and more competitive. I well remember the early morning wind sprints.”
That was 2003. O’Connor was 32. Ty Grisham was 19. Florida State, Clemson, North Carolina and Georgia Tech were the teams to beat in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Virginia was a middle-of-the-pack ACC team. That changed abruptly. In 2004, O’Connor’s first season, the Cavs won 44, lost 15, finished 18-6 in the ACC and hosted an NCAA Regional. 
“He was definitely a players’ coach,” Ty Grisham says. “I would describe him as savvy, extremely intelligent, just very impressive all around. You don’t get a ton of coachspeak from him. He’s genuine and thoughtful in everything he says.”
I will echo that last part about “thoughtful.” O’Connor brought his 2009 Virginia team to Oxford for a memorable Super Regional. Ole Miss won game one 4-3 in 12 innings. Virginia won by the same score in a second game nail-biter and then clinched the series 5-1 the next day. I approached O’Connor after a press conference for one more question that turned into a 15-minute give-and-take. A week later after a College World Series press conference, he was every bit as engaging and interesting. Put it this way: I have not been surprised by his success in the decade and a half since.
Ty Grisham says he doesn’t know why O’Connor chose to leave Charlottesville for Starkville.
“I can’t speculate,” Grisham said. “He was here 22 years. He’s a legend. I would guess maybe he just wanted a new challenge. The facilities at UVA are good, but not the Mecca you have at Starkville. I don’t know… We haven’t talked since the change.”
So I asked Ty Grisham how he thinks O’Connor will fare in this new age of NIL and the transfer portal. After two consecutive CWS appearances in 2023 and 2024, Virginia faltered to 32-18 (16-11 in the ACC) this past season, missing the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2019.
“Brian was really, really good at finding transfer guys well before NIL and transfer portal opened up,” Grisham said. “He was gifted at evaluating talent, spotting lower level guys who came to UVA and contributed. I will be shocked if he doesn’t win big at State.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/03144956/AP25153577180630.jpg,,,2025-06-03 17:13:37.493134

The Iowa Dental Board recently charged Jameson Klavins of Ankeny’s Hintz Family Dentistry with failure to maintain a satisfactory standard of competency in the practice of dentistry.
According to the board, Klavins regularly performs endodontic procedures such as root canal therapy and treatments of tooth pulp to address infections and discourage future tooth deterioration.
The board alleges it reviewed Klavins’ care over an unspecified period of time and found “several issues” that include a failure to use rubber dams when performing endodontic work and a failure to follow a basic SOAP outline, which references the “Subjective/Objective/Assessment/Plan” protocol taught in dental school and considered standard practice.

The board also alleged Klavins failed to meet the standard of care for proper recordkeeping and that he failed to maintain complete and detailed records of endodontic treatment.
On the same day it filed the charge against Klavins, the board agreed to settle the case with a warning that any such conduct in the future could result in action taken against Klavins’ license.
As part of the settlement, Klavins agreed to complete, at some unspecified point in the future, a board-approved, comprehensive remedial education program on endodontic procedures and recordkeeping.
Klavins has been licensed to practice dentistry in Iowa since May 2018.

(Photo credit: Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Smart & Safe Florida, the political committee working to get a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana use for adults before the voters next year, has collected enough petition signatures to trigger a review of its ballot language and financial impact – a significant step toward ultimately getting the amendment before voters in 2026.
Smart & Safe Florida has collected more than 377,000 signatures. That’s well above the number required to trigger a state Supreme Court review. Specifically, at a minimum Smart & Safe Florida needed to collect 220,016 signatures  — or 25% of the 880,062 valid signatures from registered voters, with a minimum of 8% coming from voters in at least half of the state’s 28 congressional districts.
A similar proposal to legalize recreational cannabis in 2024 known as Amendment 3 received 56% of the vote, short of the 60% required for passage. Following that electoral loss, Smart & Safe secured approval to launch its campaign for the 2026 election.
The petition drive process comes at the same time that Smart & Safe Florida and other organizations are fighting a new law passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature last month that will make it significantly more difficult for citizen-led constitutional amendments to make it on a ballot in Florida.

Two weeks ago, Smart & Safe Florida and Florida Decides Healthcare, another group working to get a measure on the 2026 ballot, went before U.S. Federal District Judge Mark Walker to request that he block certain provisions of the law from taking effect – including the requirement that sponsors turn in completed petitions within 10 days after the voter signs the petition, a change from the previous deadline of 30 days.
Tallahassee attorney Glenn Burhans Jr. said, prior to the new law taking effect, Smart & Safe Florida was collecting 78,000 signatures per week. Since the law took effect, he told Walker, the group was collecting between just 12,000 and 15,000 signatures per week.
The next step in the process is for Florida Republican Attorney General James Uthmeier to submit the proposed amendment’s ballot language to the Florida Supreme Court so it can begin its review. The court’s review is limited to whether the amendment conforms to a single subject and whether the ballot summary is clear.
When then Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody transmitted her letter to the Florida Court regarding Amendment 3 two years ago, she also informed the justices that she opposed the measure.
Uthmeier will likely do the same when he sends his letter to the Supreme Court. He chaired a political committee a year ago called Keep Florida Clean that was formed to oppose the weed measure.

Inspired by a favorite teacher, Josh Samaniego learned to work hard and strive for success. As
a first-generation student, he approached his college journey with determination and received
help along the way.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Standout Spaulding High School student wants to be a voice of change.","One of Josh Samaniego’s favorite classes during his time at Spaulding High School was Intro to Psychology. “Everything in that class was so immersive and made so much sense,” says Josh, citing, for example, the Bystander Effect. “The more people around when something bad happens, the less likely it becomes for someone to step in and help. You literally have to point at someone and ask them to call 911.”Josh Samaniego commands the desk at The People’s House at 1700 Pennsylvania Avenue in
Washington, DC, which houses a replica of the White House’s Oval Office.Josh, who heads to Bennington College in the fall with plans to major in political science, is determined to be more than a bystander. He wants to be a change agent.  “COVID was the first time something political impacted my life, and not in a small way. I was going to school half as much as I did before, and mostly online. I was seeing things that I wanted to change. But it was only when I started to apply to college that I thought, maybe I should consider doing this as a career.”Applying to college wasn’t always a given for Josh, who grew up in Barre City as the youngest of four children raised by a single mom. “My mom has always worked as a waitress. At times it was very difficult to raise four kids with that job, but she always prioritized us and made sure we had the brightest futures possible.”Two of Josh’s three half-siblings, who are a decade older, went to medical school, which opened Josh’s eyes to how expensive higher education could be. “Until I was nine or ten, I wanted nothing to do with college. I saw how much it cost, and I didn’t feel like I had any purpose to go. Then, in third grade, I started to enjoy school. Mr. Reese at Barre City Elementary was my favorite teacher ever. He was funny and made learning easy and enjoyable. I don’t think I would be good at school if not for him.”Mr. Reese told Josh he might be able to earn college scholarships if he worked hard. That changed his mindset. And it paid off; this spring, Josh received a Dr. Ernest V. Reynolds scholarship from Spaulding High School, which will cover all of his college expenses over four years. Along the way, Josh worked with VSAC Outreach Counselor Chelsea Martin, who has known Josh since he was in seventh grade. Chelsea helps Central Vermont students connect with higher education opportunities as part of VSAC’s Talent Search, a program that helps students explore and enroll in career and postsecondary education options. “I have been truly humbled to work with him and watch his incredible personal and academic growth,” she says. “Josh is one of the top students in his class at Spaulding, with a passion for social justice and an aspiration to make meaningful change in our country.”  Josh says VSAC has been a huge help in helping him understand what’s involved in applying to, and paying for, college—though he wasn’t always totally tuned in. “During the first two years of high school, when our entire class would meet together for VSAC once a month, I let a lot of it go in one ear and out the other,” Josh admits. “I didn’t really understand all the terms, and I figured I’d worry about it when I could see it all in front of me. But I think those meetings helped a lot down the road, because when Chelsea was explaining the terms again, I remember thinking, ‘oh, that’s what that means.’ It was familiar.” During 11th and 12th grade, Josh and his fellow VSAC participants started meeting individually with their outreach counselors, researching career options, planning their college search, and learning about how to navigate financial aid. For first-generation students like Josh, VSAC is a critical support.“Applying to college was kind of like calculus homework—asking my parents for help was out of the question,” says Josh. While his mom completed some college, she wasn’t able to finish after learning she was expecting twins—and the college application process has also changed quite a bit over the last generation. “My mom didn’t have that experience, so I had to seek help from other sources. That’s where VSAC was helpful.” Josh applied to 10 schools, following the advice of his late grandmother, Arlene, who told him to “shoot for the stars, because the clouds aren’t high enough.” According to Josh, “Her words have been a huge motivator for me, and were the reason I applied to so many prestigious schools. I am saddened that she will not get to see me graduate this June.” During the application process, Josh realized that one of the things that most appealed to him was a school with an open curriculum. Bennington College was one of several schools that didn’t require all students to complete a core group of classes. For Josh, who is excited to explore economics and politics more deeply than his high-school history and civics courses allowed, the lack of course requirements frees up more time for his passions.  Another of his passions is music, which he plans to minor in at Bennington. Josh took up the piano at age three, when he started tinkering with an instrument that was originally meant for his older sister. “But she stopped playing. I started and never stopped.” Josh taught himself how to play piano and, more recently, guitar, by watching videos online. He plays entirely by ear, noting that he played a seven-minute piece from the Clair de Lune completely from memory. When music teachers have asked him how he does it, Josh explains: “If I listen to a song enough times, I can hear the patterns others don’t hear. I can picture the shape of the chord in my head and know where my hands need to be.” When he saw the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, Josh realized that music could also be an avenue for confidence-building and self-expression. He now practices an hour a day, and he sings as well. “When I was little, I used to sing along with the songs my mom had on the radio. No one ever told me I sounded bad, so I kept going.” Josh also hopes to use his voice on the political stage. “In five to ten years, I would like to be running for office. I feel like I could make a difference there.” He acknowledges that he’ll have to brace himself for harsh criticism, something school doesn’t prepare you for. “When you put yourself out there, you’re going to get a lot of criticism; half the people will disagree with you. But I feel like my experience growing up, knowing the true value of a dollar, and my approach to people, gives me an opportunity to have a real impact.”The Vermont Student Assistance Corp. was created by the Vermont Legislature in 1965 as a public nonprofit agency.

One of Tacoma’s largest homeless shelters plans to expand to more than double the number of beds it has available.
The $20 million project is expected to be completed by summer 2026.
Tacoma Rescue Mission is the largest homeless shelter operator in Pierce County. The organization’s largest shelter is in Tacoma at 425 South Tacoma Way.
Duke Paulson, executive director of Tacoma Rescue Mission, told The News Tribune the organization is planning to expand the men’s shelter from roughly 90 beds to a capacity of 205.
The roughly 24,000-square-foot, multi-floor project will be built adjacent to the current men’s shelter.
Paulson said the beds in the expansion are designed to give a more “dignified” stay than other traditional congregate shelters in which beds are laid across a large open space. He said these bunks are inspired by the Tacoma Rescue Mission’s women’s shelter, which was updated during the pandemic to give people more privacy and space.
The bunks include a personal storage area, outlets for charging phones and built to not be in direct line of sight of each other.
“That way no one is coughing on you,” Paulson said.
On May 20, Paulson gave a presentation on the new shelter expansion to the Pierce County Council’s Health and Human Services Committee.
Paulson said the shelter was built around 2000 and had 75 beds primarily for single women experiencing homelessness.
“At that point, it was built with the idea that if we could house 60 people, we would be solving homelessness in Tacoma,” he told the committee.
Now, the shelter regularly serves 120 people a night. During the pandemic and inclement weather conditions, Paulson said, the shelter served upwards of 220 people a night.
“The need is so much greater,” he said.
The planned expansion will more than double its current bed capacity, as well as its addiction-recovery program capacity. It also will add more toilets, showers and sinks for residents.
Paulson said the project also will install a roof over the campus courtyard to offer year-round dining space and a venue for health clinics, career fairs and other events in nearly 4,000 square feet of space.
“The challenge for us is that we are going to keep the shelter open while this project is going on,” he told The News Tribune.
The expansion has been in the works for nearly a year, with previous estimates for project completion by the end of 2025. Paulson recently told The News Tribune that summer 2026 is a more accurate estimate.
On May 28, he said Tacoma Rescue Mission selected a contractor the previous week. Meetings with the city’s planning department now need to be scheduled.
The $20 million project has been funded by contributions from every level of government. Paulson described the funding process as “complicated,” taking nearly eight months for lawyers to determine the terms and requirements of the funding.
Tacoma Rescue Mission’s grant writer Emily Koo reported securing $5.5 million from Pierce County for the project, $5 million from the Washington Department of Commerce, $4 million in federal funding, $3.5 million from the City of Tacoma, as well as funding from private donors.
The project is going to be constructed at a time when Tacoma is anticipated to lose more than 300 of its homeless shelter beds in June due to a funding shortfall. City officials have maintained optimism they will be able to get state funding made available in the budget to support local homeless programs, but the timeline and process for getting the funding remain unclear.
Paulson told The News Tribune he is worried about how the loss of shelter beds will impact the community if those individuals are displaced.

(File photo by Getty Images)Clemson University wants to contract with the Medical University of South Carolina hospital system to build and run a new student health center on campus.
A legislative oversight committee gave the initial nod Tuesday to the $73 million project, which the Upstate college says will help hold down student health care costs and replace its aging facility. The project still needs approval next week from a five-member financial oversight panel chaired by the governor.
It could mark MUSC’s second such arrangement at a South Carolina college and the first outside of Charleston. The proposal is modeled after MUSC’s relationship at The Citadel, according to documents provided to the Joint Bond Review Committee.
Clemson’s existing Redfern Health Center is 56 years old, built when the university had a student population of just 6,700. Since then, Clemson’s enrollment has increased four-fold, yet the college has not expanded or renovated the center since it was constructed.
Plans call for the Medical University Hospital Authority to spend $61 million to help build the new, 90,000-square-foot center, with Clemson chipping in $3 million, and a pair of federal grants covering the remainder.
If Clemson were to pursue the project alone, it would have to pass the cost on to students, the school wrote in its proposal.
Instead, Clemson will simply turn over to MUSC the existing health fees charged to students when they enroll. As part of the deal, that fee will stay flat for the first five years of operation, potentially saving students more money on health care.
According to Clemson, student health care costs have been escalating since the COVID-19 pandemic at an average rate of 6% per year.
Students currently pay $182 per semester. There will be an additional $66 fee for any students who stay on campus for the summer session.
That fee covers the cost of doctor’s visits, counseling, and telemedicine urgent care, according to Clemson’s health services website. It does not cover prescriptions, vaccinations, lab tests, X-rays, psychiatric treatment, gynecological exams, routine physical exams or procedures, such as stitches.
MUSC will bill students for those additional services “in a manner that does not burden Clemson students or their families but is expected to generate additional revenue,” according to documents provided by the two organizations.
Students who are on their parents’ insurance policy can continue to use that coverage. MUSC will bill the insurance company.
“All students will continue to have access to student healthcare regardless of their financial status,” according to a joint letter from MUSC and Clemson.
It will also bring an end to Clemson’s current, “archaic” billing model for health services, which withholds diplomas and prevents students from enrolling in classes if they have an outstanding medical bill. A Clemson spokesman did not immediately respond to questions from the SC Daily Gazette about that policy.
MUSC will reinvest any excess revenue back into Clemson Health.
The school and the hospital system expect to sign the 30-year deal in January 2026 and complete construction in July 2027. At the end of the lease term, MUSC will transfer ownership of the facility to Clemson.
In addition to health care for students, Clemson and MUSC also plan to work together on more health-related research projects, as well as joint degree programs.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/doctor-1024x618.jpg,,,2025-06-03 17:13:37.493134

(Photo by Jason Cameron/Getty Images)After a controversial provision allowing the sale of public lands in Utah and Nevada was stripped from a massive spending package, Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee hinted he may try to revive it in the Senate. 
Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy initially proposed selling nearly 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and St. George, in addition to 450,000 acres in Nevada. 
However, amid bipartisan opposition led by Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke — who had said that selling public lands is a line he wouldn’t cross — the U.S. House ended up striking the language from the proposed spending package, widely referred to as the “big, beautiful” bill.

Proposed sale of Utah public land pulled from Congress’ budget bill

Lee, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, told Politico’s E&E News on his way to cast a vote on Monday he intended to bring back the public lands provisions. Lee’s office didn’t confirm or deny the plans Tuesday.
“Senator Lee remains committed to advancing Western priorities and ensuring that those who live closest to the land have a voice in how it’s managed,” his office wrote in a statement. “As the process moves forward, he’ll continue to advocate for solutions that reflect the needs of Utahns and other Western communities.”
However, Lee’s comment is already worrying environmental advocates, like Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, who have defended the recreational role of public lands among Americans.
“Senator Lee’s avowed and oft-stated hatred of public lands makes him a true outlier in the Senate,” Travis Hammill, D.C. director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said in a statement. “His apparent intention to include a public lands sell-off provision in the Budget Bill, which was fiercely opposed in the House, is wildly out of step with what Americans have made clear that they want to see: federal public lands remaining in public hands.”
While the provision introduced by Maloy and Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei was met with intense pushback, the “big, beautiful” bill is poised to undergo changes in the Senate with officials like Lee saying it needs to improve to pass the chamber. 
In a previous statement, Maloy had defended the proposal, arguing that it would help expand water, transportation and housing infrastructure in southwestern Utah as the region deals with rapid population growth. 
Officials eye airport expansion, reservoirs and new roads under Maloy’s proposed public land sale

If allowed to purchase the public lands, St. George officials were considering an airport expansion; Washing County Water Conservancy District planned to build a new reservoir and Washington County contemplated widening some roads. 
After the proposal was cut from the House’s version of the budget bill, St. George City leaders said they planned on working with other lawmakers on the issue.
“We were disappointed that some groups falsely presented this amendment as if it were a land grab,” city leaders said. “In actuality, the amendment was intended to protect existing critical infrastructure or future critical infrastructure that would be built on already disturbed public lands. Only approximately nine acres would have been used for attainable housing, at a spot adjacent to a future cemetery and an existing residential subdivision.”

In some Jackson council races, not even seasoned politicos know, but one thing is for sure: It all comes down to who votes.
Conventional wisdom holds that in Jackson, race, class and political party are linked. The city’s population is roughly 82% Black and 14% white, with Black Jacksonians historically backing Democrats. Other races make up the remaining 4%.
In the following interactive, you can test your hypothesis of where each candidate’s votes will come from and view the election results based on their support.
To use the tool, type in the portion of the total turnout you think will be made up by Black  and white voters in each race and the portion of the Black and white vote you think each candidate will receive to make a result projection. Toggle between elections at the top of this interactive to make projections in council races for Ward 1 and Ward 7.
Some caveats before you get started: The following interactive only deals with turnout by Black and white Jacksonians. We don’t have data to quantify the race of Jackson’s registered voters or the rate of turnout among Black and white voters in past elections.
Considering that turnout is linked with socioeconomic status and has historically been higher in Ward 1 — Jackson’s whitest and wealthiest ward — compared to the rest of the city, you might make the assumption that whites will make up a larger portion of the city’s turnout than their population rate. But how much will that affect the outcome?
With Black residents outnumbering white residents more than 5-t0-1 citywide, higher turnout among affluent whites does not necessarily translate to electoral success for their candidate. But in Wards 1 and 7, where Black residents only slightly outnumber white, voting along racial lines takes center stage.

An 8-year-old boy is the most recent casualty of a car crash at a Chatham daycare April 28.

Bradley Lund, 8, has been in a Springfield hospital since the collision at YNOT Outdoors five weeks ago, according to Sangamon County Coroner Jim Allmon.

Bradley  sustained “multiple blunt force injuries” when a black Jeep driven by Marianne Akers, 44, of Chatham, drove into the lower portion of the building that housed the gymnasium and out the other side, striking children who were playing inside.

Allmon confirmed that Bradley died Monday morning.

Ainsley Johnson, 8; Kathryn Corley, 7; Alma Buhnerkempe, 7; all of Chatham, and counselor Rylee Britton, 18, of Springfield, also died as a result of the crash.

Police said Aikers submitted blood after the crash to determine whether she was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Those toxicology screenings were negative, ISP confirmed last month. ISP Director Brendan Kelly said during a news conference in May that the crash could have been caused by a medical emergency.

The death remains under investigation by the Sangamon County Coroner and the Illinois State Police, Allmon said in his emailed release.

The Sangamon County State's Attorney’s Office will review the investigation, then will provide an update, according to an ISP spokesman.

No charges have been filed against Akers.

Bradley is the son of Daniel Lund, assistant principal in the Ball-Chatham School District, and Cynthia Riseman Lund, the legislative director for the Illinois Federation of Teachers.

Board of Education President Pamela Pugh […],"Michigan Board of Education President Pamela Pugh (left) and Michigan Superintendent  of Public Instruction Michael Rice (right) listen to members of the Michigan House Oversight Committee on Tuesday, June 3, 2025 | Photo by Ben SolisTwo top officials with the Michigan Department of Education on Tuesday defended the current state of Michigan schools amid House Republican calls for dismantling the department and allusions to taking public education back to a time when literacy rates were at some of their lowest in modern American history.
Board of Education President Pamela Pugh and Superintendent for Public Instruction Michael Rice appeared Tuesday before the Michigan House Oversight Committee, which included a lengthy presentation on the department’s goals, its latest budget requests and some heavy back and forth between Republican lawmakers.
Several Republican members of the committee, including its chair, Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay), lambasted Pugh and Rice over low literacy rates and flailing math scores. Eventually, the specter of tearing down the department and starting anew with a department controlled closely by the Michigan Legislature materialized from Rep. Jaime Green (R-Richmond).
Before dismantling the department became a topic of conversation, Rice and Pugh attempted to show the committee that schools, students and educators have been making progress in multiple ways to achieve Michigan’s Top 10 Strategic Plan, which did include record achievement in several areas.
Part of that forward progress was seen in the passage of new literacy and dyslexia laws, some of which were spearheaded by Greene, who worked closely with Rice to make that reality. Rice and Pugh extolled how much of a difference those laws will make in the screening of all children for dyslexia, for example. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX The pair also praised the Legislature for increasing funding to public schools over the last few years, but said those budgets did not make up for decades of underinvestment in public schools a decade earlier.
Pugh discussed some of the challenges currently facing schools and the effect disinvestment has had on public schools, not only on student needs and achievement, but also the state’s teacher shortage.
“It is critical and crucial to understand that the challenges before us are not new,” Pugh said. “They are the result of long standing policy decisions that prioritize cost-cutting over sustained investment in our children and our schools. Despite these challenges, the state Board of Education has remained resolute in our mission to reverse those harms and build an educational system that truly serves all Michigan students.”
Pugh said students, as well as teachers, parents and administrators, were doing their best to provide a quality education in the face of crowded classrooms, aging buildings, limited access to mental health and special education services and what she called an alarming shortage of adequately paid teachers.
“These issues are not anecdotal,” Pugh said. “They are symptoms of systemic neglect.”
Rice added that Michigan’s four-year graduation rate had improved to the highest level in state history, growing to about 83% in 2024, which is also the highest that figure has been in the last 10 years. The percentage of adults with a post-secondary certification (51.8%) was on track toward Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s Sixty by 30 goal. The initiative aims to have 60% of Michigan adults between ages 25 and 64 holding some sort of post-secondary credential by 2030.
There were moments of seeming common ground between Rice and the Republicans who control the powerful House Oversight Committee, with Rice praising Public Act 146 and Public Act 147 of 2024 addressing literacy coaching and dyslexia screening assessments and interventions.
Progress was being made, but Rice noted that Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling, or LETRS, training was needed for educators to keep up pace and do better on the literacy front. Rice called for mandatory LETRS training for kindergarten through fifth grade classroom teachers, and lower class sizes for kindergarten through third grade classrooms.
Rice said there was also a need for more in-person instructional time, as there had been cases of professional development days being treated as student instruction days in 2019, and 15 virtual days being counted as the same in 2023.
The meeting, however, was not one of the House Education Committee meant to discuss budgetary needs and goals, but rather one designed as a means to grill department officials over failures in public education.
That became clear in lines of questioning from Rep. Brad Paquette (R-Niles), who engaged in a lengthy and at times testy tit-for-tat with Rice and Pugh.
Paquette, a former teacher, said he’s seen all the headlines showing the breadth of Michigan’s public schools struggles and that he has been on various House committees in the past that dealt with public education and the budget. In that vein, Paquette said he’s seen similar presentations from Rice before and, despite additional funding over the last few years, Michigan schools are continuing to struggle.
“We’ve increased funding yet results are still tracking downward,” Paquette said. “When does accountability come into play?”
As Paquette became frustrated with Rice and Pugh’s answers, Pugh said accountability needed to be based in reality.
From there, Greene, who received a shout out from Rice for her work on the dyslexia screening law, turned the conversation toward the perceived need to dismantle the department, echoing Congressional Republican calls to do the same at the federal level.
Pugh said that studies have shown that states with elected boards like Michigan’s, and not under the control of the governor’s office or the Legislature, provided critical checks and balances, and correlated with better student outcomes. Those systems were also tied to more equity in funding and policy consistency.
Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford), hailed the fact that the “Greatest Generation” of the early 20th Century had class sizes of 30, 40 or sometimes 50 children and that they fared fine. He made other meandering comments before being cut off by DeBoyer in the essence of time. 
More questions than answers on school vouchers as a legislative oversight committee wraps up

As the meeting wrapped, Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City), tried to set the record straight on various comments made by his Republican colleagues.
Wegela called out Schriver’s point, noting that the early 20th Century was a time of rampant racial segregation, and that literacy rates today were far higher than they were in the 1920s. Schriver at one point brought up vouchers for school choice programs, which Wegela said in Arizona, it was found that parents spent that money on items like toys and other merchandise instead.
He also noted that Michigan cannot talk about its problem with schools without looking at funding adjusted for inflation.
“Record funding is only as good as saying we have record wages today,” Wegela said. “When you adjust for inflation, we are barely ahead of the year 2000. This has created a classroom size problem, and a teacher shortage.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603_094859-1024x910.jpg,,,2025-06-03 16:09:03.579472
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-03 19:58:48+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: What to expect as CT’s 2025 legislative session wraps up,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/podcast-ct-2025-legislative-session-ends/,CT Mirror's Mark Pazniokas discusses his story about what the final hours of CT's legislative session will look like for lawmakers.,"Connecticut’s legislative session ends this week. What will the final hours look like for lawmakers?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Mark Pazniokas to discuss his article, “As CT legislature enters final stretch, Lamont makes a surprise visit,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Mark’s story here.
WSHU: Lawmakers know exactly how long a Connecticut legislative session is going to last. So why does it seem that there’s always a scramble to get bills passed towards the end of a session? What’s responsible for that dynamic, and how is it playing out this year?
MP: That is the perennial question. The short answer is that the legislative session is designed to be front-loaded with committee work. If you picture the legislature as one giant funnel, and when they all gather in January, the first weeks and even months are focused on developing bills, subjecting them to public hearings and then finally having those committees report them to the floor of the House and Senate. A further complication is that anything that involves spending significant amounts of money really has to wait for the budget deal to be put together. So all these things conspire to produce what we see every year, which is a lot of bills getting done in the last two weeks, if not the last three days of every legislative session.
WSHU: So, how’s the log jam this year? What looks as if it’s going to be able to make it through in the final days and final hours, and what seems to be falling by the wayside?
MP: Let’s start with what is going to happen. There is a budget deal. There appears to be an agreement, a bipartisan agreement on a major energy bill that would lower our electric rates, not dramatically, but a little bit. That is going to happen. There are a lot of other bills that just will die from inaction, because that’s the nature of the beast. If they haven’t happened yet, and there is a partisan disagreement, it is very difficult to get anything through, because Connecticut does have a tradition of unlimited debate, and of course, that means in the last days of the session, the balance of power shifts a little bit to the Republican minorities.
WSHU: The Republican minority only holds about a third of the seats. How come they have so much power at the end of a session?
MP: It is because of this tradition, which is not absolute. I will say, for example, if the Republicans decided to talk for three days to kill a budget, the Democrats would certainly take advantage of a little-used rule, which is the ability to call the question to end debate and force a vote. Again, there is some nuance here as to the relationship between the parties that is very different from what you see in Washington, which is pure power politics. The tradition in Connecticut has been different. It’s always a test of will that survives. Because, as you say, quite correctly, the Democrats do hold slightly more than two-thirds of all the seats. So they really can do whatever they wish, assuming the Democrats all hang together. And there are certainly some factions. There are some fiscal moderates, for example, who may be more aligned with the Republicans on certain fiscal issues, but that’s the dynamic. It is one that’s evolved over time. It is something, by the way, the Democratic leaders use to their own advantage, because there are certain things they perhaps do not wish to take up …
WSHU: … which their members are very interested in.
MP: Correct. And they play off of what the Republicans would do. They also play off what the governor wants or doesn’t want. So there’s always that kind of three-handed game of chess going on, particularly at the end here.
WSHU: One of the bills that the public is very interested in is the energy bill, because our energy prices are so high in Connecticut and lawmakers have been talking since the beginning of the session that they’ll do something about this. What exactly is the position on that?
MP: The state and its Public Utilities Regulatory Authority only have control over maybe a third or a little bit more of our electric bill, because Connecticut largely deregulated the generation of electric power at the end of the 90s. And so that means what is regulated is really the delivery system of how that power gets to our homes and our businesses. One of the Republicans’ big issues is something called the public benefits charge, which has a variety of public policy initiatives that we pay for on our electric bill. Some of it has to do with encouraging clean energy. Some of it has to do with making sure poor people don’t lose their power if they can’t pay their bills. And then there’s a big one: to keep Millstone nuclear financially viable. They treat that power in a different way. They guarantee a certain amount of stability, which, most of the time, costs us more than it would on the open market. Occasionally, we get a break. It depends on the prices of natural gas, which is what’s used to generate the rest of the electricity in Connecticut.
But the other big issue for the Republicans is language to clarify that the chair of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, who has been a very controversial figure. She’s been very aggressive in trying to control costs. They want to ensure that her unilateral powers are limited, that she cannot, by herself, determine she’s going to be a one-person regulatory body on rate cases and some other key things. And that is one of the things that certainly the House Republican leader is insisting that that be addressed, and if it’s not addressed, he has the ability to block passage, but he has indicated to us he believes that that will be satisfactorily involved resolved, and therefore there will be action on an energy bill.
WSHU: Now we do have a budget deal. What was that budget deal dependent on? How did they close the gap between the governor and the Democrats?
MP: Okay, this will get quickly in the weeds, but one of the holdups was that the Democratic majority in the legislature wanted a child tax credit; there is a compromise that would use the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is a much more limited vehicle as far as the income qualifications. The original type of child tax credit would have benefited families earning up to $200,000 a year, the Earned Income Tax Credit, which they are essentially bolstering, that applies to lower-income folks. You know, you’re talking in the $60,000 and $70,000 range, I believe, is the final number. So that was one change.
Then, we get into the machinations over whether or not this budget meets the letter and the spirit of the law on Connecticut’s various spending caps and revenue caps. And the Republicans are insisting that there are gimmicks that are getting this budget around some of those limits, although they do abide by the law. This is an argument that we see over and over again about how you abide by these volatility caps, a spending cap that has resulted in some huge budget. The budget reserves a lot of money to pay pension debt, but kind of starves some other very important needs. For example, Connecticut’s Medicaid reimbursement rates for certain medical providers really haven’t changed since 2007-2008 and as a result, if you are on Medicaid, and oh, by the way, about 40% of the children born in this state are born to families who get their health care through Medicaid, it can be very difficult to get certain medical providers given the low rates.
So those are some of the tensions you see, as far as the governor who who describes himself as a fiscal centrist and really wants to maintain Connecticut’s fiscal discipline that we’ve seen in the last five, six years, and not go back to the years of spending In which there were there was great neglect of the pension funds. There was no money that went into those pension funds. Governor Lamont is committed to really maintaining some of the reforms, some of which began during the administration of Governor Dannell Malloy. Back then the state finally started every year, no matter how bad the budget was, to make the annual required contributions to the pensions. But you know, Connecticut’s fiscal problems go back decades when they were paying pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis instead of doing the smart thing, which is setting money aside, investing in the market and having those funds grow.
WSHU: Wow. Okay, and the bottom line for most voters is, are we going to end up with any new taxes in this budget?
MP: So there are some business taxes. Some of them are a little complex, something called the unitary tax, which is not applied to every business. It has to do with multi-state businesses, and how these taxes are calculated, and we will very quickly exhaust my ability to explain what that is, so let’s leave it there.
WSHU: But most politicians will be able to say to their constituents this year, we didn’t raise taxes on you, right?
MP: Right. Most people pay attention to the sales tax and their income tax and on those two very important measures, no, there will not be increases.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_Session_128-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 16:09:03.579472

Free.,Students eligible for deportation protections caught in Trump immigration crackdown,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/students-eligible-deportation-protections-caught-trump-immigration-crackdown,,"WASHINGTON — Ximena Arias-Cristobal knows the risks that can come with driving as a person living in the U.S. without legal authorization, where a simple traffic stop could lead to being deported.That fear materialized last month when she was pulled over by local police in Dalton, Georgia, for making an improper turn at a red light, but instead of a traffic ticket, the 19-year-old was detained at Stewart Detention Center for nearly three weeks, she said at a virtual event Tuesday.“Even though my time there was short … the emotional weight is overwhelming,” Arias-Cristobal said during a panel conversation organized by advocacy groups opposing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown on students without legal authorization and international students.“This isn't just an immigration issue, it's a human rights issue,” Arias-Cristobal said.She and her parents arrived in the United States without legal authorization from Mexico when Arias-Cristobal was 4 years old. Her father was in the car with her last month and was also detained at the Stewart Detention Center, she said. He has since been released.“What affected me the most was the transfer itself, being shackled at the waist and ankles,” Arias-Cristobal said of being transferred by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to Stewart Detention Center.Arias-Cristobal is eligible to apply for deportation protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy. DACA allows some people who were brought into the country as children without legal authorization to obtain a drivers license and work permits and remain in the country, under certain conditions.But the agency that issues such protections, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, stopped accepting applications in 2021 as part of a court case from Republican state officials challenging DACA’s legality.The case remains pending and is likely to head to the U.S. Supreme Court.Arias-Cristobal now faces deportation to Mexico as she tries to complete her higher education at Dalton State College, where she is studying economics and finance. Impact on higher educationGaby Pacheco, president and CEO of advocacy group TheDream.US, said that cases like Arias-Cristobal’s are becoming more common under the second Trump administration and that “Dreamers are under attack.”Pachecos’ group provides scholarships to young immigrants without legal status, including Arias-Cristobal, to pursue higher education.She said that while DACA recipients have not been caught in deportations, “we have heard of people (being) held and questioned” by ICE agents.“The level of cruelty, inhumanity and lawlessness that we’re seeing from the Department of Homeland Security… is completely alarming,” Pacheco said.That type of immigration enforcement has impacted higher education, said Miriam Feldblum, the president of the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, which advocates for international students and students without proper legal authority to attend college.The Department of Homeland Security informed Harvard University last month that it was revoking the Ivy League school’s ability to accept international students. A federal court has temporarily blocked the move while the case is pending.“This will directly harm our enrollment at U.S. institutions,” she said of the Trump administration’s stance on limiting how many international students can attend higher education.Feldblum said that because international students pay full tuition, those costs often subsidize scholarships for U.S. students.",,,,2025-06-03 16:09:03.579472

LaBar/Flickr under Creative Commons License)A startup company is proposing to build a large Bitcoin mining operation on Alaska’s North Slope later this year that’s expected to be powered by the region’s abundant natural gas — a test of an operation that it wants to grow into the largest in the nation.
The project from Wasilla-based Stax Capital Partners would be the first of its kind for the state, and the company wants to “create the playbook for sustainable, at-scale Bitcoin mining in Alaska,” said chief executive Sparrow Mahoney. She said Alaska is “the only place this makes sense, long term, for the industry.”
Stax recently applied for a permit with state land managers to set up shipping container-like pods housing natural gas generators and computers at a site some 30 miles south of the massive Prudhoe Bay oil field. The generators would be fueled by the basin’s huge stores of “stranded” natural gas — an industry term for gas that doesn’t have a pipeline connecting it to potential customers.
Bitcoin mining doesn’t have the same type of impact as hard rock mining — it’s a digital process that uses computers to create valuable cryptocurrency.
Nonetheless, the rapid proliferation of Bitcoin mining operations and other data centers is drawing increasing public opposition tied to their demand for electricity and property in Lower 48 communities.
Alaska policymakers have recently been pitching companies on the state’s ample unsettled land and, potentially, the ability to generate power using the large quantity of stranded gas at the North Slope oil fields, which is otherwise reinjected underground.
But developing new industries in the region is challenging due to its remote location and steep construction costs. And oil companies on the North Slope haven’t ever sold large quantities of gas for Alaska-based data centers or Bitcoin mining, so it’s not yet known whether their asking price would be low enough to offset the higher costs of building and operating infrastructure in the Arctic.
Stax’s gas generators would have the capacity to produce 50 megawatts of electricity — about the same amount as Alaska’s largest coal plant, in the Interior community of Healy. The company is “in conversation” with a number of potential natural gas suppliers on the North Slope, Mahoney said, though it has not yet signed a contract with any of them.
The company’s plans dwarf another test Bitcoin project on the North Slope that was proposed last year — a 1.4-megawatt partnership between oil company Hilcorp and a small infrastructure firm. Mahoney declined to reveal the exact cost of Stax’s project, but confirmed it would exceed $10 million.
Mahoney also would not say how Stax expects to move the gas the 30 miles from the oil fields to its proposed site — located at the Franklin Bluffs pad, which was built during construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. But one option could be to tap into a small, existing gas line that runs along the oil pipeline, which carries fuel used by the oil pipeline’s pumps.
The proposed Bitcoin mine comes as numerous Alaska lawmakers are separately pushing the construction of an enormous new gas export project that would connect the North Slope oil fields to a port on the Kenai Peninsula. There, the fuel would be liquefied and transferred to cargo ships that would deliver it to buyers in Asia.
While that project has drawn renewed political support from President Donald Trump’s administration, it’s also struggled to draw investors in part because of its price tag of $44 billion or more.
Stax’s project would be an “innovative” way to profit from North Slope gas without requiring construction of the export project, according to Phil Wight, an energy historian at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
But the Bitcoin mine could also come with significant impacts, he added: further industrialization of the environmentally sensitive Arctic region, as well as the carbon emissions that stem from burning natural gas.
“It just gets into this really problematic situation where, suddenly, we are burning gas that we wouldn’t otherwise burn, and we are not executing an energy transition,” Wight said.
Mahoney said her project would require “no new drilling” and that its location 30 miles south of the main North Slope oil fields is aimed at avoiding additional air pollution there.
Mahoney grew up in Alaska, graduated from Wasilla High School and once worked for Frank Murkowski when he was a U.S. senator. She has worked in the cryptocurrency industry before, helping the Iditarod develop its own “Iditacoin.”
Stax was only established a year ago. But it’s working with multiple established players in Alaska, Mahoney said.
Anchorage finance firm McKinley Alaska Private Investment has committed the money needed for the pilot project, she said, and another advisor to her company is Brian Murkowski, an energy consultant and brother of current U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Jim Shine, an attorney and former high-level official at the state’s land management agency, is handling some of the permitting work.
Stax aims to begin construction by the end of 2025, Mahoney said. If the initial, temporary project is successful, the company aims to expand; it’s eyeing power generation with a capacity of a gigawatt, or 20 times the size of the initial development.
But even the pilot 50-megawatt project would be considered significant in the Lower 48, where a New York Times analysis of what it called the nation’s 34 “largest” Bitcoin mines only examined operations larger than 40 megawatts. The country’s biggest mine, currently, is a 700-megawatt facility in Texas run by a company called Riot Platforms.
Mahoney said that Alaska could benefit from Stax’s proposed project by selling its own gas to the company; the state owns a royalty share, typically at least 12.5%, of gas produced by companies operating on the North Slope.
“What we’re doing is showing that there’s a large, viable, commercial opportunity based on infrastructure and resources that exist today,” Mahoney said. “We can monetize this together, today. And it represents an opportunity of tremendous magnitude for the state and for everyone.”

The post Two companies, one roof, and the Boston mayoral race appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","ON A TREE-LINED STREET in Medford, tucked away inside a strength training gym, there’s an office that’s been doing some heavy lifting in the Boston mayor’s race.The office is the registered home of CP Campaigns, a company that didn’t exist until this past March. But it has received roughly $425,000 to handle digital advertising from the super PAC Your City Your Future, a powerful outside group supporting Josh Kraft’s bid to topple Mayor Michelle Wu, according to Office of Campaign and Political Finance records. CP Campaigns shares the office with Liberty Concepts, a separate company that did work on Kraft’s mayoral campaign website. CP Campaigns and Liberty Concepts exist as separate companies, but as Joan Vennochi of The Boston Globe first reported, they both work on digital advertising and share Jonathan Karush, who currently works for the Kraft mayoral campaign. In an emailed statement, Karush acknowledged he is the president of Liberty Concepts, a company he created 25 years ago, and he is also the principal owner of CP Campaigns. But he said there is a “firewall” in place at CP Campaigns, which “prevents coordination, even if they share the same addresses.” Super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of cash to support candidates, are not legally permitted to coordinate with campaigns, which in Massachusetts are limited to donations from individuals of $1,000 per calendar year. That two entities – Liberty Concepts and CP Campaigns – share a roof raises questions about their conduct, said Geoff Foster, the head of Common Cause Massachusetts, a nonpartisan advocacy group that promotes transparency in government and voting reforms.  “While the proximity might be technically legal, it does raise concerns and important questions about what the firewalls are that are actually in place,” he said of the entities involved in the Boston mayoral race. Last Thursday, the Kraft campaign, which is paying Liberty Concepts for website work, initially declined to make Karush available in response to CommonWealth Beacon questions about him and his two companies. The following day, a reporter visited the office of Liberty Concepts and CP Campaigns in Medford. The office, inside a squat, stucco building that shared a pothole-marked parking lot with a construction firm, was empty, but the owner of the adjacent gym shared the business card of a Karush co-worker at Liberty Concepts. Shortly after the reporter left, a Kraft campaign spokesperson, Eileen O’Connor, who also serves as a board member of MassINC, the publisher of CommonWealth Beacon, reached out to the reporter to say Karush would soon be in touch. Asked to explain how the firewall works, Karush said, “The firewall has always been in place and it means that no one is in contact with me about the work being done on/for the PAC” – essentially, there are others at CP Campaigns handling the work. Karush added he has “no personal involvement with the operations of the Super PAC whatsoever, according to the firewall.” Your City Your Future has taken in $2.9 million, much of it from Jim Davis, the chairman of athleticwear company New Balance who has opposed Wu through super PACs in previous election cycles. Michael Rubin, the CEO of Fanatics, a sports merchandising retailer, and a friend of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Josh Kraft’s father, has also contributed to it. Davis and Rubin have each donated $1 million. Rebecca St. Amand, the chairperson of Your City Your Future, said Karush has “no affiliation” with the super PAC. The group “is working with two independent, firewalled staff members of CP Campaigns that cannot and do not coordinate with anyone associated with anyone affiliated with any Boston mayoral campaign,” she said in an email. “We have no dealings with Jonathan Karush, and have no knowledge of any work he is doing for any campaign.” When she was asked why she picked CP Campaigns to handle digital advertising, St. Amand said she was not directly involved in hiring the companies the super PAC is working with. The door that leads to the office of Liberty Concepts and CP Campaigns, on Winchester Street in Medford, Mass. (Photo by Gintautas Dumcius)“When we were writing up contracts, I was told that they had done some previous work with another vendor, which is pretty common,” St. Amand said. She did not elaborate after being asked how a company that launched four months ago had done previous work. Liberty Concepts has previously worked on websites and online advertising for ballot campaigns and Maura Healey during her time as attorney general, as well as an anti-Wu super PAC, Real Progress Boston, in 2021, according to publicly available campaign finance records. During that mayoral election, the anti-Wu super PAC pulled in money from some of the same donors now supporting Your City Your Future, including New Balance’s Davis.The post Two companies, one roof, and the Boston mayoral race appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Super-PAC-Your-City-Your-Future-screenshot.jpg?fit=1024%2C582&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-03 16:09:03.579472

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Chipping away at the state’s unfunded pension liability has strengthened Rhode Island’s financial footing, according to Fitch Ratings.
The credit ratings agency recently upgraded its rating for the state’s Long-term Issue Default Rating from AA to AA+, reflecting improvements in Rhode Island’s credit worthiness. Fitch in a March 28 report touted the state’s declining long-term liability burden compared with tax revenue, also noting the “growing financial relief” from 2012 pension changes.
However, the ratings agency cautioned that pension changes adopted in 2024, including restoring annual cost-of-living adjustments for a subgroup of state retirees, created near-term liabilities in the state pension system. The state pension was 63% funded, with a $4.7 million liability as of June 2024, according to the most recent actuarial report by GRS, a consultant for the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island.
Fitch also issued an AA+ rating to $273.6 million in state general obligation bonds, signaling their strength to potential buyers ahead of a scheduled sale on June 9.
Rhode Island General Treasurer James Diossa courted 100 prospective investors during the state’s second annual investor conference on May 30. The bond sale includes $196.3 million in tax-exempt series A bonds, $27.6 million in federal, taxable series B bonds, and $49.8 million in tax-exempt series C bonds.
The bonds, backed by state credit, also received an AA rating from S&P Global Ratings and an Aa2 rating from Moody’s Ratings. The latest ratings from S&P and Moody’s affirm agencies’ existing determinations of the state’s credit worthiness and stability.
Rhode Island’s education and health service centered-economy has grown slower than the national average, weakened in part by a higher median age and smaller growth in population, Fitch noted. Fitch predicted modest long-term economic growth, matching the rate of inflation.
Legislative changes that reverse prior pension cuts or change the state’s approach to debt management could worsen the state’s financial standing and lead to a negative rating action, Fitch said. Conversely, stronger revenue growth and policy changes such as increasing the 5% constitutional cap on the state’s reserve fund could result in a ratings upgrade.

Senate Bill 50, “Freedom to Carry NC,” would allow individuals who are U.S. citizens, at least 18 years of age, and not otherwise prohibited by law, to carry concealed weapons without applying for a permit.
It’s backed by Republican leadership and would make North Carolina the 30th state to approve of so-called “constitutional carry.” Having previously cleared the Senate, the bill now proceeds to the House Rules Committee for further consideration.

Though the Judiciary 2 Committee has only 10 members — six Republicans and four Democrats — House Minority Leader Robert Reives II (D-Chatham, Randolph) took the unusual step of using his position as a committee “floater” to attend the meeting and narrow the margin.
“Nine states have allowed constitutional carry at age 18, North Carolina would be the 10th that this bill became law,” primary sponsor Rep. Danny Britt (R-Hoke, Robeson, Scotland) said.

One amendment to the legislation increases the public safety employee death benefit to $150,000.
Another calls for the University of North Carolina Board of Governors to develop a scholarship program for any child of a law enforcement officer, correctional officer, or first responder who is permanently and totally disabled as a result of a traumatic injury sustained in the line of duty. These scholarships would be available for children between the ages of 17 and 28.
The bill received opposition from a several lawmakers and members of the public. No one other than Britt spoke in favor of the measure.
  Rep. Ya Liu (Photo: NCGA)
Rep. Ya Liu (D-Wake) is the mother of two teenagers. She said there’s a huge difference between individuals at the age of 18 and 21.
At schools, students like Liu’s son conduct drills for active shooter and lockdown situations.
“Our children are scared,” Liu said. “We shouldn’t accept it as a way of life, that they have to live with this.”
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) said this morning she told her 15-year-old son on the way to school that SB 50 was on the committee hearing docket today.
He was shocked that an 18-year-old at his high school, potentially his classmate, would be allowed to buy a gun, according to Budd.
She added that 18-year-olds in the United States can’t drink a beer or rent a car.
“But yet, when it comes to something as a lethal as a gun… we want to lower the age and remove more restrictions,” Budd said, pointing out the irony.
Anne Enberg, a local legislative leader for Moms Demand Action, said bills like SB 50 won’t make communities safer.
Enberg brought up a poll conducted by Everytown for Gun Safety in September that found 77% percent of likely North Carolina voters were against removing permit requirements from concealed carry laws.
“We should be looking for solutions that make us safer, not bills that would push crime and public safety’s staff in the wrong direction,” she said.
John Vanmeter-Kirk is a rising second-year student at North Carolina State University, a volunteer with Students Demand Action, and a lifelong Raleigh resident.
He said he was speaking in front of the committee because SB 50 would put his home and community in danger.
On Sunday, Vanmeter-Kirk noted, two North Carolina communities experienced mass shootings: one in Hickory and one in Asheville.
“Two innocent North Carolinians are dead, numerous injured, my community torn apart by senseless gun violence that could’ve been prevented,” Vanmeter-Kirk said. “Even after two North Carolinians are dead, you’re considering this incredibly dangerous bill that will only lead to the loss of more North Carolinians, dishonoring the memory of those we lost two days ago.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GunsNJ-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 16:09:03.579472

(Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Even though the Republican tax and spend bill that cleared the United States House of Representatives last month no longer authorizes the sale of thousands acres of public land, state lawmakers in New Mexico say they will continue to monitor how the federal government’s actions toward public lands could impact Native nations.
As the interim legislative Indian Affairs Committee on Monday planned its work for the rest of 2025 at its first meeting since this year’s legislative session, two members said the U.S. government’s plan to sell public lands could threaten tribal sovereignty and economic development in New Mexico, which is home to 23 Indigenous nations.
Rep. Patricia Roybal Caballero, an enrolled member of the Piro Manso Tiwa Tribe and an Albuquerque Democrat, said she anticipates the federal government’s sales of public lands may affect tribal sovereignty, and she wants to know what legal mechanisms are available to the state government to “push back against those land grabs.”
“I envision us going back to the days of land grabs,” Roybal Caballero said.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.), who co-founded the Bipartisan Public Lands Caucus earlier this year, last month applauded the removal of a provision in the budget bill that would have authorized the sale of thousands acres of public land in Utah and Nevada.
At the time, Mark Allison, executive director of conservation advocacy group New Mexico Wild, said this is the first of many fights in coming days to stave off efforts to privatize public lands.

“The same forces that tried to sneak this land grab through would love nothing more than to come after New Mexico’s public lands next time,” he said.
NM delegation: Three national monuments could be reduced, eliminated

Rep. Charlotte Little, an Albuquerque Democrat from San Felipe Pueblo, said on Monday she wants the committee to receive a report on the impact of the federal government’s proposed actions toward the Chaco Canyon and Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks national monuments, and how those actions could also affect economic development in the surrounding areas.
New Mexico’s federal delegation, led by U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), in April asked the federal government to leave intact Tent Rocks along with Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument and Rio Grande del Norte, which they said were “under consideration for  reduction or elimination.”
Roybal Caballero also said she wants the committee to discuss issues related to sustainable management of tribal lands including water rights, resource extraction and environmental protection.
By the end of the year, the committee is expected to endorse legislation for the 2026 legislative session.

The University of Phoenix and the University of Idaho have broken off talks on a multimillion-dollar purchase plan.
The parties have “jointly agreed to end discussions,” Phoenix said Tuesday morning. The news was not unexpected. But it abruptly ends a controversial two-year courtship between Idaho’s land-grant institution and a for-profit online giant with a national enrollment of more than 80,000. The proposed $685 million purchase left education and business leaders stunned, and left lawmakers feeling blindsided. And on Tuesday, U of I President C. Scott Green conceded the high-stakes process posed a potential distraction for the state’s oldest four-year school.
The State Board of Education will meet Thursday afternoon to consider a “termination agreement” that would officially break off the talks. The meeting figures to be a formality. The State Board had set a June 10 deadline for Phoenix and the U of I to come to an agreement — and it has long been apparent that the deadline will come and go without a deal.
“While we have decided not to move forward, we remain appreciative of (U of I) President Scott Green, the leadership of the University of Idaho, and the many elected officials in Idaho who supported this process,” University of Phoenix President Chris Lynne said in a news release Tuesday morning.
“Although we continue to see great value in University of Phoenix, it has become cost prohibitive, and potentially distracting to our other work, to continue conversations,” Green said in a news release Tuesday.
The State Board first gave the Phoenix purchase the green light in May 2023 — after a series of closed-door discussions. Those closed meetings remain at the center of a lawsuit filed by Attorney General Raúl Labrador; a court hearing is scheduled for June 23.
But after the State Board gave the deal its initial blessing, Labrador and many legislators questioned the clandestine process, and the merits of the multimillion deal. After a series of tense committee hearings and floor debates, lawmakers blocked the purchase in the spring of 2024.
The State Board then regrouped. In late June 2024, the board gave the U of I and Phoenix nearly a 12-month extension, allowing the parties more time to try to rework a deal and win over skeptical lawmakers.
But in April, the 2025 legislative session adjourned, with no discussion of a U of I-Phoenix partnership. That lack of legislative activity — coupled by reports that Phoenix might instead go on sale through an initial public offering — suggested that the U of I’s purchase plan was already on shaky ground.
From the beginning, U of I officials said the Phoenix acquisition would revolutionize education for adult learners in rural Idaho, and provide revenue from a profitable online university.
Instead, the U of I now says it will be kept whole.
The U of I will collect an additional $12.2 million from Phoenix — in the second of a series of “breakup fees” worked into the State Board’s extension.
The U of I received $5 million last June, to cover some of the costs on researching a potential Phoenix purchase. The second payment will bring those fees to $17.2 million — exactly enough to cover the U of I’s Phoenix-related due diligence costs, U of I spokeswoman Jodi Walker said Tuesday.
In January, Green told legislators that the Phoenix breakup fees would more than cover the university’s due diligence costs — which exceed at least $14.2 million, based on previous EdNews reporting
The U of I “learned a lot” from its two-year courtship with Phoenix, especially about delivering education to adult students who aren’t part of the U of I’s typical demographic, Walker said. She said the U of I will now be able to “refocus” on its on-campus priorities, such as Moscow-based enrollment and building its research portfolio — and the U of I has no immediate plans to seek a partnership with another university.
“I’m not aware of any other conversations,” she said, “certainly not in the short term.”
Phoenix’s next moves are unclear.
The State Board’s June 2024 extension gave Phoenix the option of talking to other would-be buyers, or pursuing an IPO. Over the past 11 months, Phoenix says it “has actively explored other strategic options that align with its mission and strengths in serving working adult learners.” But on Tuesday, Phoenix said it “will continue to operate as an independent, private institution.”

Martin Heinrich (D-NM) (Photo courtesy Cibola National Forest)Two federal offices housing wildfire dispatch centers that coordinate the detection of and response to wildfires for much of New Mexico no longer face risk of lease cancellations, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) said Tuesday.
In early March, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency listed two national forest supervisor’s offices in Albuquerque and Silver City among several hundred announced lease closures aimed at cutting federal spending.
The offices also housed interagency wildfire dispatch centers, which house equipment and personnel crucial to ensuring that small wildfire starts are quickly noticed and extinguished before they become larger. 
A Source NM review of the online DOGE list of lease terminations showed that neither of the two offices remain on the list; nor do any other Forest Service offices nationwide. They appear to have been removed in the last week. 
Albuquerque center housing ‘critical’ wildfire dispatch on DOGE termination list as fire risk grows

Heinrich questioned Agriculture Department Secretary Brooke Rollins about the centers recently during her testimony before a Senate committee. He confirmed Tuesday in a statement to Source New Mexico that the dispatch centers would remain open. 
“I’m proud to announce that the Interagency Dispatch Centers in Albuquerque and Silver City will be staying open,” he said. “These centers are essential to help protect New Mexicans during wildfires, floods, and other emergencies. That’s why I called Secretary Rollins as soon as I heard that DOGE was planning to close them. Today, we put an end to DOGE’s reckless efforts.”
About 500 offices remain on the DOGE list, down from roughly 750 in early March, according to a Source NM review. Many, but not all, Agriculture Department offices have been removed from the list.
The dispatch centers monitor most of Central and Southwest New Mexico, a 45,000-square-mile area, and coordinate the deployment of people, vehicles and aircraft to suppress wildfires as quickly as possible. 
Already this year, the dispatch center in Albuquerque has responded to 172 wildfires in its coverage area, and the one in Silver City has responded to 64, according to dispatch center data. 
The threatened closure of the Silver City Dispatch Center, in particular, alarmed some in the area because it was unclear where another dispatch center could go in the rural area. The dispatch center, which oversees the Gila National Forest, is in the epicenter of where national forecasters warn wildfire risk is highest this season. 
A spokesperson for the General Services Administration, which manages federal leases, referred comment to the Agriculture Department. Spokespeople for the national forests where the offices are housed did not respond to Source’s request for comment Tuesday. 
The removals occur as Musk departs the White House. 
‘It’s bad’: How drought, lack of snowpack and federal cuts could spell wildfire disaster in NM

Heinrich’s statement did not provide more details on why most other Forest Service offices nationwide no longer appear on the DOGE list, but he noted how important the ones in New Mexico are to preventing disasters. 
 “The Interagency Dispatch Centers help get resources – like airtankers from Kirtland Air Force Base—to where they’re needed, and fast. As fire seasons get longer and more dangerous, and post-fire floods continue to threaten our communities, I’ll keep fighting to make sure our firefighters and emergency crews have the tools they need to keep our communities safe,” he said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Federal law enforcement officers raided a Minneapolis taco restaurant Tuesday morning, sparking protests from immigrant rights activists and neighbors. 
Officers wearing the uniforms of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Minneapolis Police Department, Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, the FBI, and the criminal investigation arm of the IRS surrounded Las Cuatro Milpas on East Lake Street.
Protestors gathered on the other side of the police tape, shouting at officers and questioning why Minneapolis police — whose leaders swore wouldn’t assist federal agencies in civil immigration enforcement — stood alongside ICE agents as officers searched the building.
Five years ago, this stretch of Lake Street was filled with protestors, who clashed with police following the murder of George Floyd. Today, protestors tossed traffic cones and trash cans in the way of law enforcement vehicles as they drove away from the scene, and shouted at the officers to go home, or quit their jobs.
The incident comes amid the Trump administration’s promise of mass deportation and use of extreme and legally dubious tactics to deport immigrants, including some here legally. The administration has sought to pressure local law enforcement into joining the effort, while progressive states and cities have refused.
In a statement posted to X, the Minneapolis Police Department said it was still waiting for information about the operation, and that MPD responded only to “ensure the crowd and the surrounding area remained safe.” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara was on the scene. 
In a statement posted to social media, the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office said the incident was “not related to immigration enforcement.” 
The sheriff’s office said it has no involvement in civil immigration enforcement but does assist federal authorities on criminal investigations and enforcement. 
Federal law enforcement officers on the scene declined to say what the purpose of the raid was, and directed the Reformer to an email address for ICE’s media contact. Some declined to identify which agency they were with. Most wore masks.
Officers emerged from the building Tuesday afternoon with boxes, which they loaded into a van. Protestors attempted to block the vehicles from moving, but officers moved protestors out of the way with chemical irritants and piercing sirens. 
Minneapolis City Council Member Jason Chavez, whose ward includes Las Cuatro Milpas, was among the protestors. 
“We have people in ICE badges and we have MPD showing up, closing up the perimeter, and assisting, and helping with this situation,” Chavez said. “This is completely wrong.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250603_0391-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-03 15:12:46.367753

Pearce — whom former Gov. Gary Herbert first appointed to Utah’s highest court in November 2015 — gave six months notice in a resignation letter to Gov. Spencer Cox dated Friday. 
“The time has come for me to turn the page, start a new chapter of my career, and find new ways to serve the people of Utah,” Pearce wrote in the letter. “In keeping with the tradition of not leaving the Court until there has been an opportunity to nominate and confirm a successor, I am providing six months’ notice of my intent to depart.”
Pearce said his last day will be Dec. 1. He’ll depart shortly after his 10-year anniversary on the Utah Supreme Court. Previously, Pearce also served on the Utah Court of Appeals. Between 2009 and 2013, he also served as general counsel to Herbert. 
‘A broad attack’: Utah’s judiciary fights bills threatening its independence

A news release issued Tuesday by the Utah Judiciary said Pearce “plans to return to private practice and to continue teaching at the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah.” 
Pearce’s letter didn’t mention it, but his departure comes in the wake of a 2024 legislative session that saw unprecedented tension between lawmakers and the judiciary. Ultimately, after a deal was struck, the most controversial bills that would have given legislators more of a say in judicial retention elections were scrapped — and Cox vetoed a bill that would have given the governor and the Senate power over appointing the court’s next chief justice.
That tension came after a series of rulings issued by the court that frustrated lawmakers, prompting some to accuse the Utah Supreme Court of being an “activist court.” 
In August, the court issued a 4-1 opinion that upheld an injunction blocking enforcement of Utah’s 2020 near-total abortion ban that lawmakers had hoped would take effect once Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. And a month before that, the Utah Supreme Court issued a unanimous opinion that sent an anti-gerrymandering lawsuit back to district court, ruling the judge “erred” in dismissing the claim that the Legislature violated the Utah Supreme Court when it when it repealed and replaced a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative that sought to enact an independent redistricting commission. 
Cox vetoes bill that would have given governor power over appointing Utah chief justice

Pearce’s letter didn’t address any of that, though. He focused his message on expressing gratitude for his 16 years of public service, writing that he’s “had the privilege to work alongside some of the most dedicated and talented people in the state — none more so than my colleagues on the Utah Supreme Court.”
“I am extremely proud of the Court and the work that it has done,” he wrote. “My colleagues, past and present, are brilliant, courageous, and dedicated to the rule of law. I am a better attorney and person because of them.”
Pearce also wrote he considers himself “deeply fortunate to have spent a decade” as a justice on the Utah Supreme Court. 
“I have never lost sight of the fact that there are more qualified attorneys in Utah than there are seats on the bench,” he added. “I am humbled by the trust the people of Utah place in their judiciary and am profoundly honored to have had this chance to serve. I wish you all the best as you continue to lead the state.”
Chief Justice Matthew Durrant, in a statement issued Tuesday, praised Pearce and his work, expressing particular appreciation for Pearce’s efforts to enhance representation for indigent parties and to improve the way the Supreme Court measures lawyer competence.

“Justice Pearce’s contributions to the citizens of Utah and to their judiciary have been truly extraordinary,” Durrant said. “He is not only a brilliant jurist, but also a wonderful colleague. The legacy he has built will long be a force for good in our state.”
Since 2022, Pearce has served as the associate chief justice, one ranking below Durrant in the court’s leadership. 
According to his bio on the Utah Supreme Court’s website, Pearce has a degree in economics from the University of Utah and received his Juris Doctor from the University of California, Berkeley.

(Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is suing federal officials over his May 9 arrest outside an immigration detention center, alleging malicious prosecution and false arrest. 
He also accused Alina Habba, the acting U.S. Attorney of New Jersey, of defamation over a post on her personal social media account, in which she wrongly stated that Baraka trespassed and ignored multiple warnings from authorities to leave the Newark detention center property. 
“To arrest me, to handcuff me, to drag me away, to take my fingerprints and a picture and mugshots for a class-C misdemeanor is egregious. For me to appear in a hearing and after the hearing, for the U.S. Marshals to rush in and basically to take my picture again is egregious and malicious in my mind,” he said Tuesday outside the federal courthouse in Newark. 
Baraka, one of six candidates vying to be the Democratic nominee in the race to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, filed the federal lawsuit on the first day of early voting in the state. He said the timing is so that people are held responsible for it “immediately.”
Besides Habba, the 17-page complaint also named Ricky Patel, a supervising agent at Homeland Security Investigations, the agency that arrested Baraka. The mayor also filed a notice of his intent to sue the federal government, said Nancy Erika Smith, his attorney.

“Political prosecutions are for fascist countries, not the United States of America. Mayor Baraka was a target because he has stood up for the constitutional and human rights of all people, including immigrants,” Smith said. 
Baraka was arrested one week after Delaney Hall, now the largest detention center on the East Coast, opened its doors when he visited to check if its owner, Geo Group, had done the required inspections and secured a certificate of occupancy. 
The lawsuit details his arrest by the minute. He arrived at 1:42 p.m. and was invited eight minutes later by a Geo Group staffer inside the facility’s gates, where he waited until 2:33 p.m., the complaint states. Patel ordered Baraka to leave and threatened to arrest him, and Baraka left the property at 2:38 p.m., the suit states. Three New Jersey House members on site for a facility tour joined the mayor and advocated for his entry. 
Five minutes later, about 20 armed, masked Department of Homeland Security agents swarmed Baraka and “violently” arrested him without probable cause, the complaint says. He was taken to another DHS facility where agents photographed and fingerprinted him, an experience he called “humiliating.” He spent five hours in custody. 
Before agents took Baraka to the DHS facility, Habba already posted on social media that Baraka “has willingly chosen to disregard the law.” Later that evening, Habba also allegedly made false statements about his arrest on Fox News, and in public appearances with other DHS officials in the following days.
The suit contends that Habba and Patel “conspired” to promote “false and defamatory” statements about what happened, including that Baraka stormed the facility. 
“The false affidavit was made with malice, particularly seeking to assure that the evening news included videos of the Black mayor of Newark, New Jersey, being led away in handcuffs by federal officials,” the filing states. 
Baraka said Tuesday that race played a role in the incident. 
“It’s easy for people to believe that a mayor being arrested, especially a mayor that looks like me, has been arrested for something other than what just happened … When people see me in cuffs, they automatically believe I did something wrong, I was guilty,” he said. “The reality is, I didn’t do anything. I went down there for a press conference.” 
Habba attended a court hearing in Baraka’s case, an unusual move for a U.S. attorney. But his charge was dismissed 13 days after his arrest, which he said he learned only after Habba announced on social media she planned to drop the charges. 
Judge André Espinosa rebuked the U.S. Attorney’s Office while dismissing the charge with prejudice, urging attorneys to operate with a higher standard and avoid using their role to advance political agendas.  
The same day Baraka’s case was dismissed, Habba charged Rep. LaMonica McIver with two felony counts of assaulting officers during the scuffle. McIver has called the move “purely political.”
Habba, Trump’s personal attorney who he nominated to serve as interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, has also said she’s investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state’s ban on local law enforcement assisting in civil immigration enforcement.
A spokesperson for Habba did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Habba took to social media Monday night to blast Baraka for suing her and offered him “advice” to instead prioritize violent crime and public safety. 
“Far better use of time for the great citizens of New Jersey,” she said. 
Smith responded by touting a drop in violent crime in Newark during Baraka’s term as mayor. 
Baraka is seeking compensatory damages for pain, suffering, stress, humiliation, mental anguish, personal physical injury, physical sickness and damage to his reputation. 
“I don’t know if Alina Habba and Ricky Patel have enough resources to pay me for the damages they’ve caused me. At the end of the day, they should at least apologize — they should at least write me a letter and apologize to me,” he said.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)Three open seats in the Oklahoma House will be decided June 10 by voters in a special election. 
Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m on the day of the election. 
House District 71
In Tulsa County, voters will choose between Republican Beverly Atteberry and Democrat Amanda Clinton.
The seat opened up when Rep. Amanda Swope, D-Tulsa, stepped down in December for a position in the City of Tulsa’s government. 
  Beverly Atteberry is pictured. (Photo provided)
Atteberry, 57, previously said she’s lived in the district since 1993 and knows the community well since she’s seen all of its “ups and downs.”
As an attorney and business owner, she said her knowledge of the law and inner-workings of the state Capitol will let her “hit the ground running.” Atteberry’s law firm serves Tulsa area clients and focuses on wills, probate, and criminal law. 
Improving Oklahoma’s roads, public education and government spending to help bring more businesses to the state are among her priorities if elected, Atteberry told Oklahoma Voice.
  Amanda Clinton is the pictured. (Photo provided)
Clinton, 46, is a small business owner, an adjunct professor at Oklahoma State University and a former journalist. She worked for Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols’ campaign and on boards for Planned Parenthood and the OSU Foundation Board of Governors. 
She previously said she’s an advocate for reproductive health freedom, access to medical care, clean water and minimizing “state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ impact on public schools.” Her priorities also include lowering the cost of living and ending homelessness, according to her website. 
Clinton has said her experience with the Cherokee Nation has been an example to her of a government serving its people. 
House District 74
Democrat Amy Hossain will face off against Republican Kevin Wayne Norwood in the race for House District 74. The district in Tulsa and Rogers Counties includes Owasso and part of Tulsa. 
Rep. Mark Vancuren, R-Owasso, resigned in December for a job in the Tulsa County government. 
  Amy Hossain is pictured. (Photo provided)
Hossain, 50, works as the chief human resources officer for Domestic Violence Intervention Services in Tulsa and is the president of Khan Ohana, a nonprofit working to “break the cycle of poverty among college students.” 
She previously said she’s running because as a voter, she’s been frustrated by the lack of options on her ballot in the past and wanted to give voters the choice to elect someone from her party. 
If elected, her priorities include raising the minimum wage, better funding for public schools, access to affordable and accessible health care and housing, according to her website. 
  Kevin Norwood is pictured. (Photo provided)
Norwood, 58, is a pastor who said he’s been involved in his community, helping to build businesses and mentoring youth, for three decades. His work with community initiatives like Keep Owasso Beautiful and Owasso Cares have led to recognition and awards, according to his website. 
Building a “vibrant” economy, tax relief for Oklahomans, safer communities, strong infrastructure and supporting community and family initiatives are among his priorities. He also intends to “revitalize main streets” and stop the “green energy grift,” according to his website. 
Norwood will “champion” his community and “reflect conservative Oklahoma values,” according to his campaign website.  
House District 97
Finally, two Democrats, JeKia Harrison and Aletia Haynes Timmons, will vie for the open House District 91 seat, representing parts of Oklahoma City and Midwest City. 
Rep. Jason Lowe, D-Oklahoma City, stepped down in April to serve as an Oklahoma County commissioner. 
  JeKia Harrison is pictured. (Photo provided)
Harrison, 35, works as a legislative assistant for Rep. Meloyde Blancett, D-Tulsa, and previously worked as a child welfare specialist for the state Department of Human Services. 
She also owns Pen 2 Paper Consulting, a political campaign consulting and management firm, and has been involved in leadership for organizations like Young Democrats of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma chapter of Moms Demand Action, which advocates for stronger gun laws. 
Increased funding for Oklahoma public schools, more affordable housing, reforms to criminal justice and raising the minimum wage are some of Harrison’s priorities, according to her campaign website. 
  Aletia Haynes Timmons is pictured. (Photo from the Oklahoma County District Court)
Timmons, 64, is a recently retired Oklahoma County District judge and she previously worked in civil rights and employment law, as well as in the Oklahoma County District Attorney’s Office. 
Her priorities include criminal justice reforms, greater accountability in government, strengthening the economy and “finding common ground and working for real solutions,” according to her campaign website.
Timmons has received several awards and recognitions for her “dedication to justice, community service, and diversity,” according to her website. She’s a founder of a program in Northeast Oklahoma City addressing food insecurity and has worked as an instructor on Langston University’s Oklahoma City campus.
Early voting is set for Thursday and Friday at select locations between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. 
Voters can check their registration status and polling location on the Oklahoma Election Board’s website.

Leon Morgan officially took over as director June 1, following the departure last September of long-time director Peter Simonson, who held the post for 24 years. Morgan, who grew up in Albuquerque’s International District and has worked at the ACLU more than a decade, said Simonson and others helped him recognize the different ways the ACLU fights for justice in New Mexico.
In recent months, the ACLU of New Mexico has denounced Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s deployment of the National Guard to Albuquerque; sued in federal court to prevent the deportation of a New Mexico Tech student; and, last month, filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of people who have been held in solitary confinement in state prisons. 
The variety of actions, in and out of court, show that the ACLU is “an organization that prioritizes not just litigation but also advocacy in terms of community engagement and legislative work and communications work,” Morgan said told Source NM in an interview Monday. “[That] helped round me into a leader that knows how to use more than one tool to try to fight for outcomes that advance and protect civil liberties and rights.”

Morgan said his upbringing in New Mexico gives him a clear sense of what’s at stake in this moment. That means “holding the line” on reproductive rights, along with protecting tribal sovereignty, ending mass incarceration here and advocating for immigrant families, he said. He noted his wife’s family is from Mexico and therefore he has insight about the fears many families of mixed immigration status are feeling. 
“I feel like I understand what the stakes are here in New Mexico, particularly in the climate we’re in, where you know so many communities we care about are under attack, and that’s kind of what motivates me,” Morgan said. 
According to a news release from the ACLU, the board that appointed Howard after a national search noted that his personal experiences, including being racially profiled as a student and climbing his way into leadership positions in law school, will serve him well as executive director. 
“Leon’s strategic vision, combined with his lived experience and legal expertise, makes him uniquely qualified to lead the affiliate during this critical time for civil liberties in New Mexico and nationwide,” Kevin Hoover, president of the ACLU of New Mexico Board of Directors, said in a statement. “The entire organization is energized by this appointment and eager to continue our vital work under his leadership.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ACLU_113022_049-scaled-e1748973767424-1024x911.jpg,,,2025-06-03 15:12:46.367753

Nearly 800 law enforcement officers from across the state will participate in the 39th Annual Delaware Law Enforcement Torch Run for Special Olympics, carrying the Flame of Hope from June 11 to June 13 in support of athletes with intellectual disabilities.
Spanning from Fenwick Island to Wilmington, the three-day event features multiple relay legs and ceremonial stops, culminating in the delivery of the torch to the Opening Ceremony of the 2025 Special Olympics Delaware Summer Games at the University of Delaware’s Bob Carpenter Center on Friday, June 13.
The Torch Run highlights law enforcement’s longstanding partnership with Special Olympics Delaware, raising over $12 million since the event began to fund year-round training and competition in 15 sports.
“The Law Enforcement Torch Run is one of the most powerful symbols of our movement, it shines a light on the unwavering commitment of Delaware’s law enforcement community to inclusion, respect, and unity,” said Lisa Smith, Senior Director of Marketing and Development for Special Olympics Delaware.

“For 39 years, these dedicated officers have not only carried the Flame of Hope, but also the hopes and dreams of our athletes. Their support helps fuel our mission and reminds us what it means to stand together for a more accepting world.”
The Run kicks off with officers running simultaneous routes in both New Castle and Sussex counties, making ceremonial stops in Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Small business owners and farmers are already feeling the increased costs and decreased consumer purchasing power resulting from foreign tariffs imposed at the federal level.
During a Tuesday press conference in West Des Moines’ historic Valley Junction, local business owners said they placed orders in January for holiday products that are becoming more expensive by the day as manufacturers and even local creators have to increase prices due to the additional tariffs.
Val Voicek, the owner of Bing’s, a store in the business shopping district, said one of her best-selling products, Nee Doh, a squishy sensory toy, has jumped from $5.95 at the beginning of the year to $6.95 now. Some orders, including her holiday order for the popular product, have been canceled because, as she said, the company has “priced themselves out of the market.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX  
Voicek said that means kids aren’t spending their allowances on these toys as readily, and adult shoppers are holding off on extra purchases when they come in the store to shop. 
“I’ve been in business for eight years, and this time is really uncertain for us,” Voicek said. “It’s even harder than COVID, because it’s something that people and politicians in Washington could make a difference and take care of right now, but instead, we’re left in our communities trying to figure it out on our own.”
Voicek and Meredith Wells, another Valley Junction business owner, said about 70% to 80% of their inventories are imported products. Wells said for the orders she has already placed for the holiday season, vendors have warned her could cost 10% to 30% more to account for the associated tariffs throughout the supply chain. 
Wells said she tries to buy from local producers to stock her store, MoMere, but most local producers source packaging and other materials overseas and are similarly impacted. 
“The truth is, we’re not a big corporation, we can’t absorb these added costs,” Wells said. “We run on tight budgets, and every disruption cuts deeper. These tariffs aren’t being paid by foreign governments, they’re being paid by small businesses like ours, and ultimately, by our customers.” 
Impact on Iowa farmers
Aaron Lehman, president of Iowa Farmers Union said the tariffs and the ever-changing uncertainty are also having an impact on Iowa farmers. 
“We’re seeing falling prices for what we grow — and, on the other hand, farmers see higher prices for what we have to purchase, like fertilizer and other inputs that have to be imported into this country,” Lehman said. “Farmers already have few choices in the marketplace, and a chaotic trade policy makes a bad situation even worse.” 
Lehman said the tariffs also disrupt farmers’ established foreign trade relationships, because American farmers can no longer be seen as a “reliable” country to buy from. 
The trickle-down effect is that farmers put off equipment upgrades, which hurt ag-adjacent industries. He said it also means farmers delay a transition to the next generation, even though the average age of a farmer keeps going up and up. In some cases, it could even mean the end of a family farm, he said. 
“We need to demand better from our elected leaders,” Lehman said. “Iowa members of Congress need to speak loudly about the impact here on the ground, in our fields and in our communities. They need to demand that Congress should have a say in fair trade policy.” 
Lehman said U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley has made some comments in favor of this action, but that there is “not enough momentum.” 
Lehman said foreign trade policy needs to prioritize fair trade, build relationships over time and allow farmers, and businesses, to import what they need. 
“A well thought out, reasonable trade policy can include a targeted tariff and be quite effective to help farmers and workers,” Lehman said. “But a chaotic trade policy that uses tariffs and that, in a way, puts farmers at the front lines of a retaliatory tariff, makes no sense at all.”

(Photo by Matt Rourke/The Associated Press)A Palm Beach gun owner and two Second Amendment groups have filed a motion for summary judgement in their federal court challenge to Florida’s law banning individuals from openly carrying firearms, claiming that the law is unconstitutional.
Gun Owners of America, the Gun Owners Foundation, and gun owner Richard Hughes originally filed their lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida last August, alleging that the law banning open carry violates the Second and Fourteenth amendments of the U.S. Constitution and places them, their members, and their supporters at risk of being arrested and prosecuted should they openly carry firearms in public.
St. Lucie County Sheriff Richard Del Toro is the lone defendant in the case. In their lawsuit, Hughes and the two gun rights organizations list him because the St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office warned the public after the state legalized what is known as “permitless carry” in 2023 that “[t]he law is not open carry; open carry is still illegal under most circumstances.”
In 2017, the Florida Supreme Court upheld state restrictions on openly carrying a firearm, ruling in Norman v. State that the law did not violate citizens’ Second Amendment rights in a case brought by Dale Lee Norman, a St. Lucie County resident who faced a second-degree misdemeanor charge after he walked down a road with handgun holstered to his hip, according to the Courthouse News Service.

The federal lawsuit says that state Supreme Court ruling failed on a couple of fronts: for “not once consulting contemporaneous authorities to discern the meaning of the Second Amendment’s text” and for failure to conduct an historical analysis of the “nation’s early tradition as to open carry — or any tradition, for that matter.”
“This case is personal for me and millions of gun owners across the state,” says Luis Valdes, Florida state director for Gun Owners of America. “Florida likes to brand itself as pro-Second Amendment, but this ban proves otherwise. We are fighting to restore a right that never should’ve been taken away — and we won’t stop until every Floridian can carry openly, freely, and constitutionally.”
“Florida’s open carry ban is an outdated and unconstitutional relic,”  Sam Parades said in a statement on behalf of the board of directors for Gun Owners Foundation. “The right to bear arms means exactly that – to carry arms, not just to keep them locked away.”
Florida remains one of only five states in the nation that bans the open carrying of a firearm, the others being Illinois, Connecticut, New York and California — a list of blue states that Florida does not usually share an alliance with.
Gov. Ron DeSantis has said on several occasions that he supports open carry, and First Lady Casey DeSantis weighed in as well earlier this year, writing on X that, “It’s time for the Free State of Florida to join other states in enacting open carry! Sounds like a great priority for our GOP supermajority. This is the year.”
But it wasn’t the year for open carry in Florida’s GOP-dominated state Legislature. Senate President Ben Albritton stated his opposition to overturning the ban in his first day as leader while meeting with reporters last November.
A trial date has been set for November 3, 2025.

Unlike other attorneys general, Mississippi’s top lawyer, Lynn Fitch, has not joined a lawsuit that recouped billions of these dollars across the country. 
In early April, a few days after the federal government withdrew $11.4 billion of promised public health funds, Democratic governors and attorneys general representing 23 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit alleging that the clawback was unlawful. In mid-May, the judge hearing the case granted temporary relief for the states and ordered the country’s health agency to restore funds. 
But the federal judge limited the ruling to states that had joined the lawsuit, and Mississippi is not one of those states. 
When Mississippi Today asked Michelle Williams, chief of staff for Fitch, why Mississippi didn’t join the lawsuit, she said she didn’t know which lawsuit the newsroom was referring to and would have to look at it before commenting. After Mississippi Today emailed her the judge’s ruling, she did not respond. 
The Mississippi State Department of Health and the Department of Mental Health were administering the funds. State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney told lawmakers that his agency would lose about $230 million, and the mental health department estimated its federal funding loss from the decision to be just over $7.5 million.
Health Department spokesperson Greg Flynn said in an email that “while we would love to have our federal funding that was allocated restored, we are still providing mission critical services to the public.” 
He went on to say the department understands this will likely not be the last court ruling related to these funds, and the case could end up in U.S. Supreme Court. 
Adam Moore, Flynn’s counterpart at the mental health department, emailed Mississippi Today that while the federal government’s decision caught his agency off-guard, the rescinded dollars were set to expire in September. He said recipients of federal health grants do not always spend all their funds, and there’s no guarantee the $7.5 million cut would have been fully used. 
“It’s simply difficult to speculate on the overall impact and whether they all would have all been utilized before the planned expiration date,” Moore said. 
Five months into Donald Trump’s second presidential term, Mississippi is already seeing the consequences of cuts to these and other promised public health dollars.

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis) North Carolina officials have agreed to schedule a hearing with a firm that is protesting how the state awarded a key hurricane rebuilding contract, according to the company.
IEM International, which is based in Morrisville, filed a complaint in late May about the contract to manage homebuilding efforts in western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. The firm believes its bid for the contract was improperly disqualified. State officials have said IEM did not submit proper financial documents.
A spokesperson for IEM told NC Newsline that the firm’s request for a hearing had been granted. The NC Department of Commerce, which is overseeing the contract, did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
State officials awarded the $81.5 million contract to Horne LLP, a Mississippi-based firm. The award has quickly come under scrutiny from state lawmakers, who cite Horne’s involvement in past troubled recovery efforts.
It is not yet known when the hearing will take place, or the broader timeline for IEM’s protest. The firm has requested that the contract be re-bid; the Department of Commerce has said it believes “this procurement was conducted fairly.”
North Carolina rules state that the meeting between the state and IEM will be scheduled within 30 days. After the meeting, the state will decide if further review of the contract is needed.
In its original statement detailing the protest, IEM said it believed its bid’s disqualification was “highly irregular and concerning.”
The firm’s bid, obtained through a public records request, shows that it provided a balance sheet, income statement and cash flow data from three fiscal years. It added: “As a privately owned company, IEM’s financial statements are not public. IEM can provide to DCR [the relevant Department of Commerce division] upon request.”
State officials have cited a 2024 appeals court ruling that bars agencies from asking vendors for more information once bids have opened. Stephanie McGarrah, who is leading the Department of Commerce division that oversees Helene contracts, said during a hearing that it meant the state could not adequately follow up on IEM’s financials.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hurricane-Helene-debris-Army-Corps-photo-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-03 15:12:46.367753

Retired Rear Admiral Gregory Slavonic was appointed by Stitt. He previously led the Oklahoma Department of Veterans Affairs, which had been “plagued” by financial mismanagement, according to a news release.

Former Commissioner Allie Friesen had served in the role since her January 2024 appointment, but her time as the agency’s leader was marred by financial disarray, investigations and audits. Friesen blamed prior administrations for the financial situation that required a cash infusion from lawmakers.
The Oklahoma Legislature overwhelmingly voted to fire her in a late-night vote Thursday. Lawmakers said they had “lost confidence” in her ability to lead the department and removed her, effective immediately. 
Stitt continued to stand by Friesen throughout her time as commissioner amid calls to fire her and said she was “shining a light on an agency that has operated in darkness for far too long.” He called the Legislature’s move to fire her a “politically motivated witch hunt.”

“It is no secret that the Department of Mental Health has long been in need of reform,” Stitt said in a statement. “It is imperative that Admiral Slavonic is allowed to do the hard work needed to remove corruption and conflicts of interest without political interference. There are brighter days ahead for this department and those that rely on its services. I’m grateful to Admiral Slavonic for his willingness to set another Oklahoma agency on the right course.” 
Slavonic served in the U.S. Navy for over three decades, including as deputy and principal assistant to the secretary of the Navy, and as chief operating officer and chief management officer for the Department of the Navy. 
He also served as assistant secretary of the Navy for manpower and reserve affairs as an appointee of President Donald Trump during his first term.
“I’m grateful that Gov. Stitt is so keenly focused on rooting out corruption and ensuring that government is working first and foremost for the citizens we are tasked with serving,” Slavonic said in a statement. “The Department of Mental Health brings much needed services to many Oklahomans, and I look forward to ensuring that they have the tools needed to provide those services. I thank Gov. Stitt for trusting me with this effort.” 
Slavonic graduated from Oklahoma State University with bachelor’s degree and from University of Central Oklahoma with a master’s degree. 
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, leads a select committee investigating the mental health department’s finances and said he looks forward to working with Slavonic. 
“It is imperative that the next director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services work to restore stability, confidence and trust in the agency and its ability to provide critical services to Oklahomans while being good stewards of taxpayer dollars,” he said in a statement Tuesday.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana, alongside 20 other states, penned a letter last month urging the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate delisting China-based companies on U.S. stock exchanges “to protect American investors.” 
Indiana Comptroller Elise Nieshalla and other state financial officers said there is a growing risk posed by the China-based companies due to Chinese Communist Party interference and widespread failures to meet U.S. transparency, accounting and auditing standards.
“As stewards of invested public funds, we have a responsibility to protect our beneficiaries from foreign entities to seek to exploit our capital markets while evading accountability,” Nieshalla said in a press release.

The letter highlights the Chinese Communist Party’s crackdown on independent due-diligence firms and points to findings by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that revealed auditing failures among Chinese companies. It also states that the CCP’s systematic use of Variable Interest Entities — an organization that is controlled through contractual agreements rather than direct ownership — prevents U.S. investors from owning the company. 
The state financial officers also direct the SEC to investigate potential violations of the Securities Exchange Act, including disclosure of controls and procedures, internal financial reporting mechanisms, falsified accounting records and manipulative or deceptive practices. They alleged that the CCP’s efforts to suppress transparency exacerbated these issues. 
“As state financial officers, part of our responsibility is to ensure that the American people’s finances – and our American financial system – are protected from foreign actors who mean to do us harm,” the signatories said in the letter. 
Indiana has recently purged Chinese companies from state investments. 
In 2023, legislation was passed that required the Indiana Public Retirement System to divest from any entities that do military or intelligence work or are controlled by the Chinese government. Within a year, INPRS eliminated its $1.2 billion worth of investments in Chinese entities.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Senate is poised to vote on a pair of bills that would open the state’s sports betting industry to new vendors and impose harsher penalties on people who allow underaged online gambling.
And the odds look good for passage in the upper chamber, with longtime supporter of the state’s gambling industry, and new Senate Majority Leader, Frank Ciccone leading the charge. But across the rotunda, the fate of legislation remains unclear.
Since 2023, International Game Technology (IGT) PLC has had the exclusive right to run the state’s digital sportsbook. Lawmakers now want to end that monopoly by allowing the Rhode Island Lottery to consider additional vendors when IGT’s contract runs out in November 2026 —  opening the door for companies such as DraftKings and FanDuel to take wagers for the first time since the state first launched sports betting in 2018.
Under Ciccone’s amended legislation, the Lottery would award at least two and no more than five vendor contracts. The original bill called for the state to award at least five contracts.
“It’s a way of cleaning it up,” Ciccone said of the wording update in an interview Tuesday morning. “The Lottery was always looking at more than one option.”
A Lottery-commissioned report published May 1 by Spectrum Gaming Group recommended the state add four to six new online sports betting vendors to stay competitive with neighboring states. Massachusetts has seven vendors, while Connecticut allows three.
The Lottery intends to issue a request for information on expansion in early 2026.
Ciccone said he filed his proposal at the request of the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, who he said “hated” the quality of the existing Sportsbook RI app.  And now the legislation has the backing of the newly-elected Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat.
“She believes the sports betting bill has merit,” Senate spokesperson Greg Paré said in an email.
The Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming recommended the measure 7-0 during its meeting Monday. The bill is scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday.
Companion legislation in the House sponsored by Rep. Matthew Dawson, an East Providence Democrat, remains held for further study following its initial hearing before the House Committee on Finance on May 1.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi previously said the bill was unnecessary since the state still remains under contract with IGT through almost the end of 2026. But Shekarchi said Monday he plans to review the language following the Senate vote. 
The Speaker’s stance also applies to Ciccone’s bill which would impose up to one year in prison and a $1,000 fine for letting anyone under 21 make bets or play games through the mobile casino managed by Bally’s Corp.
Fears that high school-aged kids would get hooked on iGaming led lawmakers to restrict access to anyone under 21 when state officials legalized online gaming in 2023. The Rhode Island State Police requested this year’s legislation to help officers enforce the age restrictions.
Ciccone’s bill received unanimous approval from the Senate committee he previously chaired, but has not yet been scheduled for a floor vote.
Companion legislation sponsored by Rep. Gregory Costantino, a Lincoln Democrat, advanced to the House floor following passage by the chamber’s Committee on Judiciary in a 10-5 vote on April 29. 
The House panel initially rejected the proposal over concerns that 18-to 20-year-olds allowed to gamble in person at Rhode Island’s two casinos might end up with a criminal record for doing the same on their phones.
The House has not scheduled a floor vote on Costantino’s bill yet.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)A federal judge extended a temporary legal block, preventing Idaho from enforcing a new law that would block people in prisons from accessing state-funded gender-affirming health care.
Judge David Nye last week extended a preliminary injunction blocking Idaho from enforcing the 2024 state law for all people in Idaho prisons diagnosed with gender dysphoria and receiving hormone therapy. 
The Idaho Legislature in 2024 passed the law through House Bill 668. Nye has blocked the law from being enforced against people in Idaho prisons in response to a lawsuit brought by ACLU of Idaho.
Around 60 to 70 patients in Idaho Department of Correction custody have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to documents released in the lawsuit last year. 
Idaho’s law “clearly violates Idahoans’ Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by denying access to standard, life-saving health care,” ACLU of Idaho Legal Director Paul Southwick told the Idaho Capital Sun in a statement. “Everyone deserves bodily autonomy and access to necessary medical care, regardless of their gender or incarceration status.”
The judicial blocks only last 90 days under limits by federal law. Boise State Public Radio first reported on the extended legal block. 
The Idaho Attorney General’s Office could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Separately, a federal judge recently blocked federal prisons from enforcing an executive order by President Donald Trump that would’ve blocked gender-affirming care for people incarcerated in federal prison who have gender dysphoria, Bloomberg Law reported.

,DC,2025-06-03 18:03:00+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump wants Congress to slash $9.4B in spending now, defund NPR and PBS",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-wants-congress-slash-94b-spending-now-defund-npr-and-pbs,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration plans to send its first spending cuts request to Congress on Tuesday, asking lawmakers to swiftly eliminate $9.4 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and various foreign aid programs.The request for what are called rescissions allows the White House budget office to legally freeze spending on those accounts for 45 days while the Republican-controlled Congress debates whether to approve the recommendation in full or in part, or to ignore it.The proposal calls on lawmakers to eliminate $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service. That means NPR and PBS would lose their already approved federal allocations, if the request is approved by Congress.President Donald Trump issued an executive order in May seeking to block the Corporation for Public Broadcasting from providing funding for NPR and PBS, leading to two separate lawsuits citing First Amendment concerns.In the rescissions request, Trump wants to cut $8.3 billion from foreign aid programs, including the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, a global initiative to combat HIV/AIDS, and the African Development Foundation.The proposal is the first of several that will seek to codify efforts undertaken by U.S. DOGE Service and billionaire Elon Musk before he left his official role as a special government employee.GOP leaders in Congress appear likely to hold floor votes on the request, which only needs a simple majority to pass the Senate, avoiding the need for Democratic support to get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster.But Trump could run into problems with centrist Republicans in each chamber, especially those on the Appropriations committees, which approved the funding in the first place.The GOP holds especially narrow majorities in Congress, requiring the support of nearly every one of the 220 Republicans in the House and the party’s 53 senators.Republican leaders may need to negotiate what exactly gets written into the rescissions bill if too many moderate Republicans raise objections to cutting off the funding.Details on proposed cutsA summary of the proposal shared with States Newsroom by the White House budget office says the funding cuts would affect programs that sought to reduce xenophobia in Venezuela; support electoral reforms and voter education in Kenya; fund voter identification in Haiti; provide electric buses in Rwanda; broadcast the longtime PBS children’s show “Sesame Street” in Iraq; and strengthen the resilience of LGBTQ global movements.The proposal would also cut off funding to Harvard University to conduct research models for peace and to New York University to analyze democracy field experiments in South Sudan, according to the OMB summary.PEPFAR would no longer have funding for circumcision, vasectomies, and condoms in Zambia, or for services for ""transgender people, sex workers and their clients and sexual networks"" in Nepal, according to the OMB summary.Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a vocal supporter of PEPFAR, said during a brief interview that he was told “that PEPFAR had some cuts, but that the basic core mission was continued.”Cassidy — chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee — said his staff was carefully reviewing the request and knows he cares “about this deeply.”The rescissions request, which asks lawmakers to claw back already approved funding, is different from the president’s budget request, which proposes spending levels for thousands of federal programs for the upcoming fiscal year.Both are merely proposals, since the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse in Article I, Section 9, Clause 7.Timing on Senate floor vote unclearSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Monday that lawmakers in that chamber will begin reviewing the rescissions request this month, but didn’t detail exactly when he’d hold a floor vote. ""Another item high on our list to begin work on in June is a rescissions package the White House intends to send Congress this week,” Thune said. “The administration has identified a number of wasteful uses of taxpayer dollars and we will be taking up this package and eliminating this waste. We'll make that a priority.""Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement released Monday that “Trump is looking to go after PBS and NPR to settle political scores and muzzle the free press, while undermining foreign assistance programs that push back on China’s malign influence, save lives, and address other bipartisan priorities.”“If Republicans choose to go along with this rescission package, they will follow Trump at their peril,” Schumer and Murray wrote. “The power of the purse is one of Congress’s most fundamental Constitutional responsibilities. Democrats will not allow Republicans to play games with the budget.”Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy said during a brief interview Tuesday that he plans to ""carefully"" evaluate the rescissions request.West Virginia GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said Tuesday that she would go over the proposals once it officially arrives from the White House to determine whether she can support moving it across the floor.“It could be a fight. It could not be a fight,” Capito said. “We just don't know.”The House Freedom Caucus, a group of far-right members led by Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, posted Monday its members hope the administration sends additional rescissions requests as quickly as possible.“Passing this rescissions package will be an important demonstration of Congress’s willingness to deliver on DOGE and the Trump agenda,” the Freedom Caucus statement said. “While the Swamp will inevitably attempt to slow and kill these cuts, there is no excuse for a Republican House not to advance the first DOGE rescissions package the same week it is presented to Congress then quickly send it for passage in the Republican Senate so President Trump can sign it into law.”",,,,2025-06-03 14:11:46.396513
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-03 17:57:01+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont seeks last-minute cut to hospital tax plan,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/ct-hospital-tax-lamont/,Gov. Ned Lamont has asked legislators to cut a $375 million hospital tax increase by $90 million after industry officials raised concerns.,"Gov. Ned Lamont has asked legislators to scale back a $375 million hospital tax increase in the next state budget after industry officials raised concerns Tuesday morning.
This creates a technical challenge for legislators who entered Tuesday halfway through their formal adoption of a $55.8 billion budget for the next two fiscal years. The House approved that plan minutes after midnight, but the Senate hadn’t begun its debate by early Tuesday afternoon.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said shortly before noon that the administration now wants to impose a $285 million tax hike on hospitals in the 2026-27 fiscal year, $90 million less the hike lawmakers and the administration had negotiated last week.
Even though the budget calls for a $375 million tax hike on hospitals in the 2026-27 fiscal year, legislators could revise that number without altering the budget bill pending before the Senate or sending that measure back to the House for reconsideration.
“We are trying to reassure them that we absolutely want to help everybody,” Lamont’s budget director, Office of Policy and Management Secretary Jeffrey Beckham, said earlier Tuesday shortly after the governor had met with representatives of the Connecticut Hospital Association. “We want there to be net winners here.”
Though Lamont initiated talks of a hospital tax hike back in February, he sought to increase resources both for the state and the industry,
Since 2011, Connecticut has levied a provider tax that collects hundreds of millions annually from hospitals then redistributes those funds, plus more, back to the industry. Those return payments technically count as public health care spending and help Connecticut qualify for federal Medicaid grants, ensuring the state comes out ahead as well.
This unusual back-and-forth arrangement is employed by most states and has been encouraged by federal policymakers for years. But its future is uncertain now that Congress is seeking to make unprecedented federal budget cuts, hoping to slash $880 billion over the next 10 years, with most of those reductions coming from Medicaid.
Still, Connecticut officials said the wisest course was to seek one more increase before Washington potentially caps this program or orders reductions.
But industry officials discussed a different problem Tuesday with the governor.
Would federal Medicaid officials, who must sign off on all state provider tax arrangements, nix a $375 million tax hike even if Congress doesn’t alter the program? The hospital association said it fears the increase built into the new state budget would push the overall level permitted by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
“We appreciate the administration’s commitment to adjusting the level of the tax when considering these federal payment limitations,” the association wrote in a statement.
Hospital officials remain somewhat wary about the provider tax because of its history.
Though it began in 2011 as a tax in name only, designed chiefly to secure more aid from Washington, it evolved between 2012 and 2017 into something else.
Then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and the legislature steadily altered it, requiring hospitals to pay more while sending fewer dollars back to the industry. By 2015, hospitals, which were losing hundreds of millions of dollars, sued the state in federal court, charging it was violating Medicaid rules.
Lamont settled that lawsuit when his administration began in January 2019 and agreed on a plan to gradually restore the provider tax to its original purpose.
Still, Republican legislators said this week that Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the House and Senate majority have been sloppy in crafting a new state budget that spends excessively. House GOP leader Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford said Tuesday the latest hospital tax conflict is further evidence of this.
“That is pretty troubling, that we have a substantial partner in the state of Connecticut providing health care, and they are scurrying to the Capitol to try to protect their industry because the budget was passed without their input,” he said. 
State officials had negotiated the tax hike with the industry. But the association noted early Monday that they never were showed details on how the tax hike would impact specific hospitals.
Still, even if legislators agree to scale back the hospital tax, that doesn’t necessarily trigger a deficit in the new state budget.
The Lamont administration and legislative leaders were intentionally conservative in their revenue projections. Even when they boosted the hospital tax increase from $140 million to $375 million, they didn’t raise their projections for additional Medicaid revenues from Washington, keeping them at the $94 million Lamont offered back in February.
“The [estimate] that’s laid out in the budget is kind of a placeholder,” Beckham said.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Tuesday he was optimistic that all sides would strike a compromise before the legislative session closes Wednesday at midnight.
The speaker said there still are bills that would be called that could carry a hospital tax-related amendment.
“We’ll talk about it with the governor,” he said.

What to know.","A significant piece of housing legislation, House Bill 5002, has been one of the most contentious bills of the session. The measure takes on zoning, homelessness and fair rent commissions, among other things.
The legislation was debated for hours in both the House and the Senate, before passing each chamber with narrow margins. Gov. Ned Lamont plans to sign the bill into law.
The bill aims to address Connecticut’s housing crisis. For years, the state hasn’t built enough housing, particularly multifamily housing, and now lacks tens of thousands of units. This has resulted in a constrained market, according to housing experts.
Here’s what you need to know about the bill.
Does it change my town’s zoning?
In short, it could.
Most of the proposals are opt-in, meaning that towns have a choice and there isn’t anything that forces them to take certain actions. But some state funding is prioritized based on whether towns decide to participate, which lawmakers say incentivizes the towns to change their zoning.
One piece of the bill known as “Towns Take the Lead” divides housing need among towns based on regional need and assigns each town a set number of units to plan and zone for. That means every five years, towns will have a certain number of units they need to plan for, and some of those units will have to be for families or set aside for certain income levels.
Another change to watch for is Lamont’s proposal to allow towns to establish “priority housing development zones” that set a minimum density of four units per acre for single-family housing, six for duplexes or townhouses and 10 for multi-family housing.
The zones allow this type of development “as of right,” or without a hearing before the local planning and zoning board. Towns that adopt these zones have easier pathways to temporary reprieves to a decades-old housing law known as 8-30g.
The housing law allows developers to sue towns if their affordable housing proposals are denied, unless it’s for a health or safety reason. Towns can get temporary pauses under the law by showing they’re making progress toward increasing their designated affordable housing. 
If towns establish the housing zones under the new law, they can more easily be exempted from the developer lawsuits.
Will there be more housing options near public transit?
There could be if your town opts into a proposal known as “Work, Live, Ride,” It will also likely change the number of parking lots built in your town.
Work, Live, Ride aims to get towns to increase housing supply near train and bus stations by prioritizing certain infrastructure funding for towns that establish “transit-oriented districts,” where certain development is allowed without a hearing before a planning and zoning commission.
The bill, known as Work, Live, Ride, aims to increase the housing stock and encourage people to use public transportation, which advocates say is good for the environment.
The bill bans minimum off-street parking requirements for certain residential developments. This allows developers to cut down on building costs by not adding as many parking spaces.
Will this help the homeless population?
Advocates say it will.
H.B. 5002 includes a couple of measures to help the unhoused population. It bans towns from using so-called “hostile architecture” on public property. Hostile architecture is an urban design architecture in which certain public structures are designed to discourage behaviors such as sleeping or lying down in public. It often comes in the form of spiked surfaces under bridges, narrow benches or rocks strewn across grassy areas.
Homelessness has been increasing over the past few years in Connecticut, and as shelters reach capacity, more people are forced to stay outside.
What else might change in my town?
There are 32 more towns that will be required to create fair rent commissions.
The bill mandates that any town with a population of 15,000 or more establish a commission, which are local bodies that can make legally binding rulings on landlord-tenant issues such as complaints about unfair rent increases or housing conditions.
Previously, only towns with populations of 25,000 or more had to have fair rent commissions.
What makes this controversial?
While each measure had specific reasons for support or opposition, there were some themes across both. 
Supporters say that the state has to step in, that towns haven’t done enough in decades to make sure there’s enough housing to go around. They want to make it cheaper and easier to build housing and find other ways of keeping rents down.
Opponents fear a loss of local control and that towns that don’t opt in to specific measures will lose out on state grants they need, especially funding for bridges and roads.
Housing has long been a tough political issue in Connecticut, particularly when it comes to zoning reform. This was reflected in the tight margins in both the House and Senate votes, where moderate Democrats voted against the bill alongside Republicans.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0527_SR_HousingBill_292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 17:13:37.493134

(Photo by Meghan McIntyre/Virginia Mercury)A locker room incident at a Loudoun County high school has reignited controversy over student privacy, free speech, and school policy — now drawing scrutiny from Virginia’s top law enforcement office.
On Monday evening, the Office of the Virginia Attorney General confirmed that Loudoun County Public Schools launched an investigation against three male students who said they felt “uncomfortable” when a biologically female student changed clothes in a boys’ locker room and recorded the event.
The Attorney General’s office also cited “persistent” reports that LCPS and the school board have taken “adverse” and “potentially unlawful action” against parents, teachers, and public speakers.
Last month, Gov. Glenn Youngkin asked Attorney General Jason Miyares to investigate the claims to ensure the school division was upholding student privacy, dignity, and safety. The office described the school system’s actions as a “retaliatory Title IX investigation” targeting the three Stone Bridge High School students. 
The case has been referred to the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice for further review.
“The investigation reveals a disturbing misuse of authority by Loudoun County Public Schools, where students appear to have been targeted not for misconduct, but for expressing their discomfort for being forced to share a locker room with a member of the opposite sex,” Miyares said in a statement Monday evening. 
He added that Title IX was never meant to be used as a “weapon” against free speech or religious convictions.
“Every student in Virginia deserves the right to speak openly, think freely, and live according to their conscience without fear of retaliation,” he said. “Protecting those rights is not political — it’s foundational to who we are as Americans.”
LCPS’ Policy 8040 allows access to sex-separated facilities based on gender identity. However, the Attorney General’s Office said the school division appears to be punishing the students “who hold and express faith based views” instead of protecting their constitutional rights.
The school division has not commented on the investigation findings as of Tuesday morning.
However, LCPS did release a statement saying it was “deeply disheartening” to see an elected official — whom they did not name — rely on a WJLA report to publicly criticize the school division. LCPS defended its safety policies and commitment to student well-being and rejected the suggestion that schools are unsafe.
Loudoun County is still contending with the fallout of a 2021 bathroom assault case involving a male student who was found guilty of attacking two female students at different schools over six months. In the first incident, the male student was wearing a skirt when he assaulted a female student in a girls’ bathroom, although there’s no evidence he identified as female. 
In 2023, Loudoun County Public Schools launched a pilot program aimed at improving restroom privacy and safety. The initiative was designed to increase accessibility and provide students with the option of using multi-fixture, gender-specific restrooms or single-occupancy restrooms across all LCPS facilities.
Stone Bridge High School, where the locker room incident and investigation originated, was not part of that pilot program.

Photo by Morgan Trau/WEWSOhio educators held one last rally to urge the state Senate to fully fund public schools ahead of the chamber’s budget proposal.
Teaching at Jefferson Area High School in Ashtabula County was only supposed to be a temporary job while John Patterson finished graduate school.
“I discovered that teaching was my calling, and it was my mission,” said Patterson, a retired teacher of 29 years.
Like him, education is a passion for many teachers. Dozens made their way to the Ohio Statehouse to show their support for public school funding.
“It’s important for Ohio’s kids, it’s important for Ohio’s future, to get the school funding formula totally in place so there’s predictability and sustainability for all of our schools in every corner of the state,” Patterson told me.
The educators protested against the House’s passed budget, one that slashes hundreds of millions of dollars from the expected school spending.
  State Rep. John Patterson, D-Jefferson.
The program currently in place, the Cupp-Patterson Fair School Funding Plan (FSFP), was a bipartisan formula that Patterson helped create when he was a state representative.
“I spent a great deal of time with my dear friend (former Republican House Speaker) Robert Cupp to come together to put something out there for the legislature that is sustainable, that is transparent, and that is good for the future,” Patterson said.
But Speaker Matt Huffman says that funding level is “unsustainable.”
Now the future of the education budget is in Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino’s (R-Kirtland) hands.
“When we make a move in the budget for school systems, it impacts different systems in different ways,” Cirino said during the start of the budget process. “That’s what makes it complicated.”
Senate President Rob McColley (R-Napoleon) warned that the funding formula could actually decrease the amount of money for schools this year.
“There’s a chance that schools would see negative numbers as a result of that formula going into place,” he said.
According to lawmakers who work closely with schools, including state Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Concord, about 5% of districts would have less money this year than they did last year because they have fewer students enrolled.
“Are you fine potentially seeing negative numbers for some of these school districts?” McColley asked.
Patterson said that this makes the funding breakdown more equitable for public schools across the state.
With the House’s budget, every school would receive significantly less money than they planned for, which districts have already said could lead to staff and program cuts.
“Shop classes or (Future Farmers of America) classes or art, music and gym that aren’t necessarily required, those sorts of programs could get put on the chopping block,” Patterson continued.
The retired teacher is hoping that the Senators hear him before the budget amendments are announced this week.
“To help kids, that’s who I am,” Patterson said.

Collins to protect federal clean energy tax credits,AnnMarie Hilton,,,,,https://mainemorningstar.com/2025/06/03/maine-solar-companies-ask-sen-collins-to-protect-federal-clean-energy-tax-credits/,"Members of Maine’s solar and energy storage industry are asking U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to protect the clean energy tax credits that could be scaled back in the congressional spending bill.  “We realize that Congress has an important obligation to cut spending to balance the budget and reduce taxes,” wrote nearly 70 industry representatives in […]","Sal Miranda (C) and Tony Chang of the nonprofit GRID Alternatives install no-cost solar panels on the rooftop of a low-income household on October 19, 2023, in Pomona, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images).Members of Maine’s solar and energy storage industry are asking U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to protect the clean energy tax credits that could be scaled back in the congressional spending bill. 
“We realize that Congress has an important obligation to cut spending to balance the budget and reduce taxes,” wrote nearly 70 industry representatives in a letter Collins, who serves as Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “However, cutting solar tax credits would be counterproductive.” 
The spending bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House of Representatives late last month seeks to roll back the clean energy tax credits created in the Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The bill has been sent to the Senate, where it will likely face changes. President Donald Trump, who late last week released a more detailed version of his spending proposal, has said he backs the House version of the “big, beautiful bill.”
The letter from Maine’s solar industry cites three credits in particular they would like Collins to protect. The incentives specifically support manufacturing and the deployment of solar panels. Manufacturing credits attract investment, the letter argues, so removing those would “pull the rug out from under” solar companies in the U.S, such as the 62 currently operating in Maine.
Collins’ office did not provide comment by the time of publication.
Additionally, industry leaders pointed to recent studies that found clean energy tax credits could lower electricity bills, while repealing them could increase energy costs for ratepayers. 
Electricity prices in Maine have increased in recent years, in part due to the state’s reliance on natural gas, which has seen price swings from global events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
South Portland-based ReVision Energy often sees customers who install solar panels with hopes of lowering their energy bills, said Lindsay Bourgoine, director of policy and government affairs.
In recent years, those customers have been able to take advantage of the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which covers 30% of the costs of qualified new clean energy equipment installed on a residential property. While that credit was designed to run through 2032, and then gradually decrease after, the House budget plan would move up that expiration date to 2026. 
Though interested homeowners are cautioned about the potential loss of those credits, Bourgoine said solar is still a wise investment — even if initial costs go up.
With electricity demand expected to double in Maine by 2050, industry leaders outlined for Collins why solar is the fastest and least expensive way to add energy to the grid. A 2024 report from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shows that solar accounted for more than 80% of the new capacity installed nationwide that year. 
“If the solar and storage tax credits are reduced or eliminated, it would be devastating to the solar industry, which would cause a ripple effect of negative consequences for Maine and our country,” the industry representatives wrote in the letter.

In an interview, she shares her reflections following the historic events of the past few days that showed the world her hometown's contributions and potential.","It all started with a question: Why didn’t Clarksdale, the Mississippi Delta city where “Sinners,” one of the biggest motion pictures in the world right now, is set, have a theater where local people could watch the movie that featured their hometown?
That question inspired an idea: What if Warner Brothers, the studio that produced the film, brought a special screening to the town?
That idea inspired action: A community activist posted an online petition for the major studio to screen the movie in Clarksdale. Within hours, thousands of people had signed.
That question, that idea and that action inspired Aallyah Wright, a journalist for the nonprofit newsroom Capital B and Clarksdale native, to write a story about it. Her story quickly went viral and captured the attention of Warner Brothers and “Sinners” director Ryan Coogler.
The rest, as we can say literally in this case, was history. That series of events brought about a few days that Clarksdale will never forget.
Last week, Coogler, the film’s composer Ludwig Göransson, actor Miles Canton and others who worked on the film attended a special screening at the Clarksdale Civic Auditorium. Hundreds of locals packed the room, watched the film and stayed for a Q&A with the big names in attendance.
Fittingly, the moderator of the post-screening panel was Aallyah. She led a profound conversation that got Coogler and others talking very emotionally about Clarksdale and Mississippi. True to her life’s work, she focused the discussion on the ideas, concerns and experiences of people in the local community.
After Hollywood left town and things settled down, I caught up with Aallyah about how she was feeling about it all. I’m beyond proud to share that Aallyah is a former colleague and friend. Before she started changing lives across America as a journalist at Capital B, she was changing lives across Mississippi as a journalist at Mississippi Today.
Here’s our conversation, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Mississippi Today: I know things have been so crazy, but what have these past few days really been like for you?
 Aallyah: I think I’m still processing all of it. It just feels so wild that this has actually happened. I mean, it’s been super emotional for me, too, because folks have all of these misconceptions, perceptions and narratives they want to share about the people in Mississippi and the state as a whole. And we all know a lot of negative narratives don’t necessarily tell the holistic story of people there.
I just think it’s been super rewarding for Clarkdale to be in this spotlight, not just because of the movie but for people to see (the city) in all its glory and beauty. It’s been really important to me to amplify the people who have always been on the ground doing this work for years, some folks even decades. I think that it was just such a heartwarming moment that I couldn’t have imagined to happen in this way. And for me to be a part of that is just so profound, and I’m so proud. I’m just so happy that Mississippi is in the spotlight for something that’s so beautiful. Yeah. And pure and centered on the collective organizing of its people. So yeah, I love that.
Can you give me a sense of what this has been like for Clarksdale from your perspective as a native of the city? You know that place as well as anyone. What has all this meant for the city?
I  go back to Clarksdale often because my family is still there. Of course, I’m always doing reporting and stuff. But honestly, this time and trip home felt so different. There was this renewed sense of energy, purpose, hope and inspiration. I was emotional, I’m not gonna lie. It felt like the tide was changing, and I think it’s because a lot of the young folks are now stepping up in the spirit of our ancestors and people who were part of these instrumental movements. We all know young folks have been at the forefront of leading that charge, and I think that’s the connection with seeing that and why it was so meaningful for me.
Even though there were some negative comments and people saying that this wouldn’t work, it proved a lot of those folks wrong. Now people are just trying to figure out how to build on this momentum. Could we do a cultural festival every year? Could this become an annual thing? I know folks are figuring out how to do a Clarksdale Day event on Labor Day weekend. That can be really cool. People are having conversations about how to build up a creative arts economy there, especially around Blues tourism. How can we allow these folks who are the musicians and creators to benefit from this profitable economy? There are a lot of these different festivals, but a lot of that isn’t created by folks who actually live there. So I think there’s a lot of different questions people are asking in terms of what they can do to not only build on this momentum and sustain this arts and culture, but also create financial stability for folks.
There’s a lot of good things happening in Clarksdale. They just renovated J’s Grocery, the only Black-owned supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood. People should check out Griot Arts. They’re working to renovate the Paramount Theater, which was once a segregated theater in downtown Clarksdale. So there’s a lot of different things that are happening, and people are just trying to figure out what partnerships and collaborations need to happen to create that financial stability, job security and creative arts economy piece.
I want to ask you about those negative comments. Of course there are naysayers who have questioned why anyone spent time on this for Mississippi’s sake. A lot of people love hating on Mississippi, they’ve loved hating on Clarksdale and the Delta these past few days. What do you say to them now, after helping do this amazing thing for the city and the state and helping get the spotlight on this place?
 To be honest with you, I don’t care about the naysayers. I care about the people of Clarksdale, the people of the Delta, the people of Mississippi, and whether or not they trust me to tell the authentic lived experiences and the authentic truths of what’s happening in these communities.
One thing that I would do is challenge folks outside of Mississippi to come to Mississippi, explore the history, talk to the people, sit in these places where these things are happening. A lot of times people will go online who have never even set foot in Mississippi and are taking from these narratives or histories that are steeped in the 1930s or like pre-Civil Rights Movement and think that Mississippi has not progressed in any sense. People have a lot of ignorant comments, and Mississippi is in the news often for very bad and valid reasons. But every single place has its challenges. Mississippi is not the only place with these things that are going on. Mississippi is just always in the spotlight for it because of a very troubling and dark history, right? But again, I challenge people to actually talk to folks there, to actually go there and actually see the progress that Mississippi has made outside of these clickbait headlines that they’re always reading.
So much of the conversation these past few days has been focused on what more needs to be done for communities like Clarksdale. These places are contributing so much to the world, and they’re not getting a ton of support in return. At Capital B, you’ve covered this far beyond just Clarksdale or Mississippi. From your perspective, what needs to be done? 
That’s a tough question to answer.  I can say definitively that I feel like everyone has a part to play. Whether you’re a journalist, a schoolteacher in the Mississippi Delta or elsewhere, a local business owner, you work at a chamber of commerce or tourism office, maybe you’re in the state legislature or even work in the federal government, everyone has a part to play to ensure these places have the resources and access they need to thrive.
Too often people feel like regular, everyday people can’t make change or they can’t make some sort of impact. But I’d just like to suggest people to think about the simple things that you can do to support your community. Sometimes it’s just going to the local coffee shop, like in Clarksdale, for example, going to Meraki to purchase some coffee that goes back into the youth nonprofit of Griot Arts. That’s something very simple that you could do to support the work that they’re doing with workforce development. Or maybe it’s just showing up to a community event to learn about what Higher Purpose Hub is doing for economic development and entrepreneurs in the Mississippi Delta.
So it’s how can folks just simply think about what they can do to support what’s going on in their community? How can you vote folks into office who you think could make some important changes? We know that when it comes to folks showing out and going to the polls, it’s not always high voter turnout, so how can you activate people to go to the polls? You know what I mean? All of these things have to work together if we want these places to continue to thrive and not continue to die out. And so without trying to point the blame at any particular person, industry or institution, I just think that we all have a part to play in moving the needle forward.
With this major thing still so fresh on your mind, what would you tell young journalists or really anyone about the potential and power of the work we do?
 Some folks put emphasis on the awards, the accolades and the impact, which could mean a lot of different things. But it’s really important to keep your ear to the ground and be in community with the community. The reason this came about was because of the relationships I’ve cultivated with the people of Clarksdale, not just being a native of Clarkdale. It’s listening and being observant and utilizing my power to amplify voices often overlooked or dismissed. I always have the mindset of community first. I would just charge young folks, people who really want to make a difference, just do that. Learn all that. You can learn so much about the people, the place by just listening and being present. A lot of the work that I’ve done is just showing up at community meetings and going to events and reaching out to folks to have a coffee in person or virtual, just doing all of the things that don’t necessarily manifest in a story right away, but really pouring into folks and cultivating those relationships. You’ll get the impact, you’ll get the awards because it’ll show in the reporting that you do when you do a lot of that groundwork.
Last question for you. I know it wasn’t just one or two people who made all this happen, but it was a coalition of a lot of different people doing a lot of different things. I want to make space for you to shout out those people if you’re willing.
Oh yeah, for sure.  I would shout out Dave Houston and Jaleesa Collins, who were two of the Clarksdale natives who basically threw out the idea like, “Hey, we should have a screening.” Tyler Yarbrough, of course, who then jumped on that and did this open letter to invite the casting crew down. You have folks like Yasmine Malone who’s been part of the planning committee. Jasmine Williams of ‘Sipp Talk Media and her team. You have folks like Justin Hardiman, the phenomenal photographer out of Jackson, Mississippi. A lot of Clarksdale folks like Mark Webb, who’s a pastor, and Christopher Coleman, who works for the city. Tim Lampkin, who was also a part of the planning, with Higher Purpose Hub. Rebekah Pleasant-Patterson with Griot Arts, Storyworks Theater. There was a huge steering committee of folks that made sure, from idea to execution, that this was able to happen. So many people ended up sponsoring the events. 
Honestly, I also want to shout out Ryan Coogler, the cast, the crew and Warner Brothers because they didn’t have to decide to act on this thing that we did. They could have just seen it and moved on, but they really appreciated the invitation and really wanted to come down and then just learn and soak up the history and be in community with Clarksdale, the Delta and all of those who came. I gotta say that if I missed anybody, charge it to my head and not my heart. Those are just the top people that come to mind.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/02231339/9D9A0396-2.jpg,,,2025-06-03 14:11:46.396513

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)State officials are forming a new nonprofit to help maximize local tourism and economic development for the state from the 2026 World Cup, which includes matches at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts.
Ocean State 2026 will be led by Rhode Island Commerce Secretary Liz Tanner, who is stepping down from her cabinet position to spearhead the efforts of the new nonprofit. Rhode Island General Treasurer James Diossa will serve as chair of the nonprofit board of directors.
The preparations come a year before an estimated 1 million international soccer fans are expected to travel through the Providence metro area during the seven World Cup matches hosted at Gillette, from June 13 to July 9. The Boston-area stadium is one of 16 host cities for the three-country, 48-match tournament, which spans North America.
The Massachusetts matches are expected to generate more than $330 million in local economic impact, according to Gov. Dan McKee’s office.
Ocean State 2026 will lead business sponsorship efforts on tournament-related activities in Rhode Island while serving as a central organizer between state and local agencies, chambers of commerce, tourism bureaus and the FIFA World Cup Boston host committee before, during and after the tournament.
“Next year’s international soccer matches at Gillette Stadium will bring thousands of tourists, spending millions of dollars in our cities and towns,” Diossa said in a statement. “It truly offers an unprecedented opportunity to showcase our state while maximizing economic impact. This is bigger than soccer; it’s about investing in our state’s future and ensuring every community gets to benefit.”

While Diossa will remain in his elected general officer role, Tanner is leaving her $238,600-a-year appointed job as Commerce secretary, which she has held since June 2022. 
Tanner in a statement said she looked forward to continuing to serve the state in her new role, which she called a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”
Tanner’s career in state government dates back to 2015, when she began working in client services for Commerce. From 2017 to 2022, she led the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation, overseeing state financial services, cannabis regulation, building code and compliance and the Office of the State Fire Marshal, alongside a variety of professional licenses.
During her three years as Commerce secretary, she oversaw expansion of broadband infrastructure through a $100 million federal grant program, alongside small business supports, including those to aid business owners affected by the Washington Bridge closure and demolition.
Her last day as Commerce secretary will be July 4. An interim secretary will be named by that time, McKee’s office said. 
Information about the search and appointment for a new, permanent Commerce secretary was not immediately available. Matt Touchette, a spokesperson for Commerce, declined to share Tanner’s new salary with Ocean State 2026, noting that the nonprofit does not rely on state funding.

The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear an appeal on a lawsuit led by Illinois Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Bost challenging Illinois’ mail-in voting law.

Bost and a pair of Illinois primary delegates for President Donald Trump sued the Illinois State Board of Elections in 2022, arguing that the state’s law allowing mail-in ballots to be counted after Election Day violates the federal law establishing an “Election Day.” Both a lower federal trial court and federal appeals court have ruled Bost lacked standing to sue.

The Supreme Court said its ruling will focus on whether Bost, of Murphysboro, in his role as a political candidate has legal grounds to sue over a state’s election law, rather than if Illinois’ mail-in voting law is legal, because the appeal challenges lower court rulings that Bost did not legal grounds to sue.

A favorable ruling for Bost by the Supreme Court could force lower courts to issue a ruling about Illinois’ law.

“With the American people’s confidence in our elections at a discouraging low point, it’s more important than ever we work to restore their trust,” Bost said in a statement. “I believe a big part of that effort is ensuring all votes are tallied by Election Day, not days or weeks later. I am thankful the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear my appeal of Illinois’ election law.”

It’s not clear when the nation’s high court will hear Bost’s case. The court is scheduled to begin hearing oral arguments in October.

Under Illinois law, ballots postmarked by Election Day can be counted as late as 14 days after the election as they arrive at local election offices. Bost’s case argues this violates the federal law establishing Election Day by allowing votes to arrive and be counted for two weeks after the polls close.

After the unfavorable lower court rulings, Judicial Watch kept the fight going to the U.S. Supreme Court after appealing in November. The conservative legal group cited conflicting rulings on mail-in voting in other states and said Bost’s case is “an ideal vehicle” for the nation’s high court to decide whether ballots can be counted after Election Day.

The filing cited numerous cases from 2020 challenging election laws and outcomes, some of which Judicial Watch was a part of, in efforts to block the counting of mail-in ballots.

“It is an injustice that the courts would deny a federal candidate the ability to challenge an election provision that could lead to illegal votes being cast and counted for two weeks after Election Day,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement.

Judicial Watch argues costs for campaigns to monitor ballot counting beyond Election Day constitute harm to candidates for public office that must be addressed by the court. But the Illinois State Board of Elections via the attorney general’s office argued Judicial Watch fails to show Bost negatively suffered because of Illinois’ law, and Bost’s case would not be the right case for the court to use to review mail-in voting laws.

“Petitioners have never advanced any allegations that Illinois’s ballot receipt deadline might materially impact their likelihood of prevailing in any election,” the board argued.

In a response filing to the board’s request for the court to dismiss the case, Judicial Watch argued the Board of Elections has warned ahead of elections that apparent leads in vote totals can change as late-arriving ballots are counted, meaning election results can change negatively for Bost.

But the State Board of Elections argued Illinois’ mail-in voting law doesn’t directly regulate candidates.

“Illinois’s ballot receipt deadline does not regulate petitioners directly as political candidates; it simply recognizes the reality that ballots cast by mail may be delayed,” the board argued.

Winning elections has not been a problem for Bost. He has represented the 12th Congressional District in southern Illinois since 2015 and was reelected in 2024 with nearly 75% of the vote. His district did change slightly in redistricting after the 2020 census.

Judicial Watch said it worried “illegal votes could diminish his margin of victory” and make it appear that he is growing more unpopular with his constituents. The organization also argued Bost filed this case to preemptively correct perceived issues with the vote by mail law.

Republicans in Illinois and at the national level embraced mail-in voting in the 2024 election cycle after pushing back against it in recent years. The Illinois Republican Party joined the Republican National Committee’s “bank your vote” initiative, which encouraged reliable Republican voters to vote early or by mail so campaign resources could be focused on turning out people who were on the fence about voting or who were undecided.

Philip Moran and his son Alan have each been arrested and charged with orchestrating a scheme to cover up a crime, according to the Sun Herald.
A grand jury indicted Philip Moran, 64, and Alan Moran, 37, each on one count of bribery of a witness and one count of conspiracy. 
The arrests come six months after police arrested two teens for bribing a witness in a stalking case against Alan Moran, a former Diamondhead councilman. 
The teens were acting at the direction of the Morans, police say.
Waveland police worked with FBI agents to identify the Morans as being involved in an offer to pay $20,000 to a teen employee at Lowe’s to drop his stalking case against Alan Moran. The Morans allegedly recruited the teens to offer the money to the teen Moran had been stalking.
The arrests come one week before Alan Moran’s June 6 scheduled release from the Hancock County jail. Alan Moran has been serving a sentence for violating his probation in another case as a result of his stalking arrest.
That case is related to his misdemeanor conviction of contributing to the delinquency of a minor for buying beer for a teen on Valentine’s Day in 2022. In the same case, he was convicted of child exploitation for enticing a teen to come to him for sex.

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois’ legislative session concluded without passage of a Native American K-12 school mascot ban, but another issue sought by Natives will make its way to the governor.

Despite desire from Native Americans in Illinois, the ban on Native imagery for mascots in K-12 schools stalled in the Senate after it made its way out of the House.

House Bill 1237’s Senate sponsor, Sen. Suzy Glowiak Hilton, D-Western Springs, said after the bill missed a deadline earlier this session, she was still gathering a consensus from other legislators. But she said many of the concerns she heard about the measure stemmed from the costs associated with schools changing mascots.

“We will continue conversations about it and see what we can do with helping them pass it,” Glowiak Hilton said when the bill missed its mid-May deadline.

Native American advocates told Capitol News Illinois earlier this year about the importance of improving Native imagery.

“Our identity has been frozen in time, and it’s going to stay frozen in time as long as we’re portrayed as mascots and things of the past,” said Matt Beaudet, a citizen of the Montauk Tribe of Indians who was in Springfield to advocate for the bill’s passage.

Andrew Johnson, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and executive director of the Native American Chamber of Commerce of Illinois, said how natives are often portrayed as mascots in school logos has a detrimental effect of “costuming.”

“It really is not a sense of honor there,” he said. “It is not a sense of history. In fact, it’s a perversion of history to think that these mascots are maintaining any kind of that memory of Native people.”

Ho-Chunk Nation conserving land in Illinois

A separate bill related to Native interests did make it through both Houses and awaits the governor’s signature.

House Bill 1605, originally sponsored by Rep. Maurice West, D-Rockford, would amend existing law so tribal nations can join land conservation agreements with land owners.

As land conservators, a tribal nation could maintain the land and have control over what happens to it. Originally, only nonprofits, the state or federal agencies could join land conservation agreements with landowners.

The Jo Daviess Conservation Foundation, a nonprofit in Jo Daviess county, brought the idea of land conservation forward to the Ho-Chunk Nation, which is located inside Wisconsin. The Ho-Chunk Nation was not available for comment.

The foundation owns land in the county that holds a cultural site significant to the Ho-Chunk Nation. The nonprofit owns and maintains multiple sites that are important to different tribal nations.

The foundation’s executive director, Steve Barg, along with a former employee, said they were originally interested in giving the land to the Ho-Chunk, but they said the nation found the idea impractical.

“They're not going to get in a car every week and drive down 4 hours … to care for these places,” Barg said. “That's just not feasible for them.”

There were also reportedly concerns that Illinoisans would not be receptive to the nation owning land there akin to some worries people had about the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation. The Ho-Chunk, like the Prairie Band Potawatomi, own casinos. However, neither nation has expressed any desire to open a casino in Illinois.

A conservation agreement offered a clearer path of collaboration, but the groups needed a law change to specifically allow tribal nations to execute one.

Barg said the Ho-Chunk and the Jo Daviess Conservation Foundation have been working together for 12 years.

The groups apparently wanted to go forward with a land conservation easement because, if the foundation didn’t exist one day, any provisions agreed to under the agreement would still have to be honored. It differentiates the agreement from a private contract they could have entered instead.

“We want to make sure that the purposes of protecting this land for conservation outlasts our own organization,” Barg said. “If our own organization were ever to merge with an organization or cease to exist, those conservation easements held on our land by other entities would still protect the mission under which we saw that these lands were preserved.”

State legislation headed to the Rhode Island Senate Wednesday would allow the owner to qualify for a sales tax waiver on construction materials. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Compared with the $270 million-plus price tag to redevelop downtown Providence’s most iconic skyscraper, a $4.6 million discount sounds inconsequential.
Yet developers and city leaders championing the long-awaited rebirth of the vacant “Superman” building as a mixed-income apartment building insist the small sales tax savings for construction materials is the “missing piece” of the complex financing puzzle for the project. 
A state sales tax waiver would add to a bounty of public incentives already offered to help owner High Rock Development close financing gaps on the complex and increasingly costly project, which has risen by at least $50 million in the last three years.  
Proponents appear to have persuaded at least one chamber of the Rhode Island General Assembly, with the Senate Committee on Finance on Monday advancing legislation to the floor intended to support the request.
The unanimous committee vote came within minutes, without discussion.
The full Senate is scheduled to vote Wednesday afternoon on the legislation sponsored by Sen. Jake Bissaillon, a Providence Democrat. 
Senate President Valarie Lawson has already signaled support, touting its promotion of “robust housing development across our state” in an emailed statement.
Across the rotunda in the House, a companion bill by fellow Providence Democrat Raymond Hull remains held for further study following an initial April 3 hearing. But House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi indicated the proposed amendment to the state’s Rebuild Rhode Island Tax Credit program is still on the table.
“This issue, should it be addressed, will likely be part of the budget discussions,” Shekarchi said in a statement.
The legislation itself does not mention the 26-story Industrial National Bank Building by name, nor its location at 111 Westminster St. The single paragraph addition tweaks a 2016 law to specify that the $15 million per-project cap on an existing state tax credit program does not apply to exemptions on sales and use taxes. But the grand plan to revitalize the long vacant skyscraper with 285 rental units, 20% of which would be income-restricted, is the most obvious — and so far the only — example of a development project that meets the requirements set out in the legislation.
Supporters for the proposal have made it clear that the Rebuild Rhode Island tax credit change is specifically meant to help Superman get off the ground.
“This legislation, together with existing programs at the local, state, and federal level, is the last piece of the puzzle towards getting this project back on the track to completion as was contemplated in 2022,” Nicholas Hemond, a lobbyist for High Rock, wrote in a letter to lawmakers. High Rock through a subsidiary known as High Rock Westminster bought the Art Deco building in 2008, according to city tax records.

–  Nicholas Hemond, lobbyist for High Rock Development LLC, owner of the Superman building in downtown Providence


His plea echoes the promises High Rock made to state and city lawmakers in 2022, securing $65 million worth of public financing, including $26 million from the state and $15 million from the city to cover an estimated $220 million redevelopment cost.
But three years later, the former bank building still sits empty, though dozens of demolition, mechanical and electrical permits have been pulled, according to the city permit portal.
Hemond in his letter cited inflationary pressures hiking costs for construction, which now stand at $270 million according to a fee calculation the owner submitted to the city in December 2024. 
High Rock has kicked in more cash, increasing its initial equity from $21 million to $52 million to cover initial construction, permit and architectural fees, and making sure the building is secured, Hemond wrote.
Letting the property also apply for an exemption on sales taxes on construction materials, despite already receiving $15 million in Rebuild Rhode Island tax credits, would “go a long way” to helping the project come to fruition, Hemond wrote.
No fiscal impact to state 
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley also backed the request, stressing the importance of reviving the vacant building for the city, and the state. And waiving the credit cap for sales tax exemptions, providing Rhode Island Commerce approves an application, doesn’t require dipping into state coffers, a key concern of lawmakers amid a projected $185 million budget deficit. 
“If this project were to never happen, the state wouldn’t get that sales tax revenue anyway,” Smiley told lawmakers during the May 20 committee hearing on the bill. 
The proposal also received written support from The Providence Foundation, BuildRI, Rhode Island Commerce and the local chapter of the Laborers’ International Union of North America.
However, Neena Savage, state tax administrator, called for clarity in definitions of “affordable housing” and “workforce housing” in a letter to lawmakers. Savage also cautioned that the proposal may have “unintended consequences, including fiscal impacts and uncertainties,” if the bill does not restrict sales and use tax exemptions to no more than 25% of total project costs, and keep tabs on total available funding in the state program. 
Changes unveiled just before the Senate Committee vote Monday afternoon address Savage’s second concern, while also requiring that purchases for which sales taxes are waived must be made by June 30, 2028.
Senate Finance Chairman Lou DiPalma in an interview said the deadline aims to protect taxpayers, noting the multiple delays that have plagued the Superman redevelopment.
“The longer this goes on, the higher the cost,” DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat said. “We need to hold them accountable for taxpayer money.”
Savage was not available to comment on the amended legislation.
Bill Fischer, a spokesperson for High Rock, did not respond to inquiries for comment about the recent changes to the bill. Asked for details about the timing of the proposal, and other incentives needed to finish raising the money for the project, Fischer referred back to Hemond’s written testimony to lawmakers.
Trust and transparency 
The lack of transparency was worrisome to Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat who opposed the original stack of public financing for the project in 2022. Morales was not as bothered by the sales tax exemption, noting it was not a direct taxpayer contribution.
But he remained skeptical of the developer’s promise to finally complete the project with this additional tax break.
“I am concerned this will not be the last time they come to us to ask for public subsidies,” Morales said in an interview. “It still remains unclear whether this subsidy will get them off the ground.”
He continued, “For a project of this size, I’d like to think more homework would have been done ahead of time.”
The Superman skyscraper got its nickname due to its resemblance to The Daily Planet newspaper building where Clark Kent worked in the 1950s TV show. The property has sat vacant since 2013, when Bank of America left.
The property overlooking Kennedy Plaza was valued at $13.5 million in 2025, down $500,000 from the prior year’s assessment, according to the city assessment database. A 30-year tax deal inked between the developer and the city of Providence in 2022 would save the developer $29.4 million in city property taxes over the next 30 years if the development is completed. The payment schedule assumes the regular payment of $500,000 in annual property taxes — undiscounted — through 2026, with discounts beginning in 2026 as the property value increases alongside its redevelopment.

(Madelyn Hanes/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun on Tuesday defended his sudden removal of alumni-elected Indiana University trustees and his contentious picks to replace them.
Braun previously cited nearing ends of terms for Vivian Winston, Donna Spears and Jill Maurer Burnett as why he wouldn’t oust them early. A month later, he turned that logic on its head.
“It’s so close to that being the case anyway,” he said of the three, who are all now listed as “former” trustees.
“You can’t believe the number of individuals that came forward wanting to be considered in those slots,” Braun continued in mid-morning comments to reporters. “So, with that kind of enthusiasm and the fact that it really didn’t make a lot of difference one way or the other, (I) did make the decision to go ahead and do it, so that we don’t even delay the few weeks that would be involved.”
But only Winston’s term was due to end this year, according to an archived “about” webpage. Spears was supposed to serve until 2026, and Maurer Burnett had until 2027.

Lawmakers gave Braun control over IU’s three alumni-appointed trustee spots via language slipped last-minute — and without opportunity for public comment — into the two-year budget. The body’s six other members were already gubernatorial appointees.
The oversight entity sets tuition rates, controls campus projects and approves budgets. At other public Hoosier institutions, alumni can offer direct or indirect input into trustee picks.
Pushback to new appointees
Braun tapped prominent and polarizing attorney Jim Bopp as trustee. He’s best known for waging legal battles to weaken campaign finance laws and restrict abortion access.
“You want somebody that’s going to really be respectful of the First Amendment, and it’s making it clear that it (IU) ought to be a place where all views are listened to,” Braun said. “… He’s a guy that’s been for it through thick and thin.”
Bopp’s term extends through June 2028.
Braun’s other replacements are Sage Steele, a sports anchor known for controversial comments on race and vaccines whose term also ends June 2028, and Indianapolis estate attorney Brian Eagle, whose term ends June 2026.
IU graduate and House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta denounced the flip-flop, predicting Bopp and Steele would harm academic freedom in Indiana.

“Not fulfilling a promise you previously made is par for the course with this administration – first property tax relief, now IU trustee appointments. Promises made, promises broken,” GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, said in a Tuesday statement.
“It’s not hard to imagine that our two new trustees who are well known for their successful work overturning a woman’s right to choose and work in the conservative media circuit, respectively, will have an agenda to limit the research questions that researchers and professors are allowed to pose,” he continued.
Braun also reappointed W. Quinn Buckner, the board’s current chair, to a fourth term lasting one year — despite a new three-term limit in Indiana Code.
“It clearly said it’s not retroactive,” Braun told reporters. He said Buckner is “aligned with” IU President Pamela Whitten and wants to do some needed “sprucing up.”
Braun said he wants Indiana’s public educational institutions to offer both “good value and degrees that have a market here in the state,” complimenting Purdue University’s longstanding tuition freeze.
Other schools are enacting freezes on recommendation from Braun and the Indiana Commission for Higher Education. They’re also smarting from 5% cuts in appropriations as the state struggles to cope with a dismal revenue forecast.
That, along with the prospect of the State Budget Agency withholding another 5% of allocated funds, has prompted Ivy Tech Community College to lay off more than 200 employees across the state.
“Ivy Tech is arguably, of the public institutions, maybe the one that is most important in this day and age,” Braun remarked.
The system usually enjoys favor among even the most anti-higher education Hoosier leaders and lawmakers for its low tuition and focus on workforce development.
But, Braun said, Ivy Tech “is part of the rest of public schools that we’re going to ask to find efficiencies. Once we get through this budget forecast — that forced us to do some things that you maybe wouldn’t have done otherwise — I’ll put the resources back where we’re getting the best results.”

But instead of planning Solly’s birthday party, his stepmother Charlene Zorn was back at the legislature this week pleading with lawmakers to raise the minimum age to buy tobacco and vaping products in North Carolina from 18 to 21.
Solly was just 15-year-old when he died from vaping in 2021. Zorn said her stepson went from being a healthy, athletic teen who was training for high school football, to one who suffered kidney failure and eventually had to be placed on a ventilator.
  Charlene Zorn says she lost her 15-year-old stepson Solomon Wynn to vaping. This week he would have turned 17. (Photo: Screengrab from NCGA video)
“When we lost Solomon, I vowed to make a difference in the lives of teenagers so no family would have to go through what my family’s experienced,” Zorn told reporters at a Tuesday press conference. “Over these last two years, I have realized that in addition to speaking with youth, the best way to honor Solomon’s memory is to advocate for change in North Carolina and to make this about every child in our state, not just Solomon.”
House Bill 430 and Senate Bill 318 — the “Protect Youth From Harms of Vaping & Nicotine Act” — would raise the legal age of sale for tobacco and vape products to 21 and require sellers to have a tobacco retail sales permit.
While the two bills have bipartisan sponsors, neither has moved since they were introduced in March. Sine both missed the legislature’s self-imposed “crossover deadline,” it will be a heavy lift to resurrect the legislation at this point in the session.
But Zorn came prepared Tuesday.
Joined by the bills’ sponsors, more than a dozen teenagers from Alamance, Duplin and Wake counties came ready to walk the halls of the North Carolina General Assembly and urge their representatives to protect youth from the addictive and dangerous health effects of vaping and nicotine use.
Macey Morris, a senior at Eastern Alamance High School, said lawmakers need to understand how many young people are becoming addicted because of the lack of state regulation.
“Vaping has completely changed our schools today. It’s not only in the bathrooms, but also in classrooms where you find distracted kids who are hiding vapes in their clothing and their backpacks,” said Morris. “It affects learning, it affects focus, and it deteriorates health.”
Morris said the practice may seem harmless at first, but she’s watched student athletes lose stamina and struggle to compete in their chosen sports because their lungs were damaged by a product many were told was safer than cigarettes.
  Rep. Donnie Loftis (R-Gaston) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Advocates say permitting or licensing the sale of vape and tobacco products would allow the state to know where tobacco products are being sold and improve merchant education efforts, while also allowing the state to inspect for responsible retail practices.
Some members of the National Federation of Independent Business owners raised concerns about a permit fee in the proposed legislation, but Rep. Donnie Loftis said that should not keep the bills bottled up in the Rules Committee.
“There was some concerns that $400 may be so detrimental to a business. I’m thinking if $400 is the difference between you staying open or closed, a child’s life is well worth more than $400 for your business,” said the Gaston County Republican.
  Sen. Gale Adcock (photo: ncleg.gov)
Loftis said the bill would also set the age for legal purchase for vaping and nicotine products at 21, the same age for alcohol sales.
North Carolina is currently one of just seven states that have not raised the federal minimum legal sales age of all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, from 18 to 21.
Senator Gale Adcock (D-Wake) said after three decades as a family nurse practitioner, she’s convinced her bill will provide teenagers with the structural supports needed to prevent nicotine abuse.
“To help them make better short-term choices until their own decision-making capacity can catch-up with their physical growth,” reasoned Adcock. “That is what this bill does. It gives our youth a fighting chance.”
Ninety-five percent of vaping and tobacco use begins before age 21, according to advocates. North Carolina currently ranks 6th in the nation for youth vaping.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gettyimages-1745312545-170667a.jpg,,,2025-06-03 13:17:48.030772

(Photo by Zach Sommers for Iowa Capital Dispatch)A federally funded health care center in central Iowa has terminated core care for its transgender patients for fear of losing federal funding, four sources have confirmed.
In a letter sent to transgender patients receiving hormone replacement therapy, and obtained by the Iowa Capital Dispatch, Primary Health Care stated in February it would no longer provide hormone replacement therapy care “(d)ue to a recent Executive Order restricting use of federal grant funds from being used for gender-affirming care.” PHC in the letter told patients that should the health center be “out of compliance” with the order, it would risk losing “critical” and “significant” funding.
A former PHC employee, who spoke with the Iowa Capital Dispatch on the condition of anonymity, said PHC’s executive team told employees the health center risked “losing millions of dollars in federal grant funding for the homeless support services” if it continued gender-affirming care. The Iowa Capital Dispatch granted anonymity because the former employee feared potential repercussions from PHC.
A transgender advocate and another person with knowledge of the change, both of whom spoke to Iowa Capital Dispatch on the condition they not be identified, also confirmed that PHC had ended gender-affirming care.
Primary Health Care is a federally qualified health center, which means it receives funding from the federal government through the Health Resources and Services Administration under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. FQHCs were created in the early 1990s to serve as safety net providers. They care for underserved populations. PHC is one of 14 in the state.
Representatives of Primary Health Care and Iowa Primary Care Association, which provides broad support for Iowa’s FQHCs, did not respond to repeated questions that were posed to executives, board members, and physicians during multiple weeks of outreach.
The former employee said staff at PHC were “begging” the executive team to figure out different funding methods for the clinic in order to keep providing gender-affirming care.
“The basis of Primary Health Care and the Project is the queer community … and how could we possibly continue to be that if we’re telling part of that population that (they) don’t belong (at PHC)?” the former employee said.
Only one other federally qualified health center in Iowa responded when asked whether other care centers were following PHC’s lead in terminating care for transgender patients. Chad Wolbers, chief executive officer at Crescent Community Health Center in Dubuque, said that’s not happening at his health centers. When asked if Crescent Community currently has transgender patients, Wolbers said, “Yes we do. We take care of all that present to us in need of care.”
Consulting firm cites confusion over executive orders
A principal with FQHC Associates, a consulting firm for FQHCs nationally, acknowledged the confusion over federally funded health care centers’ ability to provide gender-affirming care to patients. Steve Weinman pointed to two executive orders President Donald Trump signed in the early days of his administration.
One executive order deals with stopping transition care for children and teenagers through 18 years of age. The other executive order, which Trump signed the day he took office, is meant to “defend women’s rights” and “recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.” In doing so, the Trump administration takes aim at gender ideology and the “false claim” of being able to change one’s sex. Through that lens, the executive order directs agencies to “end the Federal funding of gender ideology” and that “Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.”
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told the Iowa Capital Dispatch that less than two weeks after the signing of that executive order, the Health Resources and Services Administration sent an email to its federal funds recipients that they must stop their programs related to “gender ideology” for “people aged 19 and younger.” Five days later, HRSA sent another email to tell recipients its previous “notification had been rescinded.” HHS told the Iowa Capital Dispatch that “Health centers continue to provide care to Americans who face challenges in accessing quality healthcare.”
When asked why PHC still moved to stop gender-affirming care when the federal agency told FQHCs to ignore its previous mandate, the former employee at PHC said that’s “the big question, and that’s what staff wanted to know. Why? Nothing is law…The only thing that we were being told is that they were scared to lose the federal funding that they had.

Lawmaker calls decision ‘deeply disappointing’

State Rep. Aime Wichtendahl, a Democrat of Hiawatha and the first transgender legislator elected to Iowa’s Legislature, said PHC’s decision to terminate hormone replacement therapy care is “deeply disappointing.”
She said “an executive order is not law. It is not force of law. And what the Trump administration is doing, withholding federal funds, is a violation of both the law and funds that Congress has appropriated.
“If the federal pressure has been removed, then they should immediately restore services and health care to trans patients. There is no justification for cutting off access to health care,” Wichtendahl said.
One patient who said she received hormone replacement therapy care at PHC’s University Avenue location said she felt “like all hell was breaking loose” when she learned about PHC’s decision. “It felt like the sanctuary that I had was kind of just crumbling beneath me. It was quite heart wrenching because I do love going to my doctor.” The patient requested to remain anonymous.
She said her provider at PHC was also emotional about the decision to terminate hormone replacement care. The former employee echoed that and said, “everyone seemed to be pretty emotional about the decision that had been made.” Not only was PHC stopping gender-affirming care, but the former employee claimed staff also had to remove or cross-out pronouns on their ID badges and business cards.
The messaging around PHC’s decision to end gender-affirming care was carefully managed, according to the former employee. The executive team at PHC handed staff a script with suggested responses to likely questions that patients or people wanting to establish care may ask. There were at least six potential questions and corresponding answers, according to a staff handout the Iowa Capital Dispatch reviewed.
PHC’s decision, made at the same time as Republican legislative efforts to roll back gender identity protections in the Iowa Civil Rights Act weighed heavily on both the former employee and the patient. “It’s such a common thing for trans people to not get ample HRT care, as well as HIV care. Not having good resources for that, it just really sucks,” said the patient.
Wichtendahl said now is the time for the transgender community to make its voices heard “and say you’re not taking away our health care.”
“We will make that demand that they restore those services,” she said.

CHICAGO — A bill that would have repealed licensing requirements for hair braiders in Illinois died in the final stretch of the legislative session after opponents voiced concerns about how deregulation could impact health, safety and equity for the profession.

The Hair Braiding Opportunity Act, House Bill 3356, would have amended the Barber, Cosmetology, Esthetics, Hair Braiding, and Nail Technology Act of 1985 to strike a 300-hour training requirement, $30 initial licensing fee and $5,000 penalty for practicing without a license for hair braiders.

Members of the Illinois Association of Hair Braiders, or IAOHB, the original advocates behind the 2011 rule that established a special license for braiders, said a repeal would have reversed hard-won strides for the profession.

“When you ‘X’ this license out, you undo the work that Black women have been doing to be recognized in the beauty industry,” said Tamekia Swint, a licensed hair braiding instructor and owner of nonprofit salon Styles 4 Kidz in Oak Park.

The bill needed one final vote of concurrence on proposed amendments to pass after it had unanimous support in the House and the Senate. House bill sponsor Rep. La Shawn Ford, D-Chicago, said he decided not to bring it to a vote after meeting with members of the IAOHB.

“The bill was actually held to get it right,” Ford said. “They’re organizing, and we’re going to listen.”

The bill’s proponents said hair braiding, as a protective form of hair styling and cultural practice for people of African descent, is widely practiced with or without a license. It’s a skill many people learn from an early age and develop throughout their lives, often making additional training unnecessary for those looking to braid hair professionally.

“We should not be charging or requiring people to go get licensure for something that they already know how to do,” said Sen. Chris Belt, D-Swansea, the Senate sponsor of the bill.

Belt served as co-chair of the Comprehensive Licensing Information to Minimize Barriers, or CLIMB, Task Force, which was established in partnership with the Institute for Justice Clinic on Entrepreneurship, or IJ Clinic, in 2022 to investigate onerous licensing requirements as a barrier to entry for 16 low- to moderate-income occupations.

The task force released a final report of its findings in November 2024, identifying hair braiding as an occupation that could benefit from deregulation.

“We can show that it’s way too expensive, it’s way too time-consuming, and there’s not necessarily a need for it, because folks practice safely,” said Noah Bazis of the IJ Clinic, who served as project manager for the CLIMB Task Force.

Disciplinary actions for hair braiding by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation are rare, and mostly unrelated to health risks or unsafe practices, Bazis said.

Bazis said cutting red tape would have benefitted the IDFPR by removing the administrative burden and costs of managing licenses for braiders.

“If you have an occupational license category, the fewer people you have involved in that license, the more administrative cost is going to go up, because you’re managing a much, much smaller group,” Bazis said. “It’s a state agency. They only have so many resources.”

The IDFPR received 97,677 license applications for the 16 occupations CLIMB analyzed from 2017 to 2022. Of those applications, hair braiders accounted for just 648, or an average of 108 applications per year.

Opponents worried, however, that deregulation would lead to increased risk of braiders practicing in ways that are unsafe.

“The integrity of (the industry) is compromised when you allow any and everybody to just be able to do it,” said Ashanti Johnson, a licensed cosmetologist and owner of These Hands Style salon in Oak Lawn.

Johnson is a fourth-generation hair braider who has practiced hair braiding since she was 12 years old. “My grandmother did hair in her kitchen. My great grandmother did hair. My mother did hair…For me it was just always a part of my coming of age,” Johnson said.

Still, Johnson decided to go to cosmetology school when she eventually wanted to pursue a career in hair styling, pivoting from her job as a math teacher of 10 years. The process involved training at an accredited cosmetology school, passing a certification exam and paying a $50 licensing fee to the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.

She said the decision to go back to school “opened up a wealth of knowledge” and has made her a more successful business owner.

“There's just a lot that being licensed teaches you about rapport, about business, about hair… I just feel it's very necessary,” Johnson said. “I use my knowledge that I learned in cosmetology school to do braiding in a healthy way for my clients.”

Bazis said there’s a middle ground when it comes to regulating low- to moderate-income occupations like hair braiding.

“Licensing is not the only way to regulate an occupation. It’s just the most expensive and most involved and most time-consuming way,” Bazis said.

Other options for regulation include certifications or registrations, which are much less costly and burdensome for both the applicant and the IDFPR.

Ford said he is now planning to hold a town hall about the issue with U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, offering proponents and opponents a chance to have their concerns heard. Members of the IAOHB said they hope further discussions will lead to compromise legislation that preserves the integrity of their licenses.

“As professionals, we take this industry very, very seriously,” said IAOHB President TyWanna Patrick. “We don’t want our license to be stripped away like it means nothing.”

Strickland joins veteran Athens Republican state Sen. Bill Cowsert as the two Republican attorney general candidates currently in the running for next year’s May primary.
So far, no Democratic candidate has announced a run to replace Republican Attorney General Chris Carr, who is stepping down to run for governor after serving as the state’s top prosecutor for nearly a decade. Georgia’s attorney general also serves as the legal adviser for the governor, state boards and agencies and represents the state in civil cases.
Strickland, an attorney, chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees bills dealing with litigation, courts and other judicial issues. He served in the state House from 2013 to 2017 before being elected to the Senate, where he represents Morgan County and sections of Henry, Walton and Newton counties.
In this year’s legislative session, Strickland sponsored a tax credit bill intended to save families money on child care expenses. Last year, Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law Strickland’s measure to streamline jail-based competency tests that determine if a person is legally able to stand trial.

Strickland described himself Tuesday as a right-wing politician who has a strong record of winning legislative seats despite strong opposition. He said that as attorney general he would defend the state against activist-funded lawsuits seeking to overturn GOP cultural policies. Strickland also highlighted his support for mental health reform.
Strickland said he would continue efforts under Carr to combat human trafficking and other organized crimes and flaunted GOP electoral and legislative wins.
“The best part is we didn’t just talk tough on the campaign trail,” Strickland said. “We win big elections. We came up here to the state Capitol and we fought for conservative policies and won conservative big policies here at the state Capitol. I’m proud of my record up here, things such as election integrity, the heartbeat bill, constitutional carry, mental health reform. I was able to come in and also fight against organized crime in our state.”
Strickland said he disagreed with some pushback from Democratic lawmakers that the Republican legislators in recent years have been rolling back some of the criminal justice reforms that began under former Republican Gov. Nathan Deal. Strickland said the recent focus in the Legislature has been on mental health resources to help people stay out of the criminal justice system.
“It is more affordable to help people get out of the system of crime and deal with mental health and get back into society,” Strickland said. “It’s great for the taxpayers. It’s also great for the people involved and the families involved.”
Still, he characterized himself as a conservative fighter dedicated to issues that could be likely to resonate with a conservative primary electorate.
“Our values are under siege from every direction. It’s not just about crime or corruption anymore—it’s DEI mandates in schools, gender ideology in girls’ sports, and prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law,” Strickland said. “We need an attorney general who won’t blink. That’s me.”

(Courtesy of Oleksandra Kirian, Kharkiv City Council)KHARKIV, Ukraine— It’s been three days since Yevhen Vasylenko has slept through the night, and a deep worry line has worn its way across his forehead.
A spokesperson for the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv’s Emergency Situations Department, Vasylenko says missile and drone attacks have awakened him each night. Two nights earlier, Russia’s biggest attack on the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv to date had left at least 12 dead and 90 injured. Here, just 23 miles from the Russian border, the attacks are more intense and frequent. More than 12,000 of the city’s buildings, 70% residential, have been destroyed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
“The attacks right now are almost every night,” Vasylenko says through a translator, describing combined attacks of both drones and rockets. “We are near the front line, so during all the years of the full-scale invasion we have had constant attacks.”
  When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, ballistic missiles struck Kharkiv’s central administrative building. Today, the building is no longer in use, but a banner quoting Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko encourages residents to “fight – you will win.” (Cecilia Nowell)
Standing outside one of the city’s fire stations, Vasylenko takes a final drag on his cigarette before gesturing for us to step inside as an air raid siren whistles through the mid-afternoon air, indicating an incoming ballistic missile. 
When those strikes come, Ukrainian first responders pull on their flak jackets and kevlar helmets, and head out to pull civilians from the rubble of buildings, extinguish fires and disarm mines. They do so aboard a fleet of emergency vehicles — including fire trucks donated from Germany; a specialized tow truck gifted by an American entrepreneur; and an ambulance sent from the City of Albuquerque.
In July 2023, Albuquerque formed a sister city relationship with the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, and soon began sending aid, including a decommissioned ambulance formerly used by Albuquerque’s Station 8, located in the foothills near the intersection of Indian School and Tramway.
“From the beginning, we’ve been dedicated partners with Kharkiv — including the donation of an ambulance to support their emergency services — and we will continue doing everything we can to lend a hand to our friends overseas who need our help now more than ever,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said in a statement.

The ambulance is a 2011 Ford F6G, a behemoth of a rescue vehicle. Albuquerque Fire Rescue Lt. Paramedic Brent Rohrig, of Station 8, recalls that the department purchased two such vehicles, which were specced out to be large enough for the tallest firefighter in the department, who stood over 7 feet tall. The department used the vehicles for a few years, but with only two in the fleet, many EMTs and paramedics didn’t have an opportunity to learn on them. When the city purchased new ambulances in 2015, it moved the 2011 models to reserves.
“This ambulance has already been in active service with the Emergency Situations Department’s Situation Center in Kharkiv City Council,” Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terehov said through a translator. “It was used to respond to emergency calls, to reach sites of explosions and to provide help in the most difficult conditions. It’s multifunctional, well-equipped and it truly saves lives.”
Albuquerque Fire Rescue has a legacy of donating emergency vehicles that are obsolete for the city’s needs, but still in good enough shape to be useful elsewhere, says Public Information Officer Lt. Jason Fejer. 
“We did nothing more than give it away,” he said of the ambulance donated to Kharkiv. In the past, Albuquerque has donated retired fire engines to Isleta Pueblo and the towns of Mesilla and Eagle’s Nest.

Albuquerque first began its sister city relationship with the city of Kharkiv at the urging of Northern New Mexico’s Sikh community. The religious community, which has roots in India but a large presence at the Hacienda de Guru Ram Das in Española, counted among the first to offer aid to Ukrainian cities impacted by the war. When Simran Singh, a member of Española’s Sikh community and a kundalini yoga teacher, approached the Albuquerque City Council about forming a sister city partnership with Kharkiv, he said the answer was an immediate yes.
“It’s such a beautiful testament to what this state stands for,” he said. “The ambulance is one outcome of a total community-to-community aid initiative.”
Although he’s grateful for all the support the United States has offered Ukraine, Kharkiv Mayor Terekhov says, “direct city-to-city contacts are among the fastest and most effective forms of support today — especially during wartime, when action needs to be taken not in theory, but immediately.”
He added that the relationship “provides not only vital resources but also a sense of solidarity — the knowledge that we are not alone,” noting that representatives from Albuquerque have visited “Kharkiv despite the ongoing shelling — a truly courageous gesture.”
At the moment, the Albuquerque ambulance is undergoing repairs to replace a few worn out parts. “A number of those parts are manufactured only in the United States, so we are waiting for them to arrive,” said Terekhov.
That’s not unusual for donated emergency vehicles, says spokesman Vasylenko, who notes that fire engines from the US and Europe are generally designed to attach to fire hydrants, which Ukraine does not use. The style of ambulances used in the United States were not common in Ukraine either before donated vehicles began arriving.
As tensions continue to escalate in Ukraine — with Russia launching some of its most intense strikes on Ukrainian cities amid ongoing peace talks — the ambulance may be more needed than ever.
“Once repairs are complete, the ambulance will return to duty — helping people in need,” said Terekhov.

(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)Early in-person voting in this year’s gubernatorial and Assembly primaries began Tuesday morning, one week ahead of the June 10 primary.
For the first time, this year’s primary early voting period will run for six days. Early polling centers are open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. Eligible voters can cast ballots at any early polling station in their county.
New Jersey’s 21 counties will stand up 168 early voting stations this year, up from 159 in last fall’s general election. The state reimburses counties’ early voting expenses for up to three, five, or 10 early polling sites, depending on county population.
Only two counties, Union and Hudson, are standing up early polling stations at their own expense. Union is set to launch 11 early voting locations, while Hudson is erecting a staggering 31.
It remains to be seen whether this year’s governor’s race — featuring 11 candidates across the two major parties — will draw the level of early in-person turnout observed during last year’s presidential races.
Nearly 1.2 million residents cast early in-person ballots during the state’s nine-day early voting period last November, shattering previous turnout records for the voting method and eclipsing the 841,138 mail ballots returned in that race. About 65% of registered voters cast ballots in that election, with early votes accounting for a little more than a quarter of total turnout.
Until 2024, mail ballots were the main method of pre-Election Day voting. Before then, in-person early voting struggled to attract large numbers of voters. The state first allowed the practice in November 2021.
This year’s early voting period will be longer than in previous years due to a bill Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law in March. That law extends the primary early voting period to six days, from three days in most years and five days in years with a presidential election.
Gubernatorial primaries will top this year’s ballots.
On the Democratic side, six candidates — Reps. Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, former Senate President Steve Sweeney, and New Jersey Education Association President Sean Spiller — are vying for the chance to succeed Murphy.
Five Republicans — former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, Sen. Jon Bramnick, radio host Bill Spadea, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, and contractor Justin Barbera — are competing for their party’s nod.
All 80 of the state’s Assembly seats are also up for election this year.

They're joined by more than two dozen new applicants. (Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Nearly 37,000 students have been approved to participate in the state’s school voucher program during the 2025-2026 academic year, the first time it’s open to all Arkansans. 
Created by the LEARNS Act, a 2023 law that made sweeping changes to the state’s K-12 education system, the Education Freedom Account program provides state funds for allowable education expenses such as private school tuition. The program was phased in over three years with expanding eligibility. 
As of Monday, the Arkansas Department of Education had received 42,624 applications — 27,752 from private school students, 14,866 from homeschool students and six incomplete applications. Applications could be considered incomplete for a variety of reasons such as someone not entering a school in the application, ADE spokesperson Kimberly Mundell said.
ADE had approved 36,855 applicants  as of Monday — 25,569 private school students and 11,286 homeschool students. 
In the first two years of the EFA program, participation was capped at 1.5% and 3% of the total public school enrollment, roughly 7,100 and 14,000 students, respectively. ADE is projecting approximately 40,000 participants for the 2025-2026 academic year, Mundell said. 
With no cap in year three, participation will be limited by available funding, which is worrisome to Courtnei Jackson, principal and teacher at Shiloh Excel Christian School in Little Rock.
“It is a concern to know that there’s a possibility of funds running out and we still don’t have families that have renewed or applied yet,” she said. 
Shiloh Excel had 13 students last year, the majority of whom participated in the EFA program. Jackson expects around 20 students to enroll for the 2025-2026 academic year. 
EFA students are eligible to receive up to $6,994 per student next year. Students who previously qualified for the Succeed Scholarship Program, which was absorbed into the EFA program, will receive up to $7,771.
For the 2025-2026 academic year, $277 million in state funds have been approved for the EFA program, Mundell said. Asked if applications are expected to exceed available funding and if per-student funding would be reduced if that happens, Mundell said funding hasn’t yet been exceeded and “there is no plan to reduce the amount of funding per pupil at this time.”


Let us know what you think...


 

To manage the large influx of applications, ADE is evaluating and approving applications based on funding priority categories within designated application priority windows, instead of a first-come, first-served basis, according to the education department’s EFA website.
Three-week priority windows began in early March. The application portal was closed from May 26 to June 1, before reopening for the fifth application window on Monday. Once a priority window closes, all submitted applications are reviewed together, with priority given to students in higher funding categories. The students with highest priority are returning EFA participants, followed by students with specialized needs. 
The program will continue processing applications in three-week windows until Jan. 31, 2026. If the number of applications exceeds available funding, applicants in the highest priority groups will be awarded first until all funds have been allocated, according to ADE’s website. Any remaining eligible students will be placed on a rolling waitlist and considered for funding as openings occur.
Third-year schools 
Private schools that have participated in every year of the EFA program say they’re grateful the funds have helped cover families’ tuition costs and increase their enrollment. But they also say technological issues persist and worry how the program might change. 
Smaller class sizes are key to providing an effective education at Shiloh Excel, but the school may soon expand from 20 students to 100 because of the EFA program, Jackson said.
“We have been [considering expanding] over the years, but we’re really considering it now, especially since we have the vouchers that are available…so it’s possible that we could really increase quickly, and we want to be able to accommodate that,” she said. 
Joshua Academy in Van Buren opened in 2023 with 37 students. Enrollment grew to 47 by the end of the Christian school’s first year and to 121 during the 2024-2025 academic year when 97 students participated in the EFA program. Enrollment is expected to be around 160 this fall and the EFA program has been “a huge part of it,” Head of School Kara Witzke said.
Joshua Academy serves “a fairly underserved population” in a rural county with about a quarter of students qualifying for free or reduced lunch and more than 70 ACE scholarships expected next year, Witzke said. 
Founded in 2000 by a group of people that included Walmart heir John Walton, ACE Scholarships are designed for families that make up to 350% above the poverty level ($112,525 for a family of four in 2025).
“The fact that everybody’s getting it, the families are so relieved, those especially that have been paying full price for our school or relying on outside scholarships to do so,” Witzke said. “They’re so relieved to have that big burden taken care of.”
Tuition will cost $9,000 for elementary school and $9,500 for middle school next year, and with the EFA program covering the majority of that, Witzke said it creates an opportunity for the outdoor-based school to launch its first annual fund. 
Heads of Arkansas private schools participating in state voucher program cite aid to families

Private schools often rely on donors to pay for operational costs not covered by tuition, she said, so an annual fund would allow some families to donate part of what they would have paid in tuition and receive a tax deduction. 
While tuition increases are common, Jackson said she’s cautioned her school’s board not to raise tuition too much because it’s important for families to have EFA funds for other things like uniforms and supplies. Shiloh Excel’s tuition will increase from $4,250 to $5,000 this fall.
At Clear Spring School in Eureka Springs, tuition will stay the same next year, ranging from $9,000 to $10,500 for K-12 students. Roughly 85% of the school’s students receive scholarships, so the EFA program helps alleviate concerns about how much the independent school needs to raise for tuition assistance, Head of School Jessica FitzPatrick said. 
Though EFA funds are available, technology can make them difficult to access. Beyond the initial application, families must submit invoices through an online portal for quarterly payments to be disbursed to schools. 
Joshua Academy families often have phones but not computers, so some use the school’s main office computer to access the online EFA portal, Witzke said. With a smaller enrollment of 69 students, FitzPatrick said staff can generally remind families to submit invoices or assist those who aren’t “tech savvy at all.” 
“It’s not hard, but if you’ve never done it, it’s a challenge and it’s usually our lower-income families that it’s the biggest challenge for, which is who they’re trying to help,” FitzPatrick said. “But there’s a disconnect there between the lowest income and their hurdles to technology.” 
Beyond technical glitches, some private school leaders have concerns about how the EFA program could change in the future. Opponents of the program have called for private schools receiving state funding to be held to the same standards as public schools. Some lawmakers have proposed laws to require just that. 
If program requirements change such that the state dictates the direction of Clear Spring, that could be a problem because it goes against its accrediting body’s guidelines for independent schools to set their own mission, vision and philosophy, FitzPatrick said. 
Likewise, Witzke said the EFA program seems like it’s often “under attack” and she’s worried about efforts to repeal the program or attach “strings that would make it impossible for a Christian school, for instance, to maintain their freedom and curriculum choice.”
“I hope that the spirit of the LEARNS Act is maintained and that fidelity is maintained forever, but I am concerned,” she said. “If it were to go away and we have 200 students at our school that all of a sudden lose 80% of their funding, we would at that point have to rely on donor funding to keep the kids here, and that would be more challenging.”

It was likely filled with carefree moments spent with friends and family, studying for finals and feeling like you had the world at your feet. For me, 22 was exactly like that…until it all came to a screeching halt.  
 I found out that I had cancer a few months shy of my 22nd birthday. I was getting ready to go to work when I noticed a hard lump nuzzled between my chin and neck. Initially I was puzzled but shrugged it off as something that would go away on its own. As days turned into weeks, I noticed the lump growing, becoming uncomfortable and noticeable. The entire left side of my neck had started to swell and harden.   


 I knew this wasn’t something I could ignore anymore, but I was too afraid to go to the doctor for fear of what he might tell me. Despite my fear, I made an appointment with my primary care doctor. Little did I know this would start a wave of appointments, tests and sessions for years to come.  
It was confirmed that I had stage II Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a blood cancer that is most often found among very young and very old people.   
Despite my initially positive prognosis, the tumors were relentless even after eight rounds of chemotherapy, and I was encouraged to undergo radiation, more chemotherapy and finally a stem cell transplant. Nothing could’ve prepared me for the physical pain, isolation and tremendous loss that cancer brings when it enters your life like an uninvited guest. Loss of autonomy, loss of feeling carefree, loss of time, hair loss.  

Alicia Tabaka
I was working as a makeup artist and taking a few classes at a local community college when this all occurred. My family and I were nowhere near equipped financially to be able to pay for the bills that accumulated from treatment. I put school on the back burner and took a long leave of absence from work, making the path to my future look bleak. 
Life as I knew it was postponed. I kept my solitary days busy by going on walks, painting, and scrolling through social media, dreaming of when I’d be able to resume the life my friends were living. The daydream of being carefree again comforted me and kept hope alive.   
 I’ve been in remission for years now, and I can say I’m grateful to have had a second chance at life, one that I savor every moment. I’m grateful for every breath, every opportunity, every step I take. I don’t know if I’d be so conscious of how precious every moment is had I not gone through cancer.  
 I’m in a new chapter of life as a full-time student for the first time, committed to a fulfilling future, something that was lost to me for years. During those grueling years, I didn’t have the mental or financial capacity to focus on school, because my resources were dedicated to closing the chapter on cancer.   
 I certainly didn’t walk away unscathed, but I did take away many lessons from this transformative experience:   
First, don’t wait too long to get something unusual checked out by your doctor. Take care of things sooner rather than later.   
Second, cancer isn’t always synonymous with tragedy.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)A Republican member of the Michigan House of Representatives on Tuesday called for the chamber to issue articles of impeachment against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson – who is also a Democratic Party frontrunner for the 2026 gubernatorial primary.
The call for the impeachment of Benson, who was elected in 2018 and reelected in 2022, came from Rep. James DeSana (R-Carleton), citing what he called unlawful election directives, a failure to preserve critical election records and supposed conduct that has undermined the public trust.
Benson in a statement called the effort a “clown show.”
DeSana was joined at a news conference by conservative firebrand Rep. Matt Maddock (R-Milford), who stood by as DeSana claimed that Benson was “the most lawless secretary of state in Michigan history.”
The articles accuse Benson of exceeding her authority during her tenure by allegedly ignoring procedural requirements imposed by the Michigan Legislature through statute, her alleged donations to a political action committee in support of Michigan Supreme Court Justice Kyra Harris Bolden when she sought to retain her seat last year – allegedly just before her department’s attorneys argued before the high court in an election inspector challenge – and Benson’s office’s banning of firearms at polling locations.

DeSana also said Benson’s office’s handling of absentee ballots during the 2020 presidential election was part of his calculus to call for her impeachment.
With Benson as a potential major player in the Democratic gubernatorial primary next year, DeSana was asked if the move was purely political.
“Whether it’s viewed as political or not, my people sent me here to uphold the law and have fair elections and we are not anywhere near that right now. So if they want to deem that political, it’s political,” DeSana said. “It is about keeping our secretary of state accountable to the residents of Michigan for her job. It is her job to run the secretary of state’s office and to run elections. We make the law that determines what is the authority over the election. She cannot make that law.”
In response, Benson said that she believes in oversight and transparency, but “this isn’t it.”
“This is Republican lawmakers abusing their authority to access sensitive election information that would allow them – or any conspiracy theorists they share it with – to tamper with election equipment, interfere with the chain of custody of ballots, or impersonate a clerk on Election Day,” Benson said. “I continue to call on Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall and his caucus to work with us and a judicial mediator to help us reach a resolution to this matter.”
Benson added that the threat amounted to a Republican-led circus.
“But let’s be clear: this clown show he is leading is no way to govern. It is not how we solve problems. It is not how we make government work for everyone. And every taxpayer dollar wasted on these shenanigans is a waste of time and money,” Benson said. “I remain committed to the security of our elections and to the people of Michigan. I work for them. I suggest the House Republicans start doing the same.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AMR_0884-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 12:25:03.388980

The image is of a statue honoring President Abraham Lincoln that sits on the south side of the Kansas Capitol. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A surprise outpouring of individual income tax receipts in May drove overall Kansas revenue collections $158 million above the monthly projection.
The Kansas Department of Revenue received $657 million during the month, which was 31.7% above the estimate for May.
“Surpassing estimates this month is a positive indicator, but we remain diligent and focused on maintaining long-term financial health,” said Gov. Laura Kelly.

The revenue department said individual income tax collections in May totaled $314 million. That was $144 million or 85.1% above the estimate for the month and a 3.1% increase over May 2024.
In terms of corporate income taxes, the state took in $29.2 million — a figure $840,880 or 2.8% below the estimate for May. It represented a decrease of 26.8% from May 2024.


Combined retail sales and compensating use tax receipts in May were $282 million. The total surpassed the projection by $11.1 million or 4.1% and was consistent with the total in May 2024.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican seeking the GOP nomination for state insurance commissioner in 2026, said the 2024 Legislature was justified in passing a substantial tax reform bill signed into law by the Democratic governor. The bill offered an estimated $1.2 billion in tax relief over a three-year period.
“When we put money back in taxpayers’ pockets, not big government, Kansas families and communities thrive,” Hawkins said.
The 2024 law negotiated by Kelly, Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson established a two-bracket system for calculating personal income taxes. For married individuals filing jointly, taxable income up to $46,000 would be taxed at 5.2%, while taxable income above $46,001 would be taxed at 5.58%. Kansas’ previous three-bracket system pegged rates at 3.1%, 5.2% and 5.7% depending on income.

Under the 2024 legislation, the personal exemption and standard deduction on state income taxes were raised and the state income tax on Social Security benefits was abolished.
“These latest revenue numbers clearly show that passing the comprehensive tax relief package last year was hands down the right move,” Hawkins said. “Kansas is in a strong position as long as we stay focused on smart, conservative leadership.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gage-Lincoln-Color-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 12:25:03.388980
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-03 15:39:21+00:00,CT Mirror,Homeland Security’s list of ‘sanctuary cities’ pulled down after sheriffs object,Ariana Figueroa | News From The States,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/homeland-security-pulled-down-sanctuary-cities/,Homeland Security pulled down the list of cities the Trump administration labeled as 'sanctuary' after backlash from local law enforcement.,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security over the weekend took down a public list of cities and jurisdictions that the Trump administration labeled as “sanctuary” cities, after a sharp rebuke from a group representing 3,000 sheriffs and local law enforcement.
On Saturday, National Sheriffs’ Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahue slammed the list as an “unnecessary erosion of unity and collaboration with law enforcement.”
“The completion and publication of this list has not only violated the core principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with fellow law enforcement, but it also has the potential to strain the relationship between Sheriffs and the White House administration,” Donahue said.
DHS published the list Thursday and it was unavailable by Sunday. It’s unclear when it was removed, but internet archives show Saturday as the last time the list was still active.
In a statement, DHS did not answer questions as to why the list was removed.
“As we have previously stated, the list is being constantly reviewed and can be changed at any time and will be updated regularly,” according to a DHS spokesperson. “Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens.”
DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on Fox News Sunday did not acknowledge that the list was taken down, but said some localities had “pushed back.”
“They think because they don’t have one law or another on the books that they don’t qualify, but they do qualify,” Noem said. “They are giving sanctuary to criminals.”
List followed Trump executive order
Local law enforcement aids in immigration enforcement by holding immigrants in local jails until federal immigration officials can arrive.
The creation of the list stems from Donald Trump’s executive order in April that required DHS to produce a list of cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration officials in enforcement matters, in order to strip federal funding from those local governments.
Those jurisdictions are often dubbed “sanctuary cities,” but immigration enforcement still occurs in the city — there’s just no coordination between the local government and the federal government.
The jurisdictions are often a target for the Trump administration and Republicans, who support the President Donald Trump campaign promise of mass deportations of people without permanent legal status.
Congressional Republicans in March grilled mayors from Boston, Chicago and Denver, on their cities’ immigration policies during a six-hour hearing before the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
‘Strong objection’
Local officials were puzzled by the list.
One law enforcement association in North Dakota questioned why several counties — Billings, Golden Valley, Grant, Morton, Ramsey, Sioux, and Slope — were listed as sanctuary jurisdictions because those areas cooperate with federal immigration officials.
In a statement, the North Dakota Sheriff’s and Deputies Association said the “methodology and criteria used to compile this list is unknown,” and there has been no communication from DHS “on how to rectify this finding.”
“The elected Sheriffs of these counties take strong objection with language in this release characterizing them as ‘deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities,’” according to NDSDA.
“The North Dakota Sheriff’s and Deputies Association is working to gather more information regarding the lack of transparency and reasoning as to why the Department of Homeland Security did not fact check prior to incorrectly naming these North Dakota counties.”
Local advocacy groups also noted the problems with the DHS list.
“I assume they’ve removed (the list) because they were bombarded with complaints about inaccuracy and how and why these various jurisdictions got on the list,” Steven Brown, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island, said in an interview Monday.
According to the Internet Archive website Wayback Machine, the states, as well as the District of Columbia, that were on the list included Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and Wisconsin.

Lawmakers voted to pass House Bill 126, titled “Revise Voluntary Ag. District Laws,” without any discussion or testimony.
This measure would require government agencies considering condemning or rezoning property within a voluntary agricultural district to hold a public hearing. There would be 45 days to set up the hearing and 120 days for the local agricultural advisory board to submit its findings and recommendations to the agency.
“At this point, I’ve heard no opposition to this bill,” primary sponsor Rep. Jimmy Dixon (R-Duplin, Wayne) said.
The bill now heads to the Senate Rules Committee.
Legislators also reviewed two bills for discussion only: House Bill 247 (“8-1-1 Amendments“) and House Bill 694 (“Study Water/Wastewater Regionalization“).
Sen. Michael Lazzara (R-Onslow) presented HB 247 to the panel, explaining the language would be replaced with text from Senate Bill 328, which updates the Underground Utility Safety and Damage Prevention Act.
“We just made the corrections to some of the language, but essentially, it’s a consensus,” he said.
Sen. Tom McInnis (R-Cumberland, Moore) said he appreciated the bill, seeing as he’s had a lot of complaints about 8-1-1. That’s the number individuals should call prior to excavating to ensure they don’t encounter any buried utilities.
“We can’t move forward in our state unless we have a cohesive unit of construction,” McInnis said.
If this bill passes the panel, it will proceed to the Senate Rules Committee.
It’s the same case for HB 694, which would direct the Environmental Finance Center at the University of North Carolina to study wastewater and water regionalization efforts.
Sen. David Craven (R-Anson, Montgomery, Randolph, Richmond, Union) presented the legislation.
Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) asked about the Department of Environmental Quality’s role in the process of transferring water between basins.
“This starts with a notice, then DEQ works with the water applicant to develop a draft environmental statement that looks at environmental impacts, it looks at alternatives to the water withdrawal, as well as several other things of that nature,” legislative analysis Kyle Evans said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-05-at-3.51.35-PM-2-1024x818.png,,,2025-06-03 12:25:03.388980

TOPEKA — The Trump administration has paused its demand for the personal data of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients after a lawsuit was filed May 22 by national advocacy organizations.
Kansas Department for Children and Families officials received a letter from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in early May demanding personal information about SNAP recipients in the state. DCF refused to send the data, stating, “At this time, we are unsure as to the reason for the USDA’s request.”
A motion for a temporary restraining order was filed May 27 by counsel for the National Center for Law and Economic Justice, the National Student Legal Defense Network, Protect Democracy Project, the Electronic Privacy Information Center and MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger. The same group also filed the lawsuit challenging USDA’s access to the protected information, a news release said.
In a sworn declaration, USDA official Shiela Corley said the agency has not collected SNAP recipient data after telling the third-party vendors that maintain the data to hold off on submitting it, the news release said.
“USDA has instructed EBT Processors to refrain from sending any data until USDA completed procedural steps to ensure that data received would be appropriately safeguarded and to satisfy all necessary legal requirements,” her testimony said. “In accordance with USDA’s instruction, EBT Processors have not sent any data to USDA in response to the May 6 letter. Before any of the data described in the May 6 Letter is provided to USDA, USDA intends to publish a new SORN (System of Records Notice) in compliance with the Privacy Act.”
Although Corley’s declaration caused the advocacy organizations to drop the motion for the restraining order, the lawsuit will continue, the press release said.
“This is a victory for tens of millions of SNAP recipients and anyone who cares about protecting our personal data against government abuse,” John Davisson, an EPIC official, said in the release. “Although this fight is just beginning, we’re grateful that the USDA acknowledged its legal obligation to safeguard privacy and remain accountable to the public.”
Abby J. Leibman, president and CEO of MAZON, said in the news release that the USDA must consider how its actions affect those facing hunger in the United States.
“The laws and processes protecting privacy exist for vital reasons. Americans are clear that everyone has a high expectation of privacy regarding their personal information — and SNAP applicants do not cede that expectation in exchange for receiving vital support to meet their basic needs,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SNAP-data-2-1-1024x581.jpg,,,2025-06-03 12:25:03.388980

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer) Newly unionized doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants walked picket lines for the first time in Minnesota outside four Allina clinics on Tuesday, voicing frustration with what they called the “factory style” of modern medicine.
The clinicians voted by a wide margin to unionize with Doctors Council SEIU in October 2023, forming the nation’s largest private-sector doctors union with more than 600 members across 60 Allina clinics in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
But since then, union leaders say they’ve made little progress toward finalizing a first labor contract covering wages, benefits and working conditions despite meeting with hospital leaders nearly 40 times.
“We’re not seeing Allina come to the table with meaningful proposals,” said Dr. Chris Antolak, a family physician, outside Allina’s clinic in Coon Rapids. “We’re here today to picket because we need to prove to Allina that we’re standing in strength and solidarity.”
The union also organized picket lines, which are not strikes, outside Allina clinics in Maplewood, West St. Paul and Bloomington.
The striking image of physicians picketing underscores the turbulent state of American health care, which leaves many patients and now even doctors demanding change.
Physicians, as the white collars on their lab coats convey, have not historically seen themselves as workers in need of a union. The consolidation of health care and productivity demands set by faraway bosses, however, has made many feel more like workers pushed to churn through patients on an assembly line rather than masters of their own practices.
“I’m a union kid. My parents were teachers … I never thought I would be union until I realized the power that we have as a single voice,” said Dr. Kara Larson, who’s worked as a pediatrician at the Coon Rapids clinic since 1999. “The union brought us together to advocate for change for our patients.”
The clinicians say Allina has proposed cutting compensation by reducing their base salary from the median wage for health care providers nationally to the 25th percentile.
They also say the health system, one of the largest in the Upper Midwest with $5.8 billion in revenue in 2024, refused to budge in negotiations over reducing work loads and increasing support staff and sick leave. Addressing safety concerns also remains a sticking point — health care workers are among the most likely to be physically assaulted on the job, which is also animating separate union nurses’ negotiations with more than a dozen hospitals including Allina.
In a statement, Allina Health said it is negotiating in good faith with the union to seek “responsible agreements.”
“Allina Health and the union were fully aware they would be charting new territory in creating these first contracts, and it is important to get it right,” the statement said.
The two sides have come to tentative agreements over the control of their schedules, creation of a mentorship program and labor management committee, and protections against unfair discipline.
Braving rain and willdfire-induced bad air, the physicians at times seemed unfamiliar with picket line practices: A SEIU staff member shouted out instructions on picketing — where to start walking and where to pivot back — before they started. More than once the group seemed to forget to keep moving and came to a standstill, while two people led competing chants at different paces, muddying what’s typically a clear call-and-response. But nevertheless, they got their point across.
Physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants are sure to become more practiced in blue collar labor demonstrations in the years to come as unionization increases.
Just this year, resident physicians at Hennepin Healthcare and the University of Minnesota unionized with SEIU’s Committee of Interns and Residents, one of the fastest growing health care unions in the country.
More than 130 Allina doctors at Mercy and Unity hospitals voted to unionize in 2023, and last year, more than 400 nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other advanced nursing staff voted to unionize across nine Essentia hospitals and 60 clinics spanning northern Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Chris Rubesch, president of the Minnesota Nurses Association, joined the picket line in support of the doctors on Tuesday, signaling a growing alliance between two classes of health care workers not infrequently at odds with each other.
“We have a broken health care system that prioritizes profits … and we need to refocus on our patients,” Rubesch said. “We are standing with you shoulder to shoulder.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P1230001-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-06-03 12:25:03.388980

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-03 15:10:39+00:00,CT Mirror,High schoolers want to stay connected to their community. Here’s how free bus fare would help,Daniela Doncel | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/ct-student-free-bus-fares/,A free bus fare program that has allowed high schoolers to commit to more extracurriculars may not be coming back due to a lack of funding.,"Oluwaseyi Oluborode is going into her senior year at University High School of Science and Engineering (UHSSE), a STEM magnet school in Hartford. With the help of a free bus fare program at her school, she’ts able to go to the library to work on school assignments, participate in community organizations like the Hartford-based advocacy group Speak Up and take part in social activities with her peers.
“College is approaching, and it’s really important that I demonstrate that I’m engaged in my school and in extracurriculars,” Oluborode said. “It’s really hard for you to have a leadership position in a club or to have an impact within your community if you aren’t able to frequently attend meetings.”
It can cost up to $3.50 for Oluborode to get a full-day city bus pass. That bus fare on a daily basis can add up which, Oluborode said, is something many of her peers can’t afford.
A pilot free bus fare program at her school, however, has allowed her to be able to commit to more extracurricular activities, she said.
“It’s definitely made things easier because I don’t feel like I’m a burden to my parents,” Oluborode said. “I also feel like I have autonomy. It feels empowering, knowing that you can get where you want, where you need to go, and there isn’t that hassle [of going] back and forth.”
That program may not be coming back next school year due to a lack of funding. Oluborode is worried that her future may be negatively impacted without that access to transportation.
“I feel like it would undermine my college application, if I would have to drop all the extracurriculars I had been partaking in all throughout high school,” she said.
Oluborode is one of sseveral students in the Social Justice League at her school fighting to keep the free bus fare service alive, asking legislators to not forget about them as community members across the state are calling for more funding in the state budget for education.
Oluwaseyi Oluborode is part of a youth-led campaign that advocates for SB 1243, a bill that would provide fare-free bus public transportation services for high school students and veterans.

When a pandemic-era program that provided free fare for bus riders ended in April 2023, UHSSE principal Sean Tomany scrambled to get free bus passes for his students for the rest of the school year. That’s because earlier in the year, Tomany said he learned the importance of access to bus transportation after speaking with a student.
The student, Juan Cruz, came late to school one February morning. Tomany said he explained that he was late because the bus was too full.
“It dawns on me, he’s a walker. He lives 1.8 miles away,” Tomany said. “At that moment, and it’s embarrassing, as an educator who’s worked in Hartford for 25 years, that I never saw how much transportation impacts so many of my kids.”
High school students in Hartford are eligible for school bus transportation to and from school if they live two miles or more from their school. But for students like Cruz, Tomany said they either have to walk or take the city bus.
“He gets out of bed and comes to school because he wants to,” Tomany said. “I don’t think you’re gonna find an adult that wants to walk 1.8 miles in two degree weather.”
So Tomany created a club with some of his students called the Social Justice League to advocate for free bus passes for students. Last year, they helped establish the pilot free bus fare program for students in Hartford and New Haven.
According to Tomany, he was able to buy 500 students bus passes for 10 months with the $175,000 that was allocated for the Hartford program.
As part of the program, Tomany surveyed the students who participated. Across the high schools that participated, including UHSSE, Weaver High School and Hartford High School, nearly half of students reported the city bus was the main transportation option for their family. 45% said their family shared one car.
Having that access to transportation allows students to attend to school, Tomany said, which addresses the issue of chronic absenteeism that schools have been struggling with since the pandemic. Take medical appointments, for example.
“The kid has a doctor’s appointment, he misses a whole day of school, whereas now they have a bus pass, so they get on the bus, they go to the doctor’s appointment, and then they come to school,” Tomany said.
Attendance is just one part of it, however. Tomany said it helps students grow as individuals. One student, he said, was even able to start a savings account.
“She got a job because she has a bus pass. She used that bus pass to save up money. She bought a car and now she’s going to prom because she has the money, because she has a bus pass, because she has a job,” Tomany said.
Most students, according to the survey, used their bus pass to participate in sport or community programs, to support family or to partake in social activities.
Most importantly, Tomany argued, is the fact that access to transportation allows students to stay connected to their school and community.
“You know why kids come to school? They have relationships with the adults in the building. How do you develop those relationships? You play a sport, you join a club, you just hang out with Mr. Tomany at three o’clock because you can, because you can catch the bus down at Annie Fisher at 3:40,” Tomany said. “That is the power of what this can do.”

However, Figueroa said the free bus fare program provides her with more transportation options, giving her more opportunities to better herself for college through sports, extracurricular activities and a job.

Students call on legislature to step up
Nayeli Figueroa is a junior at UHSSE and a member of the Social Justice League. Now that the pilot program has run out of funding, she’s called on the legislature with her fellow club members to keep the program going with a bill that would provide fare-free bus public transportation services for high school students and veterans.
“I feel very strong as a young Latina woman in Connecticut,” Figueroa said. “You know, these challenges are hard, and a lot of people tend to forget about us kids of minorities.”
Figueroa said she would often have to search the car, couch or laundry machine for loose change around the house to be able to get $1.75 for a two-hour bus pass.
“You think it’s a small amount to pay, but it definitely adds up long term,” she said.
With the free bus fare program, she said she was able to gain independence to learn and grow outside the classroom.
“I was able to get a lifeguard certification,” Figueroa said. “I took different classes, and with the bus pass, I was able to get there, and I was also able to, once I got out, go straight to work.”
Without it, she said it would be a major hindrance.
“I feel like I would go back to my freshman and sophomore year, where I was very limited to resources,” Figueroa said. “I feel like I would take some steps back in life.”
With legislators working to get more funding in the state budget for education, including special education, it’s unclear if the free bus fare bill will pass this legislative session.
Whether the bill passes or not, Figueroa said she won’t stop advocating for free bus passes for urban students.
“I think this is something that should be solidified within Hartford Public Schools and statewide,” she said, “because we are silently excluding so many students when we don’t recognize this need.”

A months-long investigation by the New Castle County Division of Police High-Risk Offender Team has resulted in the arrest of three men and the seizure of a significant quantity of illegal drugs, authorities announced this week.
The investigation, launched in March, targeted the distribution of controlled substances across the county.
Police say the operation culminated on May 30 with the arrests of Daronce Beulah, 30, and Karon Phillips, 32, both taken into custody in Wilmington.
A third suspect, 34-year-old Stepheon Mason, was arrested later that evening following a search of a Maple Street residence.

During the initial arrests of Beulah and Phillips, detectives recovered 627 bags of heroin/fentanyl—amounting to nearly 19 grams—as well as 6.5 grams of crack cocaine and over $1,400 in cash.
The subsequent search of the Maple Street home, where Mason was apprehended, uncovered an even larger stash of drugs:

1,356 bags of heroin/fentanyl (45.38 grams)
4.7 grams of raw fentanyl
707 MDMA pills
689 grams of marijuana
84 Alprazolam pills
$4,406 in cash

All three suspects face a range of drug-related charges. Beulah, who is also accused of illegal firearm possession and endangering the welfare of a child, was held at Howard R. Young Correctional Institution on $162,252 cash bail.
Phillips faces multiple felony and misdemeanor charges and is also being held at the same facility after failing to post $62,102 cash bail.
Mason was charged with several offenses, including drug distribution and child endangerment. He was released on $6,800 secured bail.
Police say the investigation highlights the continued threat posed by the distribution of dangerous narcotics, particularly fentanyl, in the community.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Republican budget bill the U.S. House approved last month includes a surprise for the 40 states that have expanded Medicaid: penalties for providing health care to some immigrants who are here legally.
Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.
Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.
Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”
West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.
Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”
“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.
There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized anyway when they do start accepting them as they begin to qualify, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.



It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.
The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.
By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.
“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”
The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.
Need to go to the hospital? Texas and Florida want to know your immigration status.

“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”
Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.
Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.
Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.
Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.
“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”
Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.
“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”
More States Offer Health Coverage to Immigrant Children

Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.
“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.
Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.
Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.
“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.
California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.
“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.
If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.
“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.

Cinnaire has announced the closing of a $340 million Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) multi-investor fund, the largest in its 32-year history. Known as Fund 43, the investment will support the development and preservation of affordable housing across 11 states, including a major project in Wilmington. 
The fund will finance 33 developments, resulting in 2,455 affordable housing units and benefiting more than 5,400 individuals. In addition to addressing housing insecurity, the initiative is projected to generate over $844 million in local economic activity.
“The closing of Fund 43 represents a significant milestone in Cinnaire’s history of investing in communities through the creation of affordable housing,” said Matt Hodges, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Cinnaire. 
Cinnaire is a nonprofit Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) headquartered in Lansing, Michigan, with operations in multiple states, including an office in Wilmington. The organization provides creative capital solutions for high-impact community projects, partnering with developers, investors, and nonprofits to build inclusive, thriving communities.

“Our largest fund ever—creating 2,455 homes across the communities we serve—means more families have a safe place to call home. The collaborative efforts of our team, our partners, and our investors have helped to create housing not only for families and seniors, but also for people with developmental disabilities, those recovering from opioid addiction, survivors of domestic violence, and individuals living with HIV/AIDS,” said Hodges.

One of the featured developments in Fund 43 is Imani Village Phase IV. The project will deliver 84 residential units—57 of which will be affordable. The housing community is part of the Riverside revitalization initiative led by Pennrose Properties in partnership with REACH Riverside and the Wilmington Housing Authority. Support services will be provided by Kingswood Community Services.
The project continues a multi-phase redevelopment effort aligned with the Purpose Built Communities model, which aims to transform neighborhoods of concentrated urban poverty into thriving, mixed-income communities. This marks the fourth phase of Cinnaire’s partnership with Pennrose and a key element of Wilmington’s broader redevelopment goals.
“For nearly four decades, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit has been the cornerstone of affordable housing development,” said Ryan Robinson, President of Cinnaire Equity Partners.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Environmental and labor advocates expressed concerns during a news conference Monday about the New Mexico environment department’s decision to extend the timeline for a proposed rule to protect workers from heat-related illness and injury.
The delay comes as forecasts predict another warmer-than-average summer. NMED cited rising temperatures and increased heat-related injuries and deaths when it announced the proposed rule earlier this year. Under the original timeline, the rule could have taken effect as early as July. Its provisions include: required rest periods during hot temperatures; access to adequate shade, air-conditioning and water; and employer tracking of heat-related injuries.
Amid rising temperatures, NM officials propose workplace protections

NMED’s revised schedule pushes hearings into the fall and “leaves another summer where our workers are vulnerable to extreme heat in New Mexico,” Conservation Voters New Mexico Climate and Energy Advocate Justin Garoutte said.
A Friday state news release said the delay “will allow for continued outreach and stakeholder engagement throughout the summer and fall, ensuring broader participation and input in the rulemaking process.”
More than 600 public comments have already been submitted on the proposed rule, according to Source NM’s review. These include opposition from industry groups representing livestock, landscapers, oil and gas, restaurants, county governments and utilities.
The New Mexico Chamber of Commerce, for instance, asked for clarifications on how the rule would be applied across several industries and wrote: “We urge regulators to reject this rule as there is not sufficient data to justify any of these rules. Good employers protect their employees, but mandating all industries to follow one blanket rule will not work.”
Eleven New Mexico Democratic senators, however, issued a letter supporting the new standards and noted that “public comment opposed to the rule include a great deal of unscientific claims, compounded with echoes of the federal administration’s ideological bent to oppose all government action.”
During Monday’s news conference, Garoutte said advocates for the rule are “committed to getting through a rule that’s as strong as possible” and “we are here today to push back on industry groups who are claiming it’s too hard, too fast and too burdensome.”
In the meantime, “we hope that our employers will use this time to put in place the commonsense protections detailed so well in the proposed rule,” he said. “Every day that passes without this rule is another day that people across our state are exposed to dangerous and sometimes deadly working conditions.”
Six other states — Maryland, California, Nevada, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington — have adopted statewide regulations to reduce heat stress in the workplace.

At least four Democrats have signaled their interest in filling the vacancy. (Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Tuesday set a special election for Sept. 9, 2025, to fill the congressional seat left vacant by the death of Rep. Gerry Connolly, a longtime Democratic fixture in Northern Virginia who passed away May 21 after a recurrence of cancer.
The writ of election, issued by Youngkin’s office, triggers a high-stakes contest in Virginia’s 11th Congressional District, a region that leans solidly Democratic and is home to a large population of federal workers. Candidates hoping to compete must file by July 11, with eligibility details available on the Department of Elections website.
Connolly, 75, died just weeks after announcing he would not seek reelection. First elected to Congress in 2008 after a decade on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, including five years as chair, Connolly became known as a detail-oriented legislator with a focus on government oversight and civil service protections. Before his time in local government, he worked on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and held positions in the private sector with firms like SRI International and SAIC.
His death set off a cascade of questions about how and when the seat would be filled. 
Virginia law requires the governor to call a special election to replace a congressional representative, but offers flexibility on timing. Elections must be held on a Tuesday and cannot occur within 55 days of a regularly scheduled general or primary election — a restriction that ruled out much of the summer due to Virginia’s June 17 congressional primaries.
Manisha Singh, chair of the 11th District Democratic Committee, told The Mercury last week her group has been preparing for this moment while awaiting Youngkin’s decision. She described the task ahead as urgent but clear — to ensure a transparent and accessible nomination process. 
“Our voters will have plenty of opportunity to have their voice heard,” Singh said. She added that the local party’s role is not to favor any one candidate, but to oversee a fair election process.
Democratic Party of Virginia Chair Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, said last week that the party intentionally held off on finalizing its plans out of respect for the governor’s timeline. With the election date now set, he said, urgency will be key. “I want to see a nomination process that gives voters time and space to be heard,” Bagby said.
Democrats are expected to hold a “firehouse primary” in mid-July to select their nominee. The Fairfax County Democratic Committee has already begun lining up polling locations, with plans to offer at least one site in each magisterial district.
Several candidates have already stepped forward or signaled interest in the Democratic nomination. 
Braddock District Supervisor James Walkinshaw, who once served as Connolly’s chief of staff and had already received the late congressman’s endorsement, is widely seen as a frontrunner. Also weighing bids are state Sen. Stella Pekarsky, D-Fairfax; Fairfax Planning Commissioner Candice Bennett; and attorney Amy Roma, a Vienna resident who specializes in global energy policy.
Singh acknowledged the difficulty of replacing a lawmaker as experienced and deeply rooted in the community as Connolly. “It is a humongous void that we are feeling right now, and it’s some really big shoes to fill,” she said. Still, she voiced confidence in the emerging field of candidates. “We have some excellent candidates who I am very sure are up to the challenge.”
On the Republican side, Mike Van Meter, a former law enforcement officer who lost to Connolly in 2024 by a 67-33% margin, has announced plans to run again. So far, no other Republican contenders have entered the race.
Connolly’s legacy looms large over the upcoming contest. In his final message to constituents, delivered just weeks before his death, he reflected on his 30 years in public service and expressed gratitude for the opportunity to serve: “My extended family — you all have been a joy to serve.”
The full writ of election is available on the Virginia Department of Elections website.

(Photo provided by the Alaska Division of Community Affairs)A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the board which regulates subsistence hunting on federal lands within Alaska acted legally when it created an emergency hunt for a Southeast Alaska village during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency.
The order, issued Monday, is the latest chapter of a five-year-old legal dispute stemming from a hunt authorized by the Federal Subsistence Board because the emergency in 2020 disrupted the normal food supply for the Southeast Alaska village of Kake.
The emergency hunt resulted in the harvest of two moose and five deer, which were distributed to local residents.
The state of Alaska later sued the board, arguing that approving the emergency hunt was beyond its authority and that the board acted inappropriately by delegating the hunt’s administration to the Kake tribe.
The Organized Village of Kake joined the lawsuit on the side of the Federal Subsistence board.
The state’s initial lawsuit was ruled moot by U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason, but the 9th Circuit overturned that decision and sent the case back to Gleason, who ruled partially in favor of the state and partially in favor of the board.
The state appealed again to the 9th Circuit, but on Tuesday, federal judges Carlos Bea (appointed by George W. Bush), Lucy Koh (Barack Obama) and Jennifer Sung (Joe Biden) confirmed that the hunt was legal.
With Bea writing a statement on the ruling for all three judges, they said that the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act permits access to subsistence resources on federal land, not just access to the land where those resources may be found.
Bea cited Section 811 of ANILCA, in which Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to ensure “reasonable access to subsistence resources on the public lands.”
“Congress intended that the Secretary ensure that rural residents of Alaska have the reasonable opportunity to reach and use subsistence resources that can be found on federal land in Alaska,” Bea wrote.
The decision implies that the board has the authority to create hunts, not just end them, as the state had argued.
The judges also overruled part of a U.S. District Court decision that was partially in favor of the state, saying Gleason improperly handled prior instructions by the 9th Circuit.
“We hold that under Title VIII of (ANILCA), the Board has the power to authorize an emergency subsistence hunt on federal public lands for rural residents of the state of Alaska,” Bea wrote on behalf of the board.
Court of Appeals decisions are considered final, unless appealed to a higher court, such as the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision by the three judges could also be appealed to the entire 9th Circuit.  
Doug Vincent-Lang, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said in an emailed statement that the department doesn’t agree with the decision.
“We are disappointed and disagree with this decision. It is both bewildering and perplexing that the court could rule against the plain language of the Alaska National Interest Claims Act, especially in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on Chevron deference. This ruling fundamentally alters the carefully crafted agreement that Congress made in adopting their language,” he said. “We are currently reviewing our next steps.”
Attorneys representing Kake said by email that the tribe is pleased with the result.
“Today’s decision from the 9th Circuit is a significant victory for the Organized Village of Kake and Alaska Native subsistence rights,” they said. “The 9th Circuit rejected the State of Alaska’s shameful, politically-motivated attempt to gut ANILCA’s subsistence provisions, and confirmed the Federal Subsistence Board’s authority to open a small hunt to provide desperately needed access to healthy and traditional food to a remote Alaska community at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Today’s victory is an affirmation of the promises that Congress made to protect subsistence rights, and comes at a time when the State is still seeking to erode those rights in other litigation and actions. The Tribe is very pleased with the result.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/KakeShoreline2012-1024x652.jpg,,,2025-06-03 12:25:03.388980

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Republican budget bill the U.S. House approved last month includes a surprise for the 40 states that have expanded Medicaid: penalties for providing health care to some immigrants who are here legally.
Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.
Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.
Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.

It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”
West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.
Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”
“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.
There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized anyway when they do start accepting them as they begin to qualify, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.


It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.
The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.
By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.
“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”
The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.

“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”
Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.
Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.
Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.
Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.
“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”
Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.
“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”

Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.
“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.
Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.
Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.
“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.
California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.
“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.
If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.
“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.

In Part 3 of a five part audio series, Mabuhay sa Alaska, KMXT’s Brian Venua reports on how teachers who have made the move from the Philippines are navigating their new lives in Alaska.
Carmela Sison is one of Kodiak’s new special education teachers from the Philippines. She grew up in Manila, with a metropolitan population of over 13 million people. Kodiak has less than 13,000 people.
“It’s not the same as in Manila because I lived in the highly urbanized part, but I wanted to slow down – it’s easier for transition,” she said.
Easier, but not seamless.
Before she came to Kodiak in August, Sison worked at an international school in the Philippines. She said the kids there were more competitive.
“In the Philippines, I love that drive, I love that motivation for my students, but it was always coming from a place of ‘I have to.’ Here, ‘I want to,’” she said. “It’s not about competition, it’s not about getting ahead.”

That was one of the biggest surprises for her – she had to figure out new ways to motivate students.
“I did not anticipate that at all,” Sison said. “I stayed up many nights changing my lesson plan because it will not connect with students.”
Sison said being in Kodiak has meant a lot of adjustments.
  Weather has been another huge adjustment. The climate is colder, but Kodiak also has four seasons. The Philippines mainly has two — a wet and a dry season. (Photo by Brian Venua/KMXT)
She’s one of Kodiak’s third batch of teachers to come from the Philippines. Cyndy Mika, the Kodiak Island Borough School District’s superintendent, said each batch of recruits has started supporting the next.
“Now that we’ve had, really, three groups of Filipino teachers coming in, they have become the support for each other,” Mika said.
Serjoe Gutierrez came to Kodiak in December 2022. He struggled with students at first, too. He said that back in the Philippines, his private school students were more focused.
“You wouldn’t have a hard time with discipline for those kids because I think they’re afraid of the teachers – they respect you more there,” Gutierrez said.

Not all of the adjustments are in the classroom. 
The cost of living in small towns is much higher than it is in the Philippines. Sison used to hire cleaners and home chefs or get massages for a fraction of what it would cost here.
“Massage is $10 an hour, home service,” she said. “So I used to get at least a two-hour or three-hour massage every week.”
Gutierrez said comparing grocery prices still blows him away sometimes. He took his family shopping on a recent trip to the Philippines.
“Our cart was full, like overflowing full, and it only cost me like $350,” he said. “Like here, when you get out of Walmart or Safeway – it’s not like the whole cart.”

Mika, the superintendent, said some of her employees have had to learn to use amenities that most Americans take for granted, like microwaves, thermostats and space heaters.
“We’ve had to learn through mistakes that we’ve made with onboarding,” she said. “How far do we start on the integration? Just into our conveniences of life and teaching them how to use those.”
She even offers to teach new recruits how to drive.
“They don’t own vehicles in the Philippines – they have such a robust system of public transportation,” Mika said.
  Jeepneys are an iconic form of transportation in the Philippines. They can haul multiple people around at a time, charging just a few pesos per ride, however some are also used as utility vehicles in place of a truck. (Photo by Brian Venua/KMXT)
Some things are familiar, though – about 25% of Kodiak Island Borough is Filipino, and the community is organized. The Kodiak Filipino American Association regularly holds events that celebrate heritage from the island nation.
“FilAm is for everybody, and it’s an organization that is focused on helping the community – building a community,” said Mark Anthony Vizcocho, the nonprofit’s president.

One of his goals this year is to reach out to more of the new teachers as he plans cultural events like Flores de Mayo, a traditional flower festival and parade in the Philippines.
“People don’t know why we always have parties. It’s because we want them to know that we like to have fun,” Vizcocho said.
It’s a reminder of the island nation, here on this island in Alaska.

The Cannabis Control Commission is down to just 3 members, with no timeline for appointing a new chair or commissioner with big decisions – including social consumption rules – ahead. 
The post Cannabis commission remains short-handed as the agency works on social consumption and other pressing issues appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AS LAWMAKERS CONSIDER revamping the Cannabis Control Commission, the five-member commission is limping along with two empty seats and no timeline for when new members will be appointed. The commission has been down to three members since last month. In May, Nurys Camargo vacated her post as commissioner – leaving the commission understaffed as the agency works on regulations to bring social consumption to state.  In September 2023, Treasurer Deborah Goldberg suspended the commission’s chair, Shannon O’Brien, for allegedly making “racially, ethnically, and culturally insensitive statements.” (O’Brien was fired in September 2024.) The contretemps over O’Brien put the agency and its internal struggles in the public spotlight. A spokesperson for the treasurer – who is responsible for appointing the chair – told CommonWealth Beacon that there is no update on when Goldberg will appoint a new chair to the commission. The law requires that the treasurer work with the governor and the attorney general to fill the empty seat left by Camargo. All three appointing authorities said that they are coordinating together on this task, but did not respond to questions about the timeline for when a new commissioner will be appointed.  According to the law, three commissioners must agree to pass any motion. With just three commissioners left, there is an increased possibility of a deadlock because all three must agree unanimously.  Last week, House lawmakers on the Joint Committee on Cannabis Policy voted to advance a cannabis omnibus bill that would restructure the commission into a three-member body. If the bill becomes law, all commissioners would be appointed by the governor, and two commissioners would form a “quorum.” The legislation comes as an effort to make the commission – which has been criticized for failing to collect hundreds of thousands in licensing fees, having a toxic work environment, and for general dysfunction – more accountable.  The commission is working to finalize long-awaited regulations for social consumption of cannabis. Last December, the agency indicated that its goal was to publish the regulations by mid-2025. During the May 12 public meeting, Bruce Stebbins, the commission’s acting chair and one of the three remaining commissioners, said that the timing of when the regulations would be taken up again is “to be determined” and he pushed off a discussion about the regulatory timeline to “the next meeting.”  At the May 22 meeting, the commission did not address social consumption regulations, but Stebbins said that the commission aims to get back to the regulations “tentatively” on June 17 and 18.  “The important work of the Commission will continue with three members as we move toward finalizing social consumption regulations alongside work on issues,” said Stebbins, in an email. The commission’s next meeting is scheduled for June 12, and the agenda for the meeting hasn’t been posted yet. Social consumption, the ability to consume marijuana products ranging from weed beverages to edible gummies in public places, was legalized through the same ballot question that brought recreational marijuana to Massachusetts in 2016. But the commission has been slow to roll out regulations to create the framework to support social consumption. The Cannabis Control Commission has repeatedly struggled with internal disagreements and deadlocked votes. When Goldberg suspended O’Brien without appointing an acting chair, the remaining four commissioners were unable to reach consensus on who would occupy the role, before finally appointing Ava Callender Concepcion. Goldberg later appointed Stebbins as acting chair, and he has occupied that seat ever since.  This gridlock has persisted as key regulatory changes have faced major delays, much to the frustration of those in the cannabis industry. Ryan Dominguez, the head of the Massachusetts Cannabis Coalition, said that his group has urged the appointing authorities to fill the empty seats on the commission, even temporarily.  Dominguez said the cannabis industry is hoping to see a suite of changes from the commission, like streamlining the process for registering cannabis employees to work in the industry, in addition to finalizing the social consumption regulations.  “We were all hoping that social consumption would be completed by now,” said Dominguez.  Dominguez said that he hopes that the appointing authorities for the chair and for Camargo’s vacated seat will not wait for the Legislature to pass their bill. The bill, which would also raise the cap on the number of retail licenses a single company can own from three to six, increasing purchasing and possession limits for cannabis, and crack down on hemp-derived intoxicating products, is in the House Ways and Means Committee. But, even if the House continues to advance the bill, it’s not clear if the bill has support in the Senate. “It is concerning that we could be waiting a long time for [the appointing authorities] to appoint a full slate of commissioners while the Senate and the House decide how they’re going to go through this process,” said Dominguez. “We still need the commission to act on social consumption regulations and many other different things. So the best way for us to be able to move forward is to have a full slate of commissioners.” The post Cannabis commission remains short-handed as the agency works on social consumption and other pressing issues appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Commissioner_Stebbins.jpg?fit=705%2C684&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-03 10:04:47.765732

The post Feds blame ‘sanctuary policies’ in Milford teenager’s immigration arrest appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLD MARCELO GOMES DA SILVA, the Milford High School junior arrested Saturday while on his way to a volleyball practice, was not the target of a federal immigration enforcement investigation and his arrest was the byproduct of Massachusetts’s “sanctuary policies,” federal officials said Monday.Gomes Da Silva was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday and remained in custody as of midday Monday, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston Acting Field Office Director Patricia Hyde said at a press conference held to trumpet nearly 1,500 ICE arrests in Massachusetts during May.“Sanctuary policies put us in a position to go out into communities and look for people. When jurisdictions don’t cooperate with ICE and we don’t arrest people, in custodial arrests, then we must go out into the community. And when we go out into the community and we find others who are unlawfully here, we are going to arrest them,” Hyde said. “We’ve been completely transparent with that. He’s 18 years old. He’s unlawfully in this country. And unfortunately, we had to go to Milford to look for someone else, and we came across him, and he was arrested.”ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said there was at least some level of cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE. He said it was “intelligence from a local law enforcement agency” that brought ICE to Milford on Saturday looking for Gomes Da Silva’s father.“We were looking for the father,” Lyons said. “They made a traffic stop on that vehicle, which was the father’s vehicle. He was driving that vehicle. But like any local law enforcement officer, if you encounter someone that has a warrant or, like I said, is here illegally, we will take action on that.”Asked about what would happen to Gomes Da Silva next, Lyons addressed “the whole due process thing” by referring to the collaboration between his agency and the U.S. attorney’s office, which hosted Monday’s press conference. GBH News reported Monday that a federal judge issued an emergency order Sunday blocking immigration authorities from transferring Gomes Da Silva outside of Massachusetts for at least 72 hours.“He will go in front of [an] immigration judge. He’ll have the opportunity to post bond. But again, I’m just going to ask you a question — Boston police stopped an 18-year-old on the way to high school. Are we having this conversation right now?” Lyons said. “It happens every day, every day, doesn’t it? There are multiple 18-year-olds arrested, but yet, we are focused on this one.”Public and high-profile arrests and apprehensions have been part of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement strategy, including in Somerville, Worcester, Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket.U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, Lyons and Hyde held a press conference Monday to announce the results of “Operation Patriot,” which they said was a month-long enforcement “surge” across Massachusetts. ICE said it arrested 1,461 “illegal alien offenders” during the operation. Of those arrested, 790 had prior criminal convictions, were facing pending charges here or in another country, or were facing charges for illegally reentering the country ICE said. But officials shared no detailed information about the people arrested, the charges they face or faced, or their backgrounds.“Make no mistake: Every person that we arrested was breaking our immigration laws, but most of these individuals had significant criminality. They are criminal offenders who victimized innocent people and traumatized entire communities — murderers, rapists, drug traffickers, child sex predators and members of violent transnational criminal gangs,” Hyde said. “Some were convicted of violent crimes in the United States, and others were wanted for criminality in their native countries. All made the mistake of attempting to subvert justice by hiding out in Massachusetts.”Massachusetts has not declared itself a “sanctuary state,” but it has been a popular target of the Trump administration and pushback against policies that federal officials see as lenient towards immigrants. In its 2017 Lunn decision, the Supreme Judicial Court held that Massachusetts state law “provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody.”“I think it’s a matter of semantics, right? We can say we’re not a sanctuary state, but when people are arrested for local charges, drug traffickers who are peddling poison in our communities are walking out the door not turned over to ICE, what does that sound like to all of you? That’s sanctuary,” Hyde said Monday. “So it’s fine to say that you’re not, but your actions absolutely show something different.”Gov. Maura Healey stepped up her criticism of recent federal immigration enforcement actions in Massachusetts following Gomes Da Silva’s arrest Saturday, this time “demanding” immediate information.“Yet again, local officials and law enforcement have been left in the dark with no heads up and no answers to their questions. I’m demanding that ICE provide immediate information about why he was arrested, where he is and how his due process is being protected,” Healey said in a statement Sunday. “My heart goes out to the Milford community on what was supposed to be a celebratory graduation day. The Trump Administration continues to create fear in our communities, and it’s making us all less safe.”Citing “increased immigration enforcement activity across Massachusetts,” Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s office last week issued a guidance document explaining the actions of ICE, the role of local police, and what people should know if they or others are approached by immigration officers.“From arresting parents in front of their children to pulling people who present no public safety threat out of their cars in broad daylight, the aggressive ICE tactics we’re seeing across the Commonwealth do not protect the public, and instead spread fear,” Campbell said. “In releasing this guidance, I strongly encourage everyone to inform themselves of their rights when they see immigration officers in their communities.”The guidance informs Bay Staters that ICE “generally can arrest people without a judicial warrant in public spaces” and that bystanders can observe and record the arrests “but are not allowed to obstruct, impede, or assault an ICE officer.” The AG’s office also said that local law enforcement in Massachusetts “cannot be compelled to carry out federal civil immigration enforcement, and their cooperation with ICE must comply with state and local legal limitations.The post Feds blame ‘sanctuary policies’ in Milford teenager’s immigration arrest appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC07751.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-03 10:04:47.765732

The session unites the daughters of civil rights martyrs Malcolm X, Vernon Dahmer and Medgar Evers, for “a rare and intimate dialogue rooted in love, memory, and legacy,” organizers said.
The women will speak during a special VIP Reception at 6 p.m. June 26 at the Jackson Convention Complex, 105 E. Pascagoula St. in Jackson, Mississippi. The conversation will mark the official opening of the Medgar Evers’ 100th celebration.
“The panelists will share personal stories that illuminate the joys and heartbreaks of growing up in the homes of men who gave everything for justice,” organizers said. “They will reflect on the fierce love that shaped their childhoods, the losses that redefined their lives, and the legacies they now carry forward through their own work and voices.”
Reena Evers-Everette, executive director of the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Institute, said, “This conversation is a tribute to Malcolm X, Vernon Dahmer, and my father, Medgar Evers — not just as giants in the fight for justice, but as devoted fathers who poured love into our lives. To sit beside these two courageous women in Mississippi, where our families’ stories are so deeply rooted, is both an honor and a moment of healing. We come together not only to remember, but to continue their unfinished work.”

Republican candidate for mayor casts ballot 
Republican candidate for mayor Kenny Gee, a police officer, pulled up to his West Jackson polling location at Medgar Evers Library at 6:58am. He said he was the fourth in line to vote at the precinct, which had a turnout rate of just under 20% in the primary election.
“I think Jackson needs help,” Gee said just after voting for himself and Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes Tuesday. “I think Sen. Horhn might pull the race off, just because he’s just well known, majority of the citizens know Sen. Horhn from being a senator. But overall, whoever is the mayor needs to be a two-term mayor because you can’t fix Jackson in four years.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/01184654/Voting-14.jpg,,,2025-06-03 09:05:59.069746

House Bill 4345, now Public Act 5 of 2025, passed with unanimous support in the Michigan House of Representatives and with near-unanimous support from the Michigan Senate. The plan addresses additional days in the 2024-25 school year, allowing local school boards to waive up to an additional 15 days of instruction.
The school district must be located, at least partially, in a county covered by a state emergency declared by the governor. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Due to the recent spring ice storms that ravaged northern Michigan, those counties include Alcona, Alpena, Antrim, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Crawford, Emmet, Mackinac, Montmorency, Oscoda, Otsego, and Presque Isle counties.
Bill sponsor Rep. Cam Cavitt (R-Cheboygan), said in a statement that he was grateful to Whitmer for signing the bill, and that schools should not be penalized for keeping kids safe during an ice storm.
“This is a smart, bipartisan win for students, teachers, and local communities,” Cavitt said. “Now that our snow day forgiveness plan is law, school districts can end the school year when it makes the most sense for them. There will be no state mandate forcing districts to remain open for weeks into the summer and foot all the corresponding bills that would come along with the extended school year.”
Cavitt said schools don’t budget for facility costs in June, and that teachers and students line up summer work opportunities well before the school year ends. Districts also typically plan facility maintenance during that time due to the lack of students in the buildings.
“For all these reasons, it didn’t make sense to force schools into hosting mandatory summer school,” Cavitt said. “The ice storm threw everything out of whack. I’m glad we didn’t let it ruin summertime too.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GnSfcm9WoAAA20G-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-06-03 09:05:59.069746

(Photo by Zach Sommers for Iowa Capital Dispatch)A federally funded health care center in central Iowa has terminated core care for its transgender patients for fear of losing federal funding, four sources have confirmed.
In a letter sent to transgender patients receiving hormone replacement therapy, and obtained by the Iowa Capital Dispatch, Primary Health Care stated in February it would no longer provide hormone replacement therapy care “(d)ue to a recent Executive Order restricting use of federal grant funds from being used for gender-affirming care.” PHC in the letter told patients that should the health center be “out of compliance” with the order, it would risk losing “critical” and “significant” funding.
A former PHC employee, who spoke with the Iowa Capital Dispatch on the condition of anonymity, said PHC’s executive team told employees the health center risked “losing millions of dollars in federal grant funding for the homeless support services” if it continued gender-affirming care. The Iowa Capital Dispatch granted anonymity because the former employee feared potential repercussions from PHC.
A transgender advocate and another person with knowledge of the change, both of whom spoke to Iowa Capital Dispatch on the condition they not be identified, also confirmed that PHC had ended gender-affirming care.
Primary Health Care is a federally qualified health center, which means it receives funding from the federal government through the Health Resources and Services Administration under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. FQHCs were created in the early 1990s to serve as safety net providers. They care for underserved populations. PHC is one of 14 in the state.
Representatives of Primary Health Care and Iowa Primary Care Association, which provides broad support for Iowa’s FQHCs, did not respond to repeated questions that were posed to executives, board members, and physicians during multiple weeks of outreach.
The former employee said staff at PHC were “begging” the executive team to figure out different funding methods for the clinic in order to keep providing gender-affirming care.
“The basis of Primary Health Care and the Project is the queer community … and how could we possibly continue to be that if we’re telling part of that population that (they) don’t belong (at PHC)?” the former employee said.
Only one other federally qualified health center in Iowa responded when asked whether other care centers were following PHC’s lead in terminating care for transgender patients. Chad Wolbers, chief executive officer at Crescent Community Health Center in Dubuque, said that’s not happening at his health centers. When asked if Crescent Community currently has transgender patients, Wolbers said, “Yes we do. We take care of all that present to us in need of care.”
Consulting firm cites confusion over executive orders
A principal with FQHC Associates, a consulting firm for FQHCs nationally, acknowledged the confusion over federally funded health care centers’ ability to provide gender-affirming care to patients. Steve Weinman pointed to two executive orders President Donald Trump signed in the early days of his administration.
One executive order deals with stopping transition care for children and teenagers through 18 years of age. The other executive order, which Trump signed the day he took office, is meant to “defend women’s rights” and “recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.” In doing so, the Trump administration takes aim at gender ideology and the “false claim” of being able to change one’s sex. Through that lens, the executive order directs agencies to “end the Federal funding of gender ideology” and that “Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.”
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told the Iowa Capital Dispatch that less than two weeks after the signing of that executive order, the Health Resources and Services Administration sent an email to its federal funds recipients that they must stop their programs related to “gender ideology” for “people aged 19 and younger.” Five days later, HRSA sent another email to tell recipients its previous “notification had been rescinded.” HHS told the Iowa Capital Dispatch that “Health centers continue to provide care to Americans who face challenges in accessing quality healthcare.”
When asked why PHC still moved to stop gender-affirming care when the federal agency told FQHCs to ignore its previous mandate, the former employee at PHC said that’s “the big question, and that’s what staff wanted to know. Why? Nothing is law…The only thing that we were being told is that they were scared to lose the federal funding that they had. Which, the amount of federal funding that they get for homeless support is a huge chunk.”
Lawmaker calls decision ‘deeply disappointing’

State Rep. Aime Wichtendahl, a Democrat of Hiawatha and the first transgender legislator elected to Iowa’s Legislature, said PHC’s decision to terminate hormone replacement therapy care is “deeply disappointing.”
She said “an executive order is not law. It is not force of law. And what the Trump administration is doing, withholding federal funds, is a violation of both the law and funds that Congress has appropriated.
“If the federal pressure has been removed, then they should immediately restore services and health care to trans patients. There is no justification for cutting off access to health care,” Wichtendahl said.
One patient who said she received hormone replacement therapy care at PHC’s University Avenue location said she felt “like all hell was breaking loose” when she learned about PHC’s decision. “It felt like the sanctuary that I had was kind of just crumbling beneath me. It was quite heart wrenching because I do love going to my doctor.” The patient requested to remain anonymous.
She said her provider at PHC was also emotional about the decision to terminate hormone replacement care. The former employee echoed that and said, “everyone seemed to be pretty emotional about the decision that had been made.” Not only was PHC stopping gender-affirming care, but the former employee claimed staff also had to remove or cross-out pronouns on their ID badges and business cards.
The messaging around PHC’s decision to end gender-affirming care was carefully managed, according to the former employee. The executive team at PHC handed staff a script with suggested responses to likely questions that patients or people wanting to establish care may ask. There were at least six potential questions and corresponding answers, according to a staff handout the Iowa Capital Dispatch reviewed.
PHC’s decision, made at the same time as Republican legislative efforts to roll back gender identity protections in the Iowa Civil Rights Act weighed heavily on both the former employee and the patient. “It’s such a common thing for trans people to not get ample HRT care, as well as HIV care. Not having good resources for that, it just really sucks,” said the patient.
Wichtendahl said now is the time for the transgender community to make its voices heard “and say you’re not taking away our health care.”
“We will make that demand that they restore those services,” she said.

As California grapples with a $12 billion budget deficit, that state’s peer-run phone service that provides free 24/7 mental health support to thousands of residents across the state could face deep funding cuts, or even a shutdown.
The California Peer Run Warm Line — which is different from 911 and the federal 988 mental health crisis line because it is intended for non-emergencies — receives an average of 20,000 calls, texts and chats a month from people seeking emotional support and mental health resources. In May, during mental Mental Health Awareness Month, the line received more than 40,000 calls and messages.
The Mental Health Association of San Francisco, or MHASF, oversees the line. It received funding in 2019 during the pandemic to expand its services statewide. From 2022 to 2025, the line operated on a total budget of $40 million, says CEO Mark Salazar. For the next three years, it has requested $15 million a year in renewed funding, or $45 million through 2028 — with most of the money going towards paying personnel.
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s latest budget plan, however, allocates $5 million in 2025-26 and beyond for the line. Because the funding wasn’t initially included in the governor’s January budget proposal, the money “reflects an increase,” according to Newsom spokesperson Elana Ross.
But with an annual budget of $5 million, Salazar says the service may have to cut its staff from 160 to 20. The phone service estimates that it saves Californians millions of dollars in health care costs by reducing callers’ visits to the emergency room or urgent care, while also freeing up resources for emergency responders.
Lori Padilla, a Central Valley resident who has worked at the line as a counselor for more than two years, says most calls during her overnight shift are from people who are experiencing loneliness, anxiety, panic attacks or chronic pain. 

Padilla: “I actually called the warm line a couple of times and went to the support groups at MHASF. The two together really changed my life. … It was just so refreshing to have someone on the other end of the phone that cared and actually listened.”

The line’s funding woes come during a time when California police departments are scaling back their own responses to mental health crisis calls. In addition to the state budget shortfall, California mental health services are in jeopardy due to Congress’ proposal to gut Medicaid spending by $700 billion.

Huntington gears up for book censorship vote

In a special election that underscores the culture wars roiling among some California cities, voters in Huntington Beach will decide next week whether to keep its newly formed citizen committee to review library books, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
In 2023 Huntington Beach’s city council created a review board that would screen library books for explicit and sexual content. Led by councilmember Gracey Van Der Mark, who is also running for state Assembly, the self-proclaimed “MAGA-nificent 7” members of the city council said the board would protect children from offensive content.
But critics argue that Van Der Mark targeted material related to the LGBTQ+ community. They championed a pair of ballot measures that, if passed, would roll back library restrictions. By late May, both sides poured more than $230,000 total in campaigning.

Erin Spivey, a former Huntington Beach librarian who quit because of city interventions: “It’s just so disheartening to see our city council turn this city against itself. People are getting really sick and tired of the city council overstepping what they are supposed to be doing. They’re supposed to be making our community better.”

28 bills later 🧟‍♂️

When the governor vetoes a bill, that typically means the proposal is dead for good. But some measures keep coming back again and again. 
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, of the more than 2,000 bills introduced this year, at least 80 of them are “zombie bills” — legislation that is similar or identical to ones Newsom or other governors spiked in previous years. About a quarter of those 80 were backed by either labor or business groups.
Though these bills add to the large number of measures legislators must wade through during each session, experts say it’s not necessarily a bad thing that bills are revived. Some ideas take time to gain political traction, and reintroducing proposals is one way to keep the conversation going.
Assembly Bill 33, backed by the Teamsters union, is one such example of a current zombie bill. It would ban California companies from deploying driverless trucks, and it’s being reconsidered by the Legislature after Newsom vetoed it last year. 

Peter Finn, the Western region vice president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters: “We’re right on this issue. The only person that’s wrong on this issue is the governor, and just because one person is choosing Big Tech over people and drivers doesn’t mean we should stop pursuing this issue.”

Huntington Beach comes to blows over library books,Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/huntington-beach-library-books-election/,Huntington Beach will vote next week on whether to repeal a community review board for library material. It’s a test of the conservative city council’s growing clout and the national movement to restrict access to sexual content in children’s books.,"In summary
Huntington Beach will vote next week on whether to repeal a community review board for library material. It’s a test of the conservative city council’s growing clout and the national movement to restrict access to sexual content in children’s books.


The simmering battle over the public library in Huntington Beach erupted again this spring when provocative signs cropped up around town overnight.
“Protect our kids from porn,” the placards warned in bold red letters. Funded by a city councilmember’s political action committee, they urged people to vote against a pair of ballot measures in an upcoming special election, including one that would abolish a controversial new community review board for library books.
As parents dropping off their children spotted the blunt message near elementary schools that April morning, outrage began to spread online over the delicate explanations it required for kids who were far too young to understand. One man declared on social media that he cut the word “porn” out of 12 signs and delivered the pieces to city hall.
“Frankly, it reads more like a tactic to provoke than a message grounded in conservative values, and that’s something I believe we should rise above,” the man said in a video posted to a popular Facebook forum.
Now, with only a week remaining before the election, proponents of the ballot measures to roll back library restrictions are hoping enough of those frustrated, weary parents in this Orange County beach community show up to carry them to victory.
The election — the culmination of nearly two years of tense clashes over sexual content in children’s books, parental rights and censorship — carries the weight of more than just the future of the local library.
An ascendant political movement, led by the self-proclaimed “MAGA-nificent 7” members of the city council, has in recent years turned Huntington Beach into the bulwark of conservative resistance to California’s progressive governance and a hotbed of nationally resonant culture wars, including on vaccines, Pride flags and voter ID.
As complaints about obscene material being available to young readers dragged even the once-beloved library into the fray, the increasingly marginalized liberal residents of Huntington Beach have mobilized — and floundered. Not unlike the national Democratic Party, which has grappled with how to counteract the full-throttle early months of President Donald Trump’s second term, their struggle to curb the breakneck transformation of their city’s identity have left many wondering how far the council can push its revolution.
“It’s just a war being waged on the community by people in an attempt to gain power,” said Natalie Moser, a former member of a liberal council minority who was ousted in November. She has criticized the Huntington Beach conservatives for reframing all of city politics as a partisan fight. “People are easier to manipulate when they’re divided, when they don’t see each other as people but just another side.”

The most optimistic believe the “protect our kids from porn” signs could be a turning point, waking up apolitical voters and swaying moderates in this Republican-leaning community to reject the restrictions on library material. If the ballot measures pass next week, they hope it will send a signal that residents want the city council to refocus on the fundamentals of municipal governance — public safety, road maintenance and economic development.
“It’s just so disheartening to see our city council turn this city against itself,” said Erin Spivey, one of several Huntington Beach librarians who quit in the past two years because of city interventions that they considered repressive. “People are getting really sick and tired of the city council overstepping what they are supposed to be doing. They’re supposed to be making our community better.”
‘Let the community decide’ on kids books
Amid a surging national book banning movement, the debate arrived in Huntington Beach two summers ago, when then-new Councilmember Gracey Van Der Mark — a locally notorious activist who made it her cause célèbre to get what she deems sexual content out of the children’s section — first proposed reviewing and restricting access to certain library material.
Van Der Mark is alarmed by a contemporary wave of picture books and sex education manuals that she feels goes far beyond what is appropriate for young readers and could damage kids who accidentally encounter the material before they are ready.
“The last thing you want is a child to pick up a book and have a big picture of penises or instructions for how to masturbate,” she said in an interview.
The city council eventually adopted an ordinance establishing a 21-member community board to review library books for “textual or graphic references to sex, sexual organs, sex acts, relationships of sexual nature, or sexual relations in any form.” The board would have the authority to move the material to the adult section or prevent the library from purchasing it in the first place, though it has yet to be seated, in part because of a subsequent state law prohibiting these types of committees.
Van Der Mark compares the concept to the movie ratings system, arguing that it would empower parents by giving them more say in what their children read. She complained that librarians who reject the community input because they believe they know better are elitist.
“Librarians are human. They are human. They are not perfect, just like you and I are not perfect. Mistakes are going to be made,” she said. “Let the community decide. Let the community give their input on whether they think those books meet their community standards.”
But the opposition to library book restrictions has been fierce and sustained, frequently spilling into long, rancorous public comment sessions at city council meetings. Free speech advocacy groups have joined, including the ACLU, which filed a lawsuit earlier this year.
Critics say they fear the book review committee would allow the city council to assert more control over the library and eventually ban material that doesn’t align with its conservative views.
They are especially concerned that many of the books Van Der Mark and her allies have singled out are LGBTQ-themed. Some see warning signs in the recent cancellation of a library book club for gay novel “The Guncle” and a Facebook post by another city councilmember tying the “dramatic alarming rise” in LGBTQ identification among young people to the “explosion of LGBTQ+ literature.”
“What they’re trying to do is exert their moral standards on others — and that’s unacceptable in society,” said Gina Clayton-Tarvin, a member of a local school district board that endorsed the ballot measures. “This is almost like attacking what is American.”
Lindsay Klick, a Huntington Beach parent and a longtime librarian in Orange County, said library collections should be expansive, so that everyone can find books that interest them and decide for themselves what they want to read.
“The library is not a winner-take-all thing like an election,” she said. 
She criticized the city council for manufacturing outrage over sexual content in the library by selectively highlighting small excerpts from books out of their context, as if cropping the crotch from a picture of the statue of David.

It’s an effective strategy for politicians looking to raise their profiles as they seek higher office; Van Der Mark, who launched a bid for state Assembly last month, is the latest.
But it’s not a true reflection of how library patrons feel, Klick said, like at the small Orange County branch where she works near the Air Force base in Los Alamitos, which has the same books that the Huntington Beach city council has objected to.
“No one complains. It’s not a problem,” she said. “Why? Because we don’t have Gracey Van Der Mark.”
Ground zero in the national book battle
A special election in Huntington Beach carries high stakes for the national battle over children’s library books.
Library supporters collected thousands of signatures last fall for the pair of ballot measures; the second would limit the city’s ability to outsource library services, after the city council briefly explored privatizing the library last year. The council called a special election for June 10, rather than adopting the proposals outright or placing them on the ballot in 2026.
The outcome has become deeply important for the conservatives backing the city council as well. The two sides collectively spent more than $230,000 on the campaign by late May.
National activist Karen England, whose organization pushes to remove “pornographic books” from schools, has been speaking at city council meetings and church services in recent weeks to help raise awareness for the ‘no’ campaign. She said this is the first ballot measure that she is aware of challenging a book removal policy at a public library and she worries that, if successful, it could become a model for librarians across the country to cut parents out of deciding what their children read.
“That’s what I’m fighting against. They don’t know best,” she said. “I do feel like this is ground zero.”
The campaign has gotten extremely heated, with each side accusing the other of using emotion and misinformation to whip residents into a confused frenzy about what they’re actually voting on. Proponents of the ballot measures mock the conservative city council for injecting more government into peoples’ lives. Opponents complain that they are hamstrung in making their case to voters, because the offending library material is so obscene that they cannot even show it on social media or the news.
But the tension reached a zenith with the “protect our kids from porn” signs, which furious library supporters say unfairly portrayed it as a place run by groomers and pedophiles.
“If they feel like there is porn in the library, they should come and arrest me. Because I personally handed ‘It’s Perfectly Normal’ to patrons,” the former librarian Spivey said, referring to one of the books that Huntington Beach has moved out of the children’s section. “I wish they would, because it would show the community that what they’re doing is a lie.”
Van Der Mark, the architect of the library book review committee, said critics are simply trying to distract from the pornographic nature of the challenged books.
“You’re offended by the word (porn) but not the actual material,” she said.

Yet despite the heightened significance that both sides place on the special election, neither seems ready to stand down if they lose. The ACLU lawsuit is still in court, and many Huntington Beach conservatives say they could never accept the challenged books being available in the children’s section of the library.
Casey McKeon, another city councilmember heavily involved in the library debate, said he is frustrated by how vehemently some people have pushed back against the book review board, even though the council “did this the right way” — through its policymaking process, because local parents were upset about the material.
“So we’re not supposed to fix an issue if it’s quote-unquote social or cultural?” he said.
The conservative city council members are leading Huntington Beach exactly the way that voters elected them to, McKeon said, and while the pace of the changes may upset some people, the council cannot wait to fix what it sees is wrong with the city.
“You only get four years,” he said. “You don’t know if you’re going to get re-elected. You don’t have forever.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/053125-HBBookBan-ML-25.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-03 09:05:59.069746

(File photo by Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)Now that the U.S. House of Representatives has passed its version of the budget reconciliation bill, the U.S. Senate gets its turn to pass its own version.
Let’s look at how the House bill is projected to impact South Carolina’s ratepayers.
The Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) released a study May 15 by NERA Economics Consulting that projects electricity bills for businesses in South Carolina would increase by 17.1%, while residential electricity bills would increase by 11.5% between 2026 and 2032 if Congress repeals “technology neutral” clean-energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Under the bill passed by the House on May 22, energy projects would have to be underway practically immediately to collect the credits. Construction would have to begin within 60 days of the bill’s passage and produce electricity by the end of 2028.
South Carolina’s residential and small business ratepayers are already struggling financially due to the effects of inflation. The new tariffs on foreign imports that have been imposed by the current administration are projected to raise consumer prices even higher.
But higher electric bills are not the only adverse consequences for repealing the credits.
If the “big, beautiful bill” eliminates all federal tax credits for renewable energy, South Carolina’s residents and small businesses will not only suffer from increased electricity bills but would lose 4,860 jobs and suffer a $620 million decrease in our state’s gross domestic product, according to the NERA study.
A better solution would be for the Senate to preserve the Inflation Reduction Act’s federal tax credits to bring more affordable sources of energy like solar with battery storage.
The traditional knock on solar is that it’s intermittent. Investor-owned utilities claim that solar is not available at night or on cloudy days. But if solar is paired with battery storage, that would make additional power available when needed to meet unexpected demand.
Expanding energy efficiency programs also makes good financial sense.
Energy efficiency programs would help reduce South Carolina’s need to build more new generating plants which would help in reducing ratepayers’ electric bills.
But investor-owned utilities had rather build expensive nuclear and gas plants because they result in higher profits for their shareholders. That’s exactly why the utility companies aren’t enthusiastic about expanding energy efficiency programs or connecting more renewable energy to the grid.
This House bill would also add trillions more to our federal debt.
Several U.S. senators are already complaining about how this House bill would increase our national debt.
In April, GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune arguing against the repeal of energy tax credits.
These senators pointed out that the House bill would undermine the administration’s efforts to increase manufacturing here in the United States. They also expressed concerns that repealing the credits would cause an immediate increase in electric utility bills.
Let’s hope that the Senate will carefully examine these flaws in the House bill.
The best path forward for our state and our nation is for Congress to keep the original investment tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act to incentivize additional renewable energy.
It’s just common sense to incentivize investments in lower-cost energy projects.
Investments in renewable energy will help reduce the federal debt, reduce wasteful spending, reduce harmful emissions and create thousands of new clean energy jobs in South Carolina.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/solar-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-03 09:05:59.069746

(Photo courtesy of Food Bank for the Heartland)People in Marsha Keene’s community are already struggling to cover the basics.
Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.
Hunger relief group says it’s facing a $2.5 million budget shortfall due to federal cuts

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.










The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.


– Marsha Keene, CEO of the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in Missouri




In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.


She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
‘I’d probably close the doors’
The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.
But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.
Two SD lawmakers join push to ban soda and candy purchases from food assistance program

Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.
States on the hook for billions under U.S. House GOP bill making them help pay for SNAP

In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
‘It’s time to sound the alarm’
Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.
Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

The state’s budget expires in 27 days and legislators are back in town to make sure there’s a spending plan in place July 1 to avoid a government shutdown.
Leadership unveiled budget “allocations” Monday night that show how the Legislature will spend about $50 billion in general revenue, or state funds, across various government agencies. Most of the money will go to two areas: education and health care with the former receiving more than $22 billion and the latter about $17.5 billion.

The budget will also include 2% pay raises for roughly 100,000 state employees. 
Those workers won’t have to worry about increased health insurance costs either because the chambers have agreed to pump hundreds of millions into the state employee health insurance trust fund to keep it solvent in lieu of increasing costs for state workers.
As a reminder, monthly premiums for most employees are set at $50 a month for individuals and $180 a month for families. Senior-level employees have an even better deal on their monthly premiums: $8.34 for individuals and $30 a month for family plans.
The pay raises were first reported by Florida Politics and confirmed in a statement the Senate released from Sen. Cory Simon, a Republican whose district includes Leon County, home to the state government and tens of thousands of its employees. 
Simon praised Senate President Ben Albritton and Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Ed Hooper for the investment in state employees calling it “important for recruitment, retention, and morale.”
“Florida has one of the lowest per capita populations of state workers in the country. We have a lean, but strong and talented state workforce, and it’s important to me that we invest in maintaining top talent to serve the people of our state. 
“A pay raise for our hardworking and dedicated state employees has been a priority of the Senate throughout the entire budget process. The allocations finalized last week include funding for a 2% across the board pay increase for state workers ($1000 minimum). Also important, what often goes unseen is the significant investment the state is making in state employee health insurance. Again this year, employees are being held harmless from increases in premiums and copays,” Simon said in the statement.
“As we move forward into the conference, the Senate will continue to prioritize additional targeted increases for law enforcement, firefighters, and other professions where we need to further increase salaries to remain competitive with the private sector.”

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) As Utah’s capital city has faced pressure from state leaders to crack down on crime, camping and drugs, Salt Lake City’s new police chief is seeking a nearly $15 million — or 12.4% — bump to the Salt Lake City Police Department’s budget. 
Chief Brian Redd — whom Mayor Erin Mendenhall appointed earlier this year to replace former police Chief Mike Brown after she pushed him to retire — gave his first budget presentation in front of the Salt Lake City Council on Thursday, when he made his case for an increase to the city police force’s budget. 
“We understand this is a flat budget year and a challenging year,” Redd told council members, acknowledging that his request may be tough for city leaders to fund based on projected revenues, but he thanked them for considering his proposal.
Corrections director Brian Redd recommended as Salt Lake City’s new police chief

Redd asked that city leaders consider bringing the Salt Lake City Police Department’s budget from $120 million this year to $135 million for the 2026 fiscal year, which begins July 1. The vast majority of his request — more than $13.3 million — would be for a roughly 8.7% increase to police wages and benefits that were negotiated through union agreements. 
Additionally, the increase would continue to fund 12 new police officer positions that city leaders recently approved to create two squads dedicated to patrolling the Jordan River Trail and surrounding neighborhoods — areas that have been impacted by homelessness issues and illegal camping. 
Notably, Redd’s request did not include any more full-time officer positions on top of the 12 that were added in the middle of the budget year. Currently, the Salt Lake City Police Department has 779 full-time employees. That includes 630 sworn officers and 149 civilian staff positions, according to city documents. 
  Source: Salt Lake City Council
Of those positions, about 45 sworn officer roles are currently vacant, up from 22 vacant positions in January 2024, when the department was authorized to staff up to 608 officers. After the department’s authorized officer staffing increased to 630, the number of vacant positions also increased, “reflecting the ongoing challenge of recruiting to meet expanding personnel needs,” according to a city staff report. 
“The Department is prioritizing the filling of these vacancies and has initiated a refinement of its sworn recruitment strategy,” the staff report says, “including expanding the recruitment team, streamlining the hiring and onboarding process, and allowing candidates to begin onboarding immediately following successful background checks.”
More money for a new ‘intelligence hub’ and drones
The budget proposal also includes $519,350 in one-time money and $35,325 in ongoing money to fund a Real Time Crime Center (RTCC) — which is envisioned to be a “centralized intelligence hub that leverages real-time data to enhance proactive policing, threat detection, and emergency response,” according to the staff report. 
State leaders call SLC police ‘ineffective,’ urge mayor to act — or state will step in 

Redd said police officials are hoping to better utilize technology, “primarily cameras and license plate readers that will help us reduce crime, respond to crime more quickly and efficiently when it occurs.” 
“By integrating data streams from public safety cameras, drone footage, and other analytical tools, the RTCC will support smarter deployment decisions, more effective threat assessments, enhanced response times, and improved patrol planning across the city,” the report continues, adding that it “directly supports the goals outlined” in the mayor’s public safety plan.
Once up and running, the RTCC is envisioned to “triage calls for service using live feeds and real-time analysis, allowing the Department to tailor its response strategies based on up-to-the-minute information,” the staff report says. “The Center will also enable integration with fixed public safety cameras and drone video streams, and it is expected to expand into real-time
monitoring of social media platforms as part of the Department’s evolving threat management efforts.”
Redd is also asking the City Council to use $95,000 in one-time money and $53,550 in ongoing money to fund a new “drone as first responder” program, which would be designed to “utilize drones as an initial response tool in place of an in-person officer dispatch when appropriate.” 
“This model allows for rapid assessment of scenes, provides real-time situational awareness to responding officers, and enables more efficient use of Department resources — particularly in instances where a physical presence may not be necessary,” the city staff report says.

The Salt Lake City Police Department has already been testing using drones to help officers. It launched a pilot program on Jan. 1, and since then the police department has conducted more than 420 drone deployments, according to the staff report. So far, they’ve only been used to “assess low-priority calls, such as 911 hang-ups, reports of suspicious activity, and incidents later determined to be unfounded.” 
Redd said he’s asking for funding to set up a new program to “actually deploy drones to active calls.” 
‘Fed up’: SLC mayor answers Utah leaders’ call for plan to ‘restore public safety’

Through an expanded drone program, department leaders hope to improve response times, offer better real-time information to officers, and free up more officers for “high-priority emergencies” while reducing the number of officers needed on scene in certain situations. 
“This is also a great de-escalation tool,” Redd said, adding that “the drone can go ahead of the officers to identify, does this person have a weapon? Are there citizens around? What do we do with traffic? So this is something we want to build out in the future.” 
Redd said the current budget request would act as “seed funding to really get this program off the ground,” and he added that “we will likely be coming back” with more budget requests in the future, not only for more drones but potentially for more full-time positions to support the program. 
“Ultimately what we hope is that investment will reduce the need to send officers to certain calls, or if we send officers, have eyes on before officers get to the situation for de-escalation purposes and safety purposes for our officers and the public,” Redd said. 
City Council warmly receives Redd’s proposal, but wants discussion on privacy
City Council member Alejandro Puy said he was supportive of the request, but also urged city leaders to be cautious and mindful when it comes to privacy concerns if they’re going to proceed with an expanded drone program. 
“Now, it seems to me that as a department we are evolving and growing and using new technologies,” Puy said, adding that more cameras, a monitoring center and “more drones” could open up “a lot of potential problems.”

“The only way I feel like approving this is (if) there’s a legislative intent from our side to have a deep policy discussion for the use, the monitoring, of drones and cameras, accounting for civil liberties questions, the privacy, the right of privacy, also accountability, transparency, all of these things that need to be in policy,” Puy said. “Because if not, we are probably walking ourselves into a problem waiting to happen.” 
While Puy added “it’s important to approve this,” he said city leaders need to ensure “people using it know what is appropriate and what is not. … All of these potential things that could go wrong, (but) also highlighting for our neighbors the use of this and how it could go right.” 
Redd said his department is already “working on that” with the mayor’s office, “and would love to engage all of you and also your communities that you represent.” He added that “we’re also engaged at the state level, with the state’s data privacy officer and legislators are also looking at this.” 
“We want to get it right,” Redd said. “That’s important.” 
The Salt Lake City Council has until the end of June to finalize the budget for the coming fiscal year, which begins July 1.

Republican voters will have the choice between Heather Doyle, Clint Hollingsworth, Dan McWhorter and Cindy Myrex on July 15. The lone Democratic candidate, Matt Glover, will advance to the general election on Oct. 28 against the winner of the special election primary. If one Republican candidate does not receive 50% of votes, the special runoff election will take place on Aug. 12.
Former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April after he was absent for much of the 2025 legislative session. All interviewed candidates said they are running for office for Cullman County representation in Montgomery. 
“You didn’t ask how anybody that lives there, how they felt about it,” Doyle said. “This is our community, like we live there. This is going to affect us.”
“My plan is to represent the folks in this district like I have my constituents with the city,” Hollingsworth said. “I’m gonna work hard for them, just like what I’ve done for the last 17 years on the city council, for the folks here that voted for me.”
“I didn’t think we were getting much representation on the issues that I thought were important, so I figured I’d get involved,” McWhorter said.
Efforts to schedule an interview with Myrex were not successful.
Doyle, Glover and McWhorter also expressed opposition to SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills. It was signed by Gov. Kay Ivey on May 7 and allowed the City of Cullman to annex a resort on Smith Lake in Cullman County, a dry county, for the resort to serve alcohol. 
“I mean, there’s nothing I can do about that, even though I know that’s the main concentration for the election. I just think it’s wrong,” Doyle said.
“We’re exploring what it would take to rescind the legislation,” McWhorter said.
Glover’s first priority in his campaign is giving the people more power, which he said was not present when the legislation passed.
The Republican primary
Doyle, 43, is a former teacher and realtor in the Smith Lake area of Cullman County. She wants to reform the court system, inspired by an ongoing custody battle in her personal life that she declined to explain because of potential implications in the litigation.
“I think we just need a better system, like something for inmates to even go to rehab,” she said in an interview Monday. “I just think we need to do something better.”
She also wants to reduce wasteful spending and government overreach by reviewing where state taxpayer dollars are going.
“I think we need to look closer at the budget and what we’re spending and the programs,” she said.
Finally, she wants to improve education in the state and be a voice for children in education and in custody battles.
“They don’t get like issues that are going on with the court system, with kids, it’s just not a man thing. They’re not worried about kids, and they’re not worried about women,” she said. “And I just think we’ve got a lot of things going on with juveniles in the court system that I think just needs to be handled differently.”
The first-time candidate said she is the best for the job because she will not rely on the politics of lawmaking to pass legislation. 
“Nobody’s going to be able to bribe me, I don’t owe anybody a favor,” she said. “I really think this is how politics work.”
Hollingsworth, 47, owns a used car dealership in Cullman. He said in an interview on May 27 that he is prioritizing education and work force development.
“Investing in public education and job training programs is vital to prepare our students for future employment opportunities,” he said.
He also said he wants the state to support volunteer fire departments more. There are 983 volunteer fire departments in the state, 23 of which are in Cullman County, according to the Alabama Forestry Commission.
“There’s 17 in this district that I’m running for, and I want to help with funding and training and just trying to get people willing to serve and help their community,” Hollingsworth said.
He also said he wants to improve transportation infrastructure.
“Reliable transportation is essential for employment, education and our health care,” he said. “Not just the county roads, but even 65 and interstate highways just need upgrades for sure.”
The former Cullman County City Councilman said he is the best candidate because of his tenure on city council, which he has served on since 2008.
“It’s a new challenge for me, but it encompasses areas that I’m already kind of used to,” he said. “I’m just looking forward to helping and serving more people.”
McWhorter, 68, has been a sales manager for Innovative Analytical Solutions in Bremen, Alabama, for a decade. McWhorter said in an interview on May 21 that his main priority is to implement a property tax cap for property owners who are at least 65 years old.
“Property ownership is either a right or it’s a privilege,” McWhorter said. “So if it’s a right, we don’t tax free speech, right? So why are you taxing my property?”
Aside from that, McWhorter also wants a “clean lottery bill” that would fund two years of tuition at technical colleges. The legislature failed to pass a comprehensive gaming bill in 2024, and the House rejected any attempts at another from the Senate this year.
“The second one is a clean lottery bill that’ll fund two-year college tuition, or two years of college tuition for any high school graduate with a C average,” he said.
Lastly, McWhorter wants to completely eliminate the tax on overtime, which is set to expire on June 30. He also mentioned eliminating daylight savings time as a goal.
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, an original supporter of the bill, has said the exemption created a larger hole in the Education Trust Fund (ETF) than expected. President Donald Trump has advocated for a national exemption in his second term.
The lone Democrat
Glover, 40, served on the Good Hope City Council from 2012-2016. He wants to prioritize local power. 
“Returning power to local communities, like just trying to wrestle away some of the power that the state government has taken from like local cities and towns, which plays in with SB 322,” Glover said in an interview on May 23.
He also said he opposes HB 445, sponsored by Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest, which was signed into law on May 14. The bill requires testing and labeling for all consumable hemp products and caps at 10 milligrams per individually wrapped product and 40 milligrams per package. It will require the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board to license retailers of these products, restrict retail establishments selling hemp products and impose an excise tax on consumable hemp products.
“With the amount of jobs that I think that’s going to cost, and the amount of like, government overreach that is involved with it is pretty disgusting,” he said.
Finally, Glover wants to advocate for direct ballot initiatives in order for Alabamians to have a say in a state lottery. Nineteen states have direct ballot initiatives, which allow citizens to propose constitutional amendments.
“A lot of that goes back to us not being able to get the lottery amendment on the ballot, like sports gambling, any number of things, but where they just won’t pass it in Montgomery to allow the citizens to vote,” he said.
Glover said he is running for office to show the people of the district that there are Democrats and that they deserve to be represented.
“We still exist. And I think there’s just a lack of enthusiasm and motivation,” he said. “When you see a statewide ballot with no Democrats running, it makes people less likely to turn out, and then it looks like that they’re just not there.”

Aretha Franklin, the “Queen of Soul,” hits No. 1 on the Billboard singles chart with her cover of Otis Redding’s song “Respect.” She changed the lyrics and transformed the tune, which became a powerful anthem for both women and the civil rights movement. 
Asked about her boldness in pushing for these rights through song, Franklin told the Detroit Free Press, “I don’t think it’s bold at all. I think it’s quite natural that we all want respect—and should get it.” 
She received two Grammy Awards for the song, and Rolling Stone ranked her recording as the greatest song of all time. In February 1968, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave her an award, and only two months later, she would sing at his funeral. 
Frranklin went on to sell more than 75 million records, including her live album, “Amazing Grace,” one of the best-selling gospel albums of all time, which is also captured in a riveting documentary. 
Before her death in 2018, she was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Jennifer Hudson portrayed her in a biopic.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06104614/Aretha-Franklin-June3-FeatImage.jpg,,,2025-06-03 09:05:59.069746
,California,2025-06-03 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Los Angeles County’s chief executive will be one of California’s most powerful political gigs,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/los-angeles-county-powerful-ceo/,"A minor miracle occurred when Los Angeles County voters last year approved several governance reforms, including creating an elected county executive, a position that would be second in California's real-world power only to governor.","After California became a U.S. state in 1850, its Legislature grappled with how state and local governments would be structured. One decree was that counties, beginning with Los Angeles, would have five-member boards of supervisors.
Almost everything about California’s governance has changed in the last 175 years — even the size of its Legislature, which an 1879 constitutional amendment set at 80 members in the Assembly and 40 in the Senate.
With one exception, the city and county of San Francisco, California’s counties have had five-member governing boards ever since, including tiny Alpine County, with scarcely 1,000 residents, and Los Angeles, with nearly 10 million.
That’s going to change. Last year, after decades of unsuccessful efforts to overhaul how Los Angeles County is governed, a minor miracle occurred when its voters approved an expansion of its Board of Supervisors to nine members after the 2030 census. It was miraculous not only that it occurred but that the reform was proposed by the current board itself — albeit not unanimously — in a remarkable display of willingness to dilute members’ powers. 
Even more stunningly, the ballot measure also made a quantum reduction in the board’s powers by creating the elective office of county executive with potentially sweeping authority to govern the county, much as California’s governor or a big city mayor does.
Given Los Angeles County’s immense population exceeds all but 10 states, as well as its outsized economic, cultural and political weight, the ballot measure instantly created a position that would be second in real-world power only to the governorship. The occupant would automatically become a potential governor or U.S. senator.
The exact extent of the county executive’s authority, however, was not spelled out in the ballot measure. Instead, Measure G created a 13-member Governance Reform Task Force that will recommend the details of implementing its provisions, including the county executive’s authority.
The task force, reflecting the county’s extremely diverse economic, cultural and political communities, held its first meeting last week and the executive’s powers were a preoccupation of its members, some of whom opposed Measure G.
As the Los Angeles Times’ account of the meeting put it, “Should the chief executive be able to hire and fire department heads? What are the veto powers? How much control will the executive have over the county’s purse strings?”
The Times quoted Marcel Rodarte, a task force member who heads the California Contract Cities Association, as worrying about a bombastic executive “running amok and burning bridges unnecessarily,” adding, “It’s a possibility it could happen. I want to make sure that those nine supervisors have the ability to rein in the CEO.”
Rodarte’s members, which comprise dozens of small Los Angeles cities, contract with the county for such things as police patrols and fire protection, so they are concerned about who will be sitting across the table in contract negotiations. County employee unions expressed similar reservations about labor contracts.
One of the big questions is whether the county executive will have a term limit.
Governors, legislators and other state officeholders have term limits. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s second term will end in 19 months and has publicly cited the impending end of his governorship in seeking action on his priority issues.
As it stands, the county executive will not be term-limited, and that potentially looms large in the task force’s recommendations for amending the county charter.
There’s not a lot of room for protracted debates among task force members because the first county executive will be elected in 2028. Every ambitious Los Angeles politician will be weighing a campaign and everyone needs to know what the winner can — and cannot — do after being inaugurated.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/060620-Kenneth-Hahn-Hall-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-03 08:05:40.930799

The new timeline also allows committee members about five weeks to thoroughly review applications before public hearings begin.
About the Health Fund
Governor Thomas R. Carper signed Senate Bill 8 into law on July 20, 1999, creating the Delaware Health Fund to improve health care access and invest in long-term public health initiatives.
Authored by Senator Patricia M. Blevins, the legislation directed all funds received by Delaware through the national tobacco Master Settlement Agreement into a dedicated account for health-related purposes.
The law also established the Delaware Health Fund Advisory Committee (DHFAC), which will advise the Governor and General Assembly on how to allocate expected funds each fiscal year.
The committee’s recommendations will align with the fund’s core goals, which include expanding access to affordable health care, enhancing health infrastructure, promoting preventive care, and reducing tobacco and substance use.
Funds may also support innovative medical testing, treatment for lesser-known chronic diseases, and payment assistance programs for residents managing recurring medical costs.
To apply to Health Fund
Interested applicants must submit their materials electronically to James.Berryhill@delaware.gov, copying Susan.Bailey@delaware.gov.
All applications should be in PDF format and include the organization’s name at the beginning of the file name.
The Delaware Health Fund is supported by annual payments the state receives through the Master Settlement Agreement with participating tobacco manufacturers.
These funds support a range of public health initiatives across the state.

Kay Ivey delivers the State of the State address to the Alabama Legislature in Montgomery, Ala., on Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025. (Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)Gov. Kay Ivey appointed new members to the Alabama State Board of Veterans Affairs after a restructuring that gave the Governor’s Office more control over the state agency.
Ivey’s office announced in a news release Friday the 11 new members and four returning members of the newly constituted board, who include representatives from various Alabama veterans service organizations.
“I am proud to assemble a strong and wide-ranging Board of veterans to serve all of their fellow veterans,” Ivey said in the statement.

Four board members kept their positions in the newly constituted board: Deborah Walker and Charles Waugh from the Disabled American Veterans; retired Colonel Anne Toms of the Military Officers Association of America and retired Colonel Scott Gedling of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who served as the Board’s vice chair.
New appointees include retired Colonel Larry Vannoy, retired Colonel Walter Kozak and John Keen, Jr. of American Legion; Jeffrey Fisher of American Veterans; Sergeant Brandi Whitman of Disabled American Veterans; John Burks of Marine Corps League; Michael Urquhart of Military Officers Association of America; Lorenzo Nathan of Military Order of the Purple Heart; Robert Schmidbauer of The Veterans of Foreign Wars; Michael Davis of Vietnam Veterans of America and retired Colonel Lori Rasmussen of the U.S. Air Force.
The appointments come after the passage of SB 67, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Jones, R-Centre, in March, which overhauled the Department of Veterans Affairs. While the legislation kept the board at its current size of 17 members, it removed its power to enact policies and rules, making it an advisory role to the governor’s office. The new law also grants the governor the authority to appoint the agency’s commissioner. Proponents of the restructuring argued that the bill was meant to improve services for Alabama’s veterans, saying it would “elevate” veterans’ needs.
The legislative change came after a contentious period between the governor and the previous board. Ivey had fired former Commissioner Kent Davis over a dispute concerning his management of federal grants. After Ivey demanded Davis’ resignation and his refusal to resign, the former board members voted to keep him in his post, stating they found no evidence of wrongdoing. Davis subsequently resigned, but an attorney for Davis has indicated the possibility of legal action.
Following the signing of the new law on March 18, Ivey appointed retired Brigadier General Jeffrey Newton as the new commissioner. Newton had been serving as the acting commissioner since Davis’s dismissal.

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Tha tha that’s all, folks!
The Nevada State Legislature channeled their inner “Looney Tunes” and ended this year’s session in dramatic fashion, with a Senate Republican-led filibuster and the death of several high-profile bills. Most prominent among the casualties was the heavily lobbied proposal to give $1.4 billion in transferable tax breaks to the film industry, as well as two of Gov. Joe Lombardo’s priority bills.
Lawmakers did, however, pass the constitutionally required budget bills, meaning no special session is required. That’s an improvement over the 2023 session when lawmakers were forced into a brief 1-day session to pass one of five budget bills.
As the clock ticked toward midnight on Monday, Lombardo’s crime bill and health care bill, as well as the Summerlin Studios film tax credit bill, appeared to have a chance at sprinting across the finish line.  But all three fell victim to Nevada’s constitutional rule that legislative sessions only last 120 days and must end precisely at midnight.
In the Senate, the Republican caucus chose to use a series of parliamentary motions to protest and delay votes on two last-minute resolutions introduced by Democrats. In the Assembly, there were less theatrics but a procedural rule delayed an immediate vote and the clock ran out.
Here’s a recap of what happened.
For a second time, film tax fizzles
Democratic Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui’s proposal to provide Sony Pictures Entertainment, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Howard Hughest Holdings with the largest public subsidy in state history went further in this year’s legislative session than a similar proposal did two years ago. But ultimately, Assembly Bill 238 met the same fate as its predecessor: It died in the Senate.
The bill would have massively expanded Nevada’s film tax credit program to support the build out and operation of a 31-acre film studio currently referred to as the Summerlin Studios. It was one of two film tax credit bills introduced this session. The other film tax credit bill, sponsored by Democratic State Sen. Roberta Lange, centered on a film studio in southwest Las Vegas. It received a committee hearing earlier in the session but never received a full floor vote. Both film studios were included in a combined bill in the 2023 session.
On Monday, Lange proposed an amendment to turn Jauregui’s bill into an interim study. The move came after lobbyists for Lange’s film tax credit bill unsuccessfully pushed for the two bills to be merged into one.
Sony Pictures executives have said Summerlin Studios is “shovel ready” but contingent on the approval of a massive expansion of the state’s film tax credit program. It was not immediately clear Monday how the developer and film studios will proceed.
Lombardo’s priorities
Going into the session, Lombardo announced he would introduce five “priority bills” — on education, housing, crime, health care, and economic development. At sine die, an amended version of the housing bill had inched across the finish line, and provisions of the education bill had passed after being amended into a competing omnibus education bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro.
The governor’s crime bill and health care bill looked as if they had a chance of passing in the last hour of the session. Both had been significantly amended, but ultimately failed.
Lombardo’s economic development bill had received a hearing May 22 but appeared to move very little after that.
A spokesperson for the governor declined to comment on the end of the legislative session or the prospect of a possible special session to consider his priority bills. Lombardo will likely shift his focus to signing or vetoing the dozens of bills now on his desk. He has 10 days to veto the bills or they automatically become law.
Legislative Commission controversy
Senate Concurrent Resolution 8 would have changed the partisan split of the Legislative Commission, according to Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus. The language of the resolution was not available on the Legislature’s website.
Titus said the caucus received the resolution 30 minutes prior to the vote. Democrats used parliamentary rules to cut off debate on the resolution.
Republicans responded with a confusing series of parliamentary motions that were overlapped with Democrats attempting to shut them down and move the proceedings along. Republican State Sen Ira Hansen called for voice votes to be retaken using the chamber’s electronic voting system. Republican State Sen. Lori Rogich at one point delayed voting electronically and when prompted to replied, “I’m thinking.”
After the clock struck midnight, there was a debate over whether any additional actions could be taken. Legislative Counsel Bureau staff offered a legal interpretation, but Republican Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony, who presides over the Senate, rejected it, saying he needed to see the explanation in writing.
The stalemate ended with Titus explaining the caucus’s protest and saying they were willing to move on.
“We will look at what we have as a body and as a minority moving forward in protest of what happened,” she said. “Unfortunately, it leaves a bad taste in what was otherwise a very good session.”
Titus told media the protest had nothing to do with any other bills. When asked if she thought the governor should call a special session, she said no.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PXL_20250603_070003737-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-03 08:05:40.930799

In a significant move toward reforming how public schools are funded in Delaware, the state’s Public Education Funding Commission voted Monday evening to adopt a hybrid funding framework, combining elements of the current unit-count system with a weighted block grant model.
The decision comes after months of deliberation involving educators, parent advocates, legislators, and community leaders.
The Commission, which was first formed in 2024 by the General Assembly, has spent the past year reviewing Delaware’s education funding system and exploring alternatives aimed at improving equity, transparency, and student outcomes.
READ: Christopher Coleman named Milford’s next City Manager
The newly approved hybrid model is designed to allocate additional funding to students with greater needs, including those from low-income families, English learners, and students with disabilities.
It also includes dedicated funding for educator positions based on student demographics and statewide salary guidelines.
Funding Commission’s decision
In addition to endorsing the hybrid model, the Commission voted on four other key provisions:

Implementation Plan: A three- to five-year transition plan will be developed, ensuring that no local education agency (LEA) sees a reduction in funding during the phase-in.
Local Wealth Considerations: The group will continue studying how to adjust for local revenue disparities, with an eye on reforms to equalization and state-local funding shares.
Ongoing Oversight: A permanent advisory body composed of parents, educators, and community leaders will be established to review the funding system regularly.
Community Engagement: A statewide outreach campaign, including town halls and focus groups, will gather public input. At least one event will be held in each county, with data shared transparently to illustrate the impact of proposed changes.

These recommendations will inform the next phase of modeling and analysis, which will evaluate how the changes could affect individual schools and districts across the state.
The Commission, which continues under the 153rd General Assembly, is expected to serve as a long-term advisory body to ensure Delaware’s education funding system evolves to meet the needs of all students.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Aimee Loiter: A Jewish connection through bar and bat mitzvah and why it matters in today’s world.","This commentary is by Aimee Loiter, education director at Temple Sinai in South Burlington.As the school year wraps up across Vermont, many parents are turning their thoughts toward summer plans and next year’s activities. For Jewish families, this is also the time to ask a deeper question: How will my child stay connected to their identity in a complicated world?There is perhaps no more powerful answer than the journey of becoming Bar or Bat Mitzvah.A Bar or Bat Mitzvah marks a young person’s transition into Jewish responsibility. But it is far more than a religious tradition. It’s a formative rite of passage that strengthens identity, builds confidence and offers a deep sense of belonging, especially vital at a time when the world feels increasingly uncertain.The Jewish community has been shaken once again by violence connected to a global rise in antisemitism. For Jewish children — especially those growing up in places like Vermont, where they may be one of just a few in their class — the headlines can feel isolating. But stepping into Jewish adulthood, surrounded by a community that sings with you, learns with you, and celebrates with you, can be a powerful antidote to fear.Early teen years are a time when kids begin asking, “Who am I?” and “Where do I fit in?” This is a crucial window for forming identity and building resilience. Taking on the challenge of learning to read Hebrew with its entirely different alphabet and sound system, interpreting ancient texts and offering personal reflections on God, justice or Jewish history isn’t just academic. It’s meaningful. It’s hard work. And it’s theirs.What’s especially beautiful about bar and bat mitzvah in Vermont is that there’s no pressure for lavish productions or over-the-top parties. Here, some of the most moving celebrations have been as simple as a picnic at Oakledge Park or a lunch of a child’s favorite foods — whether that’s lox and bagels or frosted pop tarts. The focus stays where it belongs: on the young person and the community that surrounds them.And unlike so many milestones today, this one isn’t competitive. A bar or bat mitzvah is not about being the best, but about being your best self. It is a declaration: I am part of this people, this story, this hope.For families wondering how to root their kids in something real, something joyful, something resilient, now is the time to start. Fall may feel far off, but Jewish learning and Jewish living thrive when we plan ahead.In a scary and uncertain world, giving your child the gift of a bar or bat mitzvah isn’t just about honoring tradition. It’s about offering connection, purpose and a path forward. It’s an anchor they can return to for life.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Aimee Loiter: A Jewish connection through bar and bat mitzvah and why it matters in today’s world.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-06-03 08:05:40.930799

Sampling and analysis by the ANR of surface waters, fish tissues and wastewater effluent revealed unacceptable levels of PFOS, a chemical with no known safe level of exposure. Other contaminants of concern also enter our lake waters every day.If the waters of Lake Memphremagog flowed from north to south, threatening the drinking water of so many thousands of Vermont citizens, Vermonters would expect nothing less than immediate action by Quebec to protect the health and safety of our citizens.A permanent ban, to the maximum extent possible, on chemical contamination of Lake Memphremagog is an action that would speak volumes and swiftly restore Quebec’s faith in our mutually respectful and beneficial relationship.There is a bill right now in the House Environment Committee, H.113, a bill that would draft a crisis response plan, assessing pollutants of concern and ways to mitigate them.

That’s according to estimates from the state and researchers at a left-leaning think tank. The cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, stem from a tax cut and spending package Republicans call their “big, beautiful bill.” This legislation passed the U.S. House on May 22 and still needs approval from the Senate before it can reach President Donald Trump’s desk. 
If more stringent work requirements in the bill take effect, about 79,000 people in Washington would be at risk of losing their benefits entirely, and 149,000 would be at risk of losing some SNAP benefits, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. The majority of those people live in eastern Washington or the Olympic Peninsula. 
The state’s Department of Social and Health Services estimates more than 900,000 people in Washington could see benefits reduced or eliminated if the bill is approved as written. 
“​​The expanded work requirements provision alone would risk more than 198,000 Washingtonians losing access to critical food benefits statewide,” said Adolfo Capestany, a spokesperson for the department. 
Around 10% of the state’s population receives SNAP benefits according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The majority of people affected by the cuts would be children, older adults, and people with disabilities.
“The bill would decrease the average monthly SNAP benefit for households by $55.95, from $331.58 per month to $275.63,” said Capestany. 
What’s proposed in the Republican bill is the largest cut in the program’s history, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Nationwide, the program would see a $300 billion, or roughly 30%, reduction.
Since SNAP was introduced, the federal government has fully funded the cost of the food benefits, while states are responsible for screening for eligibility and issuing benefits. States have paid roughly half the cost of administering the program. 
The bill would require additional work requirement screening and would try to shift more costs to states. Studies have shown that work requirements do not boost employment, but do pose challenges for people trying to access benefits. 
At minimum under the Republican proposal, states would be required to pay 5% of SNAP benefits starting in 2028. States that exceed certain thresholds in making errors distributing SNAP payments would have to pay more.
“Washington would be required to backfill hundreds of millions of dollars in reduced federal funding annually,” Capestany said. 
State error rates vary from year to year, which could create challenges in the state’s annual budget process. The addition of the work requirement would increase states’ administrative burden and increase the risk of errors, according to the report. 
Capestany noted that the SNAP cuts Republicans are considering would trickle down to the economy and could decrease the amount flowing to Washington businesses, like grocers and retailers, by an estimated $360 million a year.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/groceries-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-06-03 07:04:45.517794

(Ormat press photo)Three proposed geothermal projects in Nevada will be among the first fast-tracked under the Trump administration’s new streamlined environmental review process, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced last week.
Under the new process hailed by Interior Secretary Doug Burhum in April, environmental assessments for small-scale projects will be limited to just 14 days — a sharp contrast to the typical year or more. Full environmental impact statements for more complex projects, which usually take up to 2 years, will now be finalized in just 28 days.
During his first month in office President Donald Trump proclaimed an “energy emergency” as grounds for fast-tracking lengthy environmental reviews and permitting processes for energy projects deemed critical to national security.
Conservation groups have blasted what they see as a circumvention of bedrock environmental laws on the basis of Trump decreeing an “emergency.”
But Burgum, in a statement, said  “by cutting red tape and advancing President Trump’s American Energy Dominance agenda, we’re fast-tracking reliable energy projects while strengthening national security and supporting American workers.”
Environmental assessments for the three Nevada projects — all proposed by Ormat Nevada — will be completed within a 14 day timeframe, according to Interior’s May 29 statement.
Those projects include the Diamond Flat Geothermal Project near Fallon; the McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project in Lander County; and the Pinto Geothermal Project along the Oregon-Nevada border.  
Geothermal is one the few renewable energy sources the Trump administration is promoting as part of its “American Energy Dominance” plan.
U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the CEO of the oilfield services firm Liberty Energy, has called for expanding geothermal energy, citing its potential to enhance energy security and stabilize electricity prices.
During a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month, Wright told Nevada Rep. Susie Lee he is “bullish on the future of geothermal.”
“Permitting and a sober government is necessary to make that happen,” Wright said. 
Under Wright’s leadership, Liberty Energy also invested millions in geothermal energy startup Fervo Energy. In 2023, Fervo Energy launched a geothermal pilot plant in Nevada in partnership with Google to power data centers. 
Nevada generates is second only to California in geothermal electricity generation, , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Nevada produces about 26% of total geothermal energy in the nation, and has the potential to grow.
Last month, the U.S. Geological Survey released a report that said geothermal energy in the Great Basin — which covers most of Nevada — could produce electricity equivalent to 10% of the current U.S. power supply.
Geothermal currently accounts for less than 1% of U.S. electricity generation, according to the EIA.
In the last five years, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has put up more than 700,000 acres of land in Nevada to lease for geothermal.
In a press release, USGS said commercial-scale geothermal development will largely depend on the “successful application of evolving and emerging technologies.”
Geothermal and sage grouse
Conservation groups argued the announcement is the latest effort by the Trump administration to target the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires the federal government to conduct an indepth environmental review before moving forward with infrastructure projects.   
“We support geothermal energy as a part of our clean energy mix, but like any projects on public lands these developments could cause environmental impacts,” said Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity in a statement. “Projects like these need full and complete environmental reviews to ensure they don’t unduly harm endangered species or public lands resources.”
While geothermal is a more environmentally sound alternative to traditional power sources like coal and natural gas, there are still environmental risks that require careful review. 
A recent study published in the journal Biological Conservation found that the presence of geothermal plants “adversely affected” greater sage-grouse populations within sagebrush ecosystems. The study found that the presence of geothermal infrastructure near sage-grouse breeding grounds decreased nest survival.
The study specifically reviewed the impact of Nevada’s McGinness Hills Geothermal Development, the largest geothermal complex in Nevada and the fourth largest in the United States. 
The first McGinness Hills geothermal plant was established in July, 2012 and has been producing renewable power since.
Throughout its construction and expansion, the McGinness Hills Geothermal Development has attracted pushback due to its impact on sage-grouse.
In 2017, the Nevada Department of Wildlife wrote a letter to the BLM after the agency documented the downward trend of seven of eleven breeding sites near the McGinness Hills Geothermal Development. 
In the letter the agency accused Ormat of failing to monitor and mitigate the impact of the power plant on sage-grouse habitat, as required under the project approval.
If the McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project is approved under the new streamlined environmental review process, it would expand three geothermal power plants by adding new wells, heat exchangers, cooling fans, and a 15 megawatt solar photovoltaic field.
Other Ormat geothermal energy projects have faced controversy and pushback in Nevada. 
In 2023, a planned geothermal project by Ormat was sent back to square one after federal land managers decided to reexamine the project’s approval following the listing of a small rare toad living in adjacent springs as endangered.
Another planned Ormat geothermal project near Gerlach, Nevada was thrown out by the Washoe County Board of County Commissioners in 2023 after locals fiercely opposed the project.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DJI_0403-HDR_THS-Visuals-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-03 08:05:40.930799

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. Allina doctors like me unionized in 2023 to have a voice so we can improve our workplaces and our careers and to ensure primary care is viable for future generations.
We took this step because the autocratic, profit-centric, factory style of practicing medicine is no longer viable. With our successful vote, we became the largest outpatient provider union in the United States.
We took this vote to make change for ourselves and our patients, but progress has been slow. We have been bargaining for about 15 months,± starting in February of 2024. We’ve sat across from Allina nearly 40 times, and we’ve made progress in many areas.
Unfortunately, despite all of this work it feels like we aren’t seeing the progress we need from Allina as we push toward a contract.
We understand contract negotiations can be difficult, but many areas should be simple to navigate and find common ground.
Health care workers, for instance, face workplace violence at higher rates than most other industries in the country. We feel that it would be reasonable to strive for safe and secure work sites.
Our proposals have offered measures to improve the safety of health care workers, but we have not found common ground with our employer yet.
We feel that physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners should have benefits like paid time off — a common benefit in many other industries that doctors currently lack. We have been unable to get Allina to move on that issue.

Our proposals have outlined provisions for appropriate staffing. We need nurses, medical assistants and laboratory and other ancillary staff in order to properly serve our patient’s needs. Unfortunately, some of our clinics remain understaffed, rendering it more difficult to perform our daily duties. We have proposed language around this, yet this is another issue that still needs to be resolved.
There is a clear trend in health care of providers reducing work hours. Many feel this is necessary to try to maintain some semblance of work-life balance. Health care worker burnout rates remain high. The antidote for this is not increasing work hours. Our providers trade hours of time away from family, friends and the necessary activities for well-being each week to do volumes of work that are non-compensated and don’t take place in the exam room.
Our proposals have measures to reduce the amount of this work and strategies to promote an actual work-life balance. We worry if we don’t address this, even more providers will leave the industry, which is bad for patients across Minnesota.
Most of us on the bargaining team knew we would reach resistance at some point. I had hoped we would be further along when it happened. I am not willing to abandon important issues, which our members have expressed so much concern over, simply because Allina doesn’t wish to see these common-sense changes happen. These issues are prominent with providers in health care systems across the country, and we can showcase a path forward if we can reach a fair contract.
Primary care has been shown to improve community health. A strong primary care system reduces mortality, improves life expectancy, improves health equity and lowers health care costs. Primary care must be supported and nurtured by our health care systems, communities and state government. As our providers burn out and reduce hours, our patients lose access to care. We will see worse chronic disease control and worse health outcomes.
Our members are engaging in an informational picket Tuesday because we feel this is a necessary step to help Allina administration understand the need for continued negotiations. We feel this is an important step to engage our patients and communities on the plight of primary care providers and the desperate need to maintain a strong primary care network.
Our negotiations need not be contentious. A good contract helps keep Allina’s employees happy. A good contract can attract the best providers across the state to bolster our community health efforts. A good contract ensures those new providers will flock to Allina, ready to provide our communities with decades of excellent care. A good contract helps our providers and administration collaborate to provide better care across the state of Minnesota.
On this day, we’re raising awareness that things are stuck in our negotiations, but remain hopeful that Allina will hear the voices of providers, patients and our community and understand why a fair first contract is the best solution for all involved.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/P1151760-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 07:04:45.517794

The five-person panel included former Detroit Police Chief James Craig, Detroit City Council member Fred Durhal III, former nonprofit CEO Saunteel Jenkins, Triumph Church Pastor Rev. Solomon Kinloch, Jr. and current Detroit City Council President Mary Sheffield. Candidates fielded questions about the city’s tax incentives, their plans to support business and education, address violent crime and poverty and ensure sustainable funding in the city’s budget. 
Although the panel did not represent the full range of candidates seeking election as the city’s mayor, the group was selected by the Detroit Regional Chamber’s Political Action Committee due to time constraints. Attorney Todd Perkins, businessman Joel Haashiim, entrepreneur Jonathan Barlow and two-time mayoral candidate Danetta Simpson are also competing for Detroit’s executive office, with the primary election scheduled for August 5. The two candidates with the highest vote total will advance to the general election on Nov. 4. 
With a wide field of candidates each seeking to make the final ballot, here are the highlights from each participant.

Saunteel Jenkins
Opening the debate, Jenkins noted that many of the city’s tax abatement programs would begin expiring in 2027, with over half set to expire by 2030. Jenkins said she would retool these programs at the risk of losing businesses and jobs within Detroit.
As Mayor Mike Duggan – who opted against seeking reelection to pursue an independent bid for governor – worked to rebuild confidence in the city, bringing in investments and jobs, the same needed to happen in the city’s neighborhoods, Jenkins said, calling for a commercial corridor in each of the city’s seven districts.
“We have to ensure that our planning is intentional and that it is inclusive,” Jenkins said. “And when we are having discussions about tax abatements, discussions about affordable housing, we have a real plan in place that is driving development and affordable housing and public transit in a way that is building our neighborhoods.”
If elected, Jenkins said she would craft a strategic plan to help shape economic development in each district, working with communities to decide how they want their commercial districts to look. There is also a need for additional office space for startups that can’t afford space downtown, she said.
Neighborhood planning efforts should include schools, in order to ensure students have access to high quality options for education, Jenkins said.
Additionally, as the city moves forward without $826 million in federal revenue it received through the American Rescue Plan Act, and payments under the city’s “Grand Bargain” coming to an end, the city needed to find ways to grow its businesses and its population, Jenkins said. She noted that she sees a role for a chief growth officer in her administration, if elected.

Fred Durhal III
Throughout the debate, Durhal pointed to his prior experience as a member of the Michigan Legislature, promising to coordinate with lawmakers on property tax reform and a willingness to go to bat for additional resources for education within the city.
He repeatedly noted, however, that solutions come with a price tag, quoting his grandmother in saying there’s “no romance without finance.”
Aside from pressing the city to utilize its current resources and maintaining discipline in the budget process, Durhal proposed a tax on blighted properties and a speculative tax on land sitting under development as potential new sources of revenue.
He also pitched a corridor improvement authority for the city, focused on creating walkable neighborhoods where residents have access to groceries and other amenities, which could catalyze small business in the process.

Solomon Kinloch
Kinloch remained focused on Detroit’s neighborhoods and their residents throughout the debate, and said he would work to bring the neighborhoods to the table on issues like tax policy. Kinloch said that the next mayor needed to be open to doing something new to address homelessness, poverty and job creation.
He also argued the city’s budget could use input from people whose priorities are aligned with the community. 
On the push to bring business back to residential areas of the city, Kinloch said Detroit should leverage its corporate, philanthropic and community partnerships to create an apprenticeship program to funnel Detroiters into high paying jobs. The city should also work with private-industry grocers to mentor entrepreneurship opportunities, Kinloch said. He also called for an end to food deserts within the city’s neighborhoods. 
“People shouldn’t have to eat out of a liquor store or a gas station,” Kinloch said.
Addressing education, Kinloch said his administration would bring in a chief educational officer to coordinate with the Detroit Public Schools superintendent and school board to ensure that the city is providing supplemental resources to ensure students arrive at school healthy and whole.

James Craig
As his fellow candidates offered pitches to address poverty and support businesses in the city, Craig said there needs to be a focus on growing the middle class.
“I talked a lot about growing small businesses. That doesn’t take away from continuing to grow big businesses,” Craig said. “We have got to raise revenues in the city. … We have to collaborate.”
That means having a business-friendly city, Craig said.
“And one of the things that I’ve heard as chief and deputy mayor over time is that in many of the neighborhoods, they feel left out,” he said. “They feel left out, the businesses feel left out.”
Craig argued there’s too much red tape for businesses coming into the city, and that efforts to make the city more friendly to business would help stabilize property taxes and keep them lower. He further emphasized the importance of continuing to bring in new business, and that tax dollars pay for vital services like police, fire departments and infrastructure. 
On policing, Craig promised to pick up where he left off in building trust through neighborhood policing, and noted that homicides had fallen to the lowest level since the 1960s during his tenure as police chief.
However, Craig criticized gun buyback programs within the city, saying “I have never in my 44 years in policing seen a criminal turn in a gun.”
“They don’t work. It’s all political talk,” he said. 
While other candidates pledged to work across the aisle to win support for the city from lawmakers in Lansing, Craig pointed to his existing relationship with President Donald Trump, who praised Craig for his response to Black Lives Matter protests in the Summer of 2020. 
Protestors later filed federal lawsuits arguing the Detroit Police Department used unconstitutional and excessive force and prevented them from exercising their First Amendment rights. The city agreed to a $1 million settlement in 2022.
“It’s not about me, it’s not about the president, it’s about the city of Detroit,” he said.

Mary Sheffield
As her opponents offered solutions to address the expiring tax abatement program, Sheffield said her focus would be on addressing poverty and the high property tax rate, which lead to the need for these programs to begin with. Sheffield promised “real structural property tax reform,” instead. 
The city also needs to continue to build its middle class, Sheffield said, noting that while Detroit’s median income sits around $38,000, the median for the state is around $70,000.
“Without a doubt, we have to ensure that more investment comes back into our neighborhoods, and that we’re activating our commercial corridors,” Sheffield said. “I’m very excited for my administration to be way more hands on as it relates to the education of our youth.”
Schools and the workforce are also targets for support, Sheffield said. 
“We have to invest more in education and the workforce, creating a pipeline that is ready for the jobs that are coming for today and of tomorrow,” she said.
Sheffield also called for a holistic approach in addressing crime which includes community policing alongside programs and efforts to deal with the root causes of violence. She said that could be done by providing support for mental health, jobs and education. If elected, Sheffield said she would retain Todd Bettison as police chief.
Detroit is also in need of a new funding approach for programs that would have previously been funded by the federal government. Sheffield said she would consider floating a local sales option tax, a tax on admission to sporting events, concerts and other types of entertainment or a half-a-penny tax.
“If cost savings could be achieved within various departments, I think we should look at that, but more importantly, it’s going to be about bringing more revenue into the city of Detroit to fund various programs,” Sheffield said, who later promised to aggressively pursue federal funding alongside state and local partners.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2936-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 07:04:45.517794

Mike Cierpiot, R-Lee's Summit, following the Senate's adjournment in 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Almost two dozen employees in Missouri State Archives and the State Library are on paid leave and will lose their jobs at the end of the month because of a politically motivated budget cut targeting Secretary of State Denny Hoskins.
Twenty-two employees — 17 in the archives, five in the library — were told Friday that they did not need to return to work Monday. The employees are being paid through the end of the month, — the final month of the current budget year — but according to Hoskins could not be retained because of “budget restrictions enacted by the Missouri General Assembly.”
However, the Republican lawmakers behind the cut say it only targeted unfilled positions in the office and there was absolutely no financial reason for Hoskins had to lay off any staff.
Hoskins, a Republican, is former state senator and has been secretary of state since January. While in the General Assembly, he tried repeatedly to cut job slots he said had been unfilled for months or years, arguing that agencies that had functioned without filling some jobs didn’t need the help.
Hoskins was also a member of the Missouri Freedom Caucus, which fought harder with the GOP majority leadership than it did against Democrats. State Sen. Mike Cierpiot, a Lee’s Summit Republican regularly tussled with Hoskins and the Freecom Caucus, punished him earlier this year with a budget amendment cutting 25 of the office’s authorized personnel strength of 267 full time equivalent employees, or FTE, and $680,000 from one of the funds that helps pay salaries.
In the last full year under Hoskins’ predecessor,  only 204 of those positions were filled. The office has not used more than 215 of its full time slots for at least eight years. 
At the time the cut was made, Cierpiot said it should not require any layoffs.
In a statement to The Independent, Rachel Dunn, spokeswoman for Hoskins, claimed the office had no choice. 
“The General Assembly did not cut vacant or flexible FTE authority,” she said. “It explicitly eliminated 25 FTEs from our budget, meaning we were required by law to reduce filled positions to meet that mandate. These cuts were not based on current vacancies but on a hard reduction in authorized staffing levels.”
The employees were given leave with pay to allow them time to seek new jobs, she wrote.
“This was done out of respect for their service, and to give them time to plan next steps with dignity, rather than executing immediate unpaid terminations,” Dunn said.
The $19.6 million budget approved for Hoskins’ office operations includes $11.6 million in general revenue and $8 million from other funds. In addition to the archives and library, the office is the state’s chief election authority, the repository of records establishing every business and not-for-profit in the state, and the regulator of securities brokers and sales.
Lawmakers give Hoskins — and every other statewide elected official — complete flexibility in determining whether each dollar is spent on payroll or the expense of maintaining the office. 
And in each of the past three years, the office has returned about $3 million unspent to the state treasury, including $300,000 to $400,000 of general revenue.
There was enough money and enough flexibility for Hoskins to retain all his employees, Cierpiot said. The budget change, he said, did not mandate layoffs. 
“If Secretary of State Hoskins thinks that he needs to pull back the number of people working at the archives, that’s his decision,” Cierpiot said.
State Sen. Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said there is no reason Hoskins should have terminated employees.
“I can’t understand a financial reason,” Hough said, “that there isn’t ample personal service dollars within the 100% flexibility that the Secretary of State has to continue paying not only all those folks, but I’m sure they’re still flexing some other dollars associated with the vacant FTEs.”
The problem with looking to the flexibility within the office budget for money to retain the staff is the limited nature of some funds. Money collected to regulate securities can only be spent on that function, Dunn said, and there isn’t enough general revenue to cover the cut in the dedicated funds that support the archive and library functions.
“The legislature cut both the FTEs and associated appropriations,” Dunn said. “Previous administrations had kept many unfilled FTEs on the books, but unfilled FTEs don’t always have funds associated with them. When the legislature cut both unfilled FTEs and payroll funds, our hands were tied.”
The archives is one of the office’s most public-facing functions. It stores and preserves records from the most important to the most mundane and is used for historical and genealogical research. It is also the only part of the office to have regular evening and Saturday hours.
The archives for example, is where the original document for Gov. Lilburn Boggs’ 1838 order that Mormons “must be exterminated or driven from the state” is stored, as is former Gov. Kit Bond’s 1975 order rescinding Boggs’ directive.
Online collections include territorial and state censuses, every volume of the Revised Statutes going back to 1825, and service records for soldiers and sailors from the War of 1812 through World War I.
The archives will have 43 employees after the cut, and the library will have 11, Dunn said.
“The Missouri State Archives are a vital part of our shared history and cultural legacy,” Dunn said. “These cuts will have lasting impacts on public access, preservation, and the historical transparency Missourians deserve.”

(Photo courtesy Kyle Roerink)A remarkable sequence of events unfolded in the week before Memorial Day that could shape the future of Las Vegas more than anything else in recent memory. 
First, Nevada Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei made what may prove to be a fateful miscalculation in the waning days of the House’s negotiations over the reconciliation budget bill. He added an amendment in the literal dark of night that would authorize — nay compel — the sale of over half a million acres of public land in Nevada. 
Public outrage ensued. 
The lands in question in Amodei’s amendment have been considered for sell-off in various land legislation proposals in recent years. Though those proposals have been problematic, conservation interests and county governments were at least involved in the negotiations. It felt like Amodei was blowing up the years of work they’d put in.
His sneak attack also sparked outrage across the entire country. Former Interior Secretary and Montana Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke led the charge in D.C. against the amendment, calling it “my San Juan Hill,” in reference to a battle in the Spanish-American War. Other members of Congress spoke out, and calls from around the country flooded Amodei’s office.
In the end, Amodei bowed to pressure and his amendment was withdrawn from the final House budget bill. Instead of scoring a victory for the real estate and mining interests that bankroll him, he dealt a historic setback to the public lands sell-off movement.
At the same time as negotiations were under way in D.C., the Nevada legislature was considering Assembly Joint Resolution 10, which was an endorsement of the Clark County lands bill. 
The Clark County lands bill — one of the aforementioned lands legislation proposals of recent years — would facilitate tens of thousands of acres of new sprawl south of Las Vegas. It would create a new city the size of St. Louis, stretching all the way to the California border. 
While some environmental groups have been supportive of the Clark County lands bill, citing conservation interests, our groups have steadfastly opposed any proposal that would facilitate the endless sprawl that strains our water supply and harms our air quality, wildlife habitats and communities. 
The Sierra Club, Great Basin Water Network, and Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition worked relentlessly for weeks to halt the measure. 
Amodei’s deeply unpopular amendment loomed large in Nevada’s legislative chambers. The prospect of Democrats endorsing endless sprawl days after Zinke — Trump’s former Interior Secretary — defended public lands was something that Carson City politicians couldn’t stomach. Legislators let the Clark County lands bill die late last week. 
It wasn’t just sprawl on public lands that was dealt a blow last week, however. Coyote Springs — a proposed city on a privately owned parcel of land 50 miles northeast of Las Vegas — had one of the last nails pounded into its coffin by a Clark County District Court judge. 
The developers behind Coyote Springs proposed building a city of a quarter million people on desert they own in northern Clark and southern Lincoln counties. 
The problem is they have no water. And the groundwater that sits deep under their land — which they propose pumping to fill swimming pools and irrigate golf courses — is connected to waters that sustain endangered species and communities downstream via the Muddy River and Colorado River system.
After years of wrangling in court — including a key victory for the Center for Biological Diversity and allies when the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the state’s right to manage groundwater for the public interest, including wildlife — Judge Bita Yeager ruled last week that pumping at Coyote Springs would harm endangered species and communities. 
While Coyote Springs backers are sure to appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court, the evidence and law is overwhelmingly against the project. 
Recent momentum clearly favors those who oppose the endless sprawl machine. But what does the future hold? 
We caught a glimpse last week, as the Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management launched an environmental review for the proposed Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport, formerly known as the Ivanpah Airport. 
The enormous international airport would be built 30 miles south of Las Vegas on a playa near Primm. In addition to the airport and associated facilities, the site would also include retail and industrial development. It would need pipelines for water, tons of concrete, and land currently inhabited by the imperiled desert tortoise. 
The land for the airport was given to Clark County by Congress in 2000, meaning that its permitting is close to a foregone conclusion. Even before Trump launched his assault on the nation’s bedrock environmental laws, federal agencies by and large have rubber-stamped these sorts of developments.
What’s not a foregone conclusion is whether the airport will ever be built. Where will the water come from? Who will pay the Southern Nevada Water Authority to build one pipeline to tap into Colorado River water and another to bring back effluent? Where will the people who work there live? Will we have an exodus of workers driving 60 miles roundtrip to the airport, while tourists do the same long journey just to get to The Strip? Who will pay for the new electricity infrastructure, new schools, new roads, new sewers — new everything? 
The Las Vegas growth machine is at a crossroads. 
While corporations and their politician handmaidens are growing bolder than ever in pushing the development agenda, the public is coming to the defense of our public lands and pushing back against endless sprawl. 
Our organizations will continue to highlight the absurdities of selling off public lands for sprawl and oppose these measures in all their forms. The remarkable events of the past week underscored that we have the power to resist — and win.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Vegas-Sprawl-Horizon-1024x731.jpeg,,,2025-06-03 08:05:40.930799

It is personal.
I have avoided using “I’ and have endeavored to remain objective and impersonal as I have addressed and analyzed myriad social, educational and political issues across race, age, gender and socioeconomic status.
That has been my practice, whether writing for radio, in print when I wrote for The Kansas City Star and other newspapers, or online writing for The Missouri Independent the last four years. Even in my own blog.
Maybe the “I” in this column is a “collective I” that tugs.
I have a hunch that many of my fellow Missourians and Americans may be feeling as I do as we live through unprecedented, tumultuous, and unsettling political times.
What are you longing for?
I long for a state and country where:

The fundamental tenets, rules, procedures and laws that have governed our democratic republic still hold true and still mean something as we function in the public square and in our everyday lives.
Our institutions and their histories still have meaning, value, collective power and influence.
There is real meaning and we still value representative government, where those elected really believe in respecting and fighting for the issues and concerns of those who voted for them, sent them to do the people’s bidding.
Each of us can wear the Missourian and American identity with pride, humility and thankfulness irrespective of skin color, gender, place of birth, social or economic station or political leanings.
The behaviors of the leadership in our state and nation — our governor, the legislature, our president, the halls of Congress — are shining examples to be emulated, duplicated, and cheered on.
There is hope and a positive outlook about what each of us can achieve if we work hard enough.

Some may consider those longings naive or idealistic.
I do not.
As a Black woman, born and raised on a small farm in Mississippi, and who has lived and or witnessed first-hand the good, the bad and the ugly of life in America, I have always remained hopeful and refused to give up on believing in the best of our collective humanity.
Even now — as I watch the callous and inhumane way undocumented immigrants are being treated, how caring and career public servants have had their lives upended as their jobs are snatched and taken away indiscriminately with little or no notice — I still believe our collective decency and collective humanity still exist and is worth fighting for.
When I watch DEI programs being dismantled across every aspect of American life as if the playing field is equal, I still believe in fairness and decency in spite of my experiences throughout my career — not getting jobs I was qualified for, sometimes overly qualified for, not able to buy a house in a neighborhood I could afford, on and on.
Despite those experiences, I refused to be bitter, paint the situation or future prospects with a broad brush, or feel that I would always be victimized by racism and sexism.
If I am a victim, it is in my belief that hope for a better humanity reigns eternal.
But today and for some time, I must admit, I am finding it difficult to not become pessimistic, to not throw up my hands and say, “What’s the use? Why not just sit on my porch and watch the birds, and the changing sky?”
Can I or any of us afford to do that, check out and ignore the constant bombardment of news that fly in the face of what this great “Heart of America” state and the country that was once considered the “Beacon on a Hill” supposed to be about?
We see examples and reminders every day that we are allowing debased values and goals to kill the progress we have made for over two centuries.
Why? Why? Why?
Are we willing to sit by and watch what is happening to our state and country?
Why?
Who are the few, yes the few, representatives in Jefferson City and Washington who will assume and use the power invested in them to stand up and stop the negative and destructive trajectory — of us versus them —  that the state and nation is on?
No matter where we hail from, no matter our circumstances of birth, we have shared experiences that should bind us, not divide us.
More importantly, keep us divided.
It really is not about “us” against “them.”
If only we could just keep that thought top of mind.
It isn’t about labels either: Republicans versus Democrats, conservatives versus liberals.
Like many of you, I have voted for both Democrats and Republicans. I vote for the person and what they stand for. I am both conservative and liberal — and moderate — depending on the issue.
When it comes to what is best for Missouri and America, it is about building bridges that we can all walk across to achieve the best good for the greatest number.
That is what I long for.
That is my hope.
What is yours?
We need to have an answer to pass on to our children, our grandchildren, and their children.
Our collective future is dependent on it.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Longings1-rarrarorro-1024x540.jpg,,,2025-06-03 07:04:45.517794

Marc Racicot embrace at a rally to stop the dozens of constitutional amendment proposals made in the 2023 legislative sessions. Both were keynote speakers at the Feb. 1, 2023, event. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)On June 22, at the Ellen Theater in Bozeman, Todd Wilkinson, the editor of Yellowstonian, a publication focused on the environmental issues in the Greater Yellowstone, hosted and moderated a discussion between two old political rivals. 
In 1992, Republican Marc Racicot and Dorothy Bradley campaigned all over the state, conducting more than 20 joint town halls, where they debated the issues of the day. Racicot won in a very close race, and went on to become one of the most popular governors in Montana, up until he made a fateful decision concerning the deregulation of utilities, a piece of legislation that had a long-term impact and has led many Montanans to never forgive him. 
But it’s hard to overlook the fact that Racicot is a man who reflects on these things in a way that is not typical of most politicians, especially from his party. When Racicot endorsed Monica Tranel during the 2022 congressional race, the state Republican party decided to censure him, a particularly confounding decision considering that Racicot was, at one time, the chairman of the Republican National Committee after his term as governor. He also managed George Bush’s campaign during the 2004 presidential race. 
But Racicot never classified himself as a full-on conservative, and he and Bradley both highlighted the fact that during their campaign against each other, they were able to maintain a strong feeling of respect and civility despite their differences. This was one of many issues they pointed to that are contributing to the current political situation. Another was the influx of money, and Bradley pointed out that the maximum donation during their campaign was $35 and they were meticulous about following that. 
But one of the most striking revelations during the evening for me was when someone asked Racicot whether any of the current Republican leadership in Montana ever reaches out to him for advice. 
“They don’t even return my calls,” Racicot answered. 
And although it wasn’t exactly a surprise, I still found myself kind of amazed that these people would completely dismiss the years of experience of someone like Racicot. It’s not hard to imagine that the same holds true for most of the other former office-holders in our state—people like former governors Brian Schweitzer and Steve Bullock, or former congressman Pat Williams, and especially Jon Tester. It’s obviously a product of our current political culture, which values winning over all else, that would produce the kind of arrogance that completely dismisses an entire sector of our population without a thought. But how shortsighted is it to believe that only you and those who think like you have all the answers you need? Or, that asking for advice or feedback is some kind of weakness?
People can say that Donald Trump is to blame, but this started way before he descended that golden escalator, back when Newt Gingrich and his cadre of icy collaborators decided that winning at all costs was way more important than worrying about what is important to the voters. This attitude has slowly poisoned the Republican party to the point where they feel completely justified in disowning one of the people who was considered a shining star. 
And the most maddening part about it is how gleefully and smugly they continue down this path. It’s not hard to imagine why. Because so far, it’s working. Because of Project 2025, they are no longer relying on Trump to drive the train, and it puts him in the perfect position as someone who just has to keep yelling “All aboard” and blowing his own horn. He doesn’t even have to worry about steering. 
So where does that leave us? 
I think Bradley said it best when she pointed out that we are all responsible for where we are, and that we are also responsible for figuring out what to do next. 
“Trump is eventually going away,” she pointed out. “And it’s hard to imagine anyone else in his circle having the same sway over the public. So we have to figure out how to proceed once he’s gone, and how to repair the damage he’s done.” 
The same holds true for our state. 
Greg Gianforte is serving his last term, and there’s no question that people are becoming disillusioned by the lack of access to our political leaders. Our current office-holders have made it their policy to avoid as much contact with the public as possible, and it’s not hard to imagine why. Each time they do that, someone tries to hold them accountable for the many decisions they’ve made that have done untold damage to the citizens of Montana, with the most outrageous being the (still unexplained) increase in property taxes. 
Todd Wilkinson and I are starting a new podcast soon, affiliated with Yellowstonian, and one of our first episodes is going to be a discussion about this conversation between Bradley and Racicot. But as a brief preview, I can tell you that most of the solutions they offered were ones we’ve heard before, and that we will certainly hear again. We need to continue to speak up, gather, make our voices heard, and of course vote. But it was nice to see people with different views coming together to discuss how we got here. And I suspect we will see more of that.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_8299-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-03 07:04:45.517794
,New Jersey Monitor,2025-06-03 10:49:57+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Governor says cuts to federal funding for upgrading unemployment systems ‘undermine’ workers,Sophie Nieto-Munoz,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/governor-says-cuts-to-federal-funding-for-upgrading-unemployment-systems-undermine-workers/,The Trump administration is terminating $400 million in funds meant for states nationwide to modernize their unemployment systems.,"The Trump administration is terminating $400 million in funds meant for states nationwide to modernize their unemployment systems. (Getty Images)Gov. Phil Murphy criticized the federal government for terminating programs aimed at modernizing the unemployment insurance system, which suffered under the stress of hundreds of thousands of claimants applying for jobless benefits at the height of the pandemic. 
“At a time of increased uncertainty about the U.S. economy, the last thing the federal government should be doing is taking away resources from states’ unemployment insurance systems,” Murphy said in a statement Monday. “These cuts undermine American workers.”
The Trump administration is terminating $400 million in funds for states across the country to modernize their unemployment systems, money that was authorized in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act passed under the Biden administration. 
The Murphy administration did not comment on whether any money would be returned to the federal government, or whether the change in funding would cause any disruptions to systems in the process of being upgraded. The state Department of Labor did not respond to a request for comment.
New Jersey received nearly $25 million for its upgrades. The grant money was expected to be accessible for tech upgrades through 2028. 
Murphy said in his statement that the state has used those funds to “improve the efficiency of our state’s unemployment insurance application to ensure that all eligible workers can access the benefits to which they are entitled.” 
According to Axios, the U.S. Department of Labor notified Congress last week that these grants were being terminated, suggesting that the funds were wasted on equity projects. However, “equity” in this case refers to efforts to make the system easier for people to use and access, not as a reference to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, which the Trump administration has vowed to dismantle.
A record-breaking 1.1 million claims were filed in New Jersey during the first two months of the pandemic, pushing the state’s antiquated unemployment system past the limits of what it could handle. People saw their claims frozen, received their benefits months after they applied — if they received them at all — and were often told to reach out to call centers for specialists, only to be greeted with busy signals or messages to call back another time.  
The unemployment system in New Jersey saw major overhauls following the pandemic — and its first substantial update in over a decade — as a result of a federal program with the U.S. Department of Labor. The unemployment application that rolled out in 2024 can be used on mobile devices, is available in multiple languages, can be saved if the applicant needs to return to it later, and includes revised questions to make it easier to understand.

(Menomonee Falls Public Library)   The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Menomonee Falls residents are concerned about the future of their public library after the village board voted late last month to move $300,000 from the library’s 2026 budget to the police department. 
Board members said the May 19 move, which passed in a unanimous 6-0 vote, was intended to help the police increase staffing in response to an uptick in crime. Critics of the decision said the move is likely to force the library to cut back on staff, hours and programming — potentially putting its certification from Waukesha County at risk. 
The resolution, which was passed months before the board begins working on writing the village’s 2026 budget, also comes as libraries across the country are about to be hit by funding cuts from the federal government as part of President Donald Trump’s effort to slash federal spending. 
This year, the library’s budget was set at about $2.3 million, making the $300,000 cut about 15% of the library’s total budget. The cut is larger than the $225,000 the library was budgeted to spend on purchasing new materials this year. The police department’s 2025 budget is more than $12 million. 
“If village board members are so obsessed with firing librarians, just say so and be transparent with the community, because that is the impact of stealing 20% of the library’s funds,” Ian Dickmann, a community resident and former member of the library board, said at the board meeting. “You will be firing multiple librarians, cutting library hours and negatively impacting library programs, materials and services. The community has spoken in support of the library on multiple occasions. Yet here we are again. If you as a village board cannot manage to properly fund the police and the library, then you have failed as a board.” 
Menomonee Falls Police data shows that crime has increased slightly this year, and through retirements, resignations and leaves, the department currently has fewer than the 65 sworn officers in its budget. Police Chief Mark Waters said at a board meeting in April that the department was working with 54 fully trained officers. 
At that meeting, Waters said that this year, class A offenses, which include more serious crimes such as assaults, robberies and drug offenses, are up 18% compared to the first quarter of 2024. However, much of that increase is due to a 41% increase in drug offenses, of which Waters said the vast majority was “a lot of marijuana taken out of traffic stops.” 
As of April, there had been 41 thefts in Menomonee Falls this year, according to police data, an increase of six incidents from the first quarter last year. The clearance rate, the percentage of crimes that are solved, on those thefts was 51%.
Menomonee Falls Assistance Police Chief Gary Neyhart said in an email that the department has had problems  with staffing, but that budget decisions are up to the board. 
“Chief Mark Waters provides public quarterly updates to the Village Board and a consistent message has been that staffing has been an issue here at the police department,” Neyhart said. “The Village Board then determines how best to address these stated staffing concerns. I also cannot speak on their behalf. I don’t believe we are alone with our staffing issues and that many area departments are in a similar situation as well as dealing with retention and recruitment. We will always strive to provide the highest level of service that our staffing allows.”
Board member Paul Tadda, said at the May meeting that the resolution to cut the library budget was made to maintain the level of police services a suburban community expects. 
“We’re down to 52 fully trained officers. That requires forced overtime to maintain shifts are full and able to respond to emergencies as necessary and provide police services that the village has been accustomed to,” he said. “I do not want to live in Milwaukee.” 
Andy Guss, co-leader of the community group Grassroots Menomonee Falls, told the Wisconsin Examiner he is used to Tadda’s “racist dog whistles,” and that he is more concerned about the library’s ability to remain certified and serve as an important resource for village residents. 
In Wisconsin, counties set a tax levy for library services. Those funds are distributed to municipal libraries to compensate for the use of services by people who live in communities without a library. Municipal residents are exempted from paying the library tax if they live in a community that has a library which meets standards set by the state and county board. 
The Waukesha County standards require the village to provide at least $1,630,000 in the annual library budget, be open at least 60 hours a week, employee at least 17.61 full time employees, have a collection size of at least 125,400 materials, have at least 20 public computers and provide wireless internet access. 
Guss says he’s worried the cuts will put the library dangerously close to not meeting the standards. 
“We’re going to be really close to not hitting the Waukesha County standards,” he says. “And I’m fearful of what will happen if we also lose additional funding from the federal government, because then how short will we be? How many people, how many librarians will we have to fire? How many services will we have to cut? How many books do we not get, how much new material can we not get? How many computers? It’s scary to think about, because it limits access to people that need it. Because I don’t go to the library all the time for books, I use the library for a lot of other things, like book clubs or meeting spaces. What happens to that when the hours are reduced?” 
But at the meeting, board members brushed aside concerns community members raised about the standards. Board member Ann Lessila said in an email to the Examiner that the library won’t suffer.
“By reallocating funds ahead of the budget process, we have allowed the library board extra time to prepare,” Lessila said. “The library has been funded well over the required amount every year, without having to make any significant adjustments. The library remains well funded! Just about every other department has made significant adjustments over the years.” 
Steve Heser, a Menomonee Falls resident and the director of the Milwaukee County Federated Library System, said he highly doubts claims that residents won’t see any impacts from the cuts and that one community library failing to meet the county standards strains the whole county system — which in this case is the Bridges Library System covering all the libraries in Jefferson and Waukesha counties. 
“What you really don’t want in a system is one library failing to meet those standards, and then they’re kind of relying on the other municipalities to foot the bill for their library,” Heser said. 
Aside from the county standards, Guss said he’s also worried about the village board diminishing a community gathering space, especially for kids and teenagers who have already had recreational opportunities taken away. 
In March, the board voted to ban any children over the age of 12 from hanging out unaccompanied at Menomonee Falls Village Park, which is across the street from North Middle School. Village officials said the move was meant to deter vandalism. 
“They’ve got the playground across the street. They ban the 12-year-olds so they can’t go there,” Guss said. “But we do have at the library, they have a teen room that is well managed. I know it’s well attended, but I would assume that, based on these cuts, that they’re going to lower hours, lower staff, and maybe we would even lose the teen room.” 
The Menomonee Falls Village Manager Mark Fitzgerald and six of the village board members did not respond to requests for comment.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
His sister, Susan Garcia, said her brother was removed from a ventilator and died from complications from his attempt to hang himself on July 19 in a Columbia Correctional Institution shower. At the time, Garcia was on clinical observation because he said he was feeling suicidal.
Garcia gave the Examiner access to records her family received from the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, including incident reports that provide accounts from the day of Garcia’s suicide attempt. 
Questions remain about the purpose and origin of the tether Garcia used in the suicide attempt, as well as why an officer waited for a supervisor and did not immediately remove the tether when Garcia was found. 
The Wisconsin Department of Corrections has received notice of an anticipated lawsuit being filed against the department on behalf of Victor Garcia, DOC communications director Beth Hardtke said in an email in response to questions from the Examiner. DOC practice is not to comment on matters relating to pending or ongoing litigation, Hardtke said. 
Attorney Lonnie Story said he plans to file a lawsuit involving Victor Garcia’s attempted suicide at the facility. He said he needs to obtain more information before filing a suit. 
Garcia’s prison sentence and mental health strugles

In March 2008, when he was 16, Victor Garcia was found guilty of criminal trespassing in a dwelling, battery, disorderly conduct and a domestic abuse incident. He was sentenced to two years of probation. Garcia’s probation was revoked in July 2008, and in August he was sentenced to nine months in jail. 
When he was 18, Garcia was found guilty of being party to a crime for burglary and being armed with a dangerous weapon, causing substantial bodily harm and two counts of armed robbery with use of force. He was sentenced to over 20 years in prison. 
Garcia was placed in clinical observation on July 8. According to records provided by Susan Garcia, Victor Garcia was placed there because he told security staff and psychological services that he was feeling suicidal. 
An incident report said that Garcia stated he was using psychological services to remove himself from general population status “due to fears that he was being targeted as an informant.” Susan Garcia said her brother had suicidal thoughts and had been threatened by another incarcerated person. 
In the two days prior to his suicide attempt, Garcia did not engage with staff during multiple attempts to evaluate him. According to a review on July 16, Garcia said he felt depressed and felt like dying every day. 
The report said it appeared other members of the psychological services team had recommended exploring a stabilization referral for Garcia to the Wisconsin Resource Center (WRC). WRC provides treatment for severe impairments in daily living caused by mental health challenges. Susan Garcia believes her brother should have been sent to WRC earlier in his time in prison. 
According to a mental health report dated July 19, Victor Garcia was to be monitored every 15 minutes. 
Under the DOC’s clinical observation policy, the frequency with which a patient is monitored can vary. Depending on the level of risk, a patient might be observed at 15, 10 or 5-minute intervals, or constantly. 
According to an incident report by Psych Associate Chastity Drake, Drake thought she heard someone from the clinical observation area “yell they were ‘going to hang’ themselves.” She was unsure who it was. Her report was dated July 19, with an incident time of 2:30 p.m. 
Drake asked who had yelled, and the clinical observation checker told her who it was. The name is redacted in the incident report. Drake stopped at a door to check with that person about whether he was the person who had yelled about hanging himself, and he denied it. 
In front of the shower, Drake reported she “heard a man yelling and it sounded like the voice heard earlier. Due to PIOC going into shower, this writer determined she would touch base with him after the shower.” 
Garcia had access to a ‘tether’

At 2:30-3 p.m., Drake followed the observation checker to check in with Garcia, who was seated on the floor with his back against the door, according to her incident report. Drake could see a “tether” around his neck. She began to bang loudly on the door, yelling “Garcia.” He did not respond. 
Both ends of the tether were secured to the shower door near the shower drain.
Another incident report was completed by correctional officer Anthony Rego, who drove to the hospital where Garcia was treated. He wrote in the report that he’d learned Garcia had been in the shower for approximately 40 minutes, and at some point had the tether around his neck. 
It is unclear if the tether was meant to be attached to the shower door. One incident report said Garcia had used “the tether that was attached to the shower door.” An incident report by correctional officer Tyler Peterson also mentions a tether.
In his report, also dated July 19, Peterson wrote that he was assisting with removing and escorting Victor Garcia from a cell to the observation shower. Once he was in the shower and the door was shut, another correctional officer “removed the tether and wrist restraints,” he wrote. 
Family member questions why Garcia was left tethered while unresponsive 
An incident report by Courtney Schmidt, a licensed psychologist, states she was in RH1 at approximately 2:30 p.m. Schmidt’s report states that she and Drake were waiting to check in with Garcia to assess him for risk and that at the time, he was naked in the shower.
Schmidt wrote that as they walked back to the clinical observation shower, she saw Garcia hanging from the tether. He was unresponsive and she could see that the tether “was wrapped tightly around his neck.” 
Drake began to pound on the shower cell door, and the officer accompanying them called for a “supervisor/help over his radio.” Drake left to go and wait for help in the front, while Schmidt stayed with Garcia. She wrote that she saw his belly slightly moving. 
Schmidt asked the officer if he could take the tether off, “but he stated ‘I am not taking it off until a supervisor comes.’” He then called again over his radio, and Schmidt waited until help arrived. 
In an interview with the Examiner, Susan Garcia questioned the decision to wait for another person to arrive. She thinks the door should have been  opened, and staff should not have waited to assist her brother, “if you obviously see something’s wrong.”
Drake wrote that she heard the officer call for help and went to the clinical observation table to wait for help to arrive. She wrote that “the response appeared delayed due to other high priority events happening at the same time.”
“This writer went to find help and ran into Dr. Stange and Sgt. Ferstl,” Drake wrote. “Sgt. Ferstl and moments later Lt. Laturi and support staff rushed to the clinical observation shower. I observed as the PIOC was removed from cell and began to receive medical treatment.”
In his incident report, supervising officer Steven Laturi wrote that he was working as a shift supervisor. At about 2:40 p.m., he was responding to another emergency in Restrictive Housing Unit 1 (RH1) when he heard a radio call for a supervisor to report to the observation area. 
Laturi wrote that he was unable to respond immediately because he and a team were responding to someone else, whose name was redacted in the report. This person was in a restraint chair in a program cell, and he had tipped his restraint chair back and removed his legs from it. 
According to Ferstl’s incident report, he was assisting Laturi and completing inventory when Drake came out from the RH1 observation area and told staff that Garcia was unresponsive. He reported that at around that time, the observation check officer made a radio call, asking for a supervisor to come to the observation area for an inmate who was harming himself. 
Ferstl wrote that he arrived in the RH1 observation area and saw Garcia sitting upright at the shower door. He tried to get Garcia’s attention, but Garcia was unresponsive. Ferstl made a radio call for a supervisor to report to the observation area. 
Ferstl then “unsecured one end of the door tether which removed the tether’s tension,” he wrote, allowing Garcia to rest in a lying position near the cell door. Ferstl made another radio call, asking the health services unit to report to RH1 immediately. 
How Garcia described himself
Garcia has a profile on penacon.com, a website for finding an incarcerated pen pal. Susan Garcia said her brother set up the profile, which includes photos of artwork. 
Garcia described himself as “an avid reader that enjoys educating, empowering & entertaining myself mentally in a place designed to break the mind, body & spirit.” 
He wrote that being incarcerated at 17 “forced me to mature fast.” “When I’m out,” he wrote, on his bucket list was traveling the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts, experiencing the life of different cultures through food. 
“He would call my kids almost every day,” Susan Garcia said. “Weekly, definitely weekly. He would send them gifts. He loved kids… My brother would give the clothes off his back for you. He was emotional, but hid it. He hid it very well.” 
Further information not yet available 
According to the DOC’s mental health training policy, the department’s division of adult institutions (DAI) is supposed to provide annual update training in suicide prevention to all DAI staff who have contact with incarcerated people. DAI facilities are also supposed to conduct drills simulating a suicide attempt by an incarcerated person and staff response.
On April 17, the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office said it could not release any information pertaining to the investigation at this point. The investigation was being reviewed by the Columbia County District Attorney’s Office, and additional investigation may need to occur. On May 23, the sheriff’s office said there had been no change in the status of the case. 
On May 21, the Examiner submitted a public records request to the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, asking for any records produced by any DOC investigation of Garcia’s death.
The DOC denied Susan Garcia access to body camera and security camera footage of Victor Garcia’s suicide attempt, citing security concerns and the public interest in protecting the safety of incarcerated people and staff.

A Broadway-worthy story about the 1920s all-woman Jackson Town Council runs at the Pink Garter Theatre through June 14.
The post ‘Hens deliver’ again at revival of Jackson Petticoat Rules musical appeared first on WyoFile .","“Roosters crow, hens deliver,” five candidates sing in the musical Petticoat Rules as they launch their 1921 campaign in Jackson to become the country’s first all-woman council.
The revival of the musical, first staged 25 years ago, tells the story of that famous group of stalwarts that won two terms and helped turn a frontier town into a livable community. Under the rule of Mayor Grace Miller, who beat her incumbent husband in the election, streets wouldn’t turn into rivers during a rainstorm.
No longer would 2-foot-wide ditches flow into 1-foot-wide gutters. The Town Square wouldn’t be a dump, and Jackson would own its own “Boot Hill” up on Snow King Mountain.
In a delightful script by Broadway playwright Mary Murfitt and show-stopping tunes by composer Pam Phillips, 15 Jackson thespians resurrect Wyoming history in a boot-stomping performance. The show runs through June 14 at the Pink Garter Theatre in Jackson.

With gusto, the players recreate figures from Beaver Dick Leigh to John D. Rockefeller Jr. to Struthers Burt and Cal “The Cowboy” Carrington. They all circulate around the women, including socialite Cissy Patterson, Mayor Miller, her council and Town Marshall Pearl Williams.
“Petticoat Rules in Jackson Hole, a town that works is our only goal,” sings River Nelson as Mayor Miller.
“Cal the cowboy, brings me that special joy,” warbles Sarah Dropinski as Patterson.
Creators Murfitt and Phillips wrote the musical with the help of a 1999 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts after working together on Murfitt’s “Cowgirls” in San Diego. The concept won the grant among applicants from the Equality State.
In the 25th anniversary revival, “we’re especially thrilled to be playing in the Four C Pit Band,” Murfitt and Phillips said in a program statement.

Director Andrew Munz first appeared on the Pink Garter stage at age 10 as one-sixth of the caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland. He’s since launched Tumbleweed Creative Arts and in recent years revived the Pink Garter Theatre to operate as a collaborative arts center.
“I’ve seen firsthand how easily our community can forget its own story,” Munz wrote in the show’s program. At Tumbleweed, “art created on our home turf deserves just as much respect as the art we import.”

Under guise of keeping kids safe, lawmakers look to subvert the freedom to read, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Legislature’s ‘book police’ want Wyoming libraries to pay fines appeared first on WyoFile .","I get angry when I think about legislators determined to subvert Wyoming public libraries’ most crucial role — promoting the freedom to read — under the guise of stopping them from supposedly pushing porn on kids.

Opinion

The Joint Judiciary Committee met in Torrington last month, with several members focused on the best way to punish the Wyoming public library system for this nonexistent problem. 
Rep. Ann Lucas, R-Cheyenne, brought the panel a bag of books from her local library and her own collection. She put sticky notes on pages to indicate “all the nasty words” that made them inappropriate for children.
Rep. Jayme Lien, R-Casper, said Wyoming should follow Iowa’s model legislation that defines, in graphic detail, what’s considered “sexually explicit,” but I’ll spare you the lengthy list of orifices and sex toys she read from at the meeting.
Then, five days after the meeting, a federal judge temporarily blocked Iowa from prohibiting school libraries and classrooms from buying books that depict sex acts.
One of the problems the judge cited was the law’s statewide prohibitions “on what has traditionally been the prerogative of local officials regarding the contents of school libraries.”
That’s a major misstep the committee must reconsider before it makes the same mistake. Why do legislators want to take a sledgehammer to local control and a system that already allows parents and the public to challenge books they object to?
The committee voted to draft a bill that would effectively keep books with objectionable sexual content in a section clearly labeled “adults only.” Unless it’s behind closed doors, librarians would need to constantly patrol to make certain no toddlers, grade-schoolers or teens wander in.


But it’s not at all clear from the committee’s discussion whether it wants to take books that have been banned in many U.S. libraries because of their sexual content and make them unavailable for teens. This means students curious about classic books that, under the bill, the state deems too sexually explicit for minors — by well-regarded authors like Harper Lee, J.D. Salinger, George Orwell, Kurt Vonnegut, Toni Morrison and many other writers — may not be able to access them in libraries.
Younger children would be confined to their own section, free to read books that parents can be assured don’t have any LGBTQ+ characters, lest their kiddos ask what each of those letters means. 
Those forbidden books — particularly ones with transgender themes, the Legislature’s favorite target — would be unavailable to the people they were written for: teens who may be struggling with their own gender identity. They desperately want information but don’t feel comfortable talking to anyone, especially adults.
One of the books Lucas brought, “Gender Queer,” was repeatedly condemned. It’s a 2019 graphic memoir written and illustrated by Maia Kobabe that takes readers on a journey of self-discovery and understanding of the author’s nonbinary and asexual identity.
Sen. Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne, co-chair of the joint committee, compared the book to a pornographic Hustler magazine. “I question whether it belongs in a publicly funded library in the state of Wyoming, period,” he said.
Lindsey Travis, president of the Wyoming Library Association, explained that “we have policies in place so parents make the decision about what their kids check out, not the librarians.” 
“There’s not one librarian out there who is forcing anyone to check out any book,” Travis said.
“These books are rampant across Wyoming,” Olsen maintained. “This idea of local control I support, but local control is obviously not working if these books are in our libraries.”
Local control used to be a mantra of the GOP, but now it’s conveniently forgotten when it offends far-right sensibilities. Apparently, they know better than you what’s appropriate for your children.
Lucas sponsored a bill earlier this year to remove an exemption in state obscenity statutes for librarians, teachers and museum workers. It rightfully died in the House Judiciary Committee, but if it ever passes, authorities could charge them for providing obscene material to minors, making them subject to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine.
Several committee members said they oppose any penalties in a new bill.
I’m glad there’s little appetite for putting librarians in jail.
But Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, chairman emeritus of the Freedom Caucus, was still looking for someone to pay for allegedly risking children’s safety. He urged the committee to use an approach the Freedom Caucus deployed with the Second Amendment Protection Act — a bill that Gov. Mark Gordon ultimately vetoed.
The bill would have prohibited any local agency from hiring former U.S. government employees who had ever enforced any type of federal firearms regulation. The agencies could be fined $50,000 for hiring veterans who had that experience.
Lien made monetarily penalizing libraries a part of her successful motion to draft a bill prohibiting sexually explicit material from being available in school or public libraries’ children’s sections. She lifted another idea from the gun bill: allow citizens to sue libraries for failing to enforce the law.
So now we’ll clog the courts with book challenges that are routinely handled by librarians and library boards.
Here’s a novel idea: Instead of “Iowa-ifying” Wyoming by passing an unconstitutional law in a political gambit to convince voters they’re “saving” children, let’s follow a different path.
Six states – California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and Washington — have passed laws in the past two years that preserve access to reading materials that deal with racial and sexual themes, including the LGBTQ+ community.
Wyoming should become the first red state to join this effort and show that the freedom to read is a principle we uphold, and we won’t abide by censorship in any form. Wyoming should protect libraries from civil suits, not fine them and invite litigation. And just as importantly, Wyoming should continue to allow parents — and not the government — to decide what’s best for their children.

For years, states have taxed hospitals and other health care providers to draw down federal matching funds and help finance their Medicaid programs. Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.










Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them.


– Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America's Essential Hospitals


Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

The view is of Black Diamond Pool, where a hydrothermal explosion occurred on July 23, 2024 (many of the rocks behind and to the right of the pool were deposited during that event).

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey)On the morning of July 23, 2024, visitors to Biscuit Basin, about 2 miles northeast of Old Faithful Geyser, had to scramble for safety as a hydrothermal explosion occurred from Black Diamond Pool. The plume from the explosion rose 400–600 feet into the air, was visible for miles, and threw rocks that destroyed the nearby boardwalk and littered the landscape with debris.
The rock ejected by the explosion was made up of glacial debris, sandstone and siltstone, all of which are part of the geological deposit that makes up the immediate subsurface. None of the rhyolite bedrock was found, indicating that the explosion was rooted at very shallow levels (probably within 100 feet of the surface).

Also present in the debris was impermeable silica that was probably lining the hot water conduits feeding Black Diamond Pool. Silica is dissolved in much of the water that feeds Yellowstone hot springs and geysers, and as that water nears the surface and cools, the silica precipitates out as a solid. It can coat the conduits and, because it is impermeable, can seal the system.
This can cause pressure to build and might eventually lead to an explosion, like the one that occurred on July 23, 2024.
In the weeks and months following the explosion, scientists from several institutions collaborated to install temporary monitoring stations around Black Diamond Pool, including trail cameras, seismometers, acoustic sensors and electromagnetic instruments. The cameras often recorded changes — for example, that new rocks had been ejected from the pool — and the seismometers and acoustic sensors detected several dozen eruptions from the pool.
Some of the eruptions were associated with surges of water that knocked over seismic nodes and moved them from their original locations or partially buried them in silt.
At least two small eruptions, expelling water, mud and small rocks 20–30 feet into the air, were witnessed since the July 23, 2024, explosion. One occurred on Nov. 5, 2024, while scientists were collecting gas samples. Another took place on Jan. 3, 2025, and was observed by a tour group that was passing by the area.

Since the July 23, 2024, explosion, Biscuit Basin has been closed to public visitation as Yellowstone National Park assesses damage and the potential for future hazardous events. To aid with the assessment, on May 14, 2025, Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientists installed a new webcam in Biscuit Basin. Static images from the camera are publicly available at https://www.usgs.gov/media/webcams/biscuit-basin-webcam, with images updated every 15 minutes.
The camera is a temporary deployment installed on the damaged boardwalk, so the picture is somewhat tilted due to the slope of the boardwalk itself. Nevertheless, the view of Black Diamond Pool is clear, and the camera has pan, tilt and zoom capabilities that allow the frame to be adjusted if activity warrants.
Because the deployment is not intended to be permanent, the camera might fail due to problems with power or telemetry systems. If this happens, we will work to get the camera back online as soon as possible. The camera is intended to operate at least throughout the summer of 2025, and if warranted may be hardened to last throughout the winter months.
Bandwidth at the site is not sufficient at this time to support live streaming, but video is being recorded on site. If the static images document the occurrence of an event (based on the appearance of new rocks or wet ground, for example), video can be downloaded for analysis. If any such events are captured, we’ll be sure to post video clips to the Yellowstone Volcano Observatoy website.
We hope that this new view is of interest to the public, and we are confident it will provide a new perspective on activity at Black Diamond Pool that will be useful for the ongoing assessment of hazards from the area. Many thanks to Yellowstone National Park for supporting this deployment, which was completed under research permit YELL-2025-SCI-5842.
Biscuit Basin remains closed due to the damaged caused on July 23, 2024, as well as hazards posed by potential future hazardous hydrothermal events. So for those who would like a current close-up view of Black Diamond Pool, check out the observatory’s new camera! And stay tuned for more details about the July 23 explosion and subsequent activity as research efforts continue.

But beware: two beaches on Oʻahu and Kauaʻi topped the list of shorelines across the country that are top-priority “bacteria hot spots,” according to a new report by the Surfrider Foundation.
More than 90% of the water samples collected in 2024 from the popular swim spots — Kahaluʻu on Oʻahu and Waikomo Stream at Kōloa Landing on Kauaʻi — had bacteria levels above state health standards. While other parts of the state’s coastlines are even more polluted, of places used by the public, these spots are among the highest-risk for poor water quality.
The data comes from the foundation’s Blue Water Task Force, which analyzes water quality where local governments typically aren’t keeping track. Nationally, 80% of test sites last year had at least one high bacteria result above state health standards. 
“Each location regularly shows dangerous levels of fecal-indicator bacteria tied to human illnesses, including gastrointestinal issues, flu-like symptoms, and serious skin conditions like MRSA and staph infections,” the report said.
Hawaiʻi’s reliance on cesspools has led to particularly stark problems. Wastewater contributes to the problem at Kahaluʻu, according to Daniel Amato, who coordinates the foundation’s data collection on Oʻahu. 
“It’s one of the areas that is just kind of chronically polluted with fecal indicator bacteria,” he said.
Hawaiʻi’s Hot Spots
About a fifth of Surfrider’s 83 test sites in Hawaiʻi had high levels of bacteria more than half of the time, mostly in locations near cesspools. 
In some places, it was even worse. 
Bacteria was detected in every sample collected from Nāwiliwili Stream, which feeds into Kalapaki Bay at Nāwiliwili Beach Park on Kauaʻi. The site has failed to meet water quality standards every month since 2018. 
Just last year, a sign finally went up warning would-be swimmers that high bacteria levels had been detected in the stream, after almost a decade of pressure from Surfrider Foundation. 


Other places also consistently had excessively high bacteria levels. On Oʻahu, Surfrider’s team collects samples across the island every two weeks. One site on Oʻahu’s Windward side, Punaluʻu Beach Park, fell short of state health standards in every sample collected last year.
The problem is particularly bad at the mouths of streams where water flows out to the ocean. Those fresh water sources dump runoff from cesspools, animal waste and other sources of bacterial pollution into the ocean.  
“The bacteria is coming down through these watersheds. It’s being generated by feral animals and human on-site wastewater systems like cesspools and septic tanks, particularly after heavy rains and brown water type events,” Amato said. “So that’s our primary concern — stream mouths near the ocean, where families and people tend to be in the water.”

In January 2024, several months after the devastating wildfire in Lahaina, Surfrider tested samples from nearby sites for evidence of fire-related contaminants. And here’s some good news: The tests turned up no evidence of any risk to human health from contamination after the fire.
Actually, Maui’s waters tend to be among the cleanest. More than 50% of spots where Surfrider collected samples last year never saw high levels of bacteria in excess of health standards. And even when there were indications of high bacteria levels, those spikes were less frequent on Maui than on Oʻahu and Kauaʻi. 


So what’s safe? 
Beaches that don’t have freshwater sources like streams tend to have less bacteria. 
During the rainy season, “storms serve to ‘flush’ the islands and can result in large amounts of water, sediment, wastewater, and pollutants flowing downhill into the ocean,” bringing with them more bacteria, according to the report. 
But water quality issues and bacteria spikes don’t just happen in the winter. Stagnant water also leads to higher bacteria levels. 


Surfrider recommends paying attention to water quality conditions, avoiding brown water even if there’s no posted warning and staying out of those spots where fresh water streams flow into the ocean.
“For me, it’s more about areas where families go. You always see kids playing in the streams, and you have the beach parks,” Amato said. “And our data is telling us that is not a good idea.”
 “If the water looks questionable,” he said, “it probably is.”

As gun violence surged in cities across the country after the start of the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, shootings rose even more steeply in Lansing, Michigan. The worst period came in 2021, when the rate of fatal shootings reached 20 per 100,000 residents, two points higher than the national rate.  
“That wave was so devastating,” said Marlon Beard, a community activist in Lansing whose 17-year-old son, Marshawn, was shot and killed in 2021. “We all kind of asked ourselves what we can do about it.” 
In response, city officials and community groups raised enough money from federal grants and the city to establish a local Advance Peace program, a national violence intervention method that identifies known shooters, with support from the police, and enrolls them in an 18-month fellowship. By late 2022, violence interrupters hit the ground in southwest Lansing, mentoring, conducting skills training, and providing job opportunities to 15 participants. 
Within months, police data showed a decline in shootings. To better understand the program’s efficacy, Advance Peace leaders commissioned a study by the Michigan Public Health Institute and Michigan State University. The study, published in March, found a 19 percent decrease in all shooting incidents from October 2022 to September 2024. More specifically, it found a 52 percent decline in fatal shootings and a 10 percent decline in nonfatal shootings. 
A program that works directly with shooters in Lansing is finding success — and police support

But the overall drop also coincided with a national decrease in gun violence as the pandemic receded. Determining how much of the decline was due to intervention and how much it reflected national trends remains a key part of the puzzle in understanding gun violence trends in Lansing and similar cities. The end of the pandemic also heralded the federal Build Back Better Act, which included $5 billion for community violence intervention work, along with less direct funding that strengthened the social safety net that is crucial in many communities with disproportionate rates of gun deaths. 
That widespread funding anchored programs like this one. The first 18-month Advance Peace fellowship started in late 2022 with 15 fellows on the southwest side, where shootings were most prevalent. Fatal shootings and nonfatal shootings fell by 38 percent and 32 percent, respectively, in that area. But the drop in fatal shootings was greater in the three sections of the city where Advance Peace didn’t have an initial presence, raising questions about the program’s influence. The southwest did, however, have the largest reduction in nonfatal shootings compared to the other areas. 
According to the Lansing study, Advance Peace effectively engaged with the people most likely to pick up a gun, who were identified through family members, friends, other activists, law enforcement, and people recently released from jails and prisons. More than 90 percent of participants no longer use guns to go on the offensive, said Paul Elam, the chief strategy officer at the Michigan Public Health Institute and a key member of the team that implemented the program in Lansing. Elam later took a step back from street-level engagement to join the research team.
“We have evidence that this works,” he said. “We have the evidence to prove that a public health approach works.”
Joseph Richardson, a gun violence researcher and professor at the University of Maryland, said the Advance Peace model can be successful, but more data is needed to show that the program was driving the drop in shootings. “There were significant reductions in fatal shootings where they weren’t doing their work,” Richardson said, but added that continued research of community violence intervention programs is crucial to better understanding “the role a CVI group plays locally. That’s how we learn what steps need to be taken to implement the work properly.”
The second fellowship, which covers the entire city, started in July 2024 and will continue working with 55 fellows until December, when the Trump administration’s termination of $169 million in grants for violence intervention and community safety programs leaves cities like Lansing to scramble for alternatives. Half of Advance Peace Lansing’s funding comes from federal grants, and its leaders are now strategizing about how to raise enough money to sustain the organization’s 22-person staff and $3.5 million annual budget.
“If you remove that intervention piece, gun violence will go up again,” said Michael McKissic, who runs Mikey23, a nonprofit gun violence prevention program that trains young people in trades like construction, plumbing, and electrical work. “We need that intervention. Our organization can’t do that, other organizations can’t do it. You need those individuals who are going to go in and show them the error of their ways.” 
The study showed that fatal shootings decreased by 19 percent more in Lansing from 2022 to 2024 than they did nationally — when gun violence was already dropping across the country post-pandemic. But the city’s rate of nonfatal shootings fluctuated, ending with a 15 percent decline in 2024. Richardson said this is the kind of discrepancy that requires more analysis, but that continued research will be more difficult after the cuts from the federal government. 
Elam and the other authors of the study said gun violence prevention has always been an uphill battle, and hope the promising declines don’t cause leaders to disengage with gun violence prevention. They also emphasized the positive feedback they’ve gotten from residents who say their boots-on-the-ground work has built trust, as well as city leaders, police, and the fellows themselves, most of whom are under 18 years old. 
“We can talk to them,” one of the 16-year-old fellows told The Trace, referring to Advance Peace’s credible messengers. “They care about us, they’re there for us.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/crime-scene.jpg,,,2025-06-03 06:06:58.657393

				This article is the second in a series on the environmental costs of America’s last remaining alumina refinery. Read Part 1. 



GRAMERCY — There’s a small area along the Mississippi River’s east bank where the land, buildings and roadways are rust-colored and where the air is frequently filled with the same mineral that covers the surface of Mars.
That spot, about 45 miles west-northwest of New Orleans, is near the entrance of the Atlantic Alumina plant, known better as Atalco, the only bauxite refinery in the United States. Bauxite is a rock composed of aluminum oxides and other heavy metals such as iron oxide — the same compound that gives Mars its famous rusty hue.   
Periodically, the bauxite dust travels across the river and blankets the small, historically-Black community of Wallace. In other instances, Atalco has discharged large plumes of white-colored dust from the refined alumina that has traveled as far as 4 miles from the facility. The plant occupies roughly 3 square miles of land at the St. James-St. John the Baptist Parish border.
For Shamell Lavigne, who lives in Wallace, the red remnants from Atalco are one of the many industry-caused hazards of living in St. James Parish. She is an organizer with Rise St. James, a community activist group that focuses on environmental justice.
“Any given day you can pass by over there and, if the wind is blowing a certain way, it’s blowing that red dust,” Lavigne said. 
For years, Lavigne said, rumors have circled in the community that the dust particles from Atalco might contain mercury or arsenic. Both toxic metals have been found in the slurry that spilled from recent levee breaks around Atalco’s manmade “red mud” lakes. 
The series of breaches and leaks dating back to last year are detailed in thousands of documents from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration. An LDEQ spokesman only confirmed that an investigation into Atalco was ongoing when asked for comment. 



The sludge has repeatedly escaped from containment areas and contaminated a public drainage system that flows to the Blind River Swamp. Lab testing of impacted water and soil samples from those discharges found poisonous heavy metal elements — some at concentrations far beyond the legal and safe limits, government records detail. 
Atalco has not responded to multiple interview requests from the Illuminator.
Gramercy resident Gail LeBoeuf, 72, has lived roughly half a mile from the Atalco facility since 1999 and believes it could be a source of some of her health problems. 
She was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2022, adding to the prevalence of cases along the Mississippi River corridor that go back decades. It has given rise to the label “Cancer Alley” to describe the area between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, where the population has one of the highest concentrations of cancer diagnoses in the nation, according to data from the EPA’s air toxin mapping tool.
Studies have linked the cancer to the area’s high levels of pollution, especially in predominantly Black fenceline communities next to industrial facilities. Nearly 70% of Gramercy residents are Black, according to U.S. Census figures. This includes LeBoeuf, who also has bronchitis that she believes could be the result of Atalco’s particulate matter discharges. 
Residents, some as far as 5 miles from the plant, periodically find their property and vehicles covered in a layer of red bauxite dust or white powder from the making of alumina.  
Elevated levels of arsenic are present in the waste product of alumina refining. Recent medical studies have found that even low levels of arsenic exposure through drinking water can cause bronchitis and certain other respiratory diseases, according to the National Institutes of Health. 
“It’s hard to think it’s not environmentally related,” LeBoeuf said of her illnesses, though she added that her doctors can’t say for certain how much the industrial pollution is to blame.

Pollution by air, land and water
Neighbors of the Atalco alumina refinery face exposure to dust and waste throughout the process, according to a review of regulatory documents. Plus, the facility has repeatedly poured toxic waste into the Mississippi River — and skirted the blame.
From its dock on the river, the Atalco facility receives constant shipments of crushed bauxite ore from its mining operation in Jamaica, where it is extracted near communities that — just like in Louisiana — are routinely caked in a layer of red dust.
When the ships arrive at Atalco, the dock has a system that unloads the bauxite powder from the ship and into a hopper connected to a conveyor belt that carries it into the refinery. Unloading the bauxite from the ship into the hopper is one of the more environmentally risky points in the process because it is prone to spills and wind exposure that carries the red dust into the atmosphere. The company recently installed a fogging system on the conveyor in an effort to minimize the wind-blown dust, though records show it has broken down at times.
The fogger also does nothing to minimize airborne dust from the dried chemical residues in Atalco’s red mud lakes.

Although Atalco was formally notified of the levee breaches surrounding its lakes in August, there were many earlier signs of trouble at the facility. 
LDEQ’s file on the company contains multiple reports about the facility’s pollution leaving chemical residues on homes, vehicles, plants and waterways.
Atalco has an interior system of containment ditches designed to catch chemical spills, stormwater runoff and the wastewater used to process the bauxite. The system is separate from the public drainage ditches that run along the highways outside of the facility. One of Atalco’s ditch systems has an outfall pipe that drains into the Mississippi River, so LDEQ requires the company to treat its process wastewater — which is water used for industrial processes — to keep it relatively free from hazardous contaminants and monitor it with basic water quality testing such as “potential for hydrogen” or pH levels.
Clean water has a neutral pH of around 7.0 on a 14-point scale. Values below 7 are considered acidic, while values above it are considered alkaline. Any extremes at either end of the scale, below 4 and above 10, often indicate the presence of dissolved chemicals that can be hazardous or even fatal to humans, animals and plant life. 
Under the provisions of its river outfall permit, Atalco is prohibited from discharging wastewater with a pH over 10.0 for more than 446 minutes, or just over 7 hours per month, an EPA standard. Most fish cannot survive in water with a pH level over 9.5. Atalco’s outfall monitor consistently detected amounts far greater in the months leading up to the discovery of the red mud lake levee breaches in August 2024.  
One of the highest readings occurred in February 2024, when the facility discharged waste with a pH of 13.2 for a total of over 19,000 minutes — nearly two weeks. That discharge was 43 times greater than what the EPA allows. Records show Atalco exceeded that permit limit almost every month — discharging highly caustic chemicals into the Mississippi River — going as far back as July 2023.  
In nearly every occurrence, the company blamed either the weather or some other third party, telling LDEQ the discharges could not have been prevented. For the discharge in February 2024, Atalco blamed it on a power outage and a lack of steady suppliers for the chemicals needed to neutralize high pH discharge, records show. The state has not penalized the company for those incidents.

Hotline complaint
On April 10, 2024, authorities received a more specific warning sign. Someone filed an anonymous complaint with the National Response Center regarding a “release of an unknown red and orange material onto the ground and into the roadside ditches” surrounding the Atalco plant, according to LDEQ records. 
“Caller states that nothing has been done for clean up and the vegetation is dead in that area,” the complaint noted.  
The National Response Center is a federal communications center that manages a 24-hour hotline for the reporting of chemical spills, train derailments and port security incidents throughout the country. Most complaints reported come from government officials or workers in the industrial and transportation sectors. 
U.S. Coast Guard Coast personnel who staff the hotline are trained to screen complaints and, if necessary, forward them to the agencies most appropriate to respond. For this complaint, the Coast Guard wrote an incident report and immediately notified LDEQ. 
The state agency initiated an investigation but did not visit the facility until 10 days later. During that site visit, the state inspector drove along the highways surrounding the Atalco plant but did not see anything suspicious in the ditches.

The LDEQ inspector then called Atalco on April 22, 2024 — 12 days after the complaint — to ask about the allegation. Atalco’s environmental manager, Charlotte Hooker, told LDEQ that heavy rainfall brought a lot of surface water to the facility. She acknowledged the plant saw a spike in discharges into the Mississippi River but denied that Atalco was polluting the public ditches outside of the facility. 
During the company’s discussion with LDEQ, someone noted that the anonymous caller may have simply witnessed run-off from nearby farmland with red-orange colored soil, according to the inspector’s report.
LDEQ accepted Atalco’s explanation and closed the investigation, according to state records. 
If the investigation had continued, Lavigne said LDEQ might have discovered the levee breaches sooner but doubts if it would have made much of a difference. She said the agency doesn’t do much to compel companies to prevent accidents or clean them up when they happen. She and other residents said authorities are reluctant to enforce regulations because of Atalco’s status as the only remaining alumina plant in the country. 
“I do think that they’re protected in that sense,” Lavigne said.
Atalco became the only remaining domestic source of alumina in the United States after the only other bauxite refinery, L’Alumina, located in Ascension Parish, closed in 2020. 










They’re the only alumina plant in the country, so they ride that horse every time they get in trouble.


– Craig Calcagano, Gramercy town alderman


Previous infractions
Following a 2017 compliance inspection, LDEQ cited Atalco for 78 state Environmental Quality Act violations, mostly related to the company’s air pollution permit. In 2020, the state negotiated a fine of $75,000 and allowed Atalco to deny any wrongdoing. 
At the federal level, the Mine Safety and Health Administration has cited Atalco for 370 violations since 2021 mostly for caustic material spills, according to an Advocate report. The company paid over a half-million dollars in fines related to those violations.
The residents of St. James and St. John parishes have long been aware of Atalco’s incidents and say the threat of fines has done little to curb the company’s pollution practices. 
Kristy Cambre, a long-time resident of one of the Gramercy neighborhoods closest to Atalco, noticed a layer of white dust covering her vehicle the morning of May 23. 
“It didn’t just wash off quickly or normally,” Cambre said. “Some spots kind of bubbled almost like I was rinsing off a soap.”
The red dustings used to appear more frequently, but Cambre and other residents are now seeing more of the white substance.
  The white substance is not sand but is a chemical powder covering part of the Mississippi River levee near the Atalco alumina refinery in Gramercy. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)
The red dust comes from the raw bauxite ore or the dried residue from the red mud lakes, while the white dust is the refined alumina. Mounds of the refined alumina piled on the ground can be seen from the roadways when driving by the facility, and clouds of both white and red dust can be seen coming from Atalco’s shipping dock and its conveyor belts.   
Cambre said she never reports the dustings to authorities, but some of her neighbors have. LDEQ’s file on the company is filled with incident reports prompted by citizen complaints, mostly about the chemical dust and about rust-colored water filling the public ditches. 
In most of those cases, LDEQ records show inspectors would not substantiate the complaints, writing that they have no way of knowing whether the red dust came from Atalco or some nearby farms. 
Farms surrounding Atalco grow sugarcane, and the Illuminator could not find any with finely powdered rust-colored soil.
In most cases, the inspectors reported in their records that they spoke with Atalco executives but never that they spoke with any of the farmers who purportedly have rust-colored soil.  
“They’re turning a blind eye to it,” LeBoeuf said.

Craig Calcagano, alderman-at-large for the town of Gramercy, agreed with LeBoeuf’s assessment. He said he first noticed Atalco’s lakes leaking waste in early 2024 and reported it to both the company and LDEQ, but nothing was ever done about them, he said. 
“They’re the only alumina plant in the country, so they ride that horse every time they get in trouble,” Calcagano said. 
The company has occasionally paid some fines over the years, but nothing has really changed because the pollution continues, Calcagano said. Atalco’s chemicals cover his property on an almost daily basis, he said. The public drainage ditches run red when it rains, and the Blind River Swamp across from the facility is dying, according to the alderman. 
“When it starts destroying everything you got, which you work all your life for like everybody around here, what can you do?” Calcagano asked. “When we complain, we complain on deaf ears because they don’t want to hear it.”
Atalco’s pollution also affects people who don’t live near the plant such as Teresa Williams, who works at a facility down the road from Atalco and said her car gets splattered with rust-colored residue every time she drives to and from her job. 
Gary Watson, a Wallace native who still owns property there but now lives in New Orleans, said the pollution is one of the reasons he left. 
“There should be outrage,” Watson said after he was told of the levee breaches. 
Lavigne, the community activist, said she is concerned about the people who work at Atalco who might be exposed to the toxic chemicals.

One of the more notable incidents occurred July 5, 1999, when an explosion at the plant injured 29 people and dispersed caustic waste. A federal Mine Safety and Health Administration investigation found that a power outage led to a buildup of pressure in the four giant tanks used to heat the caustic slurry. 
LDEQ records indicate the facility has seen numerous other incidents in recent years, including seven incidents since May 2022, resulting in chemical and diesel spills, severe burns to workers that required hospitalization and one death when 45-year-old Curtis Diggs fell into a pit of sodium hydroxide because a grate used to cover the area was missing. (Read more below) 
In previous incidents, Atalco has always claimed its red dust is non-hazardous, which is also a position the EPA still holds. However, recent studies have linked bauxite dust exposure to certain diseases. 
This additional research has prompted the EPA to issue warnings about bauxite’s potential to contain toxic metals and trace radioactive elements, though the toxicity is generally more concentrated in the red mud byproduct. 
Slawomir Lomnicki, an environmental scientist at LSU, said the danger with Atalco’s red mud lakes is the potential for the toxic metal to leach into the groundwater. 
Another risk is that the red mud in the lakes can dry out and turn into airborne dust that can be carried off by the wind, according to Ganga Hettiarachchi, a professor of soil and environmental chemistry at Kansas State University. 
It’s unclear what, if any, consequences Atalco will face in connection with its many permit violations. So far, LDEQ has issued a warning letter for 23 violations in connection with the levee breaches, providing little solace to some of the residents in St. James Parish.
“It looks like, you know, they’re gonna be protected,” Lavigne said. “They’re definitely one of the plants that’s been on our list of really dirty plants.”

Major incidents at the Atalco refinery in the past three years

May 3, 2022 – A large semi-trailer generator caught fire at the facility, spilling about 250 gallons of diesel into a storm drain. 
June 9, 2022 – An Atalco employee was hospitalized with severe chemical burns from a spillage of sodium hydroxide, which the report defined as an “extremely hazardous” caustic liquid.
Nov. 7, 2022 – An Atalco employee suffered chemical burns to his neck, chest and arm from a spillage of caustic liquid. 
Feb. 6, 2023 – Two Atalco workers were hospitalized with severe chemical burns and a third suffered minor injuries after a tank of caustic liquid overflowed and spilled onto them. 
Jan. 7, 2024 – Four Atalco workers were hospitalized with severe chemical burns after a valve failed, spraying them with what records described as an “extremely hazardous” caustic liquid. The company blamed the workers. 
May 4, 2024 – A white crystalline substance blanketed cars, homes, plants and other outdoor surfaces in Gramercy, Lutcher and Paulina. Parish and state authorities figured out it was aluminum oxide coming from Atalco, and the company admitted it was the result of a broken dust valve. Still, Atalco deflected blame, telling LDEQ the failure of the valve could not be anticipated. A later root cause analysis determined the company should have performed more frequent inspections of the equipment. 
Aug. 4, 2024 – A contract worker, 45-year-old Curtis Diggs of Baton Rouge, fell into a sump of sodium hydroxide because part of the grate that covered the pit was missing. He was airlifted to a New Orleans hospital with severe chemical burns and died about a month later.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Atalco-red-sign-1024x574.jpg,,,2025-06-03 06:06:58.657393

(Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)A Bismarck man who has experienced substance abuse, recovery and living with HIV is hoping to develop his leadership skills after being awarded a Bush Foundation fellowship. 
“I’ve been able to change my own life and work to help others to do the same,” Jason Grueneich told the North Dakota Monitor. “I’m just lucky to be alive and here doing the work. And it’s amazing that the Bush Foundation saw something in me.” 
Grueneich’s work includes being an advocate for those living with HIV. He created Bismarck’s first LGBTQ+ recovery group and this year founded Shine Bright and Live, an HIV-focused nonprofit, and helped repeal a North Dakota state law that he said stigmatized people who are HIV positive. 
Grueneich is one of three North Dakotans awarded a Bush Fellowship in 2025. Up to 30 Bush Fellows are selected each year to receive up to $150,000 to support their leadership goals. Fellows can come from any sector — including business, nonprofit and government, according to the Bush Foundation. 
Grueneich said the Bush Foundation isn’t so much about funding a project but investing in leaders. 
“Leaders work to bring as many people with them as possible,” Grueneich said. “It ripples out into the community and raises people up.” 
Gruenich grew up in Bismarck but said he moved away, developed a substance abuse problem and became infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
He returned to Bismarck and went through a recovery program in 2016. 
Since then, “I have dedicated myself to community,” Grueneich said. 




 Other ND Bush Fellows

Two other North Dakota also were awarded a Bush Fellowship. 
Sarah Dixon-Hackey of West Fargo will pursue certification in suicide prevention skills, expand her expertise in digital media, and deepen her research into cultural disparities in care, according to a news release. She has created storytelling projects with college students and produced podcasts for refugee families to amplify underrepresented voices, especially on the topic of mental health. 
Richard Pallay III of Fargo has used his experience as a DJ to found the cultural initiative WEAREONE. He also launched Soul Dads, a peer support network for Black fathers that blends mentorship with creative expression. Pallay will use his Bush Fellowship to launch a statewide artist network and scale Soul Dads into a model that can be replicated, the news release said.  



Grueneich chairs the North Dakota HIV Advisory Board while working in state government. He has worked for the Department of Transportation for the past five years and is operations manager for the driver’s license division. 
After founding Shine Bright and Live in January, Grueneich spent time at the Capitol advocating for the repeal of a state law that makes it a felony to willfully transfer body fluid containing the HIV virus. 
Rep. Gretchen Dobervich, D-Fargo, sponsored House Bill 1217 that repeals the law. 
She said the law singled out HIV from other infectious diseases by creating the felony crime and discouraged people from getting tested for HIV, leading to the potential spread of the virus. 
The law, “had the opposite effect of what it was intended,” Dobervich said. 
She said Grueneich was instrumental in getting the bill through the Legislature. 
“He was able to make the issue real,” Dobervich said. 
Testifying in front of a legislative committee was new for him, Grueneich said. 
“A leader faces fears,” Grueneich said. “Somebody living with HIV, standing in front of the Legislature numerous times when there’s a lot of stigma about HIV can be daunting.” 
In his testimony, Gruenich cited President Donald Trump, who in his first term in 2019, used the State of the Union address to announce a plan to end the HIV epidemic. 
Grueneich said it was a way to find common ground on HIV issues.
“Unfortunately, we see now the administration is cutting funding for HIV prevention. It’s cutting funding for the years of work we’ve had on finding HIV vaccination or care,” he said. 
Grueneich said one way he hopes to benefit from the Bush Fellowship is learning how to deal with traumatic life experiences that come with working with high-risk communities such as HIV and recovery. 
“You’re continually working through trauma and loss,” Grueneich said. “I want to learn how to heal and process those losses, so I can teach others how they can process that and then refill their cups so they can keep doing the work that’s necessary.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee closed a loop of electric vehicle chargers connecting Nashville, Knoxville, Cookeville and Chattanooga in May, marking a significant milestone in the state’s push to support EV adoption.
Meanwhile, a federally funded program intended to round out Tennessee’s EV charging network — particularly on the state’s major interstates and U.S. 64 — has been halted since February at the instruction of President Donald Trump’s administration.
Tennessee’s Fast Charge TN program aims to position an EV charger every 50 miles along Tennessee interstates and highways. In the roughly 400-mile loop closed in May with the installation of chargers in the small town of Athens, EV drivers can now access chargers every 34 miles.
The state’s $24 million program is funded separately through funds from the Volkswagen Diesel Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, electricity revenues from TVA and cost share from grant recipients. 
Some U.S. Republicans are pushing to keep energy tax credits. Tennessee lawmakers aren’t among them.

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation’s Office of Energy Programs released a Notice of Intent for the Fast Charge program’s second round in February and expects to solicit projects for 13 gap areas throughout the state “in the coming months.”
Fast Charge TN’s federally backed counterpart remains at a standstill.
The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated up to $5 billion to support EV charger installation along “Alternative Fuel Corridors” across the nation. Tennessee was set to receive $88 million over a 5-year period to complete a plan created by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT).
Upon taking office, Trump issued an executive order to pause the disbursement of federal grant money for programs supporting electric vehicles and clean energy initiatives under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
The U.S. Federal Highway Administration officially suspended NEVI funding in February, despite having already approved states’ program plans.
TDOT awarded $21 million in NEVI funds to 10 applicants in January 2024 to install 30 new charging locations, but none of those contracts have been executed as the pause remains in effect, according to TDOT Community Relations Director Beth Emmons.
Sixteen states, Washington D.C. and multiple environmental and clean energy groups sued the U.S. Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration in a Washington federal court in May, arguing the federal agencies had no authority to freeze funds already appropriated by Congress. The Executive Branch, the suit contends, cannot “override or suspend this process based on changing policy priorities.”
EVs in Tennessee: Uncertainty abounds as Trump targets Biden-era electric vehicle funding

Tennessee is not one of the plaintiffs.
Gov. Bill Lee and Tennessee’s Congressional representatives have largely been mum on the tension between the state’s work to grow the EV industry and the Trump administration’s efforts to retract federal support.
Tennessee has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into incentives and grants to entice EV-related businesses to locate their manufacturing plants in the state. Lee and the state’s economic development department have celebrated the hundreds of jobs promised by EV enterprises since 2017, many in rural areas. 
All but one of Tennessee’s representatives in the U.S. House voted in favor of an amended version of Trump’s budget reconciliation bill — which would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits for consumers and create new annual taxes for EV and hybrid owners — in May. Lee also celebrated the bill’s passage in the House, and did not respond to a request for comment regarding the potential impact to Tennessee’s EV industry.
The bill must pass in the U.S. Senate to become law.

The DOL […],"Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va. (center), visits the Charleston Job Corps Center in July 2023. (Office of Congresswoman Carol Miller photo)At least one of the West Virginia locations of a federal youth job training program will be affected by a “pause” in operations announced by the Trump administration late last week. 
The Department of Labor announced last week it would “pause” operations at all 99 contractor-operated Job Corps locations nationwide by June 25. The DOL said it would arrange transportation and cover expenses for current students back to their homes of record by June 30. 
The “pause” includes the Job Corps center at Charleston, according to news reports. 
West Virginia’s other Job Corps location, the Harpers Ferry Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center, is operated by the U.S. Forest Service. While that office will not be affected by the announcement from the Department of Labor, a spokesperson for the federal Department of Agriculture said Monday it will also review operations at its 24 Job Corps offices.  
“The Trump Administration is looking critically at the way we do business, with the ultimate goal of ensuring the best possible service for our customers, and the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars,” a USDA spokesperson wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch. “The Department of Labor has notified USDA of their intention to terminate Job Corps contracts and suspend operations for the Job Corps program. USDA is reviewing the program and will determine the status of our 24 centers soon. We continue to work closely with DOL and Congress to ensure USDA Job Corps facilities continue to prioritize the health and safety of program participants.”
Calls to the Charleston Job Corps center and the Harpers Ferry Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center were not immediately returned Monday. 
The Department of Labor’s decision to suspend the Job Corps program came after an “internal review” of its outcome and structure, the agency said in a news release. The program has been in a “financial crisis” for years, the DOL said. The program operated at a $140 million deficit in 2024. The deficit is expected to grow to $213 million in 2025. 
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education, training and community,” U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a news release. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve. 
“We remain committed to ensuring all participants are supported through this transition and connected with the resources they need to succeed as we evaluate the program’s possibilities,” she said. 
The Department of Labor said that in 2023, the Job Corps program reported 372 cases of inappropriate sexual behavior and sexual assaults, 1,764 acts of violence, and 1,167 breaches of safety or security. 
The program also has a low graduation average of 39% and has a cost of more than $80,000 per student per year, which is more than the $16,695 per year that the average student earns, according to the DOL.  
Melissa Rhodes, program director for the Charleston Job Corps Center, told WCHS-TV Eyewitness News the staff is “hanging by a thread” and that students of the program are very concerned about the pause.
“The Job Corps program matters,” Rhodes told the news station. “The future of our youth matters and I would like to say we are going to continue to fight for this program because it makes a difference in the lives of young people in our country.”
Nationwide, there are 25,000 Job Corps students at 131 centers, according to the Department of Labor. The department said it would work with local workforce partners to help current students to connect with education and employment opportunities.
According to its website, the Job Corp program is a no-cost vocational training program that helps people aged 16 to 24 earn their high school education, train for a career and find work. It’s the nation’s largest residential career training program. The program has trained more than 2 million people since its inception in 1964.

(Photo of Old Knox County Courthouse: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)At a recent Knoxville Smokies baseball game, I had a brief but nice chat with Ed Shouse, former Knoxville City Council member, former Knox County Commissioner, and former Knox County Trustee.  I congratulated him on being one of the few recent trustees not facing scandal.  He chuckled, shook his head, and said, “You’ve just got to remember it’s not your money.”
It is sage advice for anyone doing public service, especially in the trustee office, established in Knox County’s charter for collecting property taxes, disbursing and accounting for county funds and investing money quickly and wisely to earn interest and profits for the county.  We in Knox County like electing all sorts of administrative offices — register of deeds, county clerk, property assessor, even court clerks — but have experienced angst regarding a lot of recent trustees.
A Knox News article noted that when current trustee Justin Biggs was elected in 2022, he hired several friends and gave them raises ranging from 30% to 71% — effectively expanding the office payroll from Shouse’s time, 2014 to 2022, by nearly $400,000.

Knox News also recently revealed how Biggs and his staff ride and travel in style, racking up travel expenses that well exceeded the county rate.  In 2023 Biggs leased six new Ford Silverado 1500 pickup trucks equipped with four-wheel drive for which the county paid $397,968, about $200,000 more than what taxpayers pay for vehicles used by other county offices. GPS data, according to Knox News, shows trustee staff using county vehicles for personal use.  Biggs says he has reimbursed the county $3,500 for excess expenses, though it is not clear if that is the total owed for all involved.  The Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasurer is investigating.  Any follow up to that investigation will be handled by Blount County’s District Attorney.
Biggs, anticipating tough questions from Knox County commissioners, skipped an appearance before the finance committee, instead sending an office legal assistant.  He nevertheless is seeking re-election to his $164,904 a year job. Most of the Republican establishment has been keeping some distance from his campaign; many likely prefer his primary opponent, Register of Deeds Nick McBride.  Former Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe has called on Biggs to resign.
Trustee shenanigans also likely affected our congressional delegation.  From 2010 to 2013 our trustee was John Duncan, III, son and grandson of longtime congressmen John and Jimmy Duncan from Knox County.  Most political wags thought the trustee gig was a stepping-stone to a third-generation run for Congress.  Duncan, III, however, got in trouble by awarding bonuses for certification and training programs for himself and others on his staff; many of the courses had not actually been taken.  Duncan, III resigned the day he pleaded guilty to felony misconduct in 2013; he received probation with an option for diversion.  In 2014, a judge dismissed his case after he completed the diversion terms.
The biggest trustee scandal was that surrounding Mike Lowe, serving as trustee from 1994 to 2007.  Lowe pleaded guilty to two counts of felony theft related to “ghost employees” — associates on the payroll who didn’t work. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said the scheme robbed county taxpayers of more than $750,000; the TBI also said these associates kicked back some of the money to Lowe.  The former trustee, years after leaving office, also admitted to funneling title work to an associate who would overcharge the county, and give Lowe a cut of that, too.
Lowe was sentenced to ten years in prison, but was behind bars for roughly seven months before the rest of his sentence was changed to supervised probation.
Shouse ended 34 years of public service on Aug. 31, 2022.  His eight years of integrity as trustee mirrored similar upstanding behavior in other public offices.  When selecting a trustee or other position of trust, one good guide is to look for trustworthy behavior and proven integrity, someone who knows it’s not his money, to use Shouse’s words.

(Photo courtesy of Food Bank for the Heartland)People in Marsha Keene’s community are already struggling to cover the basics.
Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.
Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.










The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.


– Marsha Keene, CEO of the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in Missouri


In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
‘I’d probably close the doors’
The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.

But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.
Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.
In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
‘It’s time to sound the alarm’
Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-03 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi’s plan for its opioid settlement lets legislators spend tens of millions of dollars on purposes other than the public health crisis,Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/03/mississippi-plan-for-its-opioid-settlement-distribution/,Public health advocates and Mississippians affected by the crisis worry the setup for the state's opioid settlement funds could enable the dollars to be spent on purposes other than ending the overdose epidemic.,"In the fallout of over 9,000 Mississippians dying of overdoses since 2000, lawyers and lawmakers have set up a plan to distribute the hundreds of millions of dollars from corporations that catalyzed the crisis. But public health advocates and Mississippians closest to the public health catastrophe worry the setup could enable these dollars to be spent on purposes other than ending the overdose epidemic. 
Mississippi is expected to receive $370 million from pharmaceutical companies that profited while people struggled with addiction. That payout is set to be split between the state and local governments, with 85%, or about $315 million, being controlled by the Legislature. For years after the state attorney general’s office helped finalize the first settlements in 2021, it was unclear how the state would distribute its share and how much would be used to prevent the crisis from persisting. 
State senators and representatives took a major step toward answering these questions earlier this year. They nearly unanimously passed Senate Bill 2767, a law that outlines a general framework for how about $259 million of the funds will be distributed. 
A 15-person advisory council — made up of representatives for state government agencies, elected officials and law enforcement officials — will develop a grant application process for organizations focused on addressing the opioid addiction crisis. 
After evaluating the applications and making a list of which grants should be funded, the Legislature will decide whether to approve or deny each of the council’s recommendations.
The state lawmakers can spend the remaining $56 million they control for any purpose — related or unrelated to addressing addiction. 
House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who wield massive power over lawmakers and how state funds are spent, did not respond to questions from Mississippi Today about their priorities for the funds. 
Sen. Nicole Boyd, a Republican from Oxford and the bill’s lead sponsor, said she and other senators borrowed some ideas from surrounding states to determine how these funds could best prevent more fallout from the opioid crisis.

“It involves everything, from child welfare services to the judicial system to medical care to mental health services,” she said. “It is a crisis that has affected every aspect of society, and we needed a comprehensive group of people making those recommendations.” 
However, the bill leaves some questions unanswered, like how the application process will work, when it will open to the public and how grants will be evaluated. 
Public health advocates and Mississippians impacted by addiction expressed concern about the advisory council’s makeup, the $56 million carveout for expenses unrelated to the opioid crisis and the Legislature’s final decision-making power. They said those provisions could cause some of the corporate defendants’ dollars to be spent on issues other than addressing and preventing overdoses. 
Jane Clair Tyner, a Hattiesburg resident, lost her 23-year-old son Asa Henderson in 2019 after he struggled for years with substance use disorder. Now, through her job with the Mississippi overdose prevention nonprofit End It For Good, she works to ensure that fewer parents have to go through the pain her family experienced.

She said the only ways these state settlement dollars should be spent are on improving Mississippi public health and keeping people who are at risk of overdosing safe.  
“That’s what it should go towards, but not to the Legislature,” she said. “This is not a rainy day slush fund.”
An evolving plan
It wasn’t always the plan for the Legislature to control so much of the settlement dollars. In 2021, when Mississippi and other states were in the midst of negotiating settlements, State Attorney General Lynn Fitch published an agreement between the state and local governments that would send only 15% to the Legislature’s general fund. 
The agreement said that the bulk of the money – 70% – would be sent to the University of Mississippi Medical Center to build a new addiction medicine institute. But Mississippi law says the Legislature is the ultimate decision maker for how this type of state settlement money gets spent, according to Fitch’s Chief of Staff Michelle Williams.

So lawmakers passed their bill to change the plan. 
The Legislature changed the arrangement to make sure the money goes to where the state’s most pressing addiction needs are, said Boyd. The advisory council, which will be supplemented by at least 22 additional nonvoting members, is a good way to have those needs captured, she said. 
As for the Legislature having final approval power, Boyd said that and other provisions were put into the bill to keep some power with lawmakers if the council becomes ineffective or political. 
It’s the highest percentage of any state’s opioid settlement share that will be controlled by a Legislature, according to the Vital Strategies Overdose Prevention Program and OpioidSettlementTracker.com’s state guides.
Dr. Caleb Alexander, an epidemiology professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, served as one of the plaintiffs’ expert witnesses for some of the opioid lawsuits. Alexander has also helped U.S. cities and counties develop blueprints for how to use the settlements to quell their opioid crises.
He said using the money on a variety of prevention, treatment and recovery strategies, rather than one big project, is likely a better way to save lives and prevent more addiction. But having the Legislature, rather than an apolitical body of addiction experts, play such a large role is not the setup he would suggest. 
“I would have some concerns that it may gum things up,” he said.
Additionally, Alexander said creating ways for funds to not be used to address the opioid epidemic, as the 2025 bill does, is “a shame.” While the settlement agreements say that 70% of the funds must be spent on addressing addiction, there is nothing that prevents all the money from being used for the crisis, and most states are doing that.
He said the settlements define a wide variety of uses as addressing the epidemic — from first responder training to medication research and development — and he doesn’t see a scenario where it makes sense to spend the money on other uses. 
“The costs of abatement far outweigh the available funds for every city or county that I’ve examined,” he said. 
Boyd said she believes her colleagues in the House and Senate are all motivated to use this money to address addiction as a mental health condition. She said the new bill categorizes some funds as “nonabatement” to free them up for ways to address addiction that may not fit neatly into the settlements’ list of uses. 
The attorney general’s original plan was the first to categorize a percentage of the funds as not needing to be used to stop the opioid crisis. Williams said it was written that way to match the terms of the national settlement agreements, although the settlement for the largest payout says spending on purposes other than addressing the opioid crisis is “disfavored by the parties.”
She said Fitch would love to see all the funds be spent on addiction response and prevention, like the One Pill Can Kill campaign the office runs.
“But it’s the Legislature’s prerogative,” she said. 
‘Where are the people in recovery?’
Jason McCarty, the Mississippi Harm Reduction Initiative’s former executive director, said he’s glad the plan is no longer to send such a large portion of the settlement funds to UMMC. Organizations like the Initiative, he said, also could use additional support to keep Mississippians from dying. 
And he’s concerned that while a peer recovery specialist will serve as a nonvoting member, none of the committee’s 15 voting members must be people who’ve experienced addiction. 
“Where are the people in recovery?” he asked. “We’re the subject matter experts.”
Boyd said many of the voting committee roles are representatives of state agencies that she expects will help administer the settlement grants, like the Department of Mental Health. And there were only so many people who the Legislature can assign spots.
“It was no slight to anybody,” she said. “It’s just, this is a completely complex issue.” 
The Mississippi governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the house will each assign two people to the committee, and Boyd said it’s possible they will choose people in recovery. 
The bill says council members need to be appointed by early June. 
However the process plays out, McCarty hopes all the state’s funds go to reputable organizations focused on preventing more opioid-related harm. In Mississippi, he sees a lack of housing and treatment options, especially for new parents, as areas that this money can help address. 
And as hundreds of Mississippians continue to die from overdoses each year, he said the state government has to move quickly and responsibly to make these funds available.

Many blame pharmaceutical industry middlemen called PBMs.","A Rite Aid pharmacy in West Chester, Pa. (Capital-Star photo by Peter Hall)Ron McDermott is a part-owner of six pharmacies in western Pennsylvania and any outsider might think his business has never seemed better. 
Since the Philadelphia-based retail pharmacy chain Rite Aid declared bankruptcy last month and announced plans to close hundreds of stores across the state, McDermott has seen a flood of new customers looking to transfer their prescriptions.
“A lot of people are walking into our pharmacies. A lot of people are calling,” McDermott said. “You’d think that’s great news, but there are problems.”
For most businesses, a major competitor shutting their doors would be welcome. But for pharmacists, taking on new clients can actually pose a risk to their bottom line. McDermott’s pharmacies have had to turn away some new customers whose medications would cost them more to stock and package than they could make selling them.
“It’s the complete opposite of what we want to do as a caring, community-based pharmacy,” he said. “We have to be careful when we take on new patients. That’s a sad situation in health care. It’s not the way it should be.”
McDermott blames middlemen in the pharmaceutical supply chain called pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. They’re companies that contract with insurance plans to handle their prescription services, and are responsible for reimbursing pharmacists for drugs that they cover.
But McDermott and other pharmacists say those reimbursements have been getting smaller for years, to the point where pharmacies are actually losing money dispensing certain drugs. 
Prescription for trouble: Pennsylvania pharmacists say PBMs are driving pharmacy closures

Along with handling administrative work for insurers and reimbursing pharmacies, they also create insurance plans’ formularies — their list of approved or preferred drugs.  In that role, they negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers, often receiving kickbacks in exchange for placing their products on a plan’s formulary — their list of approved or preferred drugs. On the other end, they negotiate with pharmacies to determine how much they’ll reimburse them when they dispense drugs to insured patients.
The companies’ power comes largely from their size. The three biggest PBMs, Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx, are part of healthcare conglomerates that rank among the biggest companies in the country, and have hands in the insurance and pharmacy businesses too. CVS Health, for example, owns CVS, the largest chain pharmacy in America, CVS Caremark, the largest PBM, and Aetna, one of the largest insurance companies. It’s the sixth largest company in the U.S. by revenue.
The “big three,” as they’re known in the industry, are responsible for processing about 80% of all prescriptions in America. That means pharmacists who refuse to accept the reimbursements that they offer are likely to lose customers whose insurance plans rely on them. 
Many of those customers only use generic drugs, which cost pennies or fractions of pennies to stock. Generally, generics make up a majority of a pharmacy’s drug sales, and can be sold at a profit. But a disproportionate share of their revenue comes from the sale of name brand drugs, which can cost thousands of dollars per bottle and is often where reimbursements fall short of costs.
Rob Frankil, the executive director of the Philadelphia Association of Retail Druggists, a trade group for pharmacists, said that McDermott is not alone.
“I’m already having a lot of my members tell me they’re not willing to take in Rite Aid patients, because they’re already losing money on prescriptions they fill,” he told the Capital-Star. “It all stems from the same thing: the reimbursement is bad when you fill prescriptions.”
Greg Lopes, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, a national trade group whose members include CVS, Express Scripts and OptumRx, rejected the notion that PBMs contribute to pharmacy closures.
“PBMs put patients first by working to lower prescription drug costs,” Lopes said in a statement. “It makes no sense to blame PBMs for pharmacy closures in Pennsylvania. Independent pharmacies often point the finger at PBMs, instead of acknowledging that there are many factors that influence closures, including customer preferences for online options and changing demographics. “
Lopes added that PBMs “are supporting community pharmacies in Pennsylvania through programs that increase reimbursement and advocating to allow them to expand the additional clinical services they can offer.”
‘Pharmacies as gold’ 
Lucas Berenbrok, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Pharmacy, has been tracking pharmacy closures around the country.
Recently, he was part of a study that found around 200 have closed in Pennsylvania alone between January 2024 and March 2025.
Berenbrok’s research did not dive into the reasons for the closures, but, anecdotally, he said that it often comes back to unsustainable business models and low reimbursement rates.
“This is a big deal because one of the things that pharmacy has prided itself on for a long time is how accessible we are,” he said. “That’s why I got started in this research.”
Lately, Berenbrok’s work has been focused on identifying what he and his colleagues are calling “keystone pharmacies.” These are businesses that, if they closed, would create pharmacy deserts in the communities they serve.
Berenbrok said his team identified over 200 keystone pharmacies in Pennsylvania, though the list has not yet been made public. 
“It’s more of a preventative approach to say, ‘Hey, let’s look at these pharmacies as gold and try to do things to help them stay in business,’” he said.
The recent spate of closures has not just affected local, independent pharmacies, but large chains as well. In 2021, CVS announced it would close 900 pharmacies. In 2024, Walgreens announced it would close over 1,200 in the coming years.
Last month, Rite Aid declared bankruptcy. In bankruptcy filings, it announced plans to shutter about 150 of pharmacies in Pennsylvania alone, but all of its roughly 350 stores in the state may ultimately close.
In a press release, Rite Aid announced that more than 1,000 of its stores nationally will be sold to other businesses, including CVS and Walgreens, with many remaining open through the transition. A spokesperson for Rite Aid did not respond to multiple requests for comment about how many of those are in Pennsylvania, and how many locations in the state may ultimately shutter.
“A pharmacist is one of very few health care providers where you can walk in and talk to a highly educated, highly trained professional, and sometimes you don’t even have to have an appointment or copay,” Berenbrok said. “It’s a really great thing, I think, for everyone to understand and recognize how important it is to have a pharmacy around.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4196-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-03 06:06:58.657393

(Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)When people refer to West Virginia as “Almost Heaven,” we think of the beautiful, quiet scenic areas like Black Water Falls, Canaan Valley and Dolly Sods, all in Tucker County. 
However, our lawmakers just see money signs — and not very many of them.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey recently signed into law House Bill 2014 — one of his key priorities —  which created the state’s microgrid program to encourage data centers to come to the Mountain State. 
Residents in Tucker County are already fighting a proposed data center. A Virginia company, Fundamental Data, has applied for an air permit from the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection for the “Ridgeline Facility.” It includes an off-the-grid natural gas power plant between Thomas and Davis, which will likely power the giant data center proposed for a site just a mile away from the county’s most heavily populated and tourist-attracting areas.
A microgrid is a small power plant that is usually attached to a larger national grid, but runs independently to power things like a college campus, hospital complex or, in this case, a data center. West Virginia’s new law allows “high impact data centers” to curtail local zoning ordinances, meaning their microgrids don’t have to attach to existing utilities. 
HB 2014, as requested by Morrisey, originally included provisions that would have required electric utilities with coal fired plants to operate at a higher capacity —  69% compared to 40% — and hold a 45-day supply of coal on hand at all times, while most only stockpile a 30-day supply. 
Lawmakers saw this bill as an opportunity to boost the state’s coal industry, but power companies said it would be difficult to meet those standards. Not only that, but meeting those standards would have raised electricity rates for customers. 
The bill was amended dozens of times and passed without those standards, and Morrisey signed it into law. Now residents of Tucker County are worried about a proposed data center taking away from the serene beauty of their home. 
As someone who grew up in Poca just across the river from the coal-powered John E. Amos Power Plant, I understand why you wouldn’t want a new one to pop up near your home. It’s never quiet — you can hear the beep beep beep of equipment backing up all night and the banging of construction, and when the towers release steam, it sounds like the end of the world (at least it did when I first heard it as a child). And coal definitely keeps the lights on at the plant 24/7.
In Virginia, which has the largest data center market in the world, there are local noise and lighting ordinances to protect residents. West Virginia residents won’t have the same protections.
My dad said during the 1970s, before air pollution was taken more seriously, ash from the John Amos plant would be all over the place in the mornings. Sometime in the 1990s, everyone on our street noticed spots on their cars that messed up the paint. My dad said the air pollution commission ran some tests on the spots that indicated they came from the power plant.
It only happened that one time, dad said, but it was worrisome then and it’s something to think about now as the Trump administration rolls back environmental regulations. For instance, the Department of Justice has been told to block states from enforcing their own regulations on coal — because President Donald Trump wants to revive “beautiful, clean coal.”
Not only are power plants loud, but data centers are as well. They create noise pollution, typically a low humming sound, which is the cooling system that must run constantly to keep the temperatures down. Many data centers also use a diesel powered back-up system in case they lose power, and those must be tested monthly. These generators can run between 85 and 100 dBA — 85 dBA is when hearing can be harmed. 
So why are we putting up with this noise? It must be because it’ll bring lots of jobs to the state, right? Not likely. Data centers are just buildings full of computers, and are largely automated. You ever wonder where the stuff you save on the cloud is stored, where the computers that make AI art are or where bitcoin is mined? In a data center. 
Some facilities employ only 50 people. Most data center jobs come from the construction of the facilities, and are often contracted from out-of-state. 
Aside from data centers not bringing jobs, they could cost ratepayers more money. Virginia has proposed two transmission lines for their data centers, and the lines could cost West Virginians more than $440 million, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis
The two transmission lines, both of which cut through West Virginia, were proposed to help with growing demand for electricity from data centers. PJM’s transmission cost allocation methodology charges all ratepayers for the transmission infrastructure because it assumes that the “regional transmission costs could not be attributed to a single new user or class of users.” However the most recent Regional Transmission Expansion Plan processes shows that’s not the case.
While West Virginia is trying to use Virginia as an example on data centers, the state isn’t doing it the same way with regulations and protections. 
“What you’re going to get if you do it this way is the worst players, the ones that didn’t need to be in Northern Virginia,” said Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at Piedmont Environmental Council in Virginia. “… the players that are wanting that lack of regulations because they didn’t want to abide by rules and didn’t want to or need to protect communities, which is worse for West Virginia and the communities. What West Virginia is doing is not what Virginia is doing.”
If lawmakers are serious about bringing data centers to the state, then they need to be serious about the consequences and set better regulations to protect residents who want to enjoy wild, wonderful West Virginia without noise cancelling headphones.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)As the Maine Legislature approaches its final weeks of work, each day is packed with dozens and dozens of consequential votes. After starting around 10 a.m. on Monday, the Senate cast its final vote just after 6:30 p.m. but the House did not until close to 10 p.m.
“We’re done for the night,” House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) said, asking his caucus to walk out of the chamber.
Throughout the day, both chambers rejected a slew of proposals to make significant changes to the state’s Paid Family and Medical Leave program before it starts. The Senate also supported a measure to guarantee agricultural workers state minimum wage. 
But other votes — hundreds — were also cast that take legislation one step closer, or farther, from becoming Maine law. Here are some takeaways from Monday: 
Both chambers
Legislation (LD 3) that would have Maine adopt Eastern Standard Time year-round, contingent on federal approval, now heads to the governor’s desk. It received enactment votes in both chambers on Monday. 
That was also the case for: LD 186, which would clarify the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to establish time-of-use pricing for standard-offer service, LD 1258, which would add qualified out-of-state electric vehicle providers under the Electric Vehicle Fund, and LD 1473, which would require utilities to monitor meters for natural gas leaks.
The following bills have received the initial approval of both chambers, but still need enactment votes:

Growing “tables”
The number of bills on legislative “tables” now abound. 
Bills that land on the appropriations table, which is managed by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee that sets the budget, have already passed the full Legislature with initial votes. However, if they aren’t already funded, they are placed on the table to vie for remaining unappropriated money.
Essentially, that’s everything being voted through with a fiscal note because lawmakers are still drafting what will be in the next two year budget plan. 
For example, the House passed LD 681, “An Act Regarding Public Higher Education Funding in the State,” Monday morning, following an earlier vote in the Senate and bucking the recommendation of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee against its passage. 
On the House floor on Monday, Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) asked, “Are we just discarding the work that’s done by committee?” When the bill was sent back to the Senate for enactment, lawmakers then opted to place it on the table. 
The same happened to LD 697, “An Act to Direct the Maine Prescription Drug Affordability Board to Assess Strategies to Reduce Prescription Drug Costs and to Take Steps to Implement Reference-based Pricing,” which the House passed 125-9 before the Senate placed it on the table. 
After securing favorable votes in either the Senate or House on Monday, the following bills were also placed on the table: 

LD 505: “An Act to Update Processes and Fees in the Probate Court System”
LD 870: “An Act Regarding the Membership of the Maine Land Use Planning Commission”
LD 1097: “An Act to Provide De-escalation and Behavior Intervention Training for School Personnel” 
LD 1773: “An Act to Criminalize Certain Offenses Related to Gift Card Thefts” 

Other bills placed on the table include: LD 60, LD 61, LD 178, LD 192, LD 361, LD 540, LD 616, LD 800, LD 900, LD 1017, LD 1043, LD 1079, LD 1425, LD 1855, LD 105, LD 384, LD 493, LD 500, LD 554, LD 679, LD 858, LD 1100.
There is also a study table, where lawmakers place bills after they pass both chambers if they involve legislative studies. LD 634 and LD 1420 were placed on that table on Monday. 
And there’s a highway table, which LD 1359 was placed on. Maine has separate general fund and highway fund budgets, with the Transportation Committee overseeing the latter.
Non-concurrent matters
After the House voted against a bill (LD 1255) last month that would amend the eligibility requirements for the free community college program, the Senate tried to follow suit, initially. But its vote against the bill failed 15-19, so the chamber passed it under the hammer. It now heads back to the House to see if the lower chamber will reconsider its position. 
Legislation (LD 218) that would make student transfer agreements renew automatically, except in certain circumstances related to attendance or behavior, is poised to die in nonconcurrence. After the House opposed the measure, following the majority recommendation of the Education Committee, the Senate voted for it. The House insisted on its position on Monday. 
The House voted against a bill (LD 115) that would assess impact fees on megayachts over 150 feet long. It now heads back to the Senate in nonconcurrence. The Senate had initially voted to pass the bill, bucking the committee recommendation, but then failed to enact the measure. 
Representatives supportive of the measure described it as a matter of fairness. “Right now, when a family stays in a main hotel, they pay a lodging tax. When a business ships goods through our ports, they pay fees,” Rep. Lookner said. “But when a billionaire docks a 450 foot yacht, a vessel that’s three times as long as the Vinylhaven ferry in one of our harbors, they pay nothing toward the upkeep for our piers, dredging or sea walls that make their stay possible.”
However, Rep. Lydia Crafts (D-Newcastle), speaking against the bill, said individual municipalities already have the ability to assess slip fees.
The Senate stripped the emergency clause from LD 197, which would direct the governor’s Energy Office to conduct a study on the future of electric transmission infrastructure in the state, after it could not reach the threshold needed to enact it as an emergency, which is a two-thirds vote. The bill will now be sent back to the House. 
While that bill now has a chance at passage, LD 213 is essentially dead. The chambers could not agree on LD 213, which would increase the sales commission of retailers who sell lottery tickets. The Senate insisted on its vote against the bill on Monday, after the House insisted on its vote in support of the bill. 
With a 29-5 vote, the Senate passed LD 331, a resolve directing the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure timely reimbursements under MaineCare for hospital cost reports. In doing so it accepted the minority report of the committee, sending it back to the House in nonconcurrence.  
After the House passed LD 77, a measure to fund the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, Fisheries and Hatcheries Division by increasing inland fishing license fees, the Senate initially tried to pass it as well, but failed to do so with a 11-23 vote. The chamber then accepted the minority ought not to pass report. 
The chambers also can’t agree on LD 723, a resolve to direct the Maine Criminal Justice Academy to study the feasibility of establishing a nonresidential law enforcement training program. It failed final passage in the House but was approved for final passage in the Senate. 
Some notable enactments 
Emergency legislation needs a two-thirds vote to be enacted. LD 1551, “An Act to Support Maine Eating and Drinking Establishments by Allowing Vendors to Operate on the Premises of an Establishment with a Liquor License,” easily cleared this bar with a 120-0 enactment vote. 
However, LD 1420, which would establish a commission to “ensure a just and equitable energy transition for Maine’s workforce,” failed to reach that threshold with a 68-61 vote. 
While not an emergency bill, LD 723 failed enactment after House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) called for a roll call vote. This bill would direct the Maine Criminal Justice Academy to study the feasibility of establishing a nonresidential law enforcement training program. The House failed to enact it with a 68-71 vote, after supporting its passage initially with a 74-72 vote last month. 
The Senate also enacted a public land resolve (LD 1724) authorizing the Baxter State Park Authority to convey certain land in Cumberland County.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)This year, Denver again earned the ignominious distinction as the sixth worst city in the country for certain air pollutants. Poor air quality is a public health threat, leading to respiratory symptoms and negative long-term health outcomes — coughing, asthma attacks, cardiovascular diseases, etc.
As the Trump administration proudly rolls back federal regulations intended to protect people from air pollution and climate change, it’s imperative that local governments pass policies to fill the void. However, thus far in 2025, Denver’s City Council has done more to signal its disapproval of poor air quality than actually tackle it.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Denver’s 13-member council made headlines at the start of May when it unanimously rejected a $25 million contract with Suncor Energy’s Commerce City oil refinery to purchase asphalt. The council cited concerns of environmental justice and persistent regulatory violations committed by Suncor.
While divestment from negligent or unethical businesses can be a powerful tool to drive change, the practice must be undertaken strategically. In this case, Denver is taking a stance against Suncor by paying an additional $300,000 to an oil refinery with a similarly long rap sheet of regulatory violations — including some that led to explosions and fires. Because Denver’s asphalt will now come from Cenovus Energy in Wisconsin, it must be transported by rail to Colorado, which creates additional environmental risk. Twenty-five percent of the nation’s hazardous material accidents are caused by railroad derailments. For example, in 2023, a train spilled 500,000 pounds of asphalt into the Yellowstone River damaging hundreds of miles of natural habitat.
And finally, asphalt is a byproduct of the oil refining process, and will be produced regardless of whether or not the city buys it. The Denver council’s symbolic support of environmental justice and clean air is well-intentioned, but not strategic. A more effective means of opposing Suncor would be to reduce demand for gasoline — perhaps by promoting public transit or other modes of transportation, which would have the added benefit of reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
 More micromobility
Just weeks after the Denver City Council’s symbolic move against Suncor, the council passed an ordinance to crack down on micromobility. Since Denver signed an exclusive contract with Lime and Lyft in 2020, ridership of shared electric scooters and bikes has increased steadily. On average, Denverites take 11,100 micromobility rides every day, many of which replace car trips. Considering the emission reduction potential of micromobility, Denver’s council should focus on increasing adoption while balancing the needs of pedestrians and other road users. Unfortunately, the new ordinance isn’t balanced — it forces micromobility companies to mitigate “sidewalk riding,” which is tantamount to making micromobility less safe and, therefore, less desirable.
In 2024, 134 pedestrians and bicyclists were killed by cars in Denver — a 78% increase in fatalities since 2015. Although bike infrastructure is expanding, the city is still decades away from a truly connected, cycle-safe city.
Going forward, Lime and Lyft must enforce Denver’s law prohibiting sidewalk riding or face fines. A possible outcome is charging riders more if they ride on sidewalks. But in a city where sidewalk riding is sometimes the only safe option, that discourages safety. For many riders, this would create a lose-lose situation: Avoid the sidewalk even on busy, dangerous roads, or use sidewalks for safety and incur fines. Or, drive a car, instead.
The new micromobility ordinance isn’t all bad, though. It implements a much needed mechanism to reduce improperly parked scooters and bikes, which too often obstruct sidewalks for pedestrians and wheelchair users. The council should have stopped there — regulate parking, but don’t dictate how riders should safely navigate our car-oriented landscape. The best way to encourage riders to avoid sidewalks is to build safe bike infrastructure.
 Alternatives to widening
Contrary to its stated support of cleaner air, Denver’s City Council has recently made moves to further entrench the city’s car reliance by taking steps to widen Peña Boulevard. This Spring, in a 9-2 vote, the council approved a $15 million study to investigate widening Peña and assess other options to alleviate traffic congestion. One council member suggested that the study is a mere “formality” unlikely to seriously consider alternatives to widening Peña.
Transportation contributes significantly to the region’s poor air quality and is the greatest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Colorado. Investing in road expansion would undermine the city’s commitments to clean air, climate action, and a transit-oriented future. To retain a modicum of consistency, City Council should instead fund bus rapid transit, improvements to the Denver A-Line, greater security at Park-n-Rides along the A-line, or any number of options that would make public transit the most convenient method of traversing the city and getting to the airport.
Considering Denver’s record of poor air quality and the ongoing attacks on our nation’s bedrock environmental protection laws, Denver’s City Council should focus less on signaling support for clean air and environmental justice and more on substantive policies. Besides limiting the construction of new gas stations, the city has done nothing to improve Denver’s air quality this year — the opposite, actually.
Hopefully, the council reconsiders its priorities — before Peña is widened and micromobility ridership drops.

Thom Tillis's Raleigh office. (Photo: Rob Schofield)North Carolina has always been a conservative, business-friendly state in which lobbyists for corporate interests have generally had their way in the state Legislative Building under both Republicans and Democrats.
From the days of tobacco, textiles and furniture to the modern era in which industries like banking, technology, construction and health care predominate, it’s been a rare instance in which lawmakers have said “no” to the policy demands of a large industry – especially those willing to make significant “investments” in political campaigns.
One notable and interesting minor exception to this pattern in recent decades, however, has been in the realm of predatory consumer lending. Throughout the latter decades of the 20th Century right down to the present day, grifting high-cost lenders have generally struggled to gain the foothold here that they enjoy in many other states.
Despite repeated efforts to loosen state laws that bar exploitive products like “payday loans” and “car title loans” and that cap interest rates and fees charged by “consumer finance” companies and makers of high-cost home loans, North Carolina lawmakers have largely held firm.
Several factors that have contributed to this situation, including consistent and forceful advocacy from the consumer protection offices of Attorneys General Mike Easley, Roy Cooper, Josh Stein, and Jeff Jackson; resistance from several legislative leaders (including a handful of Republicans like veteran State Rep. Julia Howard and former State Rep. Jeff Barnhart); and tough stances by the state’s military commanders who’ve seen how predatory loans target and harm the readiness of their troops.
Together with the rise of one of the nation’s strongest networks of consumer advocacy nonprofits – a group that included, among others, advocates from the Center for Responsible Lending, the North Carolina Justice Center, the Financial Protection Law Center and the state’s Legal Aid community — these forces helped keep North Carolina a state that is comparatively predatory lender-free.
What’s more, the successes in this area were so numerous and impactful that following the financial crisis of the early 2000’s that morphed into the Great Recession, they helped inspire action in Washington to establish a watchdog federal government agency known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
In the years since, the CFPB has done prodigious work – winning billions of dollars in refunds for ripped-off homebuyers, student loan borrowers, and banking customers and even putting some predatory lenders out of business. Since its inception, more than 300,000 North Carolinians have turned to the agency with complaints of consumer abuses. More than 86,000 have thus far won relief.
Unfortunately, as one might expect, laws and lawyers that target grifters, scammers and predators are anathema to President Trump – a man whose business career was largely predicated on all manner of shady deals — and he and Republicans in Congress are working hard to gut or abolish the agency.
According to Adam Rust of the Consumer Federation of America, since Trump returned to office in January, his minions have quickly sought to lay off virtually the entire CFPB staff (a move that has waxed and waned in the federal courts), cancelled numerous consumer protection regulations (including rules designed to protect vulnerable seniors from junk fees, rein in online payment app scams and debt collectors, and cap bank overdraft fees), and dismissed more than 20 lawsuits targeting predatory actors.
Where federal law protected certain kinds of work from complete elimination – as with the Office of Servicemember Affairs (a creation of the Military Lending Act) – Rust says Trump’s team evaded the law by simply firing everyone in the office except for a single person. The massive budget and tax bill recently approved by the U.S. House doubles down on this pattern by slashing the agency’s funding agency by around 75%.
To their credit, however, North Carolina advocates and activists – some of whom helped birth the CFPB — have no intention of letting the agency be destroyed without a fight. Last Thursday, several of them gathered for a press event outside of Sen. Thom Tillis’s Raleigh office to plead with him to intervene.
In addition to Rust, speakers included community organizer Emma Horst-Martz, who cited her grandmother’s victimization by an online tech firm as an example of the need to preserve protections for seniors, and a pair of small business women – Ashley Gaddy Robbins and LaCharo Owens – both of whom explained the critical role CFPB protections have played in making access to safe, affordable credit possible for minority and women-owned businesses.
Is there a chance that Tillis could muster the courage, as is his wont every once-in-a-blue-moon, and do the right thing? Experience and a glance at some of his past actions indicate that it’s a huge longshot, but with an uphill reelection race looming in 2026, it seems at least possible that Tillis will see handing such an issue to a Democratic challenger could be a dangerous move.
For their part, the activists and small business owners who pleaded with him last week will not be giving up or going away. Their simple message: stand with the people of North Carolina, not the banks, billionaires and lobbyists. Let’s fervently hope Tillis was listening.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CFBP-presser-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-03 06:06:58.657393

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)One of Gov. Jeff Landry’s appointees to the LSU Board of Supervisors flew into a rage at LSU Health Shreveport when its staff would not perform a house call for her husband, threatening to fire multiple employees, according to a whistleblower complaint. She’s also the subject of other complaints that allege she harassed several employees and meddled in the day-to-day operations of the medical school.
Esperanza Moran, who openly rallied for the dismissal of former LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick, is the subject of an anonymous whistleblower complaint, at least one Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint filed by top LSU Health Shreveport employees and a separate complaint filed to Landry by a top administrator.
The Illuminator obtained documents cited in this report through a series of public records requests to LSU and the governor’s office.

According to an anonymous whistleblower complaint filed with LSU, Moran went to LSU Health Shreveport just days after being appointed to the board and “[caused] a public scene in outrage” that an employee was not permitted to treat her husband at Moran’s private residence. 
“This incident has caused significant distress within the LSU Health Shreveport community, affecting the staff’s health, morale and productivity,” the complaint reads. “While causing the disturbance, Ms. Moran threatened to terminate staff and said she was the new chancellor and in charge of LSU Health Shreveport.” 
The complaint goes on to say that Moran threatened to have Guzick, Sammy Wyatt, LSU Health Shreveport’s chief compliance and investigation officer, and Sharon Dunn, vice chancellor for academic administration, fired from the university. 
Guzick resigned from his position in April after Moran’s months-long pressure campaign and has since accepted a position with the LSU System office. Dunn and Wyatt are still employed at LSU Health Shreveport.
Wyatt asked the governor to intervene, adding Moran’s alleged actions are damaging to his personal and professional reputation, disrupting his ability to do his job as well as damaging LSU Health Shreveport’s public trust. 
“I am writing to request your assistance in resolving an ongoing issue with Ms. Esperanza Moran,” Wyatt wrote to Landry in December. “She has been consciously, intentionally, and maliciously defaming, harassing, targeting, and retaliating against me, utilizing Power-Based Violence and creating a hostile working environment.” 
Power-based violence is a term found in a 2021 Louisiana law approved in the wake of a Title IX scandal at LSU. It is defined as “any form of interpersonal violence intended to control or intimidate another person through the assertion of power over the person.”
When a reporter asked her about the complaints after her Senate confirmation hearing at the State Capitol last week, Moran requested questions be sent to her via email. She has not responded to the emailed questions. 
Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly and LSU spokesman Todd Woodward have not responded to requests for comment.

In its public records request to the governor’s office, the Illuminator asked for any documents containing Landry’s response to Wyatt’s letter. No documents were provided. 
Moran has not yet received state Senate confirmation. Senators typically vote to confirm governor’s appointees in batches and are expected to endorse Moran by the time the legislative session adjourns June 12. 
Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, who represents Moran’s district, said he would support Moran despite the complaints, noting that she has Landry’s support. 
Esperanza Moran lives in Shreveport and is married to wealthy businessman Scott Moran. The couple own several businesses, including Moran Oil Co., and give generously to Republican political campaigns, including Landry’s. 
The Morans also donate significant sums to LSU athletics, culminating in a plaza outside Tiger Stadium being named after Scott Moran when he gave money toward the 2012 remodel of the facility. 
Wyatt referred questions about his complaint to his attorney, Steve Soileau, adding that he is considering suing over Moran’s conduct. 
“Due to the status of the investigations and referred investigations and possibilities of litigation, we do not feel it would be appropriate to comment on specific items at this time,” Soileau said in response to questions about Wyatt’s letter to Landry. “Mr. Wyatt’s letter speaks for itself and he stands by it. His EEOC complaint is still pending.” 
The “referred investigations” involve Wyatt’s work as the medical school’s chief investigation officer. According to Wyatt’s letter to the governor, some of these probes have been into Moran’s personal friends, and one has been referred to the FBI, which Wyatt said in his complaint is looking into the incident along with state law enforcement. 
It’s unusual for a university board member to be the subject of an EEOC complaint, according to several longtime higher education observers. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is a federal entity responsible for investigating workplace discrimination. 
“I’ve seen a lot of supervisors come and go over the years, but I have never encountered anything quite like that,” said Kevin Cope, an LSU professor that has been involved in faculty governance at LSU for multiple decades. He was contacted for reaction to Moran’s alleged actions. “In fact, although the supervisors and I have disagreed, I will say the supervisors usually behave themselves pretty well. So this I will characterize as highly unusual, not only for LSU, but indeed for the nation and for higher education.” 
Politically appointed board members are not meant to be involved in the day-to-day running of a university, as it could threaten a school’s accreditation. But the complaints allege Moran did just that.
LSU closed its investigation into the anonymous complaint just days after it was filed, according to the case file the Illuminator obtained. A reporter reached out to every individual named in the complaint as possibly involved. Some did not respond, but others confirmed they were not contacted for the investigation. Woodward did not respond when asked why not all of the people named were contacted. 
During her Senate confirmation hearing, Moran was asked about the leadership of LSU Health Shreveport. 
“There still needs to be some things cleared up,” Moran said. “When you get the leadership working right, then everything trickles down, so I’m still working on that. I still have a little bit of work left to do.” 
Board members do not have sole authority to decide who staffs administrative positions in a university. Though sometimes they are involved in search committees to hire a top administrator, their influence is weighted by faculty, staff, students and community members.

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)A new lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island aims to stop a three-decade practice in which Brown University police officers keep arrest reports hidden from the public.
The complaint filed in Providence County Superior Court Monday was prompted by a pair of journalists — one is a former Brown University student journalist who graduated in 2024 and the second writes for arts and entertainment publication Motif Magazine. Each was separately refused reports of unrelated arrests made by Brown University’s Department of Public Safety. 
Brown University contends that the officers work for a private agency, and therefore are not subject to Rhode Island’s Access to Public Records Act. The ACLU argues that because Brown’s police officers have the same seizure, detention and arrest powers as local and state law enforcement — laid out under a 1995 law — their actions, including arrests, should be subject to the same scrutiny as any other government agency or public body.
“By engaging in one of the most fundamental functions of government — the enforcement of criminal laws and exercising the power to search and seize individuals — BDPS is acting on behalf of and/or in place of a government agency or public body,” the seven-page complaint states.
The legal action comes as good government advocates, including the ACLU, rally for more sweeping reform of the state’s public records law, which has not been updated since 2012. Among the 48 changes proposed in legislation pending before the Rhode Island General Assembly is a provision clarifying that private university police bestowed arrest powers by the state must be subject to state records laws.
Rhode Island School of Design police are the only other private university in Rhode Island given power to arrest under state law, though they are not named in the complaint. Steven Brown, executive director for the ACLU, said the good government group has received half a dozen complaints, mostly from journalists, about Brown University’s refusal to hand over arrest records when asked. 
“It just seems so clear that a police department, wherever it is located, is operating as a public agency when they detain and arrest individuals,” Brown said in a recent interview. “It is rather daunting to consider the power that they have as law enforcement, that they claim they can hide.”
Brian Clark, a spokesperson for Brown, said the university had not received the lawsuit as of Monday afternoon.
“Should we receive it formally, we will review it in full,” Clark said in an emailed response. 
Clark also pointed to a January opinion by the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General affirming that Brown’s police department is not subject to state public records law because it is not a government body or public agency. 
The eight-page opinion by Paul Meosky, special assistant attorney general, aimed to settle disputes between the university and two local journalists — the same two people named as plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit — over access to campus police arrest reports.

‘Undisputed,’ AG says
Meosky concluded that it was “undisputed” that Brown University’s police department was a “unit of Brown,” and therefore part of a private, nonprofit institution — not subject to state open records laws.
“Nothing in the record suggests that BUPD has open meetings or is listed as a public body on any government website,” Meosky wrote. “Additionally, the record demonstrates that the BUPD is not authorized to operate beyond the university’s campus and its immediate vicinity.” 
Meosky also noted “the strong public interest” in campus police records.
“We strongly encourage the General Assembly to carefully review this issue and whether the APRA should be amended to make law enforcement-type records maintained by private campus police departments subject to the APRA,” the opinion states.
Timothy Rondeau, a spokesperson for the AG’s office, said the opinion “speaks for itself” when asked for comment about the lawsuit.
“Our Office has been, and will continue, to be vigorously committed to open government,” Rondeau said in an email. “This was a challenging issue, and we will await the Court’s guidance.”
Brown said he was disappointed, but not surprised by the AG’s opinion, which followed what he called a “pattern of deferring to local police departments when it comes to open records laws.”
And it’s incorrect, at least in the eyes of Noble Brigham, a Brown University Class of 2024 graduate and one of the two plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit.
Brigham, 23, now lives in Las Vegas, where he works as a courts reporter for the Las Vegas Review Journal. During his time as a student at Brown, he freelanced for the Providence Journal and wrote for the campus newspaper, the Brown Daily Herald.
Brigham asked campus police for arrest reports in December 2022 while working on a story about a man charged by Brown Police with trespassing and felony breaking and entering, after he was found sleeping in the basement of a campus dorm. Brown refused to hand over the documents, prompting Brigham to appeal to the AG’s office in January 2023. 
Brigham no longer keeps tabs on the fallout from the arrest of the man, who had a 10-year history of run-ins with campus police, according to Brigham’s reporting. 
But he insists access to campus police arrest reports is important.
“I didn’t just file the complaint because I thought Brown was wrong in their interpretation of the records law,” Brigham said in an interview Friday. “I also thought it was important for people to know what’s going on.”

Erasing information 
Exempting Brown police from making arrests public also hides whether campus law enforcement are following through with charges on arrests — or, potentially, erasing those arrests even from internal records.
“One of the most important purposes of APRA is to make sure police agencies cannot make arrests disappear,” said Michael Bilow, a reporter with Motif Magazine and the other plaintiff in the ACLU lawsuit. “To this day, I have no legal assurance that Brown didn’t do that.”
Bilow first sought records for Brown University students arrested during a series of pro-Palestine sit-in protests in the wake of the Hamas attack on Gaza. An initial group of 20 students were arrested by campus police for a Nov. 8, 2023 protest, but the charges were dropped.
Another 41 students were arrested for trespassing during a Dec. 11, 2023, sit-in protest, according to news reports. State law requires that Brown University police must submit any arrest reports to the Providence Police Department.
But when Bilow first requested the arrest documents for the 41 students from Providence police, he was told there were no records. He had also tried to get them from campus police but never heard back. Five months later, Bilow spotted a Providence City Council post on X calling on the city solicitor to drop charges against the 41 Brown students. Bilow re-upped his request to the city, using the social media post as proof that arrests had been made and charges filed. 










One of the most important purposes of APRA is to make sure police agencies cannot make arrests disappear. To this day, I have no legal assurance that Brown didn’t do that.”


– Michael Bilow, a reporter with Motif Magazine and one of two plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit against the university 


Bilow eventually got the information he was asking for from the city of Providence, which admitted its error in previously telling him that there were no records.
“My understanding is that Brown Police did the “processing” of the arrested individuals, which led to our confusion here,” a city spokesperson told Bilow in the reply, which is included in a story by Bilow on Motif’s website. “This is why Public Safety had no records of the arrest.”
Samara Pinto, a spokesperson for Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office, indicated this is not unusual.
“Brown University Public Safety reports come into the Department’s possession when criminal cases involving their arrests are referred for prosecution in district court,” Pinto said in an email Monday. “In many instances, the copy in the prosecution file may be the only one we receive.”
While Bilow now has the names and charges against the 41 students, he doesn’t know if anyone else was arrested, but isn’t being prosecuted. That leaves him unable to confirm if others may have been charged but then had charges subsequently dropped.
“I have no proof, but I have no assurance either,” Bilow said. “That in itself is pretty newsworthy.”

Whistleblower steps up 
A former Brown University police officer has begun to speak out about the lengths university officials are willing to go to keep information closeted within the 95-person department. Michael Greco, who worked as a patrol officer for Brown University Department of Public Safety for 18 years before leaving in August, testified in support of public records reform at a State House hearing on May 22.
Greco told lawmakers the department’s exemption from public records law was purposefully manipulated to hide information. On multiple occasions, he or other campus officers would be sent to handle incidents that should have been handled by Providence police, specifically because that would ensure any reports or arrests could remain private, he said.
Greco has filed a workers’ compensation claim against the university after leaving due to post-traumatic stress disorder, which he developed after a November 2021 shooting and bombing threat on campus. In an interview, Greco said he and other officers were sent to respond to a report of bomb threats and someone claiming they were going to “shoot cops.” Greco said he was specifically instructed not to call in the threat on his radio so that Providence police would not hear the information and also respond.
An initial report written by Greco on the day of the threat, Nov. 7, 2021, and shared with Rhode Island Current following the threats at Brown — which were ultimately not proven true — details his concerns about campus police being ill-equipped to respond to an active shooter threat. A printout also shared by Greco shows another officer modified the report two days later; the section in which Greco wrote that he was concerned about responding and was shrugged off was deleted.
“They were willing to dangle us in front of a building where a guy said he would shoot police officers in order to keep something from getting on the Providence radios and out into the public,” Greco said. “If the primary function of Brown’s police department is to take what should be public record and make it private, they are not prioritizing the safety of officers.”
Clark did not respond to requests for comment on Greco’s allegations.
Providence police did eventually respond to the bomb and shooting threats on Nov. 7, 2021. However, the city police incident report notes the call was received at 5:21 p.m., three-and-a-half hours after the initial 1:50 p.m. call to Brown University police noted in Greco’s report.
There were no arrests.
Federal reporting in play
Brown University Department of Public Safety is also required to collect and report crime statistics to the U.S. Department of Education under The Jeanne Clery Campus Safety Act. The university maintains an electronic log of daily incidents, dating back to 2018, noting the date and time of each incident, its classification — larceny, burglary, extortion, etc — and whether the investigation is open, closed or turned over to Providence police. 
The single-line entries offer little detail, and without a formal arrest or transfer to Providence police, most of the specific information remains out of public reach.










If the primary function of Brown’s police department is to take what should be public record and make it private, they are not prioritizing the safety of officers.


– Michael Greco, a former Brown University patrol officer who left in August 2024


Greco also alleged police would routinely doctor incident reports to avoid federal reporting requirements — vandalism became “property damage with malicious intent,” for example. 
“I don’t think that there’s anything more troubling than the notion that an agency that has the power to arrest somebody can keep that information about those arrests secret,” Brown said. “That should concern anyone who cares about transparency and accountability, when any entity is given such incredible power over information.”
The lawsuit asks the court to issue a judgment determining that Brown’s campus police department is a public body, subject to compliance with public records laws. It also seeks court intervention to force Brown University to hand over the arrest documents requested by Bilow and Brigham within 10 days.

(Photo by Tom Pelton/Environmental Integrity Project)A World War II-era boiler in Virginia is at the center of a growing debate over the paper industry’s role in climate change — and how much pollution goes uncounted due to loopholes in federal reporting rules.
The Smurfit Westrock paper mill in Covington, a 126-year-old facility located north of Roanoke, released more climate-warming pollution in 2023 than any other paper mill in the country, according to a sweeping new report by the Environmental Integrity Project. 
The watchdog group found that the facility reported emitting 970,084 metric tons of greenhouse gases last year — but in reality, it released more than 2.5 million tons. The discrepancy stems from an Environmental Protection Agency policy that allows facilities to omit emissions from the burning of wood and wood byproducts, known as “biogenic” fuels.
“This plant is burning dirty fuels using a boiler built in 1940, and the pollution is hitting communities and the climate alike,” said Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project. “Even in the digital age, we need paper products. But there is no reason a clean sheet of paper needs to be made with dirty fuels and antiquated methods.”
The Smurfit Westrock press office did not to respond to an email seeking comment Monday.
The report, titled “A Paper Trail of Pollution,” paints a dire portrait of the U.S. pulp and paper industry. 
Over a six-month period, researchers reviewed thousands of public records and visited mills across the country, ultimately studying the 185 largest paper and pulp facilities in the United States. Their findings suggest that many of these plants are operating with outdated infrastructure, lax oversight and little accountability for their true environmental impact.
Among the most striking revelations is that nearly three-quarters of the mills rely on outdated boilers, with an average age of 41 years. One of the oldest, built in 1928, remains in use at a mill in Longview, Washington. In contrast, experts recommend replacing industrial boilers after about 15 years. At more than 40% of the facilities studied, at least one boiler was a half-century old or older.
The Covington mill, which employs several hundred people and is a fixture of the local economy, has long drawn criticism from nearby residents for the foul odors, soot and water pollution it produces. 
In 2023, it was the nation’s top emitter of methane — a greenhouse gas more than 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide over a 20-year period — releasing more than 214,000 metric tons. The mill also ranked third among U.S. paper facilities for hydrochloric acid emissions, releasing an estimated 170,000 pounds.
The plant’s impact extends beyond the air. State records document at least a dozen incidents over the past five years in which locals reported dark, cloudy, or contaminated discharges — including black liquor, a toxic wood-processing byproduct — flowing into the nearby Jackson River, a tributary of the James River, and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay. 
One complaint, filed in November 2022, warned of “polluted water destroying the Upper James River fishery.” The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality dismissed the complaint.
Victoria Higgins, Virginia director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said the Covington facility is a clear example of how outdated equipment and regulatory gaps are allowing the paper industry to skirt accountability. 
“Pollution from industrial factories burning trees is an under-counted source of climate-warming pollution,” she said. “In order to deliver on the promise of clean air and a stable climate in Virginia, we need to ensure facilities like the more than century-old Smurfit Westrock mill are moving to cleaner energy sources.”
 An industry steeped in tradition

The American paper industry traces its roots to 1690, when the first mill opened in Germantown, Pennsylvania, using discarded cotton rags and waterwheels for power. By 1810, about 185 mills were operating across the country, but a shortage of rags pushed papermakers to experiment with alternative fibers like straw, bark and eventually wood.
With the advent of mechanical wood grinders in the 19th century, wood pulp became the industry standard, and the U.S. quickly rose to become the world’s top paper producer. That growth came at a cost — mill operations contributed to large-scale deforestation, including the cutting of tens of millions of acres of woodland in a single year by some companies.
Today, the U.S. has more trees than it did 50 years ago, thanks in part to replanting efforts by the industry, which now plants over a billion trees annually. The modern paper sector is dominated by a few major corporations and concentrated in states like Wisconsin, Georgia, and Alabama. More than half of paper produced in the U.S. is now used for packaging and wrapping.
Federal law currently allows the paper industry to exclude emissions from the combustion of biogenic materials — such as wood, wood chips, and black liquor — on the theory that trees will regrow and eventually recapture the carbon released during combustion. 
But environmental groups and scientists increasingly question that logic, particularly when emissions from burning these fuels are both large and immediate, while regrowth can take decades.
Nationwide, the 185 mills studied reported a total of 33.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA in 2023. But after factoring in emissions from biogenic fuels — which the EPA does not currently require mills to report — the Environmental Integrity Project estimates that the true number is closer to 115 million tons. That’s more than three times the reported total.
Other pollutants are also under-regulated. In 2020, the mills collectively released more than 46,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, a pollutant linked to heart and lung problems, including premature death. Many mills, including some of the worst offenders, lack basic pollution control devices such as scrubbers that can significantly reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. 
The latter chemical is responsible for the rotten egg-like smell associated with many mills, including the one in Covington, and can trigger nausea, headaches and respiratory issues.
Hydrogen sulfide pollution is especially concentrated. In 2023, 90 of the mills reported emitting a combined total of eight million pounds of the chemical, with nearly half of that coming from just 12 plants. Six of the top 10 emitters of hydrogen sulfide across all industries last year were paper mills, the report said.
The report also found that regulatory enforcement has been inconsistent and often toothless. 
A third of the 185 mills studied had an air pollution violation in the last three years. Over the past five years, 95 of them were subject to 267 enforcement actions, which resulted in just $7.4 million in total penalties — a modest sum for an industry with multibillion-dollar revenues.
 Pollution not unique to Virginia plants

Beyond Virginia, the report includes case studies of plants in Washington and South Carolina, where local residents have filed thousands of odor complaints, voiced worries about health risks, and called on regulators to tighten enforcement. 
In Port Townsend, Washington, a mill has spent 12 consecutive quarters in violation of the Clean Air Act. In Catawba, South Carolina, residents have logged nearly 50,000 odor complaints since 2018 against a mill now owned by a private equity group led by New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.
Duggan and her colleagues argue that the solution lies in modernization and tougher oversight. The report calls for pulp and paper mills to replace aging boilers with zero-emission industrial heat systems and shift toward cleaner energy sources. It also urges a greater commitment to using recycled paper over virgin wood, which requires more energy and water and generates significantly more emissions. 
According to the group, manufacturing a ton of cardboard from recycled materials requires half the energy, 32% less water, and produces just a quarter of the climate pollution.
The study’s authors also demand an end to the biogenic loophole in EPA reporting rules and warn that the issue could worsen if efforts to eliminate or weaken greenhouse gas reporting requirements under President Donald Trump’s administration succeed.
“The American paper industry should modernize these plants to use cleaner and more efficient power systems and increase recycling to reduce climate pollution and protect the health of nearby communities,” Duggan said. “And this industry should not be allowed to hide its climate pollution.”
For residents of Covington and other communities living in the shadow of aging mills, the hope is that attention from this report will bring pressure for long-overdue reforms — before the paper trail of pollution grows any longer.

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) I’ve been thinking a lot about language lately, and the strange way words that used to mean good things are now attacked as bad, and vice-versa. Diversity, equity and inclusion are radioactive. Mentioning environmental justice or climate change will get your federal program canceled. Coal is clean, even beautiful, and pointing out the connection to global warming makes you an alarmist, because speaking up when your government steers you towards disaster is now a bad thing to do. 
Recently I received an email excoriating “woke” energy policy, which seemed especially curious. I can see how awareness of historic racial injustice against Black people might nudge policy makers into greater support for renewable energy, given that pollution from fossil fuels tends to have a disparate impact on communities of color. But judging from the hostile tone of the email, I believe we may have different understandings of wokeness.  
Sometimes, though, words mean different things to different people without anyone realizing they aren’t using the same definition. That may be the case when Virginia leaders talk about the reliability of the electricity supply. Everyone agrees reliability is critical – but they may not be talking about the same thing.
We suspected data centers were creating an energy crisis for Virginia. Now it’s official.

Virginia’s need for power is growing at a terrific pace. Data centers consume so much electricity that our utilities can’t keep up, causing them to increase imports from out of state. That’s okay for now; West Virginia is not a hostile foreign nation. Also, Virginia is a member of a larger grid, the 13-state (plus D.C.) PJM Interconnection, which manages thousands of generating facilities to ensure output matches demand across the region. But even across this wider area, demand is increasing faster than supply, pushing up prices and threatening a shortfall. Unless we tell data centers to go elsewhere, we need more generation, and fast.
Democrats and Republicans are divided over how to increase the power supply. Democrats remain committed to the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which requires Virginia’s electricity to decarbonize by 2050. Meeting the VCEA’s milestones requires investments in renewable energy and storage, both to address climate change and to save ratepayers from the high costs of coal and fracked gas. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin and members of his party counter that fossil fuels are tried-and-true, baseload sources of energy. They advocate abandoning the VCEA and building more gas plants, arguing that renewable energy just isn’t reliable. 
Note that these Republicans are not alarmists, so they ignore climate change. If they were the proverbial frog in a pot of water on the stove, they would consider it a point of pride that they boiled to death without acknowledging the reason.
Youngkin takes every chance he gets to slam the VCEA. As I’ve previously described, the governor sought to amend various energy-related legislation to become VCEA repeal bills, regardless of the original subject matter or how much good it could do.
With vetoes and destructive amendments, Youngkin acts to deepen Virginia’s energy woes

Last month, Youngkin’s Director of the Department of Energy sent a report on performance-based utility regulation to the State Corporation Commission. With it was a cover letter that had nothing to say about performance-based regulation, but a lot to say about the big, bad VCEA. The letter insists that “By all models, VCEA is unable to meet Virginia’s growing energy demand” and urges the SCC to “prioritize ratepayer affordability and grid reliability over long-term VCEA compliance.” 
Unfortunately for the Youngkin administration, affordability hasn’t been an argument in favor of fossil fuels for many years now. A new solar farm generates a megawatt of electricity more cheaply than a new fossil gas plant, and that will still be true even if Congress revokes renewable energy subsidies – though doing so will make electricity less affordable. 
The argument from fossil fuel defenders then becomes that the cheapest megawatt is not a reliable megawatt. And that’s where meaning matters.
Reliability is so important that even the decarbonization mandate of the VCEA contains an important exception: a utility can build fossil fuel generation under certain circumstances, if it is the only way to keep the lights on. 
Dominion Energy is relying on this escape clause as it seeks regulatory approval to build new fossil gas combustion turbines on the site of an old coal plant in Chesterfield. The move is opposed by local residents, environmental justice advocates and climate activists. (No word on whether they are alarmists or simply alarmed.) They argue Dominion hasn’t met the conditions set out in the VCEA to trigger the escape clause, including achieving energy efficiency targets and proving it can’t meet its needs with renewable energy, energy storage and demand response programs.
Virginia Republicans not only side with Dominion on this, they increasingly favor building gas plants over renewables as a general matter, urging the reliability point. It’s an argument that never made much sense for me, given that renewables make up only 5% of PJM’s electricity. That’s way less than the national average of over 21%, and other grids aren’t crashing right and left. 
The light bulb went off for me while I was watching the May meeting of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation. A PJM representative showed a chart of how the grid operator assigns numbers to different resources according to how they contribute to the electricity supply. Nuclear plants get the highest score because they run constantly, intermittent wind and solar sources get lower scores, with fossil fuel plants in the middle. PJM calls that a reliability score.
For some Republicans, that’s a slam-dunk: the chart proves renewable energy is unreliable. But in spite of its label, the chart doesn’t actually measure reliability; it gives points for availability, which is not the same thing. 
As I once heard a solar installer testify, few things are as reliable as the sun rising every morning (or rather, the earth rotating). With modern weather forecasting, grid operators can predict with great precision how much electricity from solar they can count on at any given time from solar facilities arrayed across the region. Solar energy is highly reliable, even though it is not always available. Add storage, and the availability issue is also resolved.
Obviously, the grid would not be reliable if solar were the only resource operators had to work with. But it isn’t. PJM calls on a mix of different sources, plus storage facilities and demand response, to ensure generation precisely matches the peaks and valleys of demand. Reliability is a matter of keeping resources in sync and ensuring a robust transmission and distribution system.
The threat to reliability today comes from the mad rush to connect new data centers. PJM has been roundly criticized for not approving new generating and storage facilities’ connection to the grid at a fast enough pace to keep up with the increase in demand and retirements of old, money-losing fossil fuel plants. Scrambling to recover, recently it decided to prioritize a smaller number of big, new gas plants over the thousands of megawatts of renewable energy and storage still languishing on its waiting list. 
Meanwhile, PJM wants utilities to keep operating coal plants even though it will make electricity less affordable and violate state climate laws. In this it is joined by the Trump administration, which wants to require utilities to keep running coal plants explicitly to support the coal industry. 
Analysts say this is the wrong way to achieve reliability. A recent report from the consulting firm Synapse estimates that PJM’s approach will raise residential electricity bills by 60% by 2036-2040. By contrast, reforming its interconnection process and enabling more renewable energy and storage to come online would lower bills by 7%. By Synapse’s calculation, Virginia would see the most savings of any state. 
In other words, Virginia Republicans are pursuing reliability the wrong way. Instead of pressuring Democrats to back away from the VCEA, they ought to be pressuring PJM to reform its approach. Reliable power doesn’t have to be expensive, if you take the politics out of it.

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt / Getty Images) The Virginia Department of Education is preparing to launch a new Office of Excellence and Best Practices by hiring an executive director who will be responsible for fostering innovation, highlighting high-performing schools, and directing resources toward initiatives with a proven track record of improving student outcomes.
The agency posted an advertisement for the opening last week. 
Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson, who began in March, said it has been challenging for the agency to track and share successful educational practices and resources across school divisions, despite significant funding. She believes the office will help.
“One of the things we’re really working hard at in the department is breaking down silos, including on data sharing, real impact, proven resources that are quickly scalable and usable from the field,” said Gullickson. “We have made progress, but we have a lot more to do to really better support our educators with this data.” 
Some Democratic state legislators, including Senate Education and Health Committee Chair Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, are concerned about the timing of the agency’s decision to fill a senior position. Since Youngkin completes his term in January, the next governor’s administration may have different ideas about the new office and its leadership. 
“If this role is truly essential to the department’s mission, the decision should be left to the next administration, which will be responsible for setting future education policy and direction,” Hashmi said. “Rushing to fill it now appears to be more about entrenching a political agenda than serving Virginia’s students.”
The governor’s administration and Democrats have not seen eye-to-eye on many education priorities with few exceptions, including their work to improve assessment testing and increase teacher pay. 
In 2022, Youngkin laid out his legislative priorities including his administration’s efforts to“restore excellence in education,” after pointing to the state’s “low” proficiency standards and parents’ battles with school divisions over their rights and concerns. 
The governor also called for investing in charter schools and developing more lab schools.
Democrats have sparred with the administration over most of the governor’s initiatives that involved public education funding and equity, curriculum changes and his scholarship program proposal. The administration, lawmakers and educators also disagreed over the administration’s process for revising school history and social science standards, which determine what students need to know in those subjects before graduating.
The Office of Excellence and Best Practices director, once hired, will work in tandem with the Road to Readiness School Performance and Support Framework Resource Hub, which offers free educational resources to families and educators.
The application process closes on June 11.

Susan Collins (R-ME) arrives for a Republican luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on February 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Editor’s Note: This story is the first of a series about U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ role during the second Trump presidency. 
After a campaign promise to bring in outsized federal dollars for Maine, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins won reelection during Trump’s first term, overcoming a record amount of spending against her and defying public polls. At the start of the president’s second term, Collins rose to the helm of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the first time a Mainer has chaired one of the upper chamber’s most powerful committees in 92 years.  
However, Maine’s longest-serving member of Congress has reached this pinnacle of authority as President Donald Trump is attempting to flip the system on its head. His administration, by Collins’ own admission, has unjustly rescinded congressionally appropriated funds, at times singling out Maine in what are widely considered retaliatory actions over the state’s defiance of his executive order rolling back transgender rights.  
During Trump’s second term so far, Collins has bucked the executive periodically, particularly with attempts to reign in tariffs by reasserting congressional control and voting against a budget framework passed by the Senate in April because of possible cuts to Medicaid, the state-federal health program for low-income people and some people with disabilities. Though, in the budget currently being considered, she is supportive of adding work requirements to limit Medicaid eligibility. 
Some of her constituents want to see more public pushback. 
“I focus on results, not rhetoric,” Collins said in an interview. “My goal is not to get on Fox News and MSNBC and rant and rave.”
Outlining her strategy for Maine Morning Star, Collins said she’s had success restoring some funding largely due to conversations outside of public view, relying on her long-developed relationships. 
“It is far more effective for me to, for example, restore the funding that the administration wants to cut for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, LIHEAP, which is so important to the state of Maine, than it is to go make a fiery speech to anywhere that doesn’t result in any change,” Collins said.
But some constituents argue a piecemeal approach to restoring funds will ultimately be ineffective as overall democratic checks and balances are tested.
Collins’ public use of power
During Trump’s first few weeks back in office, Collins said she hoped the courts would side with Congress if the president’s attempts to control spending were litigated. 
Now, with numerous cases in the courts, Collins said, “some of the actions taken by the administration have and will be overturned in court, and others Congress will overturn through the appropriations process.”
She added, “When I disagree with the actions of the administration, I have not hesitated to intervene.” 
Collins said she consulted with the Trump administration in order to restore the U.S. Department of Agriculture grants to the University of Maine, renegotiate the Maine Sea Grant, secure an exception to the hiring freeze at Acadia National Park and reverse the cancellation of a decades-old program that allows parents to register their newborns for a Social Security number while at hospitals  — though Collins’ spokesperson told Maine Morning Star that Social Security Administration Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek told the senator it was an error but reporting later revealed that he deliberately sought to punish Maine after Gov. Janet Mills’ heated exchange with Trump over the state’s transgender protections.
But some Maine voters argue Collins should be using her seniority — as the seventh most senior member of the Senate and the most senior Republican woman — for more than piecemeal fixes. 
Falmouth resident Anne Scheer — who carried a sign during a Tax Day protest in Augusta that read “Where’s Susan?” — said she wants the senator to rally her caucus to stand up for democracy, adding that she doesn’t think that has to be an anti-Trump message. 
“She needs to talk with her fellow Republicans and say, ‘This is enough,’” Scheer said. 










Her vote is the mechanism of government but she has a platform that she could be speaking from.


– Biddeford resident Anthony Burgess


Cape Elizabeth resident Jerry Kaufman, an independent who protested against Collins in Biddeford in April, said he’d vote for Collins if she could convince her colleagues to confront the president to say “stop the foolishness.” 
“Show some leadership and bring some people along with you,” Kaufman said. 
At that same protest, Biddeford resident Anthony Burgess, a registered Democrat who voted for Collins once in 2014, criticized her statements of concern and disappointment about some of the Trump administration’s actions as lacking conviction. 
He said independent U.S. Sen. Angus King’s attendance at the “Hands Off” rally in Portland in April demonstrated for him a refusal to cow to Trump. 
“Her vote is the mechanism of government but she has a platform that she could be speaking from,” Burgess said.
When asked what her response is to those who say she should be doing more to ensure the separation of powers remains, Collins pointed to her questioning officials in subcommittee hearings.
One main purpose of subcommittees is to hold hearings on spending proposals during which members can directly question agency heads. Collins has questioned several, including U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the proposed elimination of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. 
“We’re actually holding these subcommittee hearings at a breakneck pace to evaluate spending requests and reductions, as well as to assess compliance with congressional intent and enacted laws,” Collins said.

Exercising private influence
However, Collins said the public does not see what she feels is her most efficient tactic. 
“My goal is to get things fixed and to get problems solved, and I do that through the federal hearings where I’m laying the foundation for restoration of the cuts in biomedical research, which is an extraordinarily high priority for me,” Collins said, as an example. “But also I do it privately by calling up Cabinet members.” 
Collins said she is so far largely approaching her qualms with the administration through these one-on-one conversations.
This tactic has burned her at times in the past, notably when Collins voted for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after she said he gave her private assurances he wasn’t a threat to Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion ruling that he later voted to overturn.   
More recently, ahead of the deadline to avoid a government shutdown, Collins said she started texting with Trump’s billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency. That outreach does not appear to have gone as planned, at least for the immediate outcome.
While Collins initially said she was “absolutely” opposed to a full-year stop gap approach, she told Politico that Republican leaders instructed her to start writing a plan for that approach anyway. The version that passed, drafted by House GOP leadership, was ultimately pushed through with limited input from spending leaders of either chamber.
But in other cases, she’s touted success that she’s had with these conversations that happen behind closed doors, such as with the restoration of the USDA funding and renegotiation of the Maine Sea Grant. 
“Because I have these relationships with the president’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and with Cabinet members, I have been able to restore funding that was in jeopardy,” Collins said.  
Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine, sees this as a strength unique to Collins.
“Given that she’s the only Republican member of the current Maine delegation and she’s the only person with a committee chair, I think she’s better positioned to have those communications than any of the other members,” Brewer said.  
But while Collins sees these behind-the-scenes negotiations as the most effective way to restore funding that, as she puts it, has been arbitrarily and unfairly cut from Maine, when it comes to attempts to gut entire programs, “that’s going to take legislation,” she said. 
Republicans’ ‘big, beautiful bill’
The sprawling budget bill is the main vehicle where such attempts are currently being made. 
Cokie Giles, a registered nurse at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, protested with National Nurses United outside Collins’ office in Portland in March to demand the senator oppose the possible cuts to Medicaid in the budget. 
While Collins often talks about her ability to work across the aisle, Giles said, “Well, work on your own side, and don’t let these cuts go through.”
After Collins, citing concerns about possible Medicaid cuts, was one of two Senate Republicans to vote against the budget framework that the chamber passed in early April, Giles told Maine Morning Star she was pleased but not confident the senator’s opposition would remain as budget debates continues, nor that her vote would make a difference in the end. 
Late last month, the U.S. House narrowly approved the massive tax and spending plan. The legislation now heads to the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are expected to rewrite much of it, now taking into consideration the more detailed budget plan Trump released on Friday. The bill will then have to head back to the House for final approval, with a goal to get it to the president’s desk by the Fourth of July. 
As passed by the House, the 1,116-page package combines 11 bills. Among its many components, the current plan would overhaul Medicaid, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years under the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.

Collins did not provide specific red lines that would lead her to not support the budget package, but she described Medicaid as critically important for Maine’s health care system and a vital resource for many seniors, low-income families, disabled patients and those who cannot work. She told Maine Morning Star she “cannot support proposals that would create more duress for our hospitals and providers that are already teetering on the edge of insolvency.”
However, Collins is supportive of placing further limits on program eligibility, specifically “work requirements for able-bodied men and women who are capable of working and do not have obligations that preclude them from participating in the workforce,” she said. 
As passed by the House, people who are between the ages of 19 and 65 would be required to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month to be eligible. The language has numerous exceptions, including for pregnant people, parents of dependent children and people who have complex medical conditions, among others.
Under these requirements, 34,000 Mainers would be expected to lose their Medicaid coverage, reducing federal funding by $215 million, according to the progressive Maine Center for Economic Policy.
Maine Gov. Janet Mills warned in a radio address on Friday about these cuts, as well as others that would limit access to the Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces.
“If you receive health care through MaineCare or CoverME.gov, which is the Affordable Care Act, I encourage you to contact Members of Congress to share what that coverage means to you,” Mills said. “They need to hear your story.”
Some shared their stories at a protest against Collins organized by the Maine Democratic Party in Bangor on Saturday, which drew almost 200 attendees who demanded the senator block the health care and other program cuts in the budget.
“In 2020, [Collins] told us that her seniority would protect us, that chairing Appropriations would give her the power to defend Maine’s interests,” said Shawn Yardley. “Her party now controls the White House and both chambers of Congress, but the cuts and the cruelty keep coming.” 
While Collins emphasized some possible future impacts on MaineCare at the federal level, she said, “the state has not been perfect on this issue.” The senator called out the Maine Legislature for being unable to reach a compromise on its state budget.
“The state is holding up more than $100 million in emergency supplemental funding that would draw down nearly $400 million federal funds,” Collins said. 
Maine Senate Republicans held out their support for the supplemental budget plan, and later the two-year budget, because they’d wanted it to include structural reform to Medicaid — notably the work requirements Collins is supportive of adding on the federal level. 
Last month, the Maine House failed to secure enough support to get the now already allocated Medicaid funding out sooner. Some Republicans, though not ultimately enough for passage, supported that effort, arguing the state needs to pay its bills owed to providers, but others called it a blank check they wouldn’t sign. 
With Maine hospitals already struggling to keep services available, state groups are calling on Collins in particular to reject federal health care cuts, as well as cuts to childcare and food assistance in a digital ad campaign launched this week by Family Values @ Work Action, a national network of state and local coalitions aimed at promoting family-friendly workplace policies.
“This package takes food and medicine from the mouths of Maine families to fund tax cuts for the wealthy,” Destie Hohman Sprague, executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby, said in a statement on Monday. 
Among many other components, the federal budget bill proposes cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, through expanded work requirements and shifting some program costs to state governments. Maine would also lose federal matching funds as a penalty for providing coverage to some immigrant populations. 
The budget plan would also raise the debt limit by $4 trillion.
“We have an enormous deficit and debt,” Collins said, “and we do need to evaluate programs.”
As the Senate negotiates what to keep and do away with in the “big, beautiful bill” that represents the heart of Trump’s domestic agenda, how Maine’s senior senator chooses to use her influence, whether in public or not, will be put to the test.

North Carolina’s economy has undergone many important transitions over the last several decades. But in recent years there’s been no more promising arrival on the scene than the electric vehicle industry.
As experts at the national Electrification Coalition pointed out last week, federal EV tax credits have helped spur the creation of more than sixteen thousand jobs and over twenty billion dollars in investments in the state in recent years. And, of course, these are jobs and investments that are not only good for the state’s economy, but for the world as it struggles to end its heroin-like addiction to fossil fuels.
Unfortunately, the massive budget and tax bill approved by the U.S. House last week places all of this in jeopardy by eliminating several tax credits supporting the industry.
The bottom line: Our nation currently spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year subsidizing the fossil fuel industry. The least North Carolina’s congressional delegation can do is help to retain some modest subsidies for an industry of the future that helps our people and our planet.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Republican budget bill the U.S. House approved last month includes a surprise for the 40 states that have expanded Medicaid: penalties for providing health care to some immigrants who are here legally.
Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.
Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.
Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”
West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.
Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”
“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.
There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized anyway when they do start accepting them as they begin to qualify, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.










It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.
The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.
By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.
“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”
The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.
Need to go to the hospital? Texas and Florida want to know your immigration status.

“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”
Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.
Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.
Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.
Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.
“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”
Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.
“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”
More States Offer Health Coverage to Immigrant Children

Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.
“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.
Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.
Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.
“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.
California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.
“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.
If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.
“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.

(Photo courtesy of Food Bank for the Heartland)People in Marsha Keene’s community are already struggling to cover the basics.
Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.
Federal cuts affect regional food access; more uncertainty to come

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.
In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
‘I’d probably close the doors’
The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.
But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.
Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.
In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
‘It’s time to sound the alarm’
Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.
Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

(Getty Images)For years, Republican lawmakers have applied a guarantee to each budget they have passed: “no new taxes and fees.”
This year they’re reconsidering the second part. In a year defined by lower projected business tax revenues, the budget passed by the House in April includes increases to a number of registration charges and levies in the state, from driver’s licenses to tractors.
Legislative leaders say the fees are a pragmatic way forward to address expected shortfalls in business taxes in the next two years — and to apply them to those who use the services. 
“In the past, we’ve kind of overlooked fees,” said Rep. Ken Weyler, a Kingston Republican, speaking to the House on April 10. “… What does it cost to register a car? Not so much. When was the last time it went up? We can’t find any history beyond 25 years.” 
But others, including Democrats, say they’re unnecessary. “I didn’t run on a platform of increasing fees,” said Rep. Matt Wilhelm, of Manchester, speaking in April ahead of the House passing the budget. “If I remember correctly from the flyers that I received in the mail … my friends on the other side of the aisle didn’t campaign on a platform of raising fees either.” 
The question is now in the hands of the Senate, where the Finance Committee is set to wrap up a final proposal for the budget in time for the whole chamber to vote on Thursday, and where senators have already put in place more optimistic revenue projections. 
Here’s a guide to what costs might go up.
Driving fees
The House has included an increase to the fee to obtain a new driver’s license: from $10 to $20. The application fee for a new motor vehicle registration would rise from $25 to $35.
The yearly cost for vanity license plates would also increase, from $40 to $60.
A number of the fee increases would affect professional drivers, specifically. 
Large commercial trucks would all see annual registration fees increase. Those trucks between 8,000 and 73,280 pounds — which include most large commercial trucks when empty — would see a 50% increase in annual fees, from $0.96 per hundred pounds to $1.44 per hundred pounds.
Registration fees for smaller trucks and vehicles would also increase, depending on the weight class. 
The House budget also includes specific registration fee increases for agricultural vehicles, from $6 to $11; for tractors, from $1.80 to $12; for cement mixers, from $6 to $11; and for saw rigs and log splitters, from $6 to $11.
Development and business fees
A number of costs for developers, businesses, and landowners might increase. 
Under the House budget, the cost for an elevator inspection would rise from $50 to $75. And developers seeking to develop subdivisions would have to pay $450 for the application fee and an additional $450 to install sewage systems; those fees are currently $300 and $290, respectively. 
For those building structures on shorelines, the application fee would increase from $400 to $600, as well as $6 per square foot of dock area; currently that amount is $4 per square foot.
Fee hikes for farm products
A number of agricultural companies could see fees increase under the House budget. 
The annual fee for pesticide dealers would increase from $20 to $60, and they would have to pay a new annual fee of $160 for each pesticide they are registering. Fertilizer producers and dealers would see similar increases — from a $50 annual fee to a $100 annual fee, while commercial feed producers would pay $120 for each product they register with the state, up from $75.
The state charges would go up for maple products, too: Those producers would face a new fee of “not less than” $33.
Fishing, dam registration costs
For those looking to fish in New Hampshire, the cost will increase slightly. While presently, out-of-state registrants must pay $15 for a one-day permit and New Hampshire residents must pay $10, they must also pay $1 toward the fisheries habitat fee. That fee would increase to $5.  
And dam registration fees would double, ranging from $800 to $3,000, depending on the hazard potential of the dam. That’s part of a push to better fund long-needed repairs.
 Democrats opposed; industry representatives divided

Weyler said the voluntary nature of fees makes them more fair to taxpayers. 
“If you don’t want to do this, you don’t pay the fee,” he said. “You don’t want to use that, you don’t pay the fee. So we went up with the fees, and it brought us about 5% more revenue, and it should be fairly painless, because if you don’t want it, you don’t, you don’t get it, you don’t pay the fee.
But to Wilhelm, raising the fees is an unnecessary corrective to the budget. “We wouldn’t need to raise these fees … if we halted the expansion of education freedom accounts to ultra wealthy Granite Staters who don’t need taxpayer dollars to subsidize their choice to send their kids to a private school,” he said, referring to efforts in the Legislature to extend the school voucher-like program to all income levels. 
Some industry representatives have strongly criticized the fees. Jasen Stock, the executive director of the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association, spoke against the increased costs for truck owners.
“To increase truck registration fees by as much as 50 to 60% in one fell swoop is a very big pill to swallow, particularly given the economic impacts that our industry has seen with respect to the markets, tariffs and so forth,” Stock said at the Senate hearing. He asked that the fees be increased more gradually if necessary. 
But Rob Johnson, policy director at the New Hampshire Farm Bureau Federation, said his group is not so concerned about the potential new fees. Even when some have doubled or quadrupled, they still do not rank highly on the list of pressing expenses for farmers, Johnson said.
More pressing, he argued, is the need to restore a proposed $50 million cut to the university system, which Johnson worries could hurt the University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension, which supports farms.
“It has an effect (on farmers), but it’s minimal,” Johnson said of the state fees. “And overall, generally, we would rather pay it as a user fee, as opposed to an increase on the property-tax payer.” 
But Bob Scully, the official spokesman for government affairs for the New Hampshire Motor Transport Association, spoke against the fees for trucks and large vehicles, and said lawmakers were effectively passing a tax by another name. 
“There seems to be some discussions that fees are fine and taxes aren’t. If you’re the individual, the money’s coming out of your pocketbook. It’s the same thing.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/countingcash-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 06:06:58.657393

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


Dozens gathered on the west lawn of the Ohio Statehouse to raise awareness that a massive spending bill passed by Republicans in Congress could end up ending health care for more than 750,000 Ohioans.
“People say, ‘Oh, I’m not on Medicaid,'” said Bria Bennett of the Ohio Organizing Collaborative. “But when they hear Caresource (Ohio’s biggest Medicaid managed-care provider), they say ‘Oh yeah, my kids are on Caresource.’ That’s a problem everywhere. People are so focused on ‘How am I getting to work? Is my car going to get me to work? Is my uniform clean for work?’ They’re worried about all those things that trying to dip into the policy things that our politicians talk about is difficult.”
The U.S. House-passed Republican reconciliation budget — President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” — would hand out $4.6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. The University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School estimated that 70% of the benefit would go to the richest 10% of Americans.
Republicans, such as Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, have denied that the budget would cut health benefits for Americans. But then she undermined her own argument by saying “We all are going to die.”

Parts of the bill, including a strict new work requirement, led the independent, nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to conclude that it would cost about 10 million Americans their health insurance. That’s nearly half of the 24.6 million Americans who are covered under the Medicaid expansion that was passed as part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.
Most Medicaid recipients have jobs, and a 2018 assessment in Ohio said that health coverage made it easier for those people to seek and keep employment.
Meanwhile, work requirements have been shown to be ineffective for anything other than hassling people off of the system. Researchers at Harvard University and the Urban Institute found that Arkansas’s work requirement did nothing to boost employment in the state.
The federal government covers 90% of the cost of the Medicaid expansion. In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine proposed that if a significant portion of that funding were eliminated, the state would cut those people off — ending health coverage for 770,000 Ohioans.
That’s nearly 7% of the state. 
It might come as a surprise for many, but 26% of Ohioans are on Medicaid, and low-income residents are so numerous that 30% of households make 200% or less of the federal poverty level.
Bennett of the Ohio Organizing Collaborative said it’s jargon like that that obscures the dire reality in which millions of Ohioans live.
“I don’t know what 200% of whatever is,” she said. “That’s just a number to me. We’re trying to make things relatable because people don’t necessarily know that it affects them.”
For the record, for a family of four 200% of the federal poverty level is $62,400 a year.
Bennett said such households would be devastated if they lost Medicaid benefits.
“I know folks who have four-plus kids. Because of what they make, all of their kids are on Medicaid,” she said. “If that’s taken away, there are no more doctor’s appointments. There’s no more dentist’s appointments.”
And, she said, those life-saving services shouldn’t be axed to pad the pockets of the wealthy in an era of exploding income inequality.
“We should not be giving tax breaks to the wealthy when the poorest and most vulnerable of us cannot even afford health care,” Bennett said.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)In the most recent UNH Granite State Poll, New Hampshire residents said housing is their top concern. 
More than three times as many people cited housing compared to the next most important issue, taxes.  Yes, we are experiencing a statewide crisis of housing affordability. This crisis constrains economic growth and community vitality. Yet the New Hampshire Senate is poised to vote on a state budget that turns its back on housing, cutting funding for important programs that help our cities and towns meet their housing challenges and missing opportunities to help developers build housing that Granite Staters can afford.
The Housing Champions program was created by the Legislature in 2023 with a $5 million appropriation to provide grants to cities and towns to help them voluntarily change their zoning ordinances to be more “housing friendly.” Communities that made these changes were recognized as “Housing Champions” and are eligible for additional funding, such as grants for infrastructure improvements. So far, 18 communities have achieved this distinction, and others are poised to follow. Despite this celebrated success, the Senate has proposed zeroing out this program. This shortsighted decision takes away the principal incentive (“carrots, not sticks”) for our cities and towns to make important zoning changes. 
Earlier this year, the Senate passed Senate Bill 81 (then tabled it to add it to the budget) increasing the annual allocation to the state’s affordable housing trust fund from $5 million to $10 million and making an additional appropriation of $25 million to the trust fund. The annual increase acknowledges the rising cost of building homes — the same money just doesn’t go as far as it once did. The additional one-time appropriation acknowledges the housing deficit we’re in — we need to build many thousands more homes just to meet current demand and help our economy grow. Even with good zoning, the developments that house our workforce require significant financial resources. Witness the several developments that have stalled recently in Concord because of higher costs. Senators gave themselves the opportunity to add SB 81 to the budget and then ignored it.
Finally, the Senate has proposed reducing funding to the Housing Appeals Board, an innovative approach to addressing appeals of local planning and zoning decisions.  The Legislature created the fast-track of the Housing Appeals Board in 2020 recognizing the delays that housing developments faced when local decisions were appealed to court. Time is money, and delays add to development costs. The Housing Appeals Board has been nationally recognized as a light-touch, small-government approach, and it has shown to be an effective and efficient means of hearing appeals. In the midst of a housing crisis, it is nonsensical to pull back on a proven way to speed up final decisions on development proposals.
Our current lack of sufficient housing is a drag on economic growth and is hurting New Hampshire’s families. It’s time for the Senate to put its money — our money — where its mouth is: fund these vital housing programs and help move the Granite State out of its current housing crisis and toward a better, brighter future.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/housing-1024x669.jpg,,,2025-06-03 06:06:58.657393

(Photo via Getty Images)A new study of Ohio Medicaid showed the Affordable Care Act expansion group of nearly 770,000 would bring the state an economic benefit of $1 billion if it survives cuts at the federal and state level. But Ohio Republicans might include a trigger in the state budget to cut the expansion if Medicaid budget cuts come down from Congress.
The Ohio Senate is expected to release its proposed state operating budget in the next few days, a proposal that will then be compared to and combined with the Ohio House’s version already passed last month, before a final draft heads to the governor for his signature.
The Ohio House’s version of the budget absorbed a proposal by Gov. Mike DeWine in his executive budget that creates a trigger effect, eliminating Group VIII, or the Medicaid expansion eligibility group, “if the federal government sets the federal medical assistance percentage below (its current level of) 90%,” according to budget documents.
Child health programs including even pediatric cancer research see cuts in Ohio House budget draft

The expansion group, which was introduced administratively in Ohio in 2014, represents adults aged 19 to 64 who earn less than 138% of the federal poverty level but aren’t eligible for Medicaid in other categories. For a family of two, the poverty level stands at $21,150 in Ohio and other contiguous states.
The federal budget, which is being reviewed by the U.S. Senate, could include a larger state contribution to the Medicaid program than seen in the past, dropping the federal contribution, called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage or FMAP, from its current share of 90%. If that is passed into law, and if the state budget is passed and signed with the trigger in place, the expansion population would face cuts.
According to the Health Policy Institute of Ohio’s newest policy brief, written by Amy Rohling McGee, the 10% the state currently pays to support Medicaid stands in juxtaposition to revenue and state savings generated by the program.
After accounting for the savings the state nets as a part of the program and revenue created, researchers found that the state share is effectively 1.4%.
“Discontinuing expansion would save substantially less than the state share amount, it would reduce federal funds coming to Ohio by over $42 billion over five years, and would leave an estimated 435,000 Ohioans without coverage,” Rohling McGee wrote as part of the HPIO’s 2025 Ohio Medicaid Expansion Study.

The economic activity that results from those in the Medicaid expansion group having their health insurance covered “is projected to generate over $1.1 billion over the next five years in state general revenue from personal income taxes, sales taxes and gross receipts taxes,” according to HPIO researchers.
State revenue would drop in a number of other ways without the expansion group, according to the HPIO Medicaid study. The population brings state revenue through health insuring corporation (HIC) premium taxes and franchise fees, along with prescription drug rebates.
“As part of the federal Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Ohio’s Medicaid program receives rebates from drug manufacturers in exchange for the program’s coverage of most of the manufacturer’s drugs,” the HPIO wrote. “These rebates offset the costs of most outpatient prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid patients.”
Money the state receives from drug rebates goes back into the Medicaid budget to support spending, according to the study.
Along with drops in economic health for the state, the loss of the Medicaid expansion group could negatively impact the state’s overall health, dropping the number of insured Ohioans. The institute’s research said Ohio’s uninsured rate “would potentially increase by 80%” in fiscal year 2026 without the existence of Medicaid expansion.
Those in the expansion group can include students, Ohioans with chronic health conditions, and older residents. Almost 50% of the Ohioans covered under the Medicaid expansion are among the state’s workforce, according to the Center for Community Solutions.
If the Medicaid expansion remained as it is now, the policy institute found Ohio would get more than $42 billion from the federal government over five years to fund the population in that expansion.
“The state would have to raise considerable revenue to be able to fill the gap that elimination of expansion would leave,” the study stated.

(Photo by Morgan Trau.)Ohio is “weak” on policies to strengthen elementary teachers’ math instruction, according to a new report by the National Council on Teacher Quality.
Ohio is one of 25 states that received a “weak” rating by the NCTQ report that was released Tuesday. Only Alabama received a strong rating and seven states earned an unacceptable rating — Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, and New Hampshire, according to the report.

The states earned their ratings based on these five policies — 

 Set specific, detailed math standards for teacher preparation programs. 
 Review teacher preparation programs to ensure they are providing robust math instruction. 
 Adopt a strong elementary math licensure test. 
 Require districts to select high-quality math curricula and support skillful implementation.
 Provide professional learning and ongoing support for teachers to sustain effective math instruction.

A weak rating means a state has some of those policies in place, but not all. Ohio was strong in teacher preparation programs and received a moderate ranking in having a strong elementary math licensure program, according to the report.
“Ohio’s made significant investments in professional learning for teachers in reading, but much fewer investments in financially supporting professional learning in math instruction,” said NCTQ President Heather Peske.
This past school year was the first year Ohio school districts were required to teach the science of reading curriculum, which is based on decades of research that shows how the human brain learns to read and incorporates phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. 
Some of the Ohio’s 2023 two-year budget went toward the science of reading — $86 million for educator professional development, $64 million for curriculum and instructional materials, and $18 million for literacy coaches. 
“You can do two things at once,” Peske said. “It’s really important to kids that they have strong reading instruction and strong math instruction, so it’s high time that Ohio focused on improving math instruction, especially at the elementary level.”
Student math scores predict future earnings better than reading scores, Peske said. 
“Strong math skills add up to better reading scores, stronger college readiness, and eventually even higher earnings for students,” she said. 
Ohio math scores are below pre-pandemic levels, according to the Nation’s 2024 Report Card. Approximately 235,000 fourth-graders from 6,100 schools and 230,000 eighth-graders from 5,400 schools participated in the 2024 math and reading assessments between January and March of last year. 
In Ohio, the average fourth-grade math score was 239, two points higher than the national average and one point higher than the state’s fourth grade math scores in 2022. The scale for NAEP scores is 0-500. 
The state’s average eighth-grade math score was 279, seven points higher than the national average and three points higher than the state’s 2022 test. 
“If we want to improve student math outcomes, we really need to better prepare and support elementary teachers in their math instruction,” Peske said. 
Ohio lawmakers are paying attention to student math scores. Ohio Senate Bill 19 would require school districts or individual schools to come up with a math achievement improvement plan if they don’t have at least 52% of students receive a proficient score in math comprehension. 
The bill has had three hearings so far in the Senate Education Committee.

Stock photo from Getty Images.Ohio utility regulators are gearing up for hearings on FirstEnergy’s role in the House Bill 6 scandal. Former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder is behind bars — although seeking a presidential pardon — for overseeing the largest corruption case in state history.
FirstEnergy funneled about $60 million to a dark money group controlled by Householder. The former speaker used that money to secure his own leadership position and influence passage of HB 6. The measure propped up a pair of nuclear plants and aging coal facilities by tacking a rider onto consumers’ monthly bills.
But that’s just the broad strokes. Nearly five years on from Householder’s indictment, questions remain about how exactly the scheme unfolded and where FirstEnergy officials got the money for it. Half a dozen former FirstEnergy officials in government affairs and c-suite positions are set to testify in a PUCO hearing next week. Four of them previously pled the Fifth and have since received immunity from a Franklin County judge.
At the heart of the case, the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel wants to demonstrate whether FirstEnergy used the money it got from average consumers to bribe state officials.
What to expect
In January, former FirstEnergy executives Charles “Chuck” Jones and Michael Dowling were indicted on federal racketeering charges. Last year, state officials filed more than 40 charges against the executives as well as the man they bribed, former PUCO chairman Sam Randazzo. Last week, a judge in Summit County dismissed theft charges against Jones and Dowling, but they still face several other state criminal charges.
The PUCO proceedings focus on the employees one rung below Jones and Dowling, attempting to show how money moved in the scheme by gathering testimony from the foot soldiers who answered to FirstEnergy’s leadership.
Four of the witnesses previously refused to testify, citing their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination. A Franklin County judge ordered them to testify and granted them “the broadest possible immunity” from prosecution.
Ohio indictments provide a better picture of squalid relationships that spurred massive scandal

The PUCO will also hear from Steven Strah, the former CFO who took over FirstEnergy following Jones’ ouster, and Robert Reffner, the company’s chief legal officer at the time of the scandal.
The Ohio Consumers’ Counsel subpoenas argue consumers were wrongly charged more than $6.6 million, and another $7.4 million was incorrectly listed as a capital expenditure. Compelling testimony, the filings argue, “will help establish how and why FirstEnergy improperly misallocated House Bill 6 costs to the FirstEnergy Utilities.”
“We look forward to getting answers for FirstEnergy consumers and holding FirstEnergy accountable,” Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis said in a statement. “Justice for FirstEnergy consumers is long overdue.”
Just over a month ago, state lawmakers voted to put an end to the House Bill 6 rider tacked on to ratepayers’ monthly bills. The legislation won’t take effect until August. Democrats in the Ohio House, meanwhile, argue the door remains open for next House Bill 6.
“No law in Ohio prevented this scandal,” state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake, argued at a press conference last month. “And since, not one law has even remotely been truly attempted to fix this massive injustice.”
Sweeney, and state Reps. Chris Glassburn, D-North Olmsted, Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, and Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, have filed bills that would require contribution disclosures to or so-called dark money groups, institute penalties for undermining signature gathering campaigns and bar companies that make contributions from receiving state contracts.
The PUCO will hold a procedural hearing this morning, with the evidentiary portion of the case beginning next week, on June 10. The hearings themselves will likely take several days.

(Allison Kite/Kansas Reflector)“I do not believe the bill goes far enough in insuring that the truly needy are able to participate in the food stamp program.”
U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kansas
Me neither, Sen. Dole.
But they’re at it again. Last year, Republicans on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, with the support of Kansas Rep. Tracey Mann, wrote a Farm Bill. It went nowhere, not even a vote in the full House of Representatives. The Senate Ag Committee didn’t even write a bill. Congress missed its second deadline to extend the 2018 Farm Bill.
Why? That bill destroyed the coalition that has united to pass every farm bill of the last 50 years. Farm interests join supporters of food assistance programs to back one comprehensive piece of legislation. Nutrition advocates revolted against the draconian cuts in food stamps — now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP — and farmers don’t have the votes by themselves to pass a Farm Bill in the House.
With the extension of the extension ending in just four months Republicans are running the same play and running scared. They have raided SNAP of $60 billion for new farm subsidies, plus another $230 billion for tax cuts for the wealthy. Low-income families lose $5, with $1 going into a farmer’s pocket and $4 into a rich taxpayer’s bank account. The House Agriculture Committee passed it on a party-line vote; the Republican Mann voted yes while Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids voted no.
Two strikes are enough. Farm lawmakers are using money dedicated to putting food on hungry families’ tables like a bottomless checkbook — a private cookie jar — to increase subsidies to millionaire farmers. Now that the House has passed pieces of the Farm Bill as part of President Trump’s tax cut package (the Kansas delegation split along party lines), the Senate is taking a look. Then, the House should rewrite its rules to take food stamps and nutrition assistance, along with overseas food aid, out of the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee.
It’s probably time to move SNAP out of the USDA, for good measure.
Aggies justify the monstrous boost in spending as necessary to protect farmers from “dire circumstances.” But maybe the circumstances wouldn’t be so dire if farmers were not facing a trade war triggered by Trump’s tariffs. Remember Trump Trade War I and the $20 billion shelled out to make up for that fiasco?
Instead of preventing a replay, Congress went along. Kansas Republicans in the House voted to support Trump Trade War II when they voted for a provision preventing the House from even considering legislation to end the tariffs. Kansas Sens. Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran twice voted against a measure in their chamber that would have done the same.
They saying they’re simply putting “farm back into the Farm Bill,” a quaint description of shoehorning $60 billion in new farm payments into one catch-all piece of legislation. The proposal includes every legislative cat and dog the president and the Republicans can corral — from tax breaks for millionaires to more money to carry out the Trump draconian, damn-due-process mass deportation scheme. (If anyone thinks Congress is taking its responsibilities seriously, look at the sophomoric title its backers gave the bill-a name I refuse to dignify by repeating.)
Lawmakers claim they’re simply asking SNAP recipients to work in exchange for benefits. That sounds reasonable. Democrats favor work too, along with ensuring workers are paid a living wage. However, there is little evidence the requirements the House champions will themselves work. Most research is ambiguous, but it suggests that paperwork and reporting requirements will deter prospective workers.
Moreover, the bill’s transfer of administrative costs to states may lead to even more cuts in cuts in assistance.
If you’re thinking how catchy the “putting the farm back into the Farm Bill” mantra sounds, consider: In the past 10 years, the top three Kansas farm program recipients cashed checks from Uncle Sam totaling more than $30 million. That doesn’t count payments they earned last year and their share of the $10 billion in emergency payments Congress appropriated in December.
The average Kansas SNAP beneficiary receives a little more than $200 per month, and none of them can “eat tariffs” to survive. Meanwhile, the House’s new Farm Bill will boost by $30,000 the limit on a single farmer’s payments. That’s not the maximum amount — that’s just the increase in the maximum amount.
Kansas representatives and senators have never shied from supporting farm spending. It’s Kansas Politics 101. Despite partisan differences, it’s one thing Sens. Dole, Kassebaum and Roberts and Reps. Glickman, Keys, Sebelius and Slattery all had in common. They also all supported a sound, effective, amply funded food and nutrition safety net.

It was a rhetorical question. Kelly DuFour, the voting and elections manager at Common Cause Ohio, knew the proposed legislation wasn’t drafted as a solution to any glaring flaw in Ohio elections. 
So did the overflow crowd hastily assembled in the middle of a day (with little advance notice from the committee) to register overwhelming opposition to SB 153. 
So did the two GOP state senators who co-sponsored the legislation, Bowling Green Republican Theresa Gavarone and Andrew Brenner of Delaware. They see the same data on statewide voting the public does. They know rampant voter fraud or noncitizens casting ballots en masse is not an Ohio problem.  
They know the checks and balances that scrupulously safeguard the administration of free and fair elections in the state routinely produce problem-free elections with 99.9% accuracy. 
They ought to know the 2020 presidential election was not stolen in Ohio from the sore loser whose lies led to a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Gavarone and Brenner also ought to know that there is not a scintilla of evidence that noncitizens are brazenly violating federal and state election laws at the polls.  
Ohio officials who combed through years of voting records in the state were able to identify only six possible noncitizens — one of whom was dead — who cast ballots out of 8 million registered voters between 2008 and 2020. 
A Brennan Center analysis concluded that “even if every one of those cases is proven, that’s less than one noncitizen vote in a million in any given election.” Even Ohio’s partisan hack/elections chief Frank LaRose acknowledged the infinitesimal percentage of potential voting cases involving noncitizens were probably due to mistakes, i.e., being wrongly registered, and not intentional.
Why would noncitizens, who risk much to live free, jeopardize everything with nefarious subterfuge at the polls? They wouldn’t and don’t. 
Proof is the handful of supposed infractions flagged over a 12-year period in Ohio that will likely never rise to prosecutable offenses. The reality is Buckeye elections have been laudably conducted with meticulous rigor to diligently ferret out any suspected discrepancies or irregularities. 
County boards of election across Ohio report that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent in the state — no noncitizens voting, no voter impersonation, no drop box sabotage. 
But that hasn’t stopped the Ohio Senate’s most prolific sponsor of anti-voting legislation from proposing ever-restrictive solutions to nonexistent election problems.

Gavarone is a career climber who jumped on the Trump propaganda train about rigged elections that weren’t and never looked back. After the Big Lie took hold among MAGA faithful, she and other Trumpian opportunists amplified the deception to advance voter suppression measures in state and federal government. 
The senate majority floor leader joined Republicans in statehouses across the country to exploit the unfounded doubt seeded by Trump and his GOP toadies to delegitimize democratic elections long considered the envy of the world. 
Like other MAGA Republicans angling for attention, Gavarone used the Republican-planted mistrust over (baseless) election fraud rhetoric with a spate of bills, including one that produced the strictest voter ID law in the nation and led to the current Senate Bill 153, arguably her most extreme effort yet to limit voting in Ohio.
As a second term senator, Gavarone religiously parrots her party’s talking points about “working to improve the integrity and confidence of Ohio’s elections” as though she really believes them and the charade she adopted in the wake of Trump’s lawless attempt to overturn a legitimate election. 
Her hollow justifications for manipulating the phantom menace of pervasive voter fraud to enact severe voting restrictions that purportedly strengthen “trust and integrity in our institutions” are a parody of trust and integrity. 
But her latest handiwork, with co-sponsor Brenner, is a manifest assault on the voting rights of all Ohio voters. 
It mirrors the travesty passed by U.S. House Republicans — the so-called Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act or SAVE Act — that would severely restrict voting access by making it harder for all American citizens and registered voters to cast a ballot. They’d have to provide documentary proof of citizenship in person to register or update their voter registrations for federal elections. 
Convenient registration options by mail, online, at the BMV, and community options would be eliminated, forcing voters to register only at county election boards. 
The SAVE Act (which saves no one) would disproportionately impact women who’ve changed their names, rural residents, older Americans, Black voters, military personnel, people with disabilities, and students. 
Gavarone’s SB 153 creates the same hoops for those voters and worse. It bans ballot drop boxes so “people don’t have the ability to sabotage our elections” — despite zero drop box threats in the state. It hobbles direct democracy with new barriers for statewide citizen initiatives and referendum campaigns. It creates impossible bureaucratic and financial burdens on county boards of election.
What made-up election problem is Ohio Senate Bill 153 is trying to solve? None. “It’s about keeping people who don’t agree with the people in power from voting,” wrote an alarmed voting advocate in Gavarone’s hometown. Nailed it.

Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.










The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.


– Marsha Keene, CEO of the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in Missouri


In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
 ‘I’d probably close the doors’

The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.

For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.
‘The lifeblood of the community’: States invest to save rural grocery stores

Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.
Federal cuts affect regional food access; more uncertainty to come

In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
 ‘It’s time to sound the alarm’

Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

Early voting began May 27 and will end June 13. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file)For the first time since 2020, Georgia voters have a chance to decide who will represent them on the Public Service Commission. This delayed election comes after a lawsuit challenged the statewide elections used to elect commissioners, arguing it diluted the voting strength of Black voters.
Despite each commissioner hailing from a specific geographic district in Georgia, voters across the state are eligible to vote for each member. This year, District 2 and 3 seats are on the ballot. The 2025 election comes as commissioners face criticism for signing off rising rates for Georgia Power customers. After June’s primary election, winners will advance to the general election in November that will coincide with municipal elections across the state.
With early voting already in full swing, about 18,000 people have cast a ballot as of Monday, according to the Secretary of State’s data hub.
 When is the election?


The primary election will take place on June 17. Early voting began May 27 and will end June 13. If a candidate does not receive at least 50% of the vote in the primary, a runoff election will be held on July 15.
Voters can check their registration status, polling information and sample ballots on the Georgia Secretary of State’s My Voter Page.
What is the Georgia Public Service Commission?
The PSC is a five-member commission that is tasked with regulating electric, telecommunication and natural gas services. 
Why is this an important election for voters?
The commissioners’ decisions and outcomes directly affect how much people in Georgia pay for necessary utility services. Their website points out that “very few governmental agencies have as much impact on peoples’ lives as the PSC.”
Despite this impact, PSC elections tend to have low visibility and voter turnout across Georgia. University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock attributes that partly to limited campaign capability.
“I’ve often said that most Georgians [are] probably not fully aware we have a public service commission, don’t know that it has five members, and couldn’t name a single one of them,” Bullock said.
With limited campaign finances and awareness, it can be tough for candidates to reach voters. As a political scientist, Bullock said he often uses the PSC as an example when trying to identify what partisan division exists in the state. He says that when people vote for the PSC election with limited knowledge they tend to fall back on their preferred party.
“Georgia is still more Republican than Democratic, so I think ultimately, probably the incumbent Republicans are going to win,” Bullock said. “It also helps that once we get to the general election ballot, it’ll have the ‘I’ beside their name, indicating they are the incumbents.”
 What will my ballot look like?


In District 2, incumbent Commissioner Tim Echols is running for re-election. If elected, this would mark the beginning of his third term as a commissioner. Echols will face Lee Muns on the Republican ballot. Alicia M. Johnson is running uncontested on the Democratic ballot. District 2 goes as far north as Hart County and as far south as Savannah. 
In District 3, which includes Clayton, DeKalb, and Fulton counties, incumbent Commissioner Fitz Johnson is the sole candidate on the Republican ballot this month. Gov. Brian Kemp appointed Johnson to the seat in 2021.
All the action in this race is on the Democratic side right now, with four candidates trying to clinch the nomination. 
Daniel Blackman, who served as the Environmental Protection Agency’s Southeast regional administrator during the Biden administration, is fighting to remain a candidate. Blackman was disqualified after Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger agreed with an administrative court judge that he did not have the adequate residency qualifications to run. A Fulton County Superior Court judge granted an injunction allowing Blackman to remain on the ballot for now. A hearing on Blackman’s appeal is set for June 10. 
Other Democratic candidates include Peter Hubbard, who is the founder of the clean nonprofit Center for Energy Solutions, former utility executive Robert Jones and Keisha Sean Waites, who is a former Atlanta City Council member and ex-state representative.
Why are there separate ballots for the PSC primary election?
The PSC primary is a partisan election and requires voters to choose a Democratic or Republican ballot. The primary election will not occur at the same time as any municipal elections. This will not be true for the general election. For cities with municipal general elections also occurring on Nov. 4, different ballots will be offered for each election.
The partisan nature of the primary election often contributes to low voter turnout. 
“Many people do not turn out for primaries,” said Travis Doss, president of the Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials and Richmond County’s election director. “They do not feel that they have an affiliation with a party, so there’s always confusion when it comes to primaries. People argue with us that they should be able to vote for both sets of candidates.”
This was true for a Richmond County woman who recently came in ready to cast her vote but ended up telling Doss that she would not be picking a party. 
Why is this an irregular election cycle? 
A 2020 lawsuit brought forth by Black voters in Atlanta delayed years of PSC elections and challenged the electoral process that allows statewide voters to elect district-specific commissioners. Plaintiffs argued that this is a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and dilutes the voting power of Black Georgians. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately decided not to hear the case, and the at-large method of electing commissioners remains in place. 
 What are some issues surrounding the current PSC?

Critics and consumer watch groups have continued to express concerns over rate prices, growing electricity demands and the spread of data centers. According to previous Georgia Recorder reporting, the average Georgia Power residential customer pays about $43 more to cover base electric rate increases, recover excess fuel expenses, and cover the cost of completing two new nuclear power generators at Plant Vogtle.
PSC staff and Georgia Power reached a proposed agreement to “freeze” base electric rates from 2026 to 2028.  
Critics have pointed out that Georgia Power customers could still see an increase on their utility bill after the approval of funds for storm damage and fuel recovery expenses.

Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)SEATTLE — Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown warned in mid-April that the Trump administration’s actions put the country near the “precipice of a constitutional crisis.”
His comments alongside fellow state attorneys general in Colorado came shortly after the White House defied court orders to return a Maryland man the federal government had wrongfully sent to El Salvador under the president’s immigration crackdown. 
Six weeks later, Brown shies away from using that term, but says President Donald Trump’s disregard for some court rulings, especially in immigration cases, has made the circumstances around how he is wielding executive power “much more dangerous.”
“Whether or not we’re in a constitutional crisis, you know, that’s somewhat of an academic debate,” the Democratic attorney general told reporters before a town hall Monday alongside his counterparts from Oregon and California. “In my mind, we are in a crisis. Call it what you want.”
It’s been a whirlwind few months for Brown, who took office in January. Later that month, the day after Trump took office, Brown sued over the president’s executive order seeking to restrict birthright citizenship. 
Since then, he’s filed 19 more lawsuits, over threats to gender-affirming care, election systems and cuts to a host of federal agencies and funding opportunities. Some of that litigation is playing out in federal courtrooms in Seattle.
Those cases have led to court orders blocking Trump’s actions, but are not fully settled.
Oregon and California are plaintiffs in even more lawsuits than Washington.
Brown guaranteed more litigation to come.
At Monday’s event in Seattle, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield recalled a meeting he had with his governor, Tina Kotek, in January. She didn’t want him to be the next Bob Ferguson, who during Trump’s first term served as Washington attorney general and brought dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration. This raised Ferguson’s profile before he was elected governor last year. 
“During the first Trump presidency, I kept looking on the news all the time, and I kept seeing Bob Ferguson every single day,” Kotek told Rayfield. “You’re not going to do that to me, are you?”
Rayfield told the crowd, “I stand here in Washington to tell you I am the Oregon version of Bob Ferguson.”
At the town hall, the trio of western states’ top legal officials heard concerns from locals about cut public health funding, increasingly brazen immigration enforcement, disinvestment in climate policy, and congressional attacks on reproductive health care.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged that it’s a heavy time for people opposed to Trump. 
”We shouldn’t feel hopeless, because we’re not helpless,” he added. “We have power.”
Where things stand
Last month, Brown was in Washington, D.C., when the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments over challenges to Trump’s order seeking to restrict birthright citizenship. The arguments focused on the legal issue of lower court orders blocking actions nationwide, versus only in the places from which plaintiffs are suing. The justices haven’t yet ruled on the matter.
Meanwhile, Brown’s office will be in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle on Wednesday, arguing to maintain such a preliminary injunction indefinitely stopping the federal government from implementing the birthright citizenship order. 
The attorney general has also been at the forefront of defending so-called “sanctuary” policies that states and cities have enacted to stop local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Brown said his lawsuit against an eastern Washington county that aided immigration agents was “the most difficult case that I have had to bring.”
Last week, the Trump administration included Washington, about three dozen of the state’s counties and a handful of cities on a nationwide list of sanctuary jurisdictions that it feels hinder the work of immigration enforcement. Listed on the inventory was the nonexistent “Swinomish County.” The president has threatened to withhold federal funding from these state and local governments.
Over the weekend, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security took down the list’s webpage amid pushback from police officials.
In a call Monday, Brown and other attorneys general laughed over the administration’s sloppiness.
“We will survive Donald Trump,” Brown said. Still, he felt the need to knock on wood after saying Trump wouldn’t be on the ballot in 2028.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-03 04:21:35+00:00,CT Mirror,CT budget: House OKs $55.8B spending plan investing in children,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/ct-budget-house-vote/,"The House adopted a budget that scales back increases to health care providers, reforms ‘fiscal guardrails’ and invests in children.","This story has been updated.
The state House of Representatives adopted a $55.8 billion two-year budget early Tuesday that invests in child care and K-12 education, provides a $250 tax cut to working poor families and increases hospital taxes in hopes of securing more federal Medicaid grants before Washington caps that program.
The biennial plan, which the Senate is expected to debate Tuesday, increases payments to health care providers who treat the poor but offers a more modest boost than legislative leaders had pledged. Similarly, the budget includes no general increase next fiscal year for nonprofit social service agencies, though it features a $76 million cost-of-living hike in 2026-27. That delayed increase comes with an asterisk, though, since many expect Connecticut’s fiscal picture to change dramatically before then due to shrinking federal aid.
Corporations would pay an extra $213 million in taxes over the next two years combined due to changes in income reporting and other rules. And a corporate tax surcharge that was supposed to expire would be extended to 2028, raising another $128 million over the coming biennium.
The budget, which would spend $27.2 billion next fiscal year and $28.6 billion in 2026-27, would curb aggressive state spending controls. That means $1.2 billion that would have gone toward reducing pension debt over the coming biennium would be redirected into the General Fund. 
The Democratic-controlled House voted 99-49, largely along party lines, to approve the budget shortly after midnight following a debate that lasted more than seven hours. Because of those changes to state budget caps, the package had to be approved by a three-fifths margin, which requires a minimum of 91 positive votes in the 151-member House.
The plan also relies on borrowing and several accounting maneuvers to ensure the plan stays under the constitutional spending cap by a narrow $1 million — 1/240th of 1% of the General Fund — in the first fiscal year and by $75 million in the second.
“While we are unable to fund everything we’d like to fund, we do invest in the things that matter to people,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. “We are proceeding with a budget that values the health and well-being of families, that values the education and early childhood education, that values the needs of children with special needs, that values child care.”
But House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said the plan crafted by Democratic legislative leaders and Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration subverts the spending cap — which is supposed to keep budget growth in line with household income and inflation — and other controls that have added $4 billion to reserves and reduced $8.6 billion in pension debt since 2017.
“It rises to the level of deception and promotion only second to P.T. Barnum,” Candelora said during his pre-session press conference. “This budget eviscerates all of our ‘fiscal guardrails.’”
‘The single-greatest investment in children that I have ever seen’
But increasing numbers of Democratic legislators and advocates for various programs have argued in recent years that these budget controls excessively weaken education, health care, social services and other core programs.
Those “guardrails” were last fixed in 2017 and designed to end a string of budget deficits and prevent future tax hikes after big increases were ordered in 2015, 2011 and 2009.
But they’ve gone far beyond that, capturing an average of $1.8 billion per year since 2017. Analysts project a $2.4 billion surplus, equal to 10% of the General Fund, for this fiscal year, which ends June 30.
Connecticut entered this fiscal year with more than $35 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, a burden created by more than 70 years of inadequate savings before 2011. And critics say one generation cannot pay off the pension debt created by three.
“It’s important that we all realize that change is inevitable,” said Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, longtime co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee. State officials have used $2.8 billion in emergency federal pandemic grants, which could be spent outside normal budget rules, to support core programs since 2021. But those funds have been exhausted.

And while this dynamic has blocked legislators from bolstering many programs, the new biennial package makes “the single-greatest investment in children that I have ever seen,” Walker said.
That involves taking about $220 million from this fiscal year’s surplus and creating a new fund — also outside the traditional budget and spending cap — to fund future increases in early childhood development programs.
The new budget continues ongoing efforts to bolster the Education Cost Sharing program, the chief grant to support K-12 school districts’ operating costs. ECS payments would grow by $90 million next fiscal year. That funding would ensure no district would receive less money than it got this year, even though a legislative formula had called for 81 communities to lose aid in 2025-26.
Legislators from both parties ordered an extra $40 million in special education grants to local districts earlier this winter to mitigate a funding crisis in that program.
The new budget continues that $40 million hike and adds another $30 million for special education in each of the next two fiscal years.
“This budget shows that we’re delivering real impactful change where it counts,” said Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London.
No child tax credit for middle class; poor families get $250 relief
Democratic legislators acknowledged in April that they likely would not approve the full $600-per-child income tax cut many lawmakers endorsed for low- and middle-income households. Analysts estimate that would cost the state more than $300 million per year.
But as recently as two weeks ago, leaders still hoped to provide hundreds of thousands of income-eligible households with income tax relief equal to $150 per child.
That proposal, which would have cost about $80 million per year, also was deemed too expensive this past week, especially given the potential for eroding aid from Washington.
Democratic lawmakers settled on a $250 increase in an existing income tax credit for Connecticut’s working poor — the Earned Income Tax Credit — but only for those filers that have children or other dependents. 
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Saturday the payment likely would be $200 total for eligible households, regardless of how many dependents they would have. But leaders later adjusted that relief to $250, a benefit that will cost the state $35.5 million per year.
Connecticut has about 195,000 households that receive the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program to help the working poor cover basic needs and increase savings. The state credit is worth 41.5% of the federal EITC’s value, meaning it adds an average of $1,061 to a qualifying household’s Connecticut income tax refund, according to nonpartisan analysts. 
Most EITC-eligible households have children and earn between $50,000 and $63,000 per year.
State Rep. Kate Farrar, D-West Hartford, one of the legislature’s most vocal advocates for the broader child tax credit, nonetheless praised the $250 tax relief for working poor families as a step forward.
“There is immediate relief for many people in our towns who are most vulnerable … to pay for the food, to pay for the housing, to pay for that needed health care,”  she said.
Requests for health care, social services scaled back
The budget also increases the Medicaid rates paid to doctors and other providers who treat Connecticut’s poor. But the plan is much smaller than legislative leaders proposed shortly after the 2025 session began in January.
The budget allocates $15 million to boost rates for most providers next fiscal year. The extra funding would grow to $45 million in 2026-27.
Connecticut hasn’t comprehensively adjusted its provider rates since 2007, a problem that critics say has left many poor adults and children on HUSKY — the state’s Medicaid-funded insurance program — unable to find physicians willing to treat them.
Leaders initially proposed spending an extra $300 million in payments to providers by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year.
The hundreds of community-based nonprofits that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored services to people with developmental disabilities or facing mental health or addiction issues also had to settle for less.
They sought $264 million extra in the new budget. The industry insists it misses out on hundreds of millions annually because state payments haven’t kept pace with inflation for decades.
Legislators didn’t order any general rate hike for nonprofits in 2025-26, but they are slated to get $76 million more in the second year of the plan. 
The biennial package also includes $34 million in the first year and $66 million in the second year for nonprofits that run group homes for residents with developmental disabilities. 
But the funds for those nonprofits must be used to increase caregivers’ wages. 
The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed last month to suspend planned strikes at more than 190 group homes and 51 nursing homes after Lamont pledged to boost funding for caregivers in these two service areas.
Lawmakers also included an extra $30 million in the second year of the new budget specifically to bolster nonprofits serving clients with mental health and addiction issues or providing counseling to formerly incarcerated people reentering society.
“The budget is not everything we requested, but in the context of this year’s discussions about budget restrictions, we are grateful for their choice to support programs that will improve thousands of lives and even save some,” said Gian-Carl Casa, president and CEO of the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance.
Gambling on a hospital provider tax increase
Hospitals were unhappy with the new budget, arguing it makes dangerous assumptions and lacks clear details on what the state would do to the industry.
The plan asks hospitals, starting in 2026-27, to pay an extra $375 million per year in taxes.
That doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing for the industry. Connecticut has an unusual tax on hospitals that currently helps both sides. 
It already involves collecting more than $800 million annually from hospitals and redistributing those funds back to those facilities. This back-and-forth arrangement, which most states employ, helps Connecticut qualify for hundreds of millions of dollars yearly in federal Medicaid reimbursements, which it also shares with hospitals.
Lamont proposed back in February increasing the tax by $140 million per year and redistributing those funds back to facilities, estimating it would increase federal Medicaid payments to Connecticut by $94 million. The state would be the chief beneficiary of this bounty, but hospitals also would come out $10 million ahead under the governor’s proposal.
But what if Congress caps this arrangement or reduces the amount states can receive?
State officials have been bracing for months for big cuts in Medicaid payments from Washington as the Republican-led Congress seeks to slash federal spending to save $880 billion over the next decade.

State Comptroller Sean Scanlon, whom Lamont asked to negotiate details of a provider tax hike with the Connecticut Hospital Association, said Monday that the state’s best option is to try to get more from Washington before the door is shut.
“People in our position in every state capitol in America would be fools not to have a conversation about how we might work with this,” he said.
But under the plan, that tax hike is up to $375 million. Between 2012 and 2018, under then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, the state reneged on what it pledged to return to hospitals, prompting an industry lawsuit. It would be settled when Lamont took office in 2019, but hospital officials remain wary.
Further complicating matters, state officials still hadn’t shared any details by Monday evening with the hospital association showing how much each facility might gain if Connecticut secures extra Medicaid funds or what would happen if the state does not.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said “it is our intention to ensure that hospitals are no worse off than they currently are under this tax. We will be discussing plans further with them over the next year.”
But industry officials wanted hard numbers.
“We have made it very clear that we have not signed off on the tax increase contained in the budget or the comptroller’s plan to reduce payments to hospitals as drafted in the budget bill,” the hospital association wrote in a statement. “The state has provided no other estimates, runs, or numbers related to how hospital Medicaid reimbursement would change.”
Connecticut has budgetary safety nets to protect state and hospital finances if Washington caps the provider tax system.
Besides a record-setting $4.1 billion rainy day fund, Connecticut also has a savings program that’s expected to capture more than $700 million in income and business tax receipts next fiscal year and more than $650 million in 2026-27.
Reforming excessive savings programs or risking fiscal stability?
Republicans noted that Connecticut’s safety net is getting smaller quickly.
The savings program that captures income and business tax receipts had been projected to collect $1.3 billion in 2025-26 and $1.25 billion in the second year of the biennium.
Lamont, who has been reluctant to adjust the state’s budget caps, compromised with his fellow Democrats in the legislature and agreed to scale these back to bolster other programs.
The new budget also includes several maneuvers to circumvent the constitutional spending cap.
For example, majority Democrats and Lamont both planned to underfund contractually required health care benefits for retired state workers by about $230 million over the next two fiscal years. Scanlon said he hopes to mitigate that gap by negotiating savings with insurance providers, but any remaining deficit would be taken from the retiree health care trust — meaning the cost, plus interest, would be covered by future taxpayers.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee, couldn’t hide her frustrations about learning a last-minute adjustment to new budget effectively raids that health care trust by another $7 million.

Rep. Joe Polletta of Watertown, the ranking House Republican on the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, chastised Democrats for not working harder to curb spending, given clear signals from Washington that Congress is asking states to get by with less aid.
“Instead of looking for savings in our budget,” he said, “we’re looking for new revenue. That is not a sustainable way to run a state.”
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, offered an amendment to remove funding that supports health care for undocumented residents and transfer the resources, about $58 million per year, into special education grants for cities and towns.
“It comes down to what you want to be a beacon for,” Fishbein said. “I would like to be a beacon for funding for special education for our children in this state. If you want to be a beacon for illegal alien health care, you know, then you vote down this amendment.”
Rep. Geraldo Reyes, a Waterbury Democrat, urged Fishbein to revise his language and refer to those residents as “undocumented.”
“They are human beings, just like everybody in this chamber,” Reyes said. “They do live here in Connecticut with us. They contribute a great deal to this state, to this economy.”
“This is a budget that is based on values … of being accepting, of being understanding, of seeing people who are undocumented as being worthy of respect, as being worthy of health care,” Rojas said.
The House rejected the amendment in a 99-46 vote along party lines.
Republicans also objected to business tax hikes in the plan.
Changes to the corporation tax would require companies to pay an extra $131 million next fiscal year and $81.4 million above current levels in 2026-27.
Connecticut also has placed surcharges on its corporation tax system for decades, often pushing back previously approved expiration dates. That happened again in the new budget.
A 10% surcharge set to expire was extended to 2028. This will force companies to pay $128 million over the next two years combined that they had been hoping to save.
As negotiations on this budget were wrapping up this past week, Chris DiPentima, president and CEO of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said “we’re just ignoring the spending cap when all is said and done and not making hard decisions” to cut spending.
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the finance committee, said Democrats made difficult choices, balancing the needs of residents against the limits of the budget caps and vanishing federal aid.
“We cannot do everything in this budget,” she said. “We are in a moment of constraint.”
Public colleges universities must tap reserves
One area that legislators constrained involves public colleges and universities, which will be forced to tap their reserves over the next two fiscal years to mitigate program cuts and to avoid fee increases.
The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, which includes community colleges, four regional universities and online Charter Oak State College, would receive $479 million next fiscal year and $485 million in 2026-27, appropriations that mirror the $479 million in traditional state funds the system received this fiscal year.
But Lamont and legislators also propped up CSCU spending this year with $140 million in emergency federal pandemic relief, which won’t be available in the coming biennium.
Still, legislators warned system administrators they likely would face a cut. The Connecticut Mirror reported in late March that the CSCU system entered this fiscal year with $611 million in reserves, an amount that represents more than half of its current operating budget.
The University of Connecticut and its Farmington-based health center had more modest reserves but still entered this fiscal year with $171 million and $297 million, respectively.
The new state budget would reduce overall aid next fiscal year by $58 million for UConn’s main campus in Storrs and its regional campuses and by $55 million for the health center. Their funding would drop in 2026-27 by another $15 million and $4 million, respectively.
Rep. Gregg Haddad, D-Mansfield, co-chairman of the legislature’s Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee, supported the budget, but warned that inflation has been outstripping the growth in state funding for public colleges and universities for years. 
UConn and the CSCU system have ordered significant tuition and fees hikes in recent years, and tapping higher education reserves, he said, isn’t a long-term solution.
“We’re shifting the burden of funding our public institutions to students,” Haddad said, adding that leaves them with “greater debt, less opportunity and more risk. We need to do better.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0602_SR_Session_013-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 01:00:20.190763

However, what happens when those in power find the light disruptive? Can they turn it off, leaving the water dark?
This question proves central to the case of Dilan Gohill, a student journalist at Stanford University. In 2024, Gohill entered a building to report on the pro-Palestinian protest. He did not chant slogans, vandalize property, or resist authorities. Yet, when police arrived, they arrested him along with the protesters. 

Ehsanullah Hadi
In determining the validity of Gohill’s arrest, one must address three key questions:

Do journalists deserve special legal protection?
Does intent matter?
Would criminalizing Gohill set a precedent that endangers press freedom?

No one, not police officers, politicians, or journalists, is above the law; however, certain roles sometimes require special legal protection. For example, police possess “qualified immunity to enforce laws” (NCSL). Journalists, tasked with holding power accountable, must be protected not with immunity, but from laws used to suppress reporting. 
In Houchins v. KQED (1978), the Supreme U.S. Court ruled that the press has no special right to restricted areas. Stanford may argue this precedent justifies Gohill’s arrest. However, Houchins does not state that reporting from within a restricted area, strips journalists of First Amendment protections when it relates to a public concern.

Does intent matter?

Yes, in Bartnicki v. Vopper (2001), the court ruled that journalists could publish illegally obtained recordings. This decision was a result of the court reasoning that the public’s right to know outweighs concerns about how information was acquired. Similarly, Gohill did not break in; he intended to report, not to participate. This strengthened his case, and importantly, the protest addressed both a matter of public concern and public significance.

Would criminalizing Gohill set a precedent that endangers press freedom?

Yes, governments have long used laws to suppress uncomfortable truths. In Jean v. Massachusetts State Police (2005), a journalist filmed police brutality, only for officers to raid her home and seize her footage. 
The Court ruled in her favor, recognizing that punishing journalists for exposing the truth threatens democracy. The First Amendment guarantees freedom of the press, and history has shown that when journalists uncover uncomfortable truths, those in power often find ways to suppress them. 
From the early days of the republic to landmark cases, such as New York Times Co. v. United States (1971), the press has repeatedly clashed with the government over its right to report without retaliation. If Gohill’s conviction stands, it sends a clear message. Journalists covering protests risk arrest simply for being present. 
In Bursey v. United States (1972), the Court ruled that press independence must be protected from government interference. If laws can erase the difference between reporting and activism, then journalists will self-censor out of fear, and the public will suffer. Individuals argue that granting journalist protection creates loopholes, and what stops activists from claiming to be reporters?
Journalism is not simply holding a press badge, it means gathering information in the public’s interest.
A lighthouse does not take sides, it reveals the dangers. Punishing Gohill’s reporting will deter journalists from covering protests, government misconduct, and abuse. Journalists are not above the law, but neither are police. Just as officers have immunity to enforce laws, journalists must be able to report without fear of suppression. 
If society allows the lighthouse to be shut down, the water will grow dark, not just for the journalists but for all of the public.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-03 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Repeal CT’s law that denies justice to injured inmates,Alexander Taubes,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/repeal-connecticuts-law-that-denies-justice-to-injured-inmates/,No one should be denied access to justice because of a procedural rule that serves no constructive purpose.,"On November 8, 2022, Marvin Minter was pinned against a wall by a malfunctioning elevator door at the New Haven Correctional Center. The aging elevator, unserviced since 2020 despite numerous complaints, abruptly slammed shut and crushed Marvin’s arm while he was doing his prison job. A correctional officer rushed him to get medical care, but the damage was done —Marvin’s arm is now severely impaired. 
Connecticut’s sovereign immunity laws generally bar individuals from directly suing the state for negligence, unless the state grants permission. That permission typically comes from the state’s Claims Commissioner, an official who acts as a gatekeeper for lawsuits against the state. Because of this, Marvin, who was seriously injured by a faulty elevator while incarcerated, had to file a claim with the Claims Commissioner instead of going directly to court. In other words, he couldn’t simply sue the state agency responsible; he first had to ask the Claims Commissioner for approval to seek compensation.
Seeking some measure of justice, Marvin filed a claim with the Connecticut Claims Commissioner, aiming to hold the state accountable for its negligent maintenance of its elevator.  
The Claims Commissioner, taking the position of Attorney General William Tong, refused to even consider the merits of his claim. 
Why? 
Not because of any factual dispute or lack of evidence, but because of a cruel technicality. Under a 2016 state law, incarcerated individuals cannot file a claim with the Claims Commissioner until they have “exhausted administrative remedies” through the Department of Correction (DOC) internal prison grievance system. Marvin had not completed the prison’s internal grievance process before filing his claim, so the Claims Commissioner tossed it out without ever examining the evidence. 
A 2016 state law demands incarcerated people like Marvin try all administrative remedies (such as prison grievance procedures) before turning to the Claims Commissioner. The catch, however, is that the prison grievance system cannot award monetary damages for injuries. For someone seeking financial compensation for serious harm, filing a grievance is a dead end. Forcing Marvin to exhaust such a process is a classic Catch-22: he had to complete an entire grievance process—with deadlines, filings, and appeals—that could never give him the relief he needed, or else be denied the chance to have his claim heard at all.
This is not only factually absurd but also legally dubious. In fact, it directly contradicts a recent Superior Court ruling. In Mago v. Department of Correction (2024), Superior Court Judge Daniel Klau made it clear that while inmates do need to file internal grievances generally, they should not be required to do so when that process cannot provide the relief being sought – in that case, monetary compensation for injuries. 
This was common sense. Requiring exhaustion under such circumstances serves no meaningful purpose. It doesn’t advance any of the traditional goals of an exhaustion rule (like giving an agency a chance to fix a problem or reducing court case loads) when the agency has no power to grant the remedy in question. Instead, it simply slams the courthouse door on people with legitimate claims. Marvin’s case is just like Mago —the prison grievance system offered no chance of helping solve the problem, so why is the inmate required to pursue it?
Marvin’s case is not an isolated fluke — it exposes a systemic barrier that many incarcerated people face, especially people of color. Incarcerated individuals already struggle to navigate complex legal procedures. Prisons are not exactly conducive to filing paperwork: access to law libraries or legal counsel is severely limited, and strict deadlines and arcane rules can easily trip up even a trained attorney, let alone someone with limited education and likely no legal education. Language barriers frequently mean that prisoners with limited English proficiency cannot even understand the grievance instructions. Research shows that requirements like Connecticut’s create uniquely difficult hurdles for incarcerated people and these hurdles hit inmates of color the hardest. 
Connecticut, for all its progressive reputation, has one of the worst records of racial disparity in incarceration in the nation.

Source: The Color of Justice, The Sentencing Project
Black residents in Connecticut are incarcerated at a significantly higher rate — nearly ten times higher — than white residents. With a prison population so disproportionately Black and brown, any law that makes it harder for inmates to seek redress will inherently have a disproportionate impact on people of color. 
The 2016 exhaustion requirement is a prime example. It slams the courthouse door on incarcerated individuals, a group in which people of color are overrepresented due to systemic inequities. As the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation noted in a recent report, Black incarcerated victims are “less likely to bring a claim or recover damages because of the insurmountable barriers” imposed by stringent grievance requirements. This makes logical sense: when the process is made onerous to the point of futility, many people will simply give up, and injustices will go unaddressed. Connecticut should be working to eliminate such barriers, not entrench them in state law.
The legislature’s immediate step should be to address Marvin’s individual case. Under Connecticut law, the General Assembly can review the Claims Commissioner’s dismissal and decide to authorize Minter to pursue his claim in court or even order appropriate compensation for him directly. Lawmakers should do exactly that. Correcting this injustice will not only help Minter; it will also send a message that Connecticut stands on the side of justice rather than pointless bureaucracy. It would reaffirm our state’s commitment to the principle Judge Klau underscored in Mago v. DOC. 
Beyond the resolution of one man’s claim, Connecticut must confront the broader policy failure here. The 2016 administrative exhaustion requirement (now codified in Conn. Gen. Stat. § 4-165b) should be repealed or fundamentally amended. At minimum, the law must be rewritten to waive the exhaustion requirement when the internal prison process cannot provide the relief an inmate is seeking – for example, when only monetary damages will address the harm. There is simply no legitimate purpose served by forcing people through a grievance process that is guaranteed not to help them. All it does is create delay, deny justice, and generate unnecessary litigation expenses that ultimately waste taxpayer money.
Repealing this law would realign Connecticut with basic principles of justice and with our own stated values. It would not mean opening any floodgates of frivolous lawsuits – claims filed by inmates would still have to meet the same standards of merit as any other claim. It would only ensure that meritorious claims are not thrown out on a technicality before they’re even heard. It would ensure that when the state harms someone through negligence, our system provides a path to make that person whole, regardless of whether the person is incarcerated or not.
No one should be denied access to justice because of a procedural rule that serves no constructive purpose. It is time for the General Assembly to fix this mistake from 2016. Repeal the futile grievance -exhaustion requirement, and let people like Marvin Minter have their rightful day in court.
In the end, this is about more than one elevator accident or one inmate’s injury. It is about affirming that justice is for everyone. When our laws inadvertently shut out the most vulnerable from the justice they deserve, those laws must change. Connecticut’s leaders have the power to remove this barrier now. Remove the hurdle. Restore common sense and humanity to the system. In doing so, Connecticut will take a modest but meaningful step toward a more just and equitable future for all its people.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand Maryland’s decade-old ban on assault weapons, over the objections of four conservative justices who were ready to review a lower court’s defense of the law that they called “dubious” and “questionable.”
“I would not wait to decide whether the government can ban the most popular rifle in America. That question is of critical importance to tens of millions of law-abiding AR–15 owners throughout the country,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a dissenting opinion. “We have avoided deciding it for a full decade.”
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, noted that the high court’s decision not to hear an appeal of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal’s August ruling “does not mean that the Court agrees with a lower-court decision or that the issue is not worthy of review.” He predicted that, with similar cases currently working their way through other circuits, the court “should and presumably will address the AR-15 issue soon, in the next Term or two.”
But state officials welcomed Monday’s court decision.
“The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision today to leave Maryland’s assault weapons ban intact means that a critical law that prevents senseless and preventable deaths will remain in effect,” said a statement from Attorney General Anthony Brown, the target of the appeal.
“Our Office will continue to advocate for gun safety laws at the General Assembly and will defend Maryland’s common-sense gun reforms in court. We will do whatever we can to protect Marylanders from this horrific violence,” his statement said.
Federal appeals court upholds 2013 Maryland assault weapons ban

The high court on Monday also let stand Rhode Island’s 2022 ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines. Justices Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch were also ready to hear that case, which challenged a state law that prohibits the possession, sale or transfer of a firearm magazine that holds more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
The 2013 Maryland law banning assault weapons came one year after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, where 26 people, including 20 children, were shot and killed. The shooter in that case used an AR-15-style rifle along with two handguns.
Gun-rights groups quickly challenged the law, and were given more ammunition by a string of recent Supreme Court rulings that vastly expanded protections under the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms.
The 4th Circuit had previously upheld Maryland’s assault weapons ban. But the Supreme Court ordered the circuit court to reconsider that ruling in light of the high court’s 2022 decision in New York State Police & Rifle Association vs. Bruen — in which it the court said citizens did not need a “good and substantial” reason to carry a concealed weapon, the burden was on the government to prove the need for such a restriction.
A divided 4th Circuit ruled 10-5 last August that Maryland’s ban on assault weapons was constitutional, even in light of Bruen. Circuit Judge Harvie Wilkinson III wrote for the majority that weapons such as the AK-47, AR-15 and Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifle, “fall outside the ambit of protection offered by the Second Amendment because, in essence, they are military-style weapons designed for sustained combat operations that are ill-suited and disproportionate to the need for self-defense.”
An appeal quickly followed, but the court’s refusal to hear the case means the 4th Circuit ruling stands. In his dissent, Thomas said the appellate court “placed the burden … on the wrong party.”
“The Fourth Circuit erred by requiring the challengers to prove that the Second Amendment protects their right to own AR–15s” when, in fact, the burden is on the government to justify its regulation of the weapons, he wrote.
Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said in a text message he is pleased the Supreme Court upheld the state’s law “for now.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Maryland’s Assault Weapons Ban is critical for keeping Marylanders safe. These dangerous weapons like the AR-15 are military-style weapons designed for combat and not protected by the Second Amendment,” Clippinger wrote. “As a country and as a State, we still have more work to do to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. But for today, we celebrate that the Supreme Court has allowed our Assault Weapons Ban to remain.”
Nine other states, Washington, D.C., and other cities have approved similar bans on assault weapons. But Kavanaugh wrote that an estimated 15 million to 20 million Americans “possess” an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.
“Meaning that the States such as Maryland that prohibit AR–15s are something of an outlier,” he wrote.
That’s why Mark Pennak, president of the gun rights group Maryland Shall Issue, said in a brief interview Monday he agrees with Kavanaugh that other pending cases will provide an opportunity.

(Photo courtesy maryland.gov.)Former Anne Arundel County Register of Wills Erica Griswold is appealing her May shoplifting conviction, according to court documents.
Griswold, 50, remains free on a $300 bond after appealing her conviction to the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County. No hearing date has been set.
Griswold was arrested in March for attempting to leave a Severn-area Walmart with more than $160 in sheets and curtains, according to a police report filed with the court.
Prosecutors in May told a judge during a bench trial that while using a self-service checkout area at the store, Griswold failed to ring up some items and used a tag from a lower-priced item to make it appear as if she was ringing up others, citing video from the store that appeared to support the accounts of police and a store security employee.
A defense attorney described Griswold’s checkout as “chaotic.” The attorney said Griswold at times scanned items and placed them on all sides of the register and on the floor. Her attorney argued some were placed in a second empty cart provided by a store employee who was, at times, attempting to assist Griswold.

	During her own testimony, Griswold claimed she was rushing out of the store because of a call about an uncle who had just been admitted to the hospital. Under cross-examination, she told prosecutors that the call came just as she arrived at the self-checkout lane.
Video of the area did not show a phone call. Neither Griswold nor her attorney offered evidence of a call or a hospital admission.
Anne Arundel District Court Judge Shaem Spencer rejected Griswold’s explanation. As he watched a 21-minute store surveillance video showing Griswold completing four separate transactions, Spencer described in open court what he saw — Griswold scanning items the judge said he believed were lower cost. He said Griswold “concealed” other unscanned items or moved more expensive items into her cart.
Spencer sentenced Griswold to six months in jail, but suspended that sentence and tacked on 3 years of supervised probation.
Griswold was already serving a sentence of unsupervised probation stemming from a June 2024 guilty plea to misconduct in office, after she was charged with stealing $6,600 in estate taxes paid to her office when she served as Anne Arundel County register of wills.
As a result of the plea, Griswold was forced out of office. She was sentenced to 18 months in jail. The judge suspended that sentence and ordered Griswold to serve two years of supervised probation.
If her latest conviction stands, Griswold could face potential repercussions for violating her probation in the first case. No hearing has been set for a new trial for Griswold in the shoplifting case. A conference before a judge is scheduled for July.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/griswold_headshot-1024x910.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 23:01:41.271961
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-03 02:33:05+00:00,CT Mirror,Legislation promising modest relief on CT electric bills clears Senate,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/02/ct-electric-rates-bill-senate-pass/,"The bill would also promote grid-enhancing technologies and lower subsidies for solar and other renewable energy, among other measures.","Connecticut lawmakers revealed the long-awaited final draft of their plan to cut residents’ electric bills on Monday, before moving quickly to advance the measure through the frenzy of the legislature’s final week in session. 
The legislation, Senate Bill 4, is expected to save utility customers between $325 million and $350 million annually over each of the next two years, according to proponents. Those numbers amount to about 1 to 2 cents per kilowatt-hour off current electric rates, potentially adding up to a $100 or more a year for many customers.
State Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, who serves as co-chair of the Energy and Technology Committee, called it, “one of the most significant things we’ve done,” in the last six years of attempting to address the state’s infamously high electricity prices.
“We put money back in people’s pockets, took a hard look — and much as many of my colleagues think we can do better, I dare them to try without screwing up the system,” he added.
In addition to providing direct relief for ratepayers, the bill would make myriad changes to energy policy in Connecticut such as promoting grid-enhancing technologies, lowering subsidies for solar and other renewable energy sources, and offering utilities more flexibility in how they purchase power for their customers.
Over the long term, Needleman said, those changes will help contain costs that are passed along to residents through their electric bills. 
The Senate’s bipartisan, 34-1 vote late Monday advanced the bill to the House, where lawmakers now have just two days to agree to the legislation and send it to Gov. Ned Lamont’s desk before this year’s legislative session closes Wednesday.
“I’m glad to report that Democratic and Republican legislators and my office have made significant progress on legislation to reduce electric rates, which among other things eliminates some of the public benefits from consumers’ bills,” Lamont said in an X post Monday morning. “I encourage the legislature to approve this.”
Over the two weeks preceding Monday’s vote, lawmakers held a series of closed-door meetings with members of Lamont’s administration, utility representatives and other key stakeholders to hammer out the final details in the 134-page bill.
Throughout this year’s legislative session, Republicans have pushed for even bigger savings by removing the entirety of the public benefits charge from customers’ bills and paying for those programs out of the state’s budget. 
But the cost of doing so — roughly $1 billion each year — would have forced the state to cut spending in other areas, Democrats argued.
“Not one of us should walk out of this chamber today even close to believing that we resolved this problem,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “The public benefits charge still exists, it’s still too high and our electric rates are still too high.” 
The two biggest sources of savings in the final draft of the bill will be paid for through borrowing to cover the costs of public benefits programs and other charges that appear on customers’ bills.
The bill authorizes up to $125 million a year in general obligation bonds — to be paid back by taxpayers — to cover the costs of unpaid bills accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with an additional $50 million over two years for the rollout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. 
An additional $135 million in estimated savings comes from the use of rate-reduction bonds to pay for storm costs and the installation of advanced metering technology. Those bonds would be paid back by utility customers through the public benefits charge, but over a longer period of time and at lower interest rates than under the current law. 
The final pot of savings, about $100 million, will result from the variety of other changes to existing policies the bill makes, including removing wood-burning biomass facilities from the top tier of the state’s renewable energy portfolio.
Haggling over details
One particularly troublesome point in lawmakers’ negotiations hinged on language in the bill describing the administrative practices and makeup of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, the state agency that oversees and approves utility rates.
Republicans argued that an earlier draft of the legislation would have given more authority to the authority’s chairperson, Marissa Gillett, to issue rulings on procedural and other intermediate matters without the explicit backing of her fellow commissioners. 
Those powers are currently subject to a lawsuit brought by both of the state’s utilities, who have accused Gillett of issuing hundreds of unilateral rulings in cases before regulators. Both Gillet and PURA have disputed those charges.  
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, had demanded Democrats remove the controversial language from the bill in order to get the blessing of Republicans, who have the ability to talk bills to death as time runs out in the legislative session. When the latest draft of the bill was released Monday morning, the section had been amended to address most of Republicans’ concerns — save for a single sentence clarifying that Gillett served as the “administrative head” of PURA.
“Now we’re back to this circular fight: does this mean she can just assign cases to herself?” Candelora said. 
By Monday evening, however, the language had been changed again to refer to to the chair as the “chief executive” of PURA, ending Candelora’s opposition.
A spokesperson for PURA was not immediately available for comment following the bill’s passage around 8:30 p.m. 
In a statement, United Illuminating spokeswoman Sarah Wall Fliotsos praised the passage of the legislation, which she said followed years of lobbying by utilities to address costs.
“It is gratifying to see that legislators have at last turned to these challenges by introducing new funding mechanisms for the Public Benefits Charge and new procurement strategies for energy supply, both of which could help stabilize cost for customers,” Fliotsos said. “New policies to increase the stability and predictability of the state’s regulatory environment can also put Connecticut on the right track to enable the investment and grid modernization in the electric grid that our customers sorely need. There remains more work to be done, but we look forward to working with our customers and the state to implement these new measures.”
A spokeswoman for Eversource said the company would reserve comment until final passage of the bill. 
In addition to the debate over the authority’s administrative practices, lawmakers have also pushed Lamont to fill a pair of vacancies that have existed on PURA’s board since it was expanded to five members in 2019. 
Earlier this year, the governor appeared to have reached a deal with lawmakers to appoint two people — state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, and former state Rep. Holly Cheeseman, R-East Lyme — in exchange for Gillett’s renomination to another four-year term. That deal fell apart, however, over the complexities involved with appointing a sitting lawmaker and Fonfara’s past business dealings before PURA.
As part of their negotiations over S.B. 4, both Candelora and House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Monday that they’d reached a “handshake” agreement with Lamont to fill the two vacant positions before the start of next year’s legislative session.
No names were announced as part of the purported deal, which was confirmed by Lamont’s office. 
Fonfara was the only member of the Senate to vote against the bill on Monday, which he described as missed opportunity to take more systematic changes, particularly around energy procurement.
“We think because ‘Oh we’re at the end of the pipeline,’ we think because costs are always higher in Connecticut or in New England, that this is our fate,” Fonfara said. “It should not be our fate, we can do better.”
Nixed plans
Amid a flurry of late changes made to the bill in recent days was the removal of a proposal to borrow an additional $750 million over five years to pay for energy efficiency programs that are currently funded as part of the public benefits charge.
While the plan would have removed those costs from customers’ electric bills, opposition emerged this week from environmental advocates and some business owners who argued that a reliance on borrowing — which must be approved by lawmakers — would destabilize the state’s energy efficiency industry.
More than 44,000 people in Connecticut are employed in HVAC, electrical, weatherization and solar jobs that are funded by investments in energy efficiency, according to a report published by the utilities in March.
“It is very tough for us as business owners to shut the doors, and they reopen if  funding is not available,” said Edgardo Mejias, the owner of Energy Efficiency Solutions. “We cannot grow our businesses, we cannot offer services we provide to the individuals we serve.”
An earlier proposal in the bill would have also shortened Connecticut’s winter shutoff moratorium by one month and removed shutoff protections for people with certain medical conditions. Instead, those protections would have only been made available to people who can’t afford to pay their winter heating bills.
While proponents argued the changes would have saved additional millions of dollars while cutting down on fraud, opposition from groups such as the American Association of Retired Persons resulted in those provisions being stripped from the bill.
Another controversial proposal to implement time-of-use electric rates — which advocates argued would be harder to adopt by older people and those with medical needs — was referred to PURA to come up with a workable system. 
“I don’t like the bill, but some of the areas we fought to improve are improved to a certain degree,” said John Erlingheuser, a lobbyist for AARP’s Connecticut chapter.
Connecticut had the third highest cost of electricity of any state in May, according to data collected PowerOutage.us, with an average residential bill of $187. Every other state in New England made it into the top 10 states by cost of electricity.
Electric rates did drop slightly in May following PURA’s most recent decision to adjust the cost of the public benefits and transmission charges. Customers are likely to see an additional drop in July, due to lower supply rates that have been put forward by both of the major utilities.
However, the start of summer is also when many Connecticut residents begin to rely on air conditioning to cool their homes and businesses, driving up usage — and, with it, the cost of their electric bills.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024_0626_THM_SenateSession-13-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 23:01:41.271961

(Courtesy of the Ciattarelli campaign)President Donald Trump urged his New Jersey supporters during a virtual rally Monday night to vote for Republican Jack Ciattarelli for governor in the June 10 GOP primary, calling Ciattarelli a “true champion” for the Garden State. 
“It’s being watched actually all over the world because New Jersey’s ready to pop out of that blue horror show and really get in there and vote for somebody that’s going to make things happen,” Trump said.
Trump’s push for Ciattarelli came on the eve of the early in-person voting period for the primary, which begins Tuesday at 10 a.m. and runs through Sunday.
Ciattarelli is one of five men seeking the Republican nod for governor next week. His opponents include longtime New Jersey 101.5 radio host Bill Spadea, who also competed for Trump’s endorsement, and state Sen. Jon Bramnick, a Trump critic. Whoever wins the nomination on June 10 will compete against one of six Democrats in November to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat.
The president said Monday that Ciattarelli has his “complete and total endorsement.” 
“Other people are going around saying I endorsed them. It’s not true,” Trump said. 
Trump’s support for Ciattarelli came even after Ciattarelli in 2015 called Trump a “charlatan.” Appearing on Spadea’s show last year, Trump said Ciattarelli “made some very big mistakes” when Ciattarelli sought unsuccessfully to unseat Murphy in 2021.
Spadea has said he was disappointed in Trump’s endorsement of Ciattarelli, and has even referenced the endorsement in a recent campaign ad, telling Republican voters that “it’s OK for you to disagree with” Trump.
Several polls have shown Ciattarelli with a substantial lead in the GOP primary. A May 15 Emerson College/Pix 11/The Hill poll shows Ciattarelli with 44% support compared to Spadea’s 18%, with roughly a quarter of voters undecided. That poll also shows Trump has a split job approval rating in the state, with 47% approving and 47% disapproving.
Trump on Monday blasted New Jersey as a sanctuary state with “crippling regulations and rampant corruption.” Just 10 days ago, the Trump administration sued four New Jersey cities and their mayors — including two Democratic candidates for governor, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop — over their sanctuary city policies.
Trump also touched on his usual rally talking points, like easing illegal immigration at the southern border, transgender issues, crime, congestion pricing, and ending the “radical left war on suburbs.”
“New Jersey’s economy will wither and die, and you’ll be living in a nightmare of chaos and crime, and you sort of have that to a certain extent now. But it’s going to be changed, and it’s going to be changed fast with Jack,” Trump said. 
Ciattarelli told the president that his first executive order as governor would be ending the Immigrant Trust Directive — that’s the state policy that bars law enforcement from assisting federal agents with civil immigration enforcement — and pledged that his attorney general won’t sue the White House. The state’s current attorney general, Matt Platkin, a Democrat, has led and joined numerous legal complaints against the Trump administration. 
“I’m honored, and I will not let you down, nor will the Republicans across New Jersey,” Ciattarelli said. “They’re going to turn out in record numbers this year because we see what’s going on across the state.”

The state’s lone public university maintains it had no role in the decision to allow the student to join a campus sorority.
The post Trump administration investigates University of Wyoming over transgender sorority sister appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration announced Monday it’s investigating the University of Wyoming for alleged Title IX violations stemming from members of a campus sorority voting to admit a transgender woman in 2022, despite the school’s insistence that it doesn’t have a say in the membership of the private organization.
Critics of the admission of Artemis Langford have, until now, focused their efforts on the sorority itself: Kappa Kappa Gamma. Six of the sorority’s members sued the organization over the decision to admit Langford in 2023, but the case was dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge Alan B. Johnson, who ruled the government cannot interfere with how a private, voluntary organization chooses its members. 
The lawsuit did not name the University of Wyoming as a defendant. That didn’t stop the Trump administration, which has already challenged California and Maine over transgender policies, from pursuing an investigation into the Equality State’s lone, four-year public university.
“[The Office for Civil Rights] launched an investigation into the University of Wyoming after the university allowed a man to join a campus sorority,” the Department of Education announced in a statement Monday, indicating that, at least in the administration’s view, the onus was on the university to police KKG’s membership practices, a stance that at least one attorney who focuses on Title IX issues told WyoFile was legally questionable.
The Department of Education revealed the investigation in an announcement recognizing June as “Title IX Month.” (June is more prominently known as Pride Month, a time of recognition of the LGBTQ+ community.) The department said it would “highlight actions taken to reverse the Biden Administration’s legacy of undermining Title IX and announce additional actions to protect women in line with the true purpose of Title IX.”
The school, for its part, continues to maintain that Langford’s admission is a sorority matter. The University of Wyoming’s “position has been that it doesn’t control decisions about sorority and fraternity membership,” the university said in a prepared statement. “Appropriately, the university has not been a participant in litigation in federal court regarding the legality of the sorority’s decision to admit the transgender student.”
Title IX — a federal law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in educational programs and activities — provides an exemption for the membership practices of social sororities and fraternities, according to attorney Melissa Carleton, who works with colleges and universities across the country on Title IX issues. 
The Department of Education claims that KKG lost its exemption as a sorority by deviating from single-sex membership practices by deciding to admit a transgender woman. 
Because the statute says social sororities “are outside the bounds of Title IX, it’s not clear the [Department of Education] has enforcement authority,” to define who can and cannot be a member, Carleton said.

If UW is found to be in violation of Title IX, its federal funding could be on the line, Carleton said. 
“The Office for Civil Rights’ initiation of an investigation is not itself evidence of a violation of federal civil rights laws and regulations,” UW stated. “The university believes it has been and is in compliance with Title IX but intends to fully cooperate with the investigation and will work with the Office for Civil Rights to come into compliance if needed.”
How we got here
The announcement comes just days before a deadline in an ongoing civil lawsuit against UW’s Kappa Kappa Gamma chapter that began over two years ago. 
In March 2023, six members sued the sorority for allegedly breaking its bylaws, breaching housing contracts and misleading sisters when it admitted Langford, a transgender woman, by a majority vote of its members. 
The plaintiffs include Jaylyn Westenbroek, Hannah Holtmeier, Allison Coghan, Grace Choate, Madeline Ramar and Megan Kosar. 
Reasoning that the government cannot interfere with how a private, voluntary organization determines its members, a U.S. District Court dismissed the case in August 2023. 
The suing sorority sisters appealed the decision, but the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected their arguments and gave the plaintiffs two options: amend their complaint or ask the lower court for a final judgment. 
“More than nine months after the Tenth Circuit issued its decision, they have neither amended their complaint nor notified us of their decision to ‘stand on the original complaint,’ which would allow them to receive a final judgment that could be appealed,” U.S. District Court Judge Alan Johnson wrote, ordering the plaintiffs to fish or cut bait by June 9. 
The plaintiffs had not taken court action as of press time. 
The plaintiffs have, however,  developed a direct connection with the Trump administration since their initial complaint. 
May Mailman, who previously worked as their attorney, joined the White House in January as deputy assistant and senior policy strategist to President Donald Trump. 
During the time that Mailman represented the plaintiffs, she worked as legal director of the Independent Women’s Forum, a DC-based, right-wing policy group that attached itself to the case. Several of the plaintiffs now serve as “ambassadors” for the organization and can be booked for speaking events.
“With the help of Independent Women, the University of Wyoming sorority sisters have been standing up for sisterhood and to keep sororities female ever since. Their advocacy footprint has expanded reaching sorority women nationwide,” the organization said in a press release shortly following the Department of Education’s announcement. 
Langford never lived in the sorority house on campus. In a statement to WyoFile, her attorney said her client did not know what prompted the Trump administration to launch an investigation now. 
“After Ms. Langford’s sisters voted her into the sorority, some filed a Title IX complaint about her admission. Ms. Langford does not know who those sisters were,” her attorney, Rachel Berkness, said in a statement that noted the complaint was eventually dropped. “After Ms. Langford celebrated her graduation from UW last month, she is surprised to learn that the Independent Women’s Forum, a political think tank that has promoted itself through litigation against Ms. Langford, is now advertising a new Title IX investigation.”

One month later the policy became law. (Courtesy of Maine Women's Lobby)The entire Maine Legislature is so far taking the recommendations of the Labor Committee to reject significant changes to the state’s paid family and medical leave program.
On Monday, the Senate voted 20-14 to back a proposal (LD 894) to tweak the program, but rejected other bills by the same margin, including one to exempt agricultural employees from the program and another to suspend remittance for companies that plan to use private plans. That bill now advances to the House of Representatives.
Both chambers also followed the lead of the committee by backing a proposal for a constitutional amendment prohibiting the Legislature from using the program funds for any other purpose. 
Though LD 1221 was passed under the hammer by the House and Senate, it will require a two-thirds vote from each chamber for the next round of enactment votes. If secured, it would then be sent to the voters to ultimately decide on the November 2025 ballot.
LD 894, which was also endorsed by the committee, proposes a series of amendments to the current law to create certain enforcement mechanisms and penalties, as well as clarify intermittent leave. Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) introduced the bill on behalf of the Labor Department to make specific refinements to the policy that were noticed during the rulemaking process. 
“This is a bill that does the quiet, but essential work of ensuring that Maine’s paid family and medical leave program is implemented successfully,” said Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot) on the Senate floor.
Though it isn’t expected to be available until May 2026, the paid family and medical leave program will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one or the birth of a new child.
Tipping said LD 894 is the only bill that “strengthens the program without destabilizing it.”
Sen. Dick Bradstreet (R-Kennebec) urged his colleagues to support a different version of the bill that he argued would help small businesses. While Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln) said while some of those suggestions are reasonable, they seem too substantial to make for a program that hasn’t been fully implemented yet. 
“Making major structural changes at this stage before a single benefit has been paid and without knowing what’s working or not working, it’s like you’re trying to redesign a plane while we’re on the runway,” Reny said. 
Across the State House, lawmakers rejected bills to repeal the program (LD 406), make it voluntary (LD 1273) and make a series of other structural changes (LD 1333 and LD 1712).

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/02/ct-budget-house-vote/,"The House is poised to adopt a budget that scales back increases to health care providers, reforms ‘fiscal guardrails’ and invests in children","This story will be updated.
The state House of Representatives was poised to adopt a $55.8 billion two-year budget Monday evening that invests in child care and K-12 education, provides a $250 tax cut to working poor families and increases hospital taxes in hopes of securing more federal Medicaid grants before Washington caps that program.
The biennial plan, which the Senate is expected to debate Tuesday, increases payments to health care providers who treat the poor but offers a more modest boost than legislative leaders had pledged. Similarly, the budget includes no general increase next fiscal year for nonprofit social service agencies, though it features a $76 million cost-of-living hike in 2026-27. That delayed increase comes with an asterisk, though, since many expect Connecticut’s fiscal picture to change dramatically before then due to shrinking federal aid.
The budget, which would spend $27.2 billion next fiscal year and $28.6 billion in 2026-27, would curb aggressive state spending controls. That means $1.2 billion that would have gone toward reducing pension debt over the coming biennium would be re-directed into the General Fund. 
The plan also relies on borrowing and several accounting maneuvers to ensure the plan stays under the constitutional spending cap by a narrow $19 million — 1/13th of 1% of the General Fund — in the first fiscal year and by $250 million in the second.
“It is a budget that continues to move the state of Connecticut forward, make critical investments where we believe they need to be made, while still working within the fiscal constraints that we have,” House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said during a mid-morning press conference previewing the budget debate.
But House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said the plan crafted by Democratic legislative leaders and Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration subverts the spending cap — which is supposed to keep budget growth in line with household income and inflation — and other controls that have added $4 billion to reserves and reduced $8.6 billion in pension debt since 2017.
“It rises to the level of deception and promotion only second to P.T. Barnum,” Candelora said during his pre-session press conference. “This budget eviscerates all of our ‘fiscal guardrails.’”
‘The single-greatest investment in children that I have ever seen’
But increasing numbers of Democratic legislators and advocates for various programs have argued in recent years that these budget controls excessively weaken education, health care, social services and other core programs.
Those “guardrails” were last fixed in 2017 and designed to end a string of budget deficits and prevent future tax hikes after big increases were ordered in 2015, 2011 and 2009.
But they’ve gone far beyond that, capturing an average of $1.8 billion per year since 2017. Analysts project a $2.4 billion surplus, equal to 10% of the General Fund, for this fiscal year, which ends June 30.
Connecticut entered this fiscal year with more than $35 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, a burden created by more than 70 years of inadequate savings before 2011. And critics say one generation cannot pay off the pension debt created by three.
“It’s important that we all realize that change is inevitable,” said Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, longtime co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee. State officials have used $2.8 billion in emergency federal pandemic grants, which could be spent outside normal budget rules, to support core programs since 2021. But those funds have been exhausted.

And while this dynamic has blocked legislators from bolstering many programs, the new biennial package makes “the single-greatest investment in children that I have ever seen,” Walker said.
That involves taking $200 million from this fiscal year’s surplus and creating a new fund — also outside the traditional budget and spending cap — to fund future increases in early childhood development programs.
The new budget continues ongoing efforts to bolster the Education Cost Sharing program, the chief grant to support K-12 school districts’ operating costs. ECS payments would grow by $90 million next fiscal year. That funding would ensure no district would receive less money than it got this year, even though a legislative formula had called for 81 communities to lose aid in 2025-26.
Legislators from both parties ordered an extra $40 million in special education grants to local districts earlier this winter to mitigate a funding crisis in that program.
The new budget continues that $40 million hike and adds another $30 million for special education in each of the next two fiscal years.
No child tax credit for middle class; poor families get $250 relief
Democratic legislators acknowledged in April that they likely would not approve the full $600-per-child income tax cut many lawmakers endorsed for low- and middle-income households. Analysts estimate that would cost the state more than $300 million per year.
But as recently as two weeks ago, leaders still hoped to provide hundreds of thousands of income-eligible households with income tax relief equal to $150 per child.
That proposal, which would have cost about $80 million per year, also was deemed too expensive this past week, especially given the potential for eroding aid from Washington.
Democratic lawmakers settled on a $250 increase in an existing income tax credit for Connecticut’s working poor — the Earned Income Tax Credit — but only for those filers that have children or other dependents. 
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Saturday the payment likely would be $200 total for eligible households, regardless of how many dependents they would have. But leaders later adjusted that relief to $250, a benefit that will cost the state $35.5 million per year.
Connecticut has about 195,000 households that receive the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program to help the working poor cover basic needs and increase savings. The state credit is worth 41.5% of the federal EITC’s value, meaning it adds an average of $1,061 to a qualifying household’s Connecticut income tax refund, according to nonpartisan analysts. 
Most EITC-eligible households have children and earn between $50,000 and $63,000 per year.
Requests for health care, social services scaled back
The budget also increases the Medicaid rates paid to doctors and other providers who treat Connecticut’s poor. But the plan is much smaller than legislative leaders proposed shortly after the 2025 session began in January.
The budget allocates $15 million to boost rates for most providers next fiscal year. The extra funding would grow to $45 million in 2026-27.
Connecticut hasn’t comprehensively adjusted its provider rates since 2007, a problem that critics say has left many poor adults and children on HUSKY — the state’s Medicaid-funded insurance program — unable to find physicians willing to treat them.
Leaders initially proposed spending an extra $300 million in payments to providers by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year.
The hundreds of community-based nonprofits that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored services to people with developmental disabilities or facing mental health or addiction issues also had to settle for less.
They sought $264 million extra in the new budget. The industry insists it misses out on hundreds of millions annually because state payments haven’t kept pace with inflation for decades.
Legislators didn’t order any general rate hike for nonprofits in 2025-26, but they are slated to get $76 million more in the second year of the plan. 
The biennial package also includes $34 million in the first year and $66 million in the second year for nonprofits that run group homes for residents with developmental disabilities. 
But the funds for those nonprofits must be used to increase caregivers’ wages. 
The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed last month to suspend planned strikes at more than 190 group homes and 51 nursing homes after Lamont pledged to boost funding for caregivers in these two service areas.
Lawmakers also included an extra $30 million in the second year of the new budget specifically to bolster nonprofits serving clients with mental health and addiction issues or providing counseling to formerly incarcerated people reentering society.
“The budget is not everything we requested, but in the context of this year’s discussions about budget restrictions, we are grateful for their choice to support programs that will improve thousands of lives and even save some,” said Gian-Carl Casa, president and CEO of the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance.
Gambling on a hospital provider tax increase
Hospitals were unhappy with the new budget, arguing it makes dangerous assumptions and lacks clear details on what the state would do to the industry.
The plan asks hospitals, starting in 2026-27, to pay an extra $375 million per year in taxes.
That doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing for the industry. Connecticut has an unusual tax on hospitals that currently helps both sides. 
It already involves collecting more than $800 million annually from hospitals and redistributing those funds back to those facilities. This back-and-forth arrangement, which most states employ, helps Connecticut qualify for hundreds of millions of dollars yearly in federal Medicaid reimbursements, which it also shares with hospitals.
Lamont proposed back in February increasing the tax by $140 million per year and redistributing those funds back to facilities, estimating it would increase federal Medicaid payments to Connecticut by $94 million. The state would be the chief beneficiary of this bounty, but hospitals also would come out $10 million ahead under the governor’s proposal.
But what if Congress caps this arrangement or reduces the amount states can receive?
State officials have been bracing for months for big cuts in Medicaid payments from Washington as the Republican-led Congress seeks to slash federal spending to save $880 billion over the next decade.

State Comptroller Sean Scanlon, whom Lamont asked to negotiate details of a provider tax hike with the Connecticut Hospital Association, said Monday that the state’s best option is to try to get more from Washington before the door is shut.
“People in our position in every state capitol in America would be fools not to have a conversation about how we might work with this,” he said.
But under the plan, that tax hike is up to $375 million. Between 2012 and 2018, under then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, the state reneged on what it pledged to return to hospitals, prompting an industry lawsuit. It would be settled when Lamont took office in 2019, but hospital officials remain wary.
Further complicating matters, state officials still hadn’t shared any details by Monday evening with the hospital association showing how much each facility might gain if Connecticut secures extra Medicaid funds or what would happen if the state does not.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said “it is our intention to ensure that hospitals are no worse off than they currently are under this tax. We will be discussing plans further with them over the next year.”
But industry officials wanted hard numbers.
“We have made it very clear that we have not signed off on the tax increase contained in the budget or the comptroller’s plan to reduce payments to hospitals as drafted in the budget bill,” the hospital association wrote in a statement. “The state has provided no other estimates, runs, or numbers related to how hospital Medicaid reimbursement would change.”
Connecticut has budgetary safety nets to protect state and hospital finances if Washington caps the provider tax system.
Besides a record-setting $4.1 billion rainy day fund, Connecticut also has a savings program that’s expected to capture more than $700 million in income and business tax receipts next fiscal year and more than $650 million in 2026-27.
Reforming excessive savings programs or risking fiscal stability?
Republicans noted that Connecticut’s safety net is getting smaller quickly.
The savings program that captures income and business tax receipts had been projected to collect $1.3 billion in 2025-26 and $1.25 billion in the second year of the biennium.
Lamont, who has been reluctant to adjust the state’s budget caps, compromised with his fellow Democrats in the legislature and agreed to scale these back to bolster other programs.
The new budget also includes several maneuvers to circumvent the constitutional spending cap.
For example, majority Democrats and Lamont both planned to underfund contractually required health care benefits for retired state workers by about $230 million over the next two fiscal years. Scanlon said he hopes to mitigate that gap by negotiating savings with insurance providers, but any remaining deficit would be taken from the retiree health care trust — meaning the cost, plus interest, would be covered by future taxpayers.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee, couldn’t hide her frustrations about learning a last-minute adjustment to new budget effectively raids that health care trust by another $7 million.

Rep. Joe Polletta of Watertown, the ranking House Republican on the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, chastised Democrats for not working harder to curb spending, given clear signals from Washington that Congress is asking states to get by with less aid.
“Instead of looking for savings in our budget,” he said, “we’re looking for new revenue. That is not a sustainable way to run a state.”
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, offered an amendment to remove funding that supports health care for undocumented residents and transfer the resources, about $58 million per year, into special education grants for cities and towns.
“It comes down to what you want to be a beacon for,” Fishbein said. “I would like to be a beacon for funding for special education for our children in this state. If you want to be a beacon for illegal alien health care, you know, then you vote down this amendment.”
Rep. Geraldo Reyes, a Waterbury Democrat, urged Fishbein to revise his language and refer to those residents as “undocumented.”
“They are human beings, just like everybody in this chamber,” Reyes said. “They do live here in Connecticut with us. They contribute a great deal to this state, to this economy.”
The House rejected the amendment in a 99-46 vote along party lines.
But Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the finance committee, said Democrats made difficult choices, balancing the needs of residents against the limits of the budget caps and vanishing federal aid.
“We cannot do everything in this budget,” she said. “We are in a moment of constraint.”
Public colleges and universities must tap reserves
One area that legislators constrained involves public colleges and universities, which will be forced to tap their reserves over the next two fiscal years to mitigate program cuts and to avoid fee increases.
The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, which includes community colleges, four regional universities and online Charter Oak State College, would receive $479 million next fiscal year and $485 million in 2026-27, appropriations that mirror the $479 million in traditional state funds the system received this fiscal year.
But Lamont and legislators also propped up CSCU spending this year with $140 million in emergency federal pandemic relief, which won’t be available in the coming biennium.
Still, legislators warned system administrators they likely would face a cut. The Connecticut Mirror reported in late March that the CSCU system entered this fiscal year with $611 million in reserves, an amount that represents more than half of its current operating budget.
The University of Connecticut and its Farmington-based health center had more modest reserves but still entered this fiscal year with $171 million and $297 million, respectively.
The new state budget would reduce overall aid next fiscal year by $58 million for UConn’s main campus in Storrs and its regional campuses and by $55 million for the health center. Their funding would drop in 20260-27 by another $15 million and $4 million, respectively.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0602_SR_Session_013-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 22:02:24.386964

(Screenshot from City of Boulder livestream)The man suspected of attacking a group of demonstrators with incendiary devices in Boulder on Sunday, leaving multiple people hospitalized with severe injuries, faces state and federal charges for attempted murder and a hate crime, law enforcement officials announced.
Officials said the total number of victims in the attack had risen to 12, at least some of whom were participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. They suffered burns from Molotov cocktails and what FBI officials described as a “makeshift flamethrower.”
At least two victims remained hospitalized as of Monday afternoon, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohammed Sabry Soliman, was arrested by Boulder police and later told investigators that he targeted what he called a “Zionist group” after learning about it through an online search, according to an FBI affidavit filed Monday. Officials previously reported that Soliman, a Colorado Springs resident, was heard to shout “Free Palestine” during the attack.
“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the FBI wrote of the suspect’s interview after his arrest. “He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year.”
A criminal complaint filed in federal court charges Soliman with one count of “a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.”
“No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”
At a press conference later Monday, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said his office had charged the suspect with 16 counts of attempted murder in the first degree, two counts of the use of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device. A judge has set a $10 million cash bond on the state charges. Soliman made a brief appearance in Boulder County court on Monday afternoon, and is scheduled to return for a formal filing of charges on Thursday.
“Our office and the U.S. Attorney’s Office will be working closely together and in coordination with one another to ensure that the defendant is held fully accountable,” Dougherty said.
Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said Monday that Soliman was in the U.S. unlawfully, having entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023. An Egyptian national, he filed an asylum claim in September 2022, McLaughlin said.
J. Bishop Grewell, the acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, said additional federal charges could be forthcoming. In a press release Monday, the Department of Justice called the incident an “anti-Semitic terrorist attack.”
“We’ve moved to charge quickly, to send the message to the community that no acts of anti-Semitism are going to be tolerated,” Grewell told reporters. “Just because there’s only one charge that has been made so far doesn’t mean that we’re not considering other charges that could come in the future.”
FBI agents worked through the night to gather evidence at the scene and execute a search warrant at the suspect’s Colorado Springs residence, said Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office. The suspect was not previously known to the FBI’s local Joint Terrorism Task Force, Michalek said.
“While at this time it appears the perpetrator acted alone, we do continue to investigate all possibilities and pursue all investigative leads,” he added.
All evacuations and closures in downtown Boulder had been lifted as of early Monday morning, Redfearn said.
“This morning, I walked down Pearl Street with members of my team. I interacted with a lot of business owners community out there, and the way I felt leaving there was I was heartened,” said Redfearn. “I was heartened by the resilience of our community. … Once again, as a community, we’re going to recover after coming together.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A Milwaukee man was charged Monday after writing a letter to the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that threatened to assassinate President Donald Trump. Demetric Scott told investigators that he wrote the letter claiming to be 54-year Ramón Morales Reyes, a Mexican-born Milwaukee resident who does not have permanent legal status. Scott was already incarcerated in the Milwaukee County Jail for armed robbery and aggravated battery and allegedly victimized Morales Reyes when he committed that crime. 
WISN 12 reported that Scott told investigators that he wrote the letter framing Morales Reyes because he didn’t want Morales Reyes  to testify against him during his trial in July. Scott reportedly told a person during a recorded jailhouse call that if Morales Reyes “gets picked up by ICE, there won’t be a jury trial so they will probably dismiss it that day. That’s my plan.” 
The letter Scott authored was written in perfect English, with only a few misspellings. “We are tired of this president messing with us Mexicans,” it stated, adding, “I will self deport myself back to Mexico but not before I use my 30 yard 6 (sic) to shoot your precious president in the head – I’ll see you at one of his big ralleys (sic).” The letter was likely referring to a 30-6 (pronounced 30 odd six) high caliber rifle round, and appeared to be an assassination threat against the president. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
On Friday, lawyers representing Morales Reyes and local immigration advocates from Voces de la Frontera held a press conference, asserting that Morales Reyes could not have authored the letter. The 54-year-old father, who works as a dishwasher, comes from a rural part of Mexico where he received little formal  education. He does not speak English and cannot read or write proficiently even in Spanish. 
After Morales Reyes was arrested by ICE, his daughter contacted Voces de la Frontera and shared information about his background. Days after the arrest, Department of Homeland (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem issued a press statement, condemning Morales Reyes as having threatened President Trump’s life. Noem said  the letter was part of a  series of  dangerous threats to the president. 
Morales Reyes’ attorneys and Voces de la Frontera called on DHS to retract Noem’s  statement and clear his name. It’s unclear why Noem issued the statement, as CNN reported that MPD was investigating the likelihood that the letter was a fake on the day Morales Reyes was arrested. Scott told investigators that he did not receive any help in writing the letters. 
Democratic U.S. Reps. Gween Moore and Mark Pocan visited the Dodge County jail, Wisconsin’s only ICE detention facility Monday, on a  congressional oversight visit. They were not permitted to talk to anyone incarcerated there and did not receive any response to their questions from ICE.  
“In this facility, ICE is still detaining Ramón Morales Reyes despite being wrongfully accused of a crime,” Moore and Pocan said in a joint statement.  “ICE is also working without transparency to Congress, which was only magnified by today’s visit when we tried to call the local Milwaukee field office number on its website, but the number was disconnected. It is unacceptable for ICE to be inaccessible to Members of Congress. As members of Congress, we will continue using all tools available to conduct oversight.”

They’ve warned it could result in hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage and SNAP benefits.,"State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D-Philadelphia) decried the ""Big, Beautiful Bill""  during a press conference outside Pennsylvania Capitol. (Capital-Star photo by Vincent DiFonzo)Pennsylvania Democrats stood on the Capitol steps in Harrisburg Monday and called on Republicans to oppose cuts to entitlement programs that are working their way through Congress.
“They don’t want to talk about this massive negative impact it’s going to have on the quality of life of so many Pennsylvanians,” Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny), said. “It’s not too late for them to join us, to be part of the discussion that says ‘no.’”
The proposed federal spending cuts are part of what Republicans call their “Big, Beautiful Bill,” a budget reconciliation package that includes much of President Donald Trump’s agenda. The bill has already passed the U.S.House, and can pass the U.S. Senate with a simple majority vote, which Republicans can muster without Democratic support.
The bill would renew Trump’s 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire and increase funding for immigration enforcement. To offset the costs, it includes dramatic spending cuts, especially to entitlement programs. Though the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found it could add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. 
Democrats in Harrisburg say the bill’s spending cuts will have dramatic impacts in Pennsylvania. They’ve warned it could result in hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage, and tens of thousands losing access to food assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The state, they say, does not have the funds to make up for that.
Sen. Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia), the minority chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said there is little room to make up for potential federal cuts with state funding.
“Knowing the state budget the way I know it, we know that we have no capacity to backfill any of those cuts,” he told the Capital-Star. 
According to the left-leaning think tank Pennsylvania Policy Center, the bill includes roughly $600 billion in cuts to Medicaid spending over 10 years, and would institute new work requirements for people covered through the program. They say the result could mean more than half a million Pennsylvanians would lose health care. 
Currently, around 23% of Pennsylvanians, or around 3 million people, are covered by Medicaid, according to the state Department of Human Services.
Rep. Arvind Venkat, (D-Allegheny), who is also an emergency physician,said before the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid, 20% of his patients didn’t have health insurance. 
“They would come into the emergency department too late for me to treat them, and that is a real thing,” he said. The reason some gave him was the fear of medical debt that they’d accumulate because they were uninsured.
He worries that will happen again if more people lose insurance 
“We need to call out the cynicism from our Republican colleagues in Congress. On the one hand they’re saying they don’t want to take coverage from anybody,” Venkat said. “But then they’re happy to brag that they’re going to save $1.7 trillion in decreased federal funding. And the only way that happens is if people lose insurance or stop seeking healthcare when they need it.”
The bill’s Republican defenders say that the cuts are the result of eliminating fraud and waste, and will ultimately reduce spending to help bring a ballooning budget back in line. 
Republican Sen. Dave McCormick did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star, but addressed the bill at a televised debate with Democratic Sen. John Fetterman Monday morning.
He said entitlement spending has been on the rise, and attributed that to an uptick of claims by people for whom benefits were never intended.
“Those are working-age men without dependents, and those are illegal immigrants in a number of cases,” McCormick said. “So what I’m arguing for is that we need to cut out the use of those programs … by people for whom they weren’t designed.”
The reconciliation bill would also cut SNAP spending by nearly $300 billion, according to the Pennsylvania Policy Center, by reducing the federal government’s share of spending. It would also expand work requirements. As it stands, parents raising dependent children under 18 are not required to meet them, but the bill would lower the age of qualifying dependents to 7. People 55 and older are also not required to meet work requirements, but the bill would change that to 65 and up.
Pennsylvania Department of Human Services Secretary Val Arkoosh has warned that 140,000 Pennsylvanians could lose access to the food assistance program with the changes to work requirements. According to the Department’s most recent data, in 2023, around 2 million Pennsylvanians received SNAP benefits every month.
“This bill would be the largest cut ever to food assistance in U.S. history,” Costa said. 
He added that the bill could mean cuts to the Farmers Market Nutrition Program, which pays farmers to provide fresh food for seniors and people who receive Women, Infants and Children (WIC) nutritional assistance programs.
Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D-Philadelphia), the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, called on Republicans to join his party in opposition.
“I think we have an opportunity to stop this, but the problem is it’s only Democrats out here,” he said. 
Spokespeople for Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) and Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star.
As it stands, the U.S. Senate is likely to make changes to the bill before returning it to the House. A number of Senate Republicans have raised concerns over how much the bill could add to the deficit.
Populist Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) raised concerns about cuts to Medicaid, which he called “morally wrong and political suicide.”
Gov. Josh Shapiro also warned of a steep impact if the House version of the bill is passed. He said that it could impact not just patients, but hospitals that rely on Medicaid funds.
“We’ve got 25 rural hospitals that right now are operating on a deficit that likely would have to shutter if these Medicaid cuts go in effect,” Shapiro said at a press conference Monday morning in Harrisburg.
“It is certainly my hope that our federal representatives wouldn’t vote for something that takes something away from Pennsylvania students or Pennsylvania seniors and everybody in between,” he added.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DDA1E9C2-C557-4B90-BEA5-18F677DA993D-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 20:59:44.009172

(Photo by Craig McCaa/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)The Trump administration plans to lift environmental protections on roughly half of the National Petroleum Reserve on Alaska’s North Slope, reopening the area to possible oil and gas drilling.
The new move would reverse actions taken during the Biden administration to restrict development in the 23 million-acre reserve.
The plans, announced Sunday in Utqiagvik and formally on Monday by the U.S. Department of the Interior, open a public comment period, with final action to come later. The plans were announced as three of the Trump administration’s top officials visit Alaska.
U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, are in Alaska this week for a series of events, including a speaking engagement at Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s annual sustainable energy conference, which begins Tuesday in Anchorage.
During a brief question-and-answer session with reporters on Sunday, U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, sat alongside the three cabinet members and called the effort to restrict development in NPR-A the “most egregious effort of the Biden administration,” adding that “one of the top priorities is to get the NPRA back to where it was supposed to be by the intention of Congress, to develop oil and to remove all the regulations that the Biden guys put on NPR-A, and that is a huge priority.”
While large oil companies have expressed little interest to date in drilling within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which lies to the east of the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, there has been interest in drilling within the reserve, which lies to the west. 
Since the first days of the second Trump administration, federal officials have said that they are prioritizing an effort to eliminate obstacles for companies interested in digging or drilling for natural resources in Alaska.
Burgum, Wright and Zeldin traveled to the North Slope after meeting with state officials in Anchorage on Sunday and were scheduled to tour Pump Station No. 1 of the trans-Alaska Pipeline System before returning to Anchorage on Tuesday to participate in the governor’s energy conference.
The two-hour Anchorage event was largely closed to the public, but reporters were able to listen to closing remarks and ask limited questions at the end.
There were no new details about the potential construction of a trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline, and officials did not address the Trump administration’s decision to freeze or rescind grants awarded to renewable energy projects in Alaska.
Burgum, speaking in Anchorage, noted that Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport offers direct flights to 16 countries and talked about the “rise of the Pacific” in terms of global commerce.
“Alaska can play such a huge role in this, but we’ve got to get the federal government out of your way. That’s what the three of us are here to do,” he said.
In response to a question, Burgum said the administration plans to prioritize development of the planned Ambler Road, a 211-mile mining access road through the Brooks Range, and the proposed King Cove Road, an 11-mile road connecting King Cove to the Cold Bay airport, among other projects. 
On Monday, environmental groups responded to the NPR-A decision with scorn and concern. 
Grandmothers Growing Goodness, an environmental group that supports Indigenous communities in the Arctic, said that the repeal of the Biden administration protections would significantly impact Teshekpuk Lake and its surroundings, which are important for the Teshekpuk caribou herd. “The area is also integral to Indigenous subsistence practices, supporting hunting, fishing, and gathering,” they said, in an email statement with the announcement
Protest demonstrations are planned in Anchorage for Monday and Tuesday to oppose the proposed Alaska LNG pipeline project and “other fossil fuel projects promoted by Gov. Dunleavy’s ‘sustainable energy conference,’” according to organizers. 
“It’s hard to overstate the havoc this could wreak on the Western Arctic’s undisturbed habitat for caribou, polars bears and belugas,” said Marlee Goska, Alaska attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Trump’s fixation on plundering Alaska’s ecosystems for short-term gain is matched only by the stupidity of turning this precious place into a fossil fuel extraction site. Alaska’s vast expanses of wild lands are a big part of what makes our state so special, and we’ll do everything possible to protect these places.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/49159199058_5167f11791_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 20:59:44.009172

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The deputy secretary of public health services is leaving the Maryland Department of Health this week after two years serving under the Moore Administration and more than a decade in both private and public health services in Maryland, state officials confirmed Monday.
Tuesday will be Dr. Nilesh Kalyanaraman’s last day with the department.
“We thank Dr. Kalyanaraman for raising his hand to serve the people of Maryland — especially through the COVID pandemic — as a dedicated champion for public health,” according to a spokesperson for Gov. Wes Moore.
His departure is the latest in a string that began in February, when then-Secretary Laura Herrera Scott left amid several controversies at the department, including oversight issues at Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center, a high-security hospital that has been riddled with complaints of patient abuse and violence.
Secretary Meena Seshamani, a former top official with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, took the reins of the department in April.
Just last week, Erin McCullen left her position as the department’s chief of staff, a position she’s held since 2023. McCullen also worked in the department in various positions from 2013 through 2017. Chase Cook also left his job last week as the department’s director of communications, following several years in the position.
Former CMS administrator takes helm of controversy-laden health department

As the deputy secretary of public health services, Kalyanaraman has spoken on a wide variety of health and safety issues throughout the years — from heat illnesses and dental health workforce to bird flu threat levels and more.
Before working with the Moore administration, Kalyanaraman served as the health officer for Anne Arundel County from September 2019 through March 2023, leading the county through the COVID-19 pandemic.
“He was a really, really good resource for the issues that we dealt with during COVID,” said Sen. Pam Beidle (D-Anne Arundel), chair of the Senate Finance Committee. “He was always willing to do a webinar with us and our constituents. I think he did a really good job guiding our county through COVID.”
Before his time in local government, Kalyanaraman served from 2012 to 2019 as the chief health officer for Baltimore-based Health Care for the Homeless, a nonprofit that provides health care and housing support to 10,000 people in the region annually.
He leaves a health department that’s trying to pull itself out of a series of controversies and challenges. During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers grilled Kalyanaraman for answers about one of those controversies — a significant backlog of nursing home annual inspections.
Kalyanaraman argued that the department had been making progress on the backlog of state inspections, but lawmakers remain concerned that some facilities had not received annual inspections for over four years, putting vulnerable senior citizens at risk of inadequate care.
Kalyanaraman declined Monday to comment on his departure.
Neither McCullen nor Cook responded to a request for comment. But McCullen said in a social media post about her departure from the health department that she was “filled with immense gratitude for the privilege of serving alongside such dedicated public servants.”
“The experience has been invaluable, and I am forever thankful for the opportunity to contribute to the health and well-being of Marylanders alongside some of the best people you will ever meet,” she said.

The Senate vote follo[...]","The Connecticut legislature’s omnibus special education bill, which would reform how private providers charge for services and increase oversight of special education programs, is headed for Gov. Ned Lamont’s desk to be signed into law after unanimously passing out of both chambers.
House Bill 5001 passed the Senate 35-0 Monday evening. The Senate vote followed just days after the legislation also unanimously passed the House of Representatives late last week.
The bill’s final passage is the culmination of a legislative session in which leaders of the Education Committee pledged, from the outset, to bolster special education funding and services in the coming biennium. Earlier in the session, lawmakers also passed emergency legislation adding $40 million to the current year’s budget for special education.
“It’s not just oversight. It’s not just accountability. We’re investing in education because this is our priority in our state. Our children are the future we’re investing in,” said Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox, D-Trumbull, who served as a co-chair on the legislature’s Select Committee on Special Education. 
Gadkar-Wilcox added that while “meeting the needs of the students, that’s our primary goal, it [also] has to be sustainable.”
The bipartisan bill called for changes to several aspects of the Connecticut special education system. Among the lawmakers’ priorities was to augment state oversight of districts that outsource special education services to private providers.
“[This bill] puts us on a path of reform in a way that provides better quality and helps us control costs,” said Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk. “We are working to make sure every tax dollar is spent in the best way possible. But at the same time, we’re getting the best results for our students.”
“What I enjoy about the bill that is before us here this evening is it’s really focused, not so much on the funding mechanisms, … but more of the policy points that will, I think, help control costs,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, added Monday evening.
Financial oversight
Once signed into law, the bill will prohibit cost increases from private providers in the upcoming school year and require state agencies to define “reasonable costs” for services, including speech, behavioral and occupational therapies. it will also establish a rate schedule for direct special education services, which would limit how much providers can charge, and create a billing standard for special education transportation costs.
“It’s not to set a minimum. It’s not to set a cap,” Gadkar-Wilcox said Monday. “Step one is to understand what is, in fact, reasonable when you have a complex system of services that are required.”
Rate setting was a controversial proposal earlier this year, with critics of the measure saying it would “destroy” private programs and potentially harm the state’s students with the most severe disabilities.
Gadkar-Wilcox said Monday the rate setting process would not be rushed. She said “the nuances” would be considered so rates wouldn’t be set so low that private providers would be unable to serve high-need students.
“It’s also going to be up to the state department, in consultation with the [Office of Policy and Management], in consultation with those stakeholders to understand the nuance of it as well — the intensity of these services, the quality of these services, when you add on multiple of these services for multiple students with the same provider, how do you factor that in?” Gadkar-Wilcox said. 
The bill also allots an additional $60 million in the next two fiscal years for school districts to expand in-district special education services. The $30 million allocated for 2026 will be added to $221 million already in the budget for special education that year. 
Program standards
The bill will also require the state Department of Education to establish licensure standards for private special education providers, with Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker assigned to supervise the programs.
The state Education Department will also be responsible for conducting site visits of private special education providers, creating a “workload analysis” for teachers and school service providers and providing public data on excess cost projections twice a year, which is expected to help boards of education predict estimated special education costs in their budget seasons.
The data will give lawmakers a “better sense of where we need to invest and what interventions are the most important,” Gadkar-Wilcox said.
Sen. Eric Berthel, R-Watertown, ranking member on the Education Committee, said lawmakers haven’t “given enough coverage” in state reimbursement for special education costs and that “this bill, in my humble opinion, begins to appropriately address these issues,” he said.
The Office of Dyslexia and Reading Disabilities within the Education Department will also be required to report to the state legislature’s Education Committee next year with best practices on evaluations, interventions, student outcomes and teacher preparation measures.
Private special education providers will be responsible for submitting annual enrollment reports to the state, and local boards of education will likewise need to annually report information about their out-of-district placements.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney called the annual reports important for oversight and accountability.
“We know in many cases there’s children, especially poor children whose parents may not be as skilled as advocates or may be working multiple jobs,” Looney said. “We need to know that those children will have someone looking out for them with a system to make sure that their care is appropriate, their placement is appropriate, their evaluation is appropriate.” Looney said the bill provides “greater accountability at all levels.”
Changes to diagnosis age, hearing rules
House Bill 5001 also raises the age by which a child can be diagnosed with a developmental delay from age 5 to age 8.
“In some cases, we don’t know — when a child that comes to school — whether it is a developmental disability or whether it’s perhaps just the product of prior years of neglect, in terms of not being part of a quality preschool or daycare program,” Looney, who favors the change, said.
The bill also makes changes to due process hearings, which seek to resolve disagreements between school district officials and parents regarding a student’s special education services.
Currently, under state law, the district and parents must participate in a pre-hearing — to resolve the issues and narrow the scope — and disclose specified information at least five business days before the specified date. The two parties must disclose their evidence, witnesses and completed evaluations and recommendations prior to the hearing.
The new proposal will now require all claims to be disclosed before the start of the hearing, require hearing officers to consider all the claims and limit hearings to four days.
Looney said the changes would “make sure that children’s rights are protected.”
“A hearing can be a daunting place for a family that does not have legal representation or may not be adept in all of the kinds of legal infighting that goes on in these hearings,” Looney said. “So these are procedural protections.”
The bill also will require local boards of education to provide behavior assessments, and make or update a behavioral intervention plan for students with “challenging behavior” before they’re placed with an out-of-district provider.
Some efforts failed
Earlier this session, other proposals regarding special education passed out of the Education Committee, but were not taken up in the House or Senate. 
Among those proposals were bills that sought to codify 504 plans into state law and another that would have shortened the amount of time a student with a disability could stay in the public school system beyond their senior year of high school.
Lawmakers also considered codifying protections under what’s known as Section 504 for certain students with disabilities. House Bill 7219 came at a time where the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which lays out protections for this group of students, has come under attack.
In September, a group of 17 states sued the federal government, challenging the constitutionality of the federal law. The lawsuit came shortly after then-President Joe Biden finalized a rule to include gender dysphoria under Section 504 of the law in early 2024.
Nearly 48,000 students in Connecticut have 504 plans, according to the state Department of Education. Unlike an Individualized Education Plan, which provides specialized instruction, children with 504 plans do not require special education services. In schools, a 504 plan instead outlines accommodations for a student with disability, including things like preferential seating, assistive technology or extended time on tests.
Despite receiving broad support, the proposal ultimately fizzled. Education Committee Co-chair Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, said lawmakers are “waiting to see what happens with the federal case.”
House Bill 7076, a bill that would shorten the time students spend in transitional special education programs, also passed out of the Education Committee 42-3 earlier this year.
Currently services for students with severe disabilities can last through the end of the school year during which they turn 22. Instead of finishing out that school year, H.B. 7076 proposed ending transition services as of a student’s 22nd birthday.
The bill gained support among superintendents who say these services are costly, but it also had strong opposition at its public hearing from over 100 parents and special education advocates who say the services are crucial for some the states highest need children.
While some provisions in House Bill 7076 were included in omnibus education bill House Bill 7009, the language that proposed the age  change was removed.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0602_SR_Session_008-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 20:02:01.564936

(Photo by Karen Ducey/Getty Images)Kshama Sawant, the socialist who served a decade on the Seattle City Council, launched a “working-class, antiwar, anti-genocide” campaign Monday to unseat incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Adam Smith in the 2026 election.
At her campaign kick-off in Seattle, Sawant called for a $25 an hour minimum wage, universal health care and a halt in U.S. military aid to Israel for its ongoing offensive against Hamas. Sawant did not seek re-election in 2023 as she established Workers Strike Back, an activist group focused on pro-labor causes and other issues.
The Seattle resident vowed, if elected, to “flip the script on how to use elected office” as she did as a city leader from 2014 to 2024. 
“My socialist city council office went to war for working people to defeat the strenuous opposition from both big business and the Democratic Party,” she said in a statement. “Our experience in Seattle shows that we can defeat the rich and their political servants.”
Sawant filed as an independent with the Federal Election Commission.
Smith, who’s served in the U.S. House since 1997, said Sawant’s candidacy will offer voters “a clear contrast.”
“Her record on the Seattle City Council is defined by extreme, divisive tactics and policies that left lasting harm,” he said in a statement.

Sawant hit hard Monday, saying that because the Democrats and Republican parties have backed U.S. support of Israel “to the hilt,” they both are “responsible for what is in reality a new holocaust” in which thousands have died and Gaza has been reduced to rubble.
Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, has “blood on his hands” for fully endorsing the policies, she said.
He, in turn, said Sawant bears responsibility for Republican Donald Trump winning the presidency because she actively campaigned against former Vice President Kamala Harris’ bid for the office, undermining Democratic efforts to defeat Trump.
“I have constantly fought against Donald Trump and the devastating policies he is forcing on the American people,” Smith said.

(Photo by Getty Images)Colton George felt sick. The 9-year-old Indiana boy told his parents his stomach hurt. He kept running to the bathroom and felt too ill to finish a basketball game.
Days later, he lay in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. He had eaten tainted salad, according to a lawsuit against the lettuce grower filed by his parents on April 17 in federal court for the Southern District of Indiana.
The E. coli bacteria that ravaged Colton’s kidneys was a genetic match to the strain that killed one person and sickened nearly 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce.
But most people have never heard about this outbreak, which a Feb. 11 internal FDA memo linked to a single lettuce processor and ranch as the source of the contamination. In what many experts said was a break with common practice, officials never issued public communications after the investigation or identified the grower who produced the lettuce.
From failing to publicize a major outbreak to scaling back safety alert specialists and rules, the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory and cost-cutting push risks unraveling a critical system that helps ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, according to consumer advocates, researchers and former employees at the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The investigation into the illnesses began near the end of the Biden administration but work on the lettuce outbreak wasn’t completed until Feb. 11. At that time, the decision was made by the Trump administration not to release the names of the grower and processor because the FDA said no product remained on the market.
The administration also has withdrawn a proposed regulation to reduce the presence of salmonella in raw poultry, according to an April USDA alert. It was projected to save more than $13 million annually by preventing more than 3,000 illnesses, according to the proposal.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have said that food safety is a priority, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an April 29 interview with the newsletterInside Medicine that the recent job cuts would not affect agency operations.
“The FDA had 9,500 employees in 2007. Last year it was nearly 19,000. Has the 100% increase in employees increased approval times, innovation, AI, food safety, or agency morale?” Makary asked. “No, it hasn’t. In fact, it’s increased regulatory creep.”
The FDA referred questions to HHS, which declined to comment or make Makary available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said “protecting public health and insuring food safety remain top priorities for HHS. FDA inspectors were not impacted [by job cuts] and this critical work will continue.”
Public health advocates warn companies and growers will face less regulatory oversight and fewer consequences for selling tainted food products as a result of recent FDA actions.
The administration is disbanding a Justice Department unit that pursues civil and criminal actions against companies that sell contaminated food and is reassigning its attorneys. Some work will be assumed by other divisions, according to a publicly posted memo from the head of the department’s criminal division and a white paper by the law firm Gibson Dunn.
The Justice Department did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“They need the DOJ to enforce the law,” said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “For an executive investing in food safety, the knowledge they could go to jail if they don’t is a really strong motivator.”
Federal regulators also want states to conduct more inspections, according to two former FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. But some Democratic lawmakers say states lack the resources to take over most food safety inspections.
“Handing that duty to state and local agencies is really troubling,” said Rep. Shontel M. Brown (D-Ohio). “They don’t have the resources, and it creates a potentially unsafe situation that puts families in Ohio and America at risk.”
The high cost of foodborne illnesses
Foodborne illnesses exact a major economic toll in the United States, according to federal data, and cost thousands of lives each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the deaths, chronic illness, medical treatment, and lost productivity from food-related illnesses amounted to $75 billion in 2023.
Each year, about 48 million people in the U.S. get sick with foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its first few months, the administration has suspended a program known as the Food Emergency Response Network Proficiency Testing that ensures food-testing labs accurately identify pathogens that can sicken or kill, according to a former FDA official.
In March, the agency said it would delay from January 2026 to July 2028 compliance with a Biden-era rule that aims to speed up the identification and removal of potentially contaminated food from the market.
However, the FDA is taking aim at foreign food manufacturing, saying in a May 6 notice that it would expand unannounced inspections overseas. “This expanded approach marks a new era in FDA enforcement — stronger, smarter, and unapologetically in support of the public health and safety of Americans,” the notice said.
Some former FDA and USDA officials said that goal isn’t realistic, because U.S. inspectors often need to obtain travel visas that can wind up alerting companies to their arrival.
“It’s really, really difficult to do surprise inspections,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports and a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. “The visa process can alert the local authority.”
HHS declined to address Ronholm’s concerns.
The FDA hasn’t met the mandated targets for inspecting food facilities in the U.S. since fiscal year 2018, and the agency has consistently fallen short of meeting its annual targets for foreign inspections, according to a January report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Foodborne illness can turn serious. Salmonella bacteria in cucumbers sickened dozens of people in April and May and left at least nine people hospitalized, according to the FDA. A 2008-09 salmonella outbreak involving peanut butter killed nine, resulting in criminal charges against company executives. And E. coli in cookie dough sickened more than 70 people in 2009, including a Nevada mother who died of complications from eating the raw dough.
‘Life or death for our son’
E. coli, commonly found in feces, can be especially dangerous to children like Colton, the boy from Avon, Indiana, who ate contaminated lettuce. The bacteria can damage blood vessels and cause clots that destroy the kidneys, leading to strokes and comas. Consumers sickened by E. coli can pass it along to others, and, in some cases, the bacteria end up killing victims who never consumed the contaminated food.
By the time Colton’s mother brought him to the emergency room that November day, the bacteria were releasing toxins and damaging his blood cells and kidneys, according to his father, Chris George.
Colton was sent to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Chris said doctors told him and his wife, Amber George, that their son was in kidney failure and the next 24 to 72 hours would determine whether he would survive, the father recalled.
“They said it was life or death for our son, and I was like, wait, he was just playing basketball,” said Chris, a firefighter. “I told them, ‘You do what you need to do to save my son.’”
Usually, the FDA alerts the public and identifies growers and food manufacturers when there are outbreaks like the one that sickened Colton. The FDA said in its February internal summary that the grower wasn’t named because no product remained on the market.
But Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food-safety litigation and represents the George family, said the information is still important because it can prevent more cases, pressure growers to improve sanitation, and identify repeat offenders.
It also gives victims an explanation for their illnesses and helps them determine whom they might take legal action against, he said.
“Normally we would see the information on their websites,” Marler said, adding that the agency’s investigatory findings on the outbreak were “all redacted” and he obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The FDA, USDA, and CDC play central roles in overseeing food safety, including inspections and investigations. The FDA and CDC have been rocked by job cuts that are part of a reduction of 20,000 staff at HHS, their parent agency. The Agriculture Department has also shrunk its workforce.
Staffing cuts mean delays in publicizing deadly outbreaks, said Susan Mayne, an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health who retired from the FDA in 2023.
“Consumers are being notified with delays about important food safety notifications,” she said, referring to a recent outbreak in cucumbers. “People can die if there are pathogens like listeria, which can have a 30% fatality rate.”
Makary has said the cuts wouldn’t touch inspectors, reviewers, or scientists at the agency.
But the FDA laid off scientists in April who worked at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco, where they performed specialized analysis for food inspectors, former FDA officials said. The FDA later restored some positions.
“No scientists were fired? That was incorrect,” Mayne said.
Siobhan DeLancey, who worked in the agency’s Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine for more than 20 years before she also was laid off in April, said new requirements for reviewing agency announcements became so arduous that it took weeks to get approval for alerts that should have been going out much sooner.
She said some employees who were laid off include communications specialists and web staff who do consumer outreach aimed at preventing illness. The USDA and FDA have been bringing some workers back or are asking some who accepted deferred resignations to take back their decisions.
“It’s all about destruction and not about efficiency,” DeLancey said. “We’re going to see the effects for years. It will cost lives.”
HHS did not respond to an email seeking a response to DeLancey’s comments.
For 13 days, Colton stayed on dialysis at the hospital, initially unable to eat or drink. His mother wet a sponge to moisten his lips and tongue.
He turned 10 in the hospital. Chris George bought paint markers to make signs on the windows of his son’s room.
“I am not happy with the CDC and FDA,” Chris George said. “Victims have a right to know who made them sick. This is my kid. He’s my life.”
Colton was able to leave the hospital almost three weeks after first eating the contaminated lettuce but still has nightmares about the ordeal and is seeing a therapist.
“The whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ the focus on taking food color dyes out of cereal?” said Chris George, who objects to the Trump administration’s decision to redact information about the grower in the February report. “How about we take E. coli out of our lettuce, so it doesn’t kill our kids?”

Lawmakers are projected to end the next two fiscal years, through mid-2027, at a $4.15 million surplus. Lawmakers are facing a projected $129.1 million hole in the following two fiscal years, from mid-2027 through mid-2029, which future lawmakers will need to address.
Just five months ago, lawmakers faced a $432 million projected deficit for the 2025-27 fiscal years, which had grown by the time the budget passed in May.
“There is always more work to do and more opportunity to make Nebraska an even better state in which to live our lives and build our dreams,” Arch said in his closing address. “It was hard work this session, but you proved that you can do the hard work. Next session will be no different.”
Arch told senators to pay attention to fiscal dynamics in Washington, D.C., which could fall back on Nebraska, and to the next state revenue forecast this Oct. 31, on Halloween. 
Multiple state senators have noted congressional talks on Medicaid and SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits could pass costs back on to Nebraska.
Gov. Jim Pillen and Arch agreed that budget adjustments for the 2025-27 fiscal years “will be a priority” in 2026. That agreement came after Pillen unsuccessfully tried to line-item veto multiple items from the state’s budget bills. Lawmakers rejected the vetoes as not having been properly filed with the Legislature, and Pillen ultimately withdrew his vetoes.
As of this time, neither Pillen nor lawmakers have announced plans for a 2025 special session. 
A total of 204 bills passed this session, according to a count by the Legislature. Arch said 113 more bills were amended into those bills that have or will soon become law. Most bills that do not have a set date to take effect will become law Sept. 3, three months after adjournment.
Pillen has committed to not vetoing any of the bills sent to him before Monday. 
Arch said senators requested more than 1,600 amendments and 845 fiscal notes during the session. While 715 bills, 18 constitutional amendments and six more policy-based resolutions were introduced this session, Arch said 374 more proposals were drafted but not introduced.
Any legislation not passed in 2025 will return in 2026, such as slowing down voter-approved annual increases to the state minimum wage, increasing paid family and medical leave for teachers, requiring health care facilities to cremate or dispose of aborted fetal remains or creating second chance relief for certain state offenders.
Arch told his colleagues to consider over the next seven months what they want to bring to the 2026 table, including what issues are most important to constituents and the state generally.
“Think about how we’re going to work together as a diverse group of individuals,” Arch said, “with differing opinions, different life experiences, but with a common goal of building consensus and crafting a policy that even makes this state of Nebraska better and better.”
Lawmakers will reconvene Jan. 7, 2026, and stay for up to 60 legislative days, or around mid-April.

Days before Pennsylvania lawmakers advanced Gov. Josh Shapiro’s plan to expand the commonwealth’s renewable energy resources, the Trump administration ordered a fossil fuel-fired power plant outside Philadelphia to keep running past its planned retirement date.
The U.S. Department of Energy on Friday ordered Pennsylvania’s electricity grid operator PJM Interconnect and owner Constellation Energy to keep the Eddystone Generating Station in Delaware County ready to meet peak power demands. It was scheduled to cease operations Saturday.
The order highlights challenges facing Pennsylvania policymakers as they work to ensure there’s enough electricity for industry and residents while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Legislation that would set a more ambitious goal for renewable energy production in what Shapiro describes as an all-of-the-above approach to meeting demand passed a state House committee on Monday.
House Bill 501 would enact the Pennsylvania Reliability Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS), which is part of Shapiro’s broader energy policy dubbed the Lightning Plan. It would require 35% of the state’s energy to come from clean sources including solar, wind, nuclear and other emerging technologies by 2040.
Other aspects of the plan would provide tax credits for renewable energy development and establish a dedicated board to streamline energy permitting to incentivize developers to prioritize clean energy.
While President Donald Trump has backed the oil, gas and coal industries since he campaigned for his first term in 2016, the DOE order to keep the Eddystone Generating Station online cited an “emergency situation” as PJM warned that electricity demand in the 13 states it serves could soon outpace the opening of new power plants.
PJM projects its peak demand will grow by about 70,000 megawatts to 220,000 megawatts by 2040. The growth is being driven by the increased electrification of transportation and industry and the proliferation of data centers to satisfy the demand for computing power from artificial intelligence and other technologies. 
PJM’s process to authorize new power plants to connect to the grid faces a backlog including hundreds of gigawatts of renewable energy while about 20% of its existing generating capacity is expected to retire in the next five years.
Starting this month, consumers in Pennsylvania and the rest of PJM’s footprint will see electric bills increase by 10% to 20% as a result of soaring prices in last July’s capacity auction, in which electricity generators bid to provide generating capacity.
Pennsylvania, meanwhile, lags behind most of the nation in renewable energy development. An analysis of federal energy data by PennEnvironment put the commonwealth behind all but Washington and Alaska, which tied for last place. 
Debate on the renewable energy legislation Monday in the House Environmental and Natural Resources Committee demonstrated the tension between Pennsylvania’s energy future and its past.
Republicans argued the goal of obtaining 35% of the state’s energy from clean sources by 2035 is unrealistic. Natural gas and coal provide reliable electricity while helping to drive Pennsylvania’s economy, they said.
Rep. Tim Twardzik (R-Schuylkill) said renewable energy sources including solar and wind power would take up too much land. And subsidizing them at the expense of established fossil fuel sources would hurt workers and consumers by taking away jobs and increasing prices. 
“It’s just going to waste money and not solve our problems,” Twardzik said.
Democrats said diversifying the state’s energy portfolio is essential to staving off an energy crisis. 
“We are at a crossroads,” Rep. Chris Pielli (D-Chester) said. “I think that we should be looking at many forms of energy, nuclear, geothermal, and even using our gas and our oil.”
Pielli rebutted claims by Republicans that the renewable energy legislation would create winners and losers. He argued Pennsylvania’s gas industry benefitted from a subsidy when lawmakers chose not to impose an excise tax on gas production, forgoing billions in revenue.
Deeply conservative Texas, Pielli noted, leads the nation in both natural gas production, wind and solar energy.
“Let’s look at that … recognizing that this bill is an opportunity that we can fine tune, where we can use any and all of these resources to protect our consumers going forward when it comes to our power,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wind-farm-1536x1026-1-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 20:02:01.564936

(Screenshot of Charleston County Sheriff's Office livestream)Two alleged cartel members and one person wanted by Interpol for murder in Honduras were among at least 80 people arrested during a weekend sting operation at an unlicensed nightclub in Charleston County.
Federal, state and local law enforcement raided the Alamo nightclub, located in an industrial area outside the town of Summerville, around 3 a.m. Sunday. The club had no license to operate or to sell alcohol.
About 200 people were there at the time of the raid. The investigation, dubbed “Operation Last Stand,” continues, Charleston County Sheriff Carl Ritchie said during a news conference Monday.
They included 10 juveniles as young as 13 — including one reported as missing — as well as potential human trafficking victims. They were turned over to social service agencies. Officers also seized guns, cocaine and cash, Ritchie said, without giving details on the amounts.
Those arrested included two people believed to be “high-level cartel members” associated with the Mexico-based Los Zetas cartel and the Venezuela-based Tren de Aragua gang, said U.S. Department of Homeland Security agent Cardell Morant.
He referred to the club scene as a “cartel afterparty.” More than 80% of those arrested are living in the United States illegally, he said.
The law enforcement agencies went in with 116 warrants for 80 people.
Five people were arrested for criminal offenses, Morant said.
Law enforcement officials did not provide names of those arrested or a list of charges.
“Some of these individuals have been charged with serious offenses,” which include the person wanted internationally for murder, Morant said. Other charges made in the raid include “assault on a police officer, resisting arrest, possession of a controlled substance and a felon in possession of a firearm,” he said.
The investigation began in November with officers looking into noise complaints and reports of assaults occurring in the parking lot, Ritchie said.
“Bad guys like to celebrate too. So, this was their way to let off some steam, and they were, unfortunately, doing it right here in the community,” Morant said.
“This operation was not only about immigration enforcement. It was also about restoring order, removing threats from our streets and ensuring the safety and well-being of Charleston-area residents,” he added.
About a dozen local, state and federal agencies participated in the raid.
“We will continue to work to bring justice to those that have been victimized and also bring those to justice that have violated our laws,” said State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-02-at-6.19.27 PM-1024x631.png,,,2025-06-02 20:02:01.564936

(NPS/Jacob W. Frank)A record number of out-of-state visitors spent roughly $5 billion while traveling to Montana in 2024, money that drives one of the state’s strongest economic sectors through tourism-oriented businesses.
That’s according to the latest report on nonresident visitation to Montana conducted by the University of Montana’s Institute for Tourism and Recreation Research (ITRR), released last month. The quarterly nonresident research has been ongoing since 2009 and involved 11 surveyors conducting nearly 22,000 surveys at airports, rest areas and gas stations across the state in 2024. 
In 2024, roughly 13.8 million visitors — a record number by a million — spent around 10% less during their travels through the state compared to 2023, showing a lower impact to the state’s economy than in recent years, but still representing a substantial jump from pre-pandemic trends. 
The $5.0 billion out-of-state travelers spent in Montana directly supported $3.9 billion in local economic activity in the state through purchases of gasoline, groceries and retail, and use of services such as lodging, outfitters and guides and costs of license and entrance fees. 
Visitor spending directly supported an estimated 38,240 jobs, according to ITRR data, comprising roughly 1-in-15 Montana workers, but lower than an estimated 48,340 the year before. Visitors also generated more than $308 million in state and local taxes, and reduced the average tax burden on Montana households by $680, down from last year, but in line with 2022 figures.

The visitation figures track with recent data released by the National Park Service showing that both Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park saw the second highest number of visitors on record in 2024. The two parks are listed as top attractions by visitors, serve as anchors for the state’s outdoor economy, and are crucial to their respective regions’ local communities.  
Results from the ITRR continue to track with data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis that show Montana’s outdoor recreation sector makes up 4.6% of the state’s economy, the third highest contribution of any state. 
According to ITRR, nonresident tourism had a more than $6.1 billion contribution to the state’s economy, combining direct spending from tourists, indirect impacts from travel-related business purchases and “induced impacts” from employees in adjacent industries. 
Here are some highlights from the 2024 visitor spending data.

Jim Pillen, center, greets State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil on the final day of the 2025 legislative session. June 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN —  Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, in his end of session speech to state lawmakers, called the state budget “historically conservative.”
Pillen portrayed the session as “positive,” highlighting the passage of some of his priorities this session, including limiting high school and college sports participation to sex at birth, banning lab-grown meat, prohibiting cell phones in schools and a merger of the state’s agencies in charge of overseeing water quality and quantity. He also praised a budget with a two-year average general fund spending growth of 1% a year. 
“I believe we are setting the Cornhusker State up for success, and when we commit to strong fiscal conservatism and reduce the tax burden for Nebraska families, the potential of this place for generations to come is beyond our understanding,” Pillen said.
Pillen said he and state lawmakers worked together to pass a “budget package that said no when we needed to say no” and put the state’s “idle pillowcase money to work.” 
Nebraska lawmakers balanced the budget mostly by using the state “rainy day” cash reserve fund and a series of cash transfers and spending cuts to fill budget holes. Democratic lawmakers have compared the budget to “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” a fairy tale where the ruler is naked but his subjects pretend he has extravagant clothing. Pillen tried and then withdrew his intended $14.5 million in general fund line-item vetoes to the budget.
Property tax relief, a top Pillen priority, was dealt a blow when the Legislature’s last shot at meeting his pledge to keep property taxes flat this year fell short last month, Nebraska’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that would have shifted sales taxes toward property tax relief. 
That bill became the third property tax package in the past year to propose and lack support for broadening the sales tax base to lower property taxes. Pillen’s push for “Winner-Take-All” failed, as grabbing too few votes to overcome a filibuster. 
The governor, whose family owns a major hog operation based in Columbus, alluded to addressing property taxes in future sessions. 
“We can decrease spending and actually fix our tax system — and we have to fix it because it is badly broken,” he said. 
Pillen achieved some of his culture war-related goal issues, including the school sports law, a law against foreign agents, age verification for future social media accounts and the ban on lab-grown meat. 
Pillen didn’t directly address some of the session’s controversies, among them several heated debates as the GOP-majority Legislature pushed back against a handful of ballot measures passed by Nebraska voters, including new laws requiring paid sick leave, raising the minimum wage, repealing school vouchers, and legalizing medical marijuana. 
He said he would continue to work with lawmakers to serve the people of Nebraska — and this time made no mention of a possible special session.
“I’m really proud to have partnered with you all on many of these initiatives,” Pillen said, “So good news in just seven or so months, we all get to do it over again.”

House Bill 279 by Rep. Delisha Boyd, D-New Orleans, originally would have required all college students to take a one credit-hour anti-hazing course.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of the Kansas Legislature You Tube channel)TOPEKA — Filing reports of suspected child abuse or neglect is the most difficult part of Marcus Stratton’s job as a school counselor at a Kansas middle school.
Stratton is a mandatory reporter, the title given to educators, health care workers, social workers and members of law enforcement who are required by law to report any suspicion of neglect or abuse. Teachers and school staff are the most frequent reporters of child neglect and abuse in Kansas, but minimal feedback, communication and transparency from the state foster care agency have left more questions than answers.
Testifying before the Joint Committee on Child Welfare System Oversight, Stratton asked lawmakers Monday for more training for mandatory reporters and greater clarity on how the process of investigating allegations of abuse or neglect works within the state’s foster care agency, the Kansas Department for Children and Families.
“When I get to a point where I have to make a mandatory report for a child, I can no longer meet the needs of the child in a public school setting,” Stratton told lawmakers.
Teachers are taught not to investigate when they suspect potential abuse or neglect. Once a report is made, Stratton said he rarely knows the outcome. He only knows whether or not it has been assigned for investigation.
“Once we make the report, we may be meeting our legal obligations to do that, but we still have the relationship with the student that we have to maintain,” he said.
Stratton is a counselor at Pauline South Intermediate School in Wakarusa, and he was not speaking as an official representative of the school. With concern for the wellbeing of students, he regularly questions how to navigate the opaque mandatory reporting process. He said the process can only be as good as those who are making the reports and those who are receiving them. 
Of the 71,000 reports of potential abuse, neglect or a family in need of assessment to the Kansas Protection Report Center in 2024, about half are assigned to an investigator, according to DCF data. Almost 30% of reports come from educators.
In his nine years as a counselor, Stratton has never been called to court to testify in a child’s case after filing a report. His experience with the Kansas Department for Children and Families has been good about 90% of the time, he said.
“In the years that I’ve been making mandated reports, I haven’t come up with a magic formula,” Stratton said. “There’s so many different types of situations, so many different types of people. There’s just no way that I think you can perfectly legislate something like this.”
The more information, the better, he said. He suggested training for mandatory reporters to understand how DCF’s process of investigation works and what qualifications and training an investigator might have.
Eudora Republican Sen. Beverly Gossage, a former teacher and chair of the committee, said Stratton’s concerns resonated with her. She relayed her experience with an old student who came to her sixth-grade class with a “belt mark” across his face. He always had a story, Gossage said.
After the second time, she filed a report.
“It does put you in an awkward position,” she said.
The process can be a gray area for mandatory reporters, who may not know the consequences of filing a report and whether their anonymity will be maintained.
It can be difficult to be specific when filing reports, said Monique Young, a Missouri educator who has also worked in Kansas. In Missouri, counselors, teachers and administrators participate in required training to recognize when a student needs help, but it can be a tough balance, Young said, when no central system exists within schools to ensure the best outcomes for both reporters and students.
Often, information regarding investigations is confidential, said Tanya Keys, the deputy secretary of DCF. But she took Stratton’s suggestions in stride, indicating there might be opportunities for educators to gain insight into the mandatory reporting system. 
Before Stratton left the committee room Monday, Gossage gave Keys and Stratton homework. She requested they meet again outside of the committee setting to discuss Stratton’s concerns and find solutions that can apply to all mandatory reporters.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-02-at-4.34.48 PM-1024x557.png,,,2025-06-02 19:06:00.364371

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner).LINCOLN — Two Nebraska bills most vulnerable to a governor’s veto in the waning hours of the 2025 Nebraska Legislature are about to become law without his objection.
The pair — separate priority bills from Omaha State Sens. Megan Hunt and Terrell McKinney — were among a late wave of 26 bills approved by the full Legislature and awaiting action by Gov. Jim Pillen as lawmakers adjourned for the year. Both the Hunt and McKinney bills cleared final votes Friday by less than the number needed to override a veto.
Pillen, in a letter early Monday to the Clerk of the Legislature, said all the bills on his desk “will become law without my objections in the coming days.” Included in the 26 bills Pillen is expected to approve were three sent to his desk Monday.
  Gov. Jim Pillen talks with reporters after his annual State of the State speech to the Nebraska Legislature. Jan. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
That negated any need for veto override attempts on the Legislature’s final day.
Hunt said she was “surprised,” and excited to see her Legislative Bill 275 cross the finish line.
The bill reforms the use of Social Security benefits received by eligible Nebraska foster children, in part strengthening communication between the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and the youth’s representative. Hunt described recipients as among the state’s most vulnerable, because the benefits are related to the death of a parent or guardian or a physical or mental disability.
DHHS currently intercepts the Social Security benefits bound for those kids and uses the funds to offset the state costs of the youths’ care. LB 275 requires DHHS to set aside at least 20% of all Social Security benefits in a separate trust fund, beginning when the foster youth is 14, with the percentage increasing gradually to 50% at age 18. Meant to ease transition to adult independence, it brings Nebraska “in line with federal law to provide further accountability, transparency and conservation of a portion of the funds in a trust account for the youth’s own use when they exit state care.” 
Hunt said she thought LB 275, which advanced to Pillen’s desk on a 29-19 vote, might be in jeopardy partly because of a roughly $1 million in annual notification and operational costs estimated in a fiscal note and also because of a pattern of Pillen’s vetos, which she said have been “less about policy and more about the introducer.”
McKinney said Monday that he was unsure what Pillen might do on LB 48, his bill aimed at helping to keep youths out of the criminal justice system. He said he was happy to see it unobstructed by a veto, and proud of the accomplishment.
  State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha. July 21, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“It’s good legislation that’s going to help a lot of families and juveniles, keeping them out of the system,” he said.
LB 48 calls for an around-the-clock Family Resource and Juvenile Assessment Center pilot program in Omaha. The goal is two sites that will address family dynamics, mental health, substance abuse and educational challenges to juvenile delinquency. 
The bill faced resistance and near demise during earlier legislative debate. It passed final reading on a 27-21 vote.
Of 26 bills awaiting Pillen’s signature Monday, two others passed final legislative debate with 33 votes; four passed with vote tallies in the mid to upper 30s, and the rest secured 40 or more votes.
Said Hunt: “I’m excited now to breathe a sigh of relief and move on to the next issue.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)After securing a big win at the federal level Monday, Rhode Island’s gun safety advocates are hoping the momentum continues  at the State House Tuesday when a House panel will consider an amended bill to ban assault-style firearms.
The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge by gun rights advocates against the state’s 2022 law banning firearm magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement he’s grateful the court did not overturn the ban.
“As the Rhode Island General Assembly prepares to vote on the assault weapons ban, it is my hope that this office’s successful defense of the large-capacity magazine ban inspires our leadership to act, and act boldly,” Neronha said. “One life lost to gun violence is one too many.”
The 15-member House Committee on Judiciary meets Tuesday at 3 p.m. to consider advancing amended legislation sponsored by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, to the floor for a full vote by the chamber.
Knight’s bill has support from 38 of the House’s 75 members. Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has previously indicated support for a ban on assault-style weapons. 
The proposal includes revisions based on feedback from a March 26 Judiciary Committee hearing where hundreds of Second Amendment advocates in yellow T-shirts outnumbered gun safety advocates.
Under Knight’s bill, assault weapons are defined as semiautomatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns equipped with accessories such as pistol grips, folding stocks, or threaded barrels. The amended version removed bayonet mounts and certain .22 caliber rimfire rifles and Olympic-style target pistols from the definition.
The amended legislation now takes effect July 1, 2026, rather than Jan. 1, 2026. Knight said the new date was picked in order to give store owners more time to prepare for the change, and for state and local police to develop a voluntary firearm certification program for assault-style weapons acquired ahead of the ban.
Knight’s original legislation proposed that grandfathered weapons be registered with state or local police. Weapons acquired ahead of the ban would continue to be exempt from the legislation, but the amended bill also exempts firearms passed down through a family.
The amended bill now exempts retired law enforcement officers. That’s in addition to active police and members of the armed forces who would be allowed  to keep assault-style weapons under the original bill.
“We got rid of one or two things upon reflection we probably did not need,” Knight said in an interview Monday. 
“The vast majority of Rhode Islanders want this policy change,” he added, acknowledging two recent polls that found widespread support for banning assault weapons.
A University of New Hampshire poll released May 29 found that 55% of the 653 residents surveyed were in favor of banning the sale and manufacture of firearms with “military-style features.” A February poll conducted for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO found 64% of Rhode Islanders support the ban.
‘It’s our responsibility’
Knight has backed legislation to ban assault-style weapons since 2018 — the same year then-Gov. Gina Raimondo established a gun-safety working group after a gunman killed 17 students in Parkland Florida with an AR-15.
“You see random acts of violence that involve multiple victims stepping up,” Knight said. “It’s our responsibility as a legislature to provide public order and safety.” 
What’s not changing in the amended bill: Violators of the proposed ban would face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and forfeiture of their assault-style weapon. 
“It’s a good bill,” Melissa Carden, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence, said in an interview. “This is really momentous. This is the reason that the coalition was formed, it’s been our priority for a really long time.”
But Knight’s changers are still not enough to appease gun rights advocates, who remain opposed to the proposed ban. 
“Their concern is passing a bill for the win, and not reducing gun violence,” Glenn Valentine, president of the Rhode Island Second Amendment PAC, said in a text message Monday.
The Gaspee Project, a nonprofit that touts its opposition to progressive and “special interest” policies on its website, took to social media Friday evening to urge gun owners to keep opposing Knight’s legislation.
“This amended version is just as awful as the original,” the group wrote on X.
Companion legislation is filed in the Senate by Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, where the bill has 23 additional sponsors — including Senate President Valarie Lawson. DiPalma’s bill was heard by the Senate Committee on Judiciary on May 14 where it was held for further study
The bill has not been scheduled for the committee’s consideration as of Monday.

(Screenshot/SEIU 1199NE  video) Two days after their work-sponsored health insurance expired, striking Butler Hospital workers marched two-and-a-half miles from the Providence psychiatric hospital to the headquarters of its parent company, Care New England.  
The demonstration marked week three of the strike, which began on May 15 and has seen approximately 800 unionized members SEIU 1199 New England cease work to protest what they call unfair labor practices, including subpar wages and inadequate safeguards around workplace violence.
“We remain ready and willing to settle a fair contract and return to the patients who need us,” Niki Anthony, a registered nurse and member of the union’s bargaining committee, said in a statement Monday, adding that the workers marched on the headquarters to make the entire management team “stop the delays and end the bad faith bargaining.”
Striking Butler Hospital workers take labor dispute to Rhode Island State House

According to a statement from Butler President and COO Mary Marran, negotiations will resume on Wednesday, June 4.
“Butler believes productive dialogue on meaningful issues is the best way to reach an agreement,” Marran wrote. “We are returning to the table with a steadfast commitment to constructive dialogue and the goal of reaching a fair and sustainable agreement.”  
Marran also briefly described the tensions from last week’s attempts at negotiations, in which both parties sat down with agents of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to hash it out. Wednesday and Thursday saw negotiating sessions take place over 11 hours, with no conclusion agreed upon even with the feds’ help. 
“On the evening of May 29, 2025, after conferring with the parties, FMCS mediators recommended concluding the bargaining session in order to allow the parties the opportunity to consider modifications to their positions,” Marran wrote.
But union members alleged the new set of contract proposals they offered that Thursday were strategically declined by the hospital.
“It’s crystal clear management is using our access to healthcare as a weapon to break our resolve,” said Dan Camp, who works in behavioral health call intake, in a statement Friday. 
Since then, workers’ health insurance has been officially terminated by the hospital. A May 19 letter from Butler management first informed union members they could lose medical, dental, and vision coverage on May 31 if they remained on strike. Other benefits — including disability, life, and accident insurance — had already lapsed on May 14.
Hundreds of striking workers have since enrolled for new health coverage via HealthSource RI, the state’s insurance marketplace. According to SEIU 1199 New England, the union organized a crisis team to assist workers with one-on-one enrollment support ahead of the May 31 deadline.
After negotiations stalled last week, Gov. Dan McKee issued a statement on the strike Friday, and penned a letter to the leaders of both sides.
“As I said before this strike began, my priority as Governor is the health and well-being of all Rhode Islanders — I know you share that commitment,” McKee wrote in his letter to Marran and SEIU 1199 Executive Vice President Jesse Martin.
“That is why I strongly urge both hospital leadership and the union to immediately return to the bargaining table to reach a fair and timely agreement,” McKee’s letter continued. “I know that you both take your responsibilities seriously and want what is in the best interest of the people you serve.”

A new law would get the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources more actively involved in regulating Vermont farms to meet federal water quality requirements, but critics say it doesn’t go far enough.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont is violating the federal Clean Water Act. Will a new state legal framework for regulating farm runoff help?.","Rep. David Durfee, D-Shaftsbury, chair of the House Agriculture Committee, explains details of a farming regulations bill to the House Democrat caucus at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Tuesday, May 27. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIn December 2019, state agriculture investigators observed manure from Iraburg’s Nelson Farms, a dairy in the Northeast Kingdom, running into a local waterway. The staff from Vermont’s Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets were required under a 2017 interagency agreement to report the runoff to Vermont’s Agency of Natural Resources immediately. But they failed to do so until four months later, according to a petition filed to federal officials by environmental advocates. This misstep wasn’t uncommon. A month earlier, the agricultural agency had inspected the McKnight Farm in East Montpelier and found agricultural wastes flowing through a barnyard and entering surface water, but didn’t refer the matter for over a month.The mistakes are part of a broader problem in Vermont, state environmental advocates say, in which a conflict between the agencies that govern natural resources and agriculture has thwarted a regulatory system that’s required under the federal Clean Water Act. Since January, they have urged the Legislature to step in. “I feel strongly that this is not a choice,” Elena Mihaly, vice president for the Vermont chapter of the Conservation Law Foundation, said in a legislative committee hearing on May 15. “We’ve gone too long trusting that this system is working and it is not.”Last summer, the federal Environmental Protection Agency agreed that the state has been violating the law.The only way to come into compliance, the EPA told the Agency of Natural Resources, would be to put the state environmental agency in charge of inspecting farms and issuing permits related to water quality — dramatically shrinking the agriculture agency’s role. This legislative session, a debate about how to fix the system has been playing out in Montpelier. A bill, S.124, which cleared the Vermont Legislature on Friday and is headed to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk would give the Agency of Natural Resources a greater role. If the bill becomes law, the agency will be authorized to hire three new staff members who would lead some farm investigations. The agency would also be tasked with undertaking a new permitting program to align with federal law and with forming a stakeholder group to work on water quality regulations that includes environmentalists and farmers. The leadership of both of the state agencies have backed the bill.But critics say this solution may not move the needle. Beyond these changes, the bill looks much like the ghost of regulations past: by maintaining a familiar split between agencies, it could also amount to maintaining the status quo. “We’re in the middle of a long-term process to build a better regulatory program,” said Scott Sanderson, director of Conservation Law Foundation’s farm and food initiative, in a statement. “This bill takes important first steps and creates a needed stakeholder process, but it doesn’t confront what EPA identified as a root cause of Vermont’s broken system: the division of jurisdiction over agricultural water pollution between the Agency of Natural Resources and the Agency of Agriculture.” READ MORE
‘Zero is unique’Under federal law, farms are allowed to  send runoff into local waterways only if the farm is monitored under a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation, or CAFO, permit. Vermont has more than 140 medium and large animal operations that could be CAFOs, defined as where animals have been stabled or confined for at least 45 days, which includes most  dairy farms. Another 1,000 small farms are potential CAFOs and need to be monitored for unpermitted waste discharge, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency.For more than half a century, the Environmental Protection Agency has delegated the authority for ensuring that farms, waste systems and waterways comply with the federal Clean Water Act to the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources. In a small state, Vermont’s authority to administer the 1974 federal law meant it could staff its state agencies with experts more capable of managing rural places than federal officials traveling in from outside regions, according to Julie Moore, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources.The Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets oversees state monitoring of water quality on farms. The CAFO program is the natural resource agency’s vehicle for that federal regulation, but the state has never issued a single CAFO permit.This fact, and the corroborating examples, became the foundation of a 2022 petition filed by the Conservation Law Foundation, along with the Vermont Natural Resources Council and Lake Champlain Committee, that claimed Vermont was polluting its waterways in violation of the Clean Water Act. The Environmental Protection Agency studied the state for the following two years, launching its own investigation into Vermont farms and the two agencies in charge of monitoring them. In the EPA’s 2024 response to the petition, they wrote that the failure to implement this law was caused by “the division of Vermont’s agricultural water quality program between ANR and AAFM, which has resulted in ANR’s nonperformance of delegated duties,” along with insufficient resources given to ANR to administer the federal program. If the agency didn’t make significant changes, the state’s authority to implement the Clean Water Act would be revoked and the federal government would take over, according to the EPA’s 2024 letter in response to the petition.EPA staff conducted 10 on-farm investigations and found several farms “had evidence of ongoing or recent discharges that appear unaddressed.” EPA staff also looked at 113 complaints about discharge received by either agency between February 2021 and January 2023. Many complaints described discharges to surface waters, but almost a quarter of these complaints were unresolved, and about 45% were concluded without a violation notice from ANR, according to the EPA. Only 7% were noted as Clean Water Act violations, and even then, the farm was allowed to correct the violation without a penalty or CAFO permit requirement.“Us issuing zero is unique,” said Moore of the lack of CAFO permits in the state. But even with a better system, still only a small subset of farms would likely be required to obtain a CAFO permit. In neighboring states like New York, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, a vast majority of farms are not regulated as CAFOs, Moore said.While the agriculture agency has no authority to enforce the law, it has nine staff at least partially responsible for investigating farms for pollution to surface water, known as discharges, while the natural resources agency only has two. Because of their limited staffing capacity, ANR has long relied on agriculture officials to report discharges back to them.“If we’re going to have a robust CAFO program, we don’t have enough capacity currently,” Moore said. By the end of 2026, ANR will have to report back to EPA on what they think they’ll require in staffing, according to their corrective action plan. While the EPA gave four options to remedy the problem, the federal agency said the only viable option that would allow the state to stay in charge of enforcement was “consolidated agricultural regulatory authority with ANR,” meaning ANR should be the lead agency monitoring water quality on farms.The Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets declined an interview request for Secretary Anson Tebbetts and instead sent a comment over email.“The Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets is working closely with the Agency of Natural Resources to address the issues raised by the EPA,” wrote Scott Waterman, director of communications for AAFM. “We are proud of the work of our Vermont farmers who are doing the hard work to improve our environment. That work will continue today and well into the future.”Julie Moore, Vermont’s secretary of the agency of natural resources, speaks during a roundtable hosted by U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held to discuss the role of agriculture in addressing climate change and water quality at the ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake Champlain in Burlington on Aug. 19, 2021. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerSource of pollution mattersThe split between the two agencies goes back to the split between how Vermont monitors water quality, distinguishing between two kinds of sources of pollution: nonpoint and point sources. Nonpoint pollution is diffuse, like runoff from rain or snow flowing over land, while point source pollution comes from a singular and identifiable source, like a pipe or ditch. For decades, Vermont has regulated farms with this separation in source pollution. Nonpoint sources are regulated by the state’s agricultural agency, while point sources are meant to be regulated by ANR.CAFOs are considered point sources due to the amount of waste they produce and how that waste is stored, in lagoons or spread as fertilizer over farm fields. When manure or waste is discharged into a waterway, the CAFO needs a permit. In the last five years, the state Agency of Agriculture has reported 170 potential discharges to ANR, according to the agriculture agency’s attorney, Steve Collier. But neither agency knows how many of those were investigated, nor how many showed evidence of an actual discharge, according to attorneys for both agencies who testified in front of the House Environment Committee in May.Farmers have long worked with the agricultural agency and have developed trust that its officials are working to protect their interests as agriculture faces increasing challenges from global economic rifts and climate change. They’re not as used to working with ANR, largely because Vermont’s CAFO program is underfunded and understaffed, meaning farmers have interacted less frequently with ANR than they might have under a more robust program, according to Moore.“I anticipate there are some farms that would require CAFO permits,” Moore said. “But part of our challenge as we sit here today is that we don’t know what we don’t know as far as the number of farms.”Because no permits have been issued before, implementing such a system has struck a nerve in the farming community.“It doesn’t exist, but people worry about the worst version of it,” Moore said. “Most Vermonters prefer not to be regulated.”Collier told lawmakers in May that it wasn’t a victory for the state to issue a CAFO permit. “It’s a victory to have farms not discharging,” Collier said.But as the 2022 petition and the EPA response showed, farms are discharging, and a CAFO permit is meant to predate a discharge. Without the permit, that discharge is illegal under the Clean Water Act. Therefore a CAFO permit could be a protective measure for farmers, but only if they’re issued.“We all agree that (the agency of) agriculture’s program is pushing farms to achieve a no discharge standard, so the question is what happens when they don’t, and if they need time to come into compliance,” Moore said.Caroline Sherman-Gordon, the legislative director for Rural Vermont, a group that advocates for small farmers, said farmers would adhere to CAFO permitting if necessary: “They’ll bite into the sour apple,” she said.Rep. Amy Sheldon, D-Middlebury, left, and Rep. Larry Satcowitz, D-Randolph, listen as Scott Sanderson of the Conservation Law Foundation testifies before the House Environment Committee at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Jan. 21, 2025. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger’Dysfunctional and broken’This isn’t the first time Vermont’s approach to monitoring water quality on farms has been put under a microscope.Challenges can be traced back to 2008, when the Vermont Law School Environmental and Natural Resources Clinic filed a petition  that resulted in a 2013 corrective action plan. Vermont agreed to improve its approach to farms under the requirements of the Clean Water Act.But by 2016, both agencies were attending a bureaucratic version of couples counseling. The  Center for Achievement in Public Service began hosting a series of meetings and retreats for staff members. Early in that process, the center noted the two agencies had divergent missions and cultures and a lack of a shared vision. It noted a history of errors, exclusions, misunderstandings and misinterpretations that “was long and unaddressed,” according to details in the 2022 petition.After a retreat a month later, the center concluded that the Agency of Agriculture focused on promoting farms and supporting people, the other focused on policy and enforcement. When issues arose, so did groupthink: each agency “tended to rely on assumptions about the other group’s motivation,” according to the center.For example, when an ANR officer expressed frustration that an agricultural officer had failed to contact him about a point source discharge in a timely manner, after some back and forth the ANR officer emailed, “It seems pointless to discuss these details anymore when we are both working within such a confusing and highly flawed system.”More emails in 2019 showed that the agricultural agency had called ANR’s work “a waste of taxpayer dollars,” in an email quoted in the petition.Moore wrote in an email to agricultural secretary Tebbetts: “The assertions that our work is either poorly conceived or nefarious makes [it] extremely difficult to engage constructively and needs to stop.”A year later, Moore wrote a memo in response to the governor’s call to improve efficiency across state agencies. She said the dual oversight was fact-intensive, time-consuming, and reduced clarity for the farming community. She proposed transferring agricultural staff responsible for inspections under the Clean Water Act to ANR to create a single program because the division had “led to tension and conflict between the agencies, regulatory uncertainty for farmers, and more time-consuming outcomes for water quality resulting in more pollution.” She suggested it would save two inspector positions and an estimated $350,000.In an email to Secretary of Administration Susanne Young, she called the challenges that existed between the agencies not only institutional and statutory but “at times, even personal.”The Vermont Agency of Administration declined to act on Moore’s suggestion.“It’s really easy to write it in a memo and much more challenging to implement as it involves real humans and changing where they work and who they work for,” Moore said of the memo five years later. “It raised concerns in the agricultural community that they don’t have the same relationship with ANR and therefore we haven’t built trust in that community yet.”But by 2022, the petition was filed by three environmental organizations to the EPA alleging that the relationship was “dysfunctional and broken.”“All Vermonters are harmed by AAFM’s stubborn rivalry with ANR, including farmers,” the petitioners wrote.The EPA report noted that for over 15 years, Vermont has had “ample time and opportunity to cure longstanding program deficiencies” but failed to do so. The EPA concluded that consolidating the authority to implement the agricultural water quality program into ANR “is the only workable solution” to avoid losing the state’s ability to oversee the Clean Water Act.‘This is crazy’Early in the current legislative session, a different bill, H.146 — endorsed by the environmental organizations that filed the 2022 petition — suggested an easy answer: entirely transition the state’s water quality regulation and enforcement to ANR and require all large and some medium farms to obtain federal permits. That bill never left committee.Sherman-Gordon, the legislative director for Rural Vermont, said her organization opposed the original House bill.“What we often hear is that if farmers have to deal with ANR, then they feel less heard and less seen,” Sherman-Gordon said. She said farmers feel historically underrepresented in the legislature, and she doesn’t feel that farmers were appropriately consulted or invited to testify on H.146. “The issue is that ANR hasn’t been doing the job they’ve been told to do, and instead of holding them accountable, the discourse is can we take away jurisdiction without hearing from farmers.”Instead, by mid-May, the compromise bill, S.124, was being discussed in the House Environment Committee as members tried to determine whether to add language that could make the bill more stringent. On May 21, when the committee was voting on that amendment, Collier, with the state’s agriculture agency, interrupted the meeting with a raised hand. In a previous meeting, he’d told the committee that the Agricultural Agency felt the regulatory work was getting done. He argued that the only reason they were discussing this issue was because “the advocates filed a petition and they want ANR to do all the work.”“We have some of the most restrictive water quality regulations in the country so the question is not about whether ANR should do more, it’s whether anyone should do more,” Collier told the committee on May 21.“That’s crazy,” said committee chair Amy Sheldon, D-Middlebury, clearly frustrated. “We’ve been confronted with a petition that has been years in the making. We have water quality issues, staff are under stress. We need to be engaged in this and empowering the agency to take responsibility,” Sheldon said. “Under the current political regime, ANR hasn’t taken responsibility, and we’re saying they need to take responsibility.”Rep. Rob North, R-Ferrisburgh, encouraged his fellow committee members to “take a breath.” “There’s been a fair amount of animosity pointed towards these two departments that are trying to work together,” said Rep. Christopher Pritchard, R-Pawlet. He claimed that the advocates who wrote the petition had “no skin in the game” and wouldn’t have to deal with the repercussions of the amended bill.“From the point of view of the advocates, the skin in the game we all have is that if we want to have better water quality in our state, this is how to go about it,” Rep. Larry Satcowitz, D-Randolph, said in response.While the EPA’s most recent letter supported S. 124, it acknowledged that it would likely require more legislation in the future. Moore said she expected more information from the federal agency in the coming weeks. ANR plans to do 10 farm inspections this summer and take the lead on inspections required on medium and large farms next year under its revised corrective action plan with the EPA. If the EPA approves of the legislation, ANR will draft a new document that will outline the agreement between the dual agencies by September 1. That document could give ANR new authorities related to inspections and establish a more thorough stakeholder process to help the agencies coexist and reconcile their responsibilities.In the background is an unsettling federal landscape under President Donald Trump’s administration. In committee meetings, legislators have wondered about including language from the federal Clean Water Act into state law. That way, if the federal law is overturned or changed, the state law will remain strong.“There’s real value in having people on the ground doing work that are familiar with the specifics of Vermont and our rural nature and the small, small size of many of our systems,” Moore said. “A lot of that would be lost if the programs were returned to EPA.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont is violating the federal Clean Water Act.

Deidre Grzymala states in her legal complaint that library board member Tammara Hamby defamed her in violation of an agreement between Grzymala and the county upon her resignation as Crawford County Library System director in February 2023. The agreement said Grzymala and the county would refrain from “criticizing, denigrating or disparaging each other.”
At an April 18 library board meeting, Hamby claimed Grzymala was responsible for a First Amendment lawsuit against the county, the library board and others over the library’s segregation of children’s books with LGBTQ+ themes into “social sections.” Three parents sued over the segregation in May 2023, and a federal judge ruled in their favor in September 2024.
The Crawford County Quorum Court voted unanimously at a special meeting in April to accept the library board’s offer to pay nearly $113,000 in legal fees, ending months of dispute over who would foot the bill for losing the case.
Crawford County Library will foot the bill for lawsuit over segregation of LGBTQ+ children’s books

Hamby was among the board members to support the payment and previously supported the segregation of LGBTQ+ children’s books. The county quorum court appointed her to the library board in early 2023, replacing one of three members that resigned en masse after the creation of the “social sections.”
Hamby said April 18 that Grzymala “lied to” her and “caused the lawsuit.” These “defamatory statements… were communicated to thousands of Arkansas citizens” via the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette’s River Valley bureau, Grzymala’s complaint states.
In addition to Hamby and Crawford County, the lawsuit lists “John Doe 1-5” as defendants. Grzymala’s attorney, Christopher Hooks, signed an affidavit attached to the complaint, stating that all the relevant defendants in the case are as yet unknown and will be named in the case upon Hooks learning their identities.
Hooks previously alleged a violation of Crawford County’s “separation agreement” with Grzymala in an April 23 letter to the county seeking $100,000 in damages over Hamby’s remarks.
Grzymala’s lawsuit seeks punitive damages, alleging she has faced “damage to [her] reputation as a librarian/library director, damages to reputation in the community, loss of wages, loss of earning capacity and business opportunity, incidental expenses, mental anguish, [and] extreme emotional distress.”

Grzymala complaint 
The complaint requests a jury trial in the circuit court of Washington County, where Grzymala now lives.
Hamby and her husband, Jeffrey, co-wrote a December 2022 letter to Crawford County pastors, saying LGBTQ+ library books within children’s reach is “grooming a generation of children to feel this is normal and an accepted way of life.”
This was part of a “pressure campaign” to force the library to segregate the books, an action publicly framed as a “compromise,” Grzymala alleges in her complaint.
The county lost a separate lawsuit over Act 372 of 2023, which would have given local elected officials the final say over whether to relocate challenged library materials some consider “obscene.” The 18 plaintiffs who sued the state, including Crawford County Library patrons, cited county officials’ statements that Act 372 was a reason to maintain the “social sections.”
A federal judge blocked the challenged portions of Act 372, citing First Amendment violations, in December. The legal fees facing Crawford County defendants in both lawsuits exceeded $575,000, library board chairman Keith Pigg said in April.

Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers together just two weeks after they finished work in the regular session to consider a package of tax incentives intended to convince the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals to stay in Missouri. 
Kehoe is also asking lawmakers for a $235 million spending bill with $25 million for disaster relief as well as a special tax deduction for the cost of meeting insurance deductibles after a disaster. 
The brief opening session didn’t feature any sharp exchanges, but the bills filed — and the statements made about them — show where the battle lines are being drawn.
Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, told reporters that members of his caucus aren’t willing to talk about stadium funding until an appropriations bill and other disaster relief measures are on Kehoe’s desk.
“When that happens and it’s through the House and on the governor’s desk, then we can talk about it,” Beck said.
Members of the Freedom Caucus said they are holding out for a tax cut that benefits all Missourians before considering a stadium plan, said state Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance.
Schroer filed a bill to cut the top income tax rate to 4% — it is currently 4.7% — and make the tax flat across all incomes.
“​​The members of the Freedom Caucus, plus the other conservative members that are not necessarily in the caucus, they’ve all expressed that whether it’s income tax, personal property tax or real property tax, for us to sit at the table, and allow tax credits for billionaires to move forward, the little guy needs to get something in return,” Schroer said.
The regular session ended in acrimony when Republicans twice invoked a rarely used procedural move to shut off debate. Democrats had blocked a proposed ballot measure to restore Missouri’s ban on most abortions and a bill repealing the paid sick leave law passed by voters in November.
Democrats vowed that the move ended their cooperation with Republicans and gave a taste of what that meant last week when they stalled the final paperwork of the regular session.
Under the Missouri Constitution, lawmakers have 60 days to complete work on items in a special session and Kehoe has said he won’t try to impose an artificial deadline. Because of the uncertainty of action in the Senate, the Missouri House won’t convene until next week and will only remain in session if the Senate has passed a bill for it to consider.
But the Chiefs and Royals have only until the end of the month to answer an offer from Kansas to fund new stadiums. Kehoe hopes to have his plan for tax incentives worth about 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums to be passed by then.
The plan for the Chiefs and Royals would take tax money already generated from activities at the stadiums — $28.8 million annually as estimated by the Chiefs and $15 million annually by an estimate from the Royals — and commit it to bond payments for 30 years for the new or upgraded facilities.
The economic activity associated with the Chiefs supports 4,500 jobs, Kehoe contends, and a new stadium for the Royals would generate about 8,400 jobs. 
The spending bill Kehoe wants passed would use $25 million of general revenue to support a new research reactor on the University of Missouri’s Columbia campus, plus funding for a new livestock display barn at the State Fairgrounds in Sedalia and about $50 million to help with construction of a new mental hospital in Kansas City.
The funding for the reactor is $25 million less than Kehoe proposed. State Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat, introduced an appropriations bill with $75 million for the reactor, plus all the other general revenue projects that died when Missouri House Republicans refused to bring the construction spending bill up for a vote.
“If there is going to be a $25 million variance on agreements made in this chamber, we ought to go $25 million in the other direction,” Webber said.
Webber also introduced a bill imposing a 1% income tax surcharge on incomes greater than $1 million, which he said would bring in about $400 million over three years to support disaster relief.
“There is obviously a belief, among some, that billionaires should be given a sweetheart deal. I would disagree with that,” Webber said. “There is also some concern about whether we can fund disaster relief for some communities in our state that were desperately hit. So what I’ve tried to do is build a bridge between those two issues.”
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican who chairs the Freedom Caucus, introduced a bill to finance the stadiums entirely from donations. He called it the “No Taxation, All Donation Act” and included incentives for giving.
“So if somebody gives over $10,000 to this stadium, then they are able to obtain free parking to be able to get into that stadium,” Brattin said.
The next step will be to send the bills to committees for hearings. That will happen tomorrow and the first hearings will occur soon afterward.
Senate Majority Leader Tony Luetkemeyer, a Republican from Parkville, seemed happy to have gotten past the first day without a filibuster.
“Today went smoothly,” Luetkemeyer said. “And then we’ll just take it day by day and see where we go from here.”

“I am committed to providing safe, secure, and humane environments that support rehabilitation and public safety,” Foreman said in a news release.
Foreman is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served as a sergeant with infantry and security forces for over six years before beginning his corrections and law enforcement career. 
After his military service, Foreman worked with the Federal Bureau of Prisons for more than two decades. He worked at several correctional facilities, including serving as associate warden for FCI Tallahassee, a low-security federal prison for female inmates in Tallahassee, Florida.
Following his time with federal institutions, Foreman went on to work for public correctional facilities such as jail administrator for Jackson County Correctional Facility and assistant warden at Jefferson Correctional Institution in Monticello, Florida. Both facilities have multiple security levels ranging from minimum to medium.
“The Iowa State Penitentiary is a cornerstone of our institution system, and we are confident that Mark is the right leader to guide it into the future,” Iowa DOC Director Dr. Beth Skinner said in a news release. 
Foreman’s experience also includes several positions with private correctional institutions company CoreCivic, including his most recent role as senior warden of Cimarron Correctional Facility, a medium-security facility located three miles southwest of Cushing, Oklahoma Prior to this, he served as warden of Cibola County Correctional Facility, a minimum-security prison in Milan, New Mexico; assistant warden of Jenkins Correctional Facility, a medium-security prison in Millen, Georgia and assistant warden of McRae Correctional Facility, a low-security prison in McRae-Helena, Georgia.
“His leadership style is rooted in accountability, staff development, and a clear vision for operational excellence.

(Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin on Monday said he could not certify a proposed constitutional amendment related to direct democracy because it violates a new state law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. 
Act 602, which became law in April, prohibits the attorney general from certifying a proposed ballot title with a reading level above eighth grade as determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula. The test uses word complexity and sentence lengths to calculate what grade of education is needed to comprehend written material.  
“The ballot title you have submitted ranks at grade 11.5. Thus, your ballot title requires significant revisions before it complies with the Act,” according to Monday’s opinion, which was prepared by Assistant Attorney General Jodie Keener and approved by Griffin. 
Monday’s opinion identified additional issues with the proposal, including ambiguity regarding the Arkansas General Assembly’s authority and how conflicting measures become law. 
The Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment, sponsored by the Protect AR Rights coalition, would amend Article 5 Section 1 of the Arkansas Constitution, the section that governs the state’s initiative and referendum process. It would designate as a “fundamental right” the right of voters to propose laws and constitutional amendments that can be put to a statewide vote.
Among its various provisions, the measure would require petition signatures be gathered from at least 15 counties instead of 50 and would explicitly prohibit the Arkansas General Assembly from amending or repealing a constitutional amendment approved by voters. 
This is the second ballot measure proposed this year in response to state lawmakers approving about a dozen direct democracy-related laws during the 2025 legislative session. Supporters of the new laws have said they will ensure the integrity of the initiative and referendum process, while opponents have argued it will make it more difficult for citizen-led initiatives to qualify for the ballot. 
The direct democracy process allows Arkansans to propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allows citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.


Let us know what you think...


 

Protect AR Rights spokesperson Bill Kopsky said in a phone interview that Monday’s decision was expected because the attorney general often rejects the first draft of a proposed ballot title. The ballot question committee intends to request a meeting with Griffin’s staff to gather feedback, Kopsky said.  
In an emailed statement, Protect AR Rights noted this was “the first step in a long process, and our coalition remains fully committed to protecting the rights of Arkansans to shape their own laws.” Griffin’s rejection of the group’s proposed amendment reinforces why it’s “so urgently needed,” according to the group. 
“We’re reviewing the AG’s feedback and will revise and resubmit our amendment. But let’s be clear: the new 8th grade reading requirement — passed by politicians trying to limit access to the ballot — is a serious barrier to a fundamental right,” the statement reads. “We believe measures should be clear, accessible, and accurate. That’s exactly why we’re fighting this provision in court.”
Court filings reveal opposition to intervening motion in Arkansas direct democracy lawsuit

Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, another ballot question committee pursuing an education-focused constitutional amendment, are trying to challenge Act 602 by intervening in a federal lawsuit that challenges several other new laws governing the state’s direct democracy process. 
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas filed the lawsuit against the secretary of state in April. The League proposed its own direct democracy-related ballot measure this year that was thrice rejected by the attorney general, including once for violating Act 602. Griffin substituted and certified the popular name and ballot title so it met the eighth grade-reading level requirement on May 21. That means the League can begin gathering signatures to try to place their measure on the 2026 ballot.
In response to the motion to intervene, both the League and the state argued in court filings last week that Protect AR Rights lacks standing and is not entitled to intervene in the case. 
Protect AR Rights could file its own lawsuit if a judge dismisses the motion to intervene, but Kopsky said the court would likely freeze both lawsuits while deciding whether to consolidate them.
“We believe it would slow the process down substantially, which doesn’t seem to be in anybody’s interest,” he said. “So we were surprised that they opposed the motion to intervene, but our legal team is going to respond to it in a way that’s appropriate. The bottom line is we’re committed to protecting the right to direct democracy and the right to have access to ballot measures in the state.”

Claeys, a member of the Kansas Legislature for 13 years, said he accepted appointment to an administrative job in the U.S. Department of Agriculture within under President Donald Trump. He said serving the Salina area was the biggest honor of his life. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican Sen. J.R. Claeys of Salina resigned from the Kansas Legislature after accepting an administrative job with the rural business development service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Claeys, who served 13 years in the House and Senate but lost a GOP primary for secretary of state, disclosed several weeks ago his intent to quit as senior advisor to Attorney General Kris Kobach and as a Republican political consultant for Axiom Strategies.
On Monday, Claeys assumed duties at USDA as director of the Rural Business-Cooperative Service. The federal agency within USDA has responsibility for promoting economic development by supporting rural businesses and cooperatives.
Claeys said he joined the administration of President Donald Trump to “continue to fight for rural Americans.”
“I have had the privilege of serving my hometown in the Kansas Legislature,” Claeys said. “Representing the people of Saline and Dickinson counties, including Salina where I was born and raised, has been the honor of my life.”
Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, said he appreciated the role Claeys’ played in shaping the Senate’s budget and tax policies.
“He has helped lead efforts to secure key private and public sector investments into Kansas, particularly his district,” Masterson said.
The 24th District in the Senate, in accordance with Section 5 of the Kansas Constitution, was declared vacant and the process of nominating a replacement could begin. Claeys won reelection to a four-year term in November.
Claeys was the second Republican to recently depart the Legislature for employment at USDA. State Rep. Patrick Penn, R-Wichita, stepped down in mid-May to begin work as deputy undersecretary for the agriculture department’s food and nutrition service.
Sedgwick County Republicans nominated Steve Brunk to complete the unexpired portion of Penn’s term. Brunk served as a state representative from 2003 to 2015.
Claeys said the central Kansas region within his legislative district experienced economic growth due to massive federal investment and an influx of state bond revenue that spurred manufacturing expansion and technological evolution. Developments included transportation projects, housing construction, downtown revitalization and growth at Kansas State University’s aviation campus in Salina.
“Rural America is not an afterthought,” Claeys said. “It is where the strongest work ethic exists in our nation. A resource more valuable than any other.”
Claeys was elected to the House in 2012 and transitioned to the Senate in 2020. He worked on behalf of the Trump presidential campaign in 2020. He ran unsuccessfully for Kansas secretary of state in 2010.
In 2012, the Salina Journal reported a company owned by Claeys was the subject of a Federal Trade Commission investigation into sales of worthless “green” certifications to more than 125 companies. The FTC concluded Tested Green, based in Washington, D.C., sold bogus environmental certifications from February 2009 to April 2010.
“This company was putting out a green certification that consumers could pay for that was deceptive,” the FEC said at that time. “It had nothing behind it to prove a company was green.”
The FTC said Tested Green certifications were backed by the National Green Business Association and the National Association of Government Contractors. Those Claeys-owned associations shared an address in the District of Columbia.
Claeys said he launched Tested Green, but turned over management to a “director” when he began the campaign for Kansas secretary of state. Claeys said he was deceived by the director, who he declined to identify.
The FTC’s order listed Jeremy Ryan Claeys was doing business as Tested Green, the Journal said. The company wasn’t fined or penalized by the FTC, which typically would issue a cease-and-desist order to the offending company.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Claeys-Senate-3.26.25-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-02 19:06:00.364371

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)As a national outbreak of measles continues, South Dakota has detected its first case of the year.
The state Department of Health said Monday in a news release that the infected person is a Meade County adult who “visited several public locations.”
The department said people may have been exposed to measles in the Rapid City Medical Center Urgent Care waiting room from 7:15 a.m. to 10 a.m. Mountain time on May 28 and the Monument Health Sturgis Urgent Care waiting room from 9:45 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mountain time on May 29.
People who were in those settings should self-monitor for measles symptoms for 21 days, the department said.
‘I question it myself’: South Dakota vaccination rates fall amid mistrust and misinformation

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that spreads through the air from an infected person. People who lack immunity from vaccination or past infection are at high risk of measles infection if they have contact with an infected person.
Measles symptoms appear in two stages. In the first stage, the individual may have a runny nose, cough and a slight fever. The eyes may become reddened and sensitive to light while the fever consistently rises each day. The second stage begins on the third to seventh day of symptoms and consists of a temperature of 103-105 degrees Fahrenheit, and a red blotchy rash lasting for four to seven days. The rash usually begins on the face and then spreads down to the trunk and out to the arms and legs.
The department said the measles vaccine “offers the best protection against infection and avoids the risks that come with infection.” The department said the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine “is highly effective at preventing measles infection, and two MMR doses usually produce lifelong immunity.”
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a measles vaccination rate of 95% is needed to prevent outbreaks, given the highly contagious nature of the virus. 
Vaccination rates have been falling in South Dakota, where incoming kindergarteners are required to be up to date on the MMR vaccine unless they have a medical or religious exemption. Ten years ago, six South Dakota counties had less than 95% of kindergarteners vaccinated for measles, with the lowest being 80%. Now, more than 40 counties in the state are below 95%, with 12 below 80% and five below 70%. 
The South Dakota measles case comes amid the most severe U.S. measles outbreak in decades. According to the CDC, there had been more than 1,000 measles cases detected this year across 33 states prior to the detection in South Dakota.
Last year, South Dakota reported its first measles case in nine years.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A super PAC aligned with statewide teachers union the New Jersey Education Association has put at least $40 million into an independent expenditure group backing the gubernatorial candidacy of Democrat Sean Spiller, the union’s president, according to new campaign filings.
Working New Jersey, the independent expenditure group, reported spending nearly $37.5 million in a preelection report filed with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission and made public Monday. All its money came from Garden State Forward, the teachers union super PAC.
The spending dwarfs Spiller’s own. The union leader was the only one of the six Democrats vying on June 10 for the nomination to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy to miss fundraising and spending thresholds needed to qualify for matching public funds and debates organized by the commission.
Spiller reported raising a cumulative $438,817 on his most recent campaign filing. He’s spent just $342,059 over the course of the cycle — nearly 110 times less than Working New Jersey has spent boosting his campaign.
Asked to comment, Spiller said in a statement from his campaign that his backing comes from “working folks.”
“I reject the premise that only corporations, Wall Street, and billionaires are allowed to back the candidates that represent their interests,” Spiller said. “It’s time working folks had a chance to speak too. I’m proud that my campaign is supported by tens of thousands of hard-working people all across the state who have made small-dollar donations to help us fight back against the insiders and wealthy interests who are trying to  buy this election.”
The Sunlight Policy Center, a frequent critic of the teachers union, characterized the news of Working New Jersey’s new disclosures about its spending as New Jersey teachers “being forced to fund Spiller’s vanity run.”
“All of this money comes from teachers’ highest-in-the-nation annual dues without their knowledge or consent. It’s a scandal of the first order,” said the group’s founder, Mike Lilley.
The teachers union PAC has endorsed Spiller. The union had invited all other gubernatorial candidates to screen for its backing, but only Spiller did so, it said last August.
Working New Jersey’s role in Spiller’s campaign is unusual. While candidates for high-profile offices like New Jersey’s governorship often see independent expenditures boosting or dinging their candidacies, the degree to which Working New Jersey has supplanted traditional campaign infrastructure and spending stands out.
The group has spent broadly. Its funds have paid for media buys across a range of platforms, a bevy of polls and research, and millions of dollars in consulting.
The depth of its spending may well be unprecedented. Working New Jersey’s $37.5 million in spending lags the combined spending of the race’s five other Democrats by only $818,587, though some of those candidates are also receiving outside support, if at far lower levels.
Independent spending in the 2017 governor’s primary — that was the last year New Jersey had such a race with no incumbent on the ballot — totaled just $9.1 million, according to the Election Law Enforcement Commission.
Garden State Forward, the PAC associated with the teachers union, gave a second independent expenditure group called Protecting Our Democracy $5 million between April 2022 and January 2024. Spiller appeared in ads crafted by Protecting Our Democracy to pledge to protect democracy and create affordable housing and conducted interviews on civic engagement for its social media channels.
Protecting Our Democracy did not file a preelection report — its spending predates the start of the campaign and may not have to be reported — and it’s not clear how much money it’s put into the race.
The group was last publicly active in May 2024, when it launched a 30-second ad with a voiceover from Spiller, who launched his gubernatorial campaign the following month.
Candidates are barred by law from coordinating spending with independent expenditure groups.
The race’s other Democrats have also received outside support, though none at the level Spiller has enjoyed.
Two independent expenditure groups backing Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05) — Affordable New Jersey and No Surrender — have spent a combined $11.6 million boosting Gottheimer’s candidacy.
One Giant Leap PAC has put nearly $3.8 million behind Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11), while the Coalition for Progress has backed Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop and Assembly candidates he’s recruited with $6.8 million.
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney received nearly $4.3 million in backing from the Building Bridges Voter Project.
Early in-person voting for the primary begins Tuesday at 10 a.m., and residents have already returned more than 258,000 mail-in ballots.

José Javier Rodriguez announced Monday that he is a candidate for the Democratic Party nomination for attorney general in 2026. 
“Corrupt deal makers have taken over Florida, and we are paying the price,” says Rodriguez in a video message announcing his candidacy posted early Monday afternoon.
“Our power company is planning the biggest rate hike in U.S. history. Our insurance goes up every year. Powerful interests get away with everything they want, looking out for themselves and making deals at our expense and at our children’s expense. And who do we have to stop them? Nobody. Because our attorney general, the guy who should be taking them to court, is too busy enriching himself and only looking out for himself.”
That last reference is to Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, who was selected by Gov. Ron DeSantis to serve out the remainder of Ashley Moody’s four-year term in February after he appointed her to the U.S. Senate.
Rodriguez, 46, is a Miami attorney with Cuban roots who graduated from Harvard Law School before getting into electoral politics. He first ran for office in 2012, when he won a House seat representing a portion of Miami-Dade County. In 2016, he left the House and won a seat in the state Senate representing various cities in Miami-Dade (including downtown Miami).
His time in the Legislature ended abruptly in 2020 when he lost his bid for re-election to his Senate seat to Republican Ileana Garcia by just 32 votes out of more than 210,000 cast.
However, it was later exposed in state court that former Republican state Sen. Frank Artiles had orchestrated the candidacy of a no-party-affiliated “ghost candidate” named Alex Rodriguez by offering him $50,000 to enter the contest to take votes away from José Javier Rodriguez.
Alex Rodriguez received 3% of the vote that year. Ultimately, Artiles was sentenced to 60 days in jail for his involvement in that operation.
In 2021 Rodriguez was nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as assistant secretary for employment and training in the U.S. Department of Labor. He wasn’t confirmed however, until March of 2024, clearing the U.S. Senate on a narrow 50-48 vote.
Climate change
A strong advocate for combatting climate change during his time in the Senate, in 2019 Rodriguez filed a bill that would have allowed property owners to sell home-generated solar power to other people or tenants living in their homes.
Such legislation if enacted could have become a threat to investor-owned utilities like Florida Power & Light. It was later reported that then-utility CEO Eric Silagy sent an email to lobbyists for the utility after the bill was introduced, writing, “I want you to be make his life a living hell…seriously.”
Rodriguez referenced that comment in his campaign video on Monday.
“I made my career taking on the corrupt and powerful,” he said.
“When I did, they promised to make my life a living hell. Seriously. So I gave ’em hell right back. Seriously. As an attorney, fighting for janitors, security guards, and cab drivers whose wages were stolen. As a state senator, taking on special interest giants who want more and more of our hard-earned money at every turn. And as an assistant secretary of Labor, proud to fight every day for American workers. And now I’m running to be your attorney general, because Florida needs somebody in its court, and I’ve never been more ready to take on the corrupt and powerful.”
Rodriguez is the first major Democrat to announce his candidacy for the AG position, which has been held by Republican lawmakers ever since Bob Butterworth left office due to term limits in 2002.
Uthmeier controversy
Uthmeier previously served as DeSantis’ chief of staff and has already faced several controversies during his short time in office, which could invite a primary challenge from a fellow Republican. A federal judge has said that she may hold him in contempt of court for informing law enforcement officers that they don’t need to follow a court order barring enforcement of a newly enacted state immigration law.
Uthmeier has also had his name mentioned in the Hope Florida saga. Specifically, he chaired a political committee called Keep Florida Clean last year that was created to oppose Amendment 3, the proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis use for adults.
Keep Florida Clean was the ultimate recipient of millions of dollars of the original $10 million that the Hope Florida Foundation received from a $67 million Medicaid overpayment settlement with the state. Uthmeier has denied any involvement in how that money came to Keep Florida Clean.
Like any Democrat now running statewide in what has become a very red state, Rodriguez will definitely be an underdog should he win the Democratic party’s nomination for AG next year.  Evan Power, the Republican Party of Florida chair, blasted the South Florida Democrat as being a “failed politician and liberal ambulance chaser.”
“José Javier Rodriguez has spent his career coddling criminals, chasing ambulances, and auditioning whatever political gig he can land,” Power said in a statement. “Floridians support fighters who protect communities, not far-left hacks who put criminals first.”

Our economic competitiveness, our educational excellence, and our role as a beacon of equality require us to protect and preserve our cultural sector. Every resident can play a role in this defining moment.
The post As leaders of state and regional organizations, we’re sounding the alarm on Trump’s attacks on the arts appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AS LEADERS OF statewide and regional organizations dedicated to increasing access to the arts, culture, and humanities, we are fortunate to advocate for the power of culture. We revel in the work of bold theater companies and groundbreaking museum exhibits, witness children build confidence and imagination through local arts programs, and applaud the relentless efforts of the cultural sector to improve accessibility for every resident.  Our jobs often find us celebrating the successes that unfold in communities that embrace the arts and the humanities. Today, however, we must sound the alarm. In its first 100 days, the Trump administration took steps that represent a clear and present danger to the cultural vitality of the nation and, we believe, to our democracy. We call on the people of New England to respond proactively to these threats. From executive orders to muzzle free speech to the elimination of jobs and funding, the aggressive attacks on the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services will impact communities in every state. Efforts to radically alter the missions of the Kennedy Center and the Library of Congress signal a willingness to fundamentally change how we create, tell, and share the stories of the American experiment.  We must stand up for these people and organizations. Our economic competitiveness, our educational excellence, and our role as a beacon of equality require us to protect and preserve our cultural sector. Every resident can play a role in this defining moment. While we understand that this fight will require years of shared effort, we see immediate possibilities in several areas.  We call on state and local government to protect our public libraries, parks, museums, and historic sites. These spaces serve as common ground for every resident in a time of division and misinformation.  They face a twofold threat from the federal government’s actions. First, the cuts to the federal agencies will create increased scarcity, leading to a reduction in services. Second, executive orders aimed at whitewashing our history apply pressure to the people operating these public spaces. As democracy is pushed to the brink, we cannot sacrifice the very places dedicated to ensuring a free society. State and local officials must support open access and the truth.  We ask private philanthropy to increase its support for the cultural sector during this critical period. We know that the cascading crises caused by this administration increase demand for every sector. Along with its $29.7 billion economic impact in Massachusetts alone, the cultural sector generates inspiration, helps to solve problems, and increases knowledge for residents in every community.  Our artists and organizations collaborate with sectors including health and human services, education, and climate. As we seek to combat fear and intolerance provoked by the federal government’s actions, philanthropy can ensure that children still learn to dance, that festivals still bring people together, and that the voices, songs, and visions of our artists continue to uplift us in this dark time.  We call on public and private supporters to honor the history of New England by celebrating our right to courageous dissent. We must resist the urge to sanitize artistic expression. The federal government’s efforts to intimidate everyone from theater companies to historians to elementary school teachers cannot be rewarded by the hurried erasure of our values.  We must refuse to sideline the voices of LGBTQ+ communities and people of color. Let our stages and concert halls remain safe places for every resident. Instead of revisiting tired tropes of Americana, we must continue to embrace artwork and scholarship that challenges us. We must serve as a refuge for creatives whose bodies and bodies of work do not fit into the gardens of heroes propped up by this administration.  As leaders, we know that we, too, must deepen our commitments. In our advocacy work, we will not bend in our demands for public funding that is distributed equitably. As funders, we will strive to find more resources so that we can respond swiftly during this emergency. As membership organizations, we will find ways to bring more people into our movement and give them the tools and care necessary to navigate these dangerous waters. Finally, we believe that solidarity is tyranny’s kryptonite. We commit to working collectively to ensure a united front in this struggle. Despite the damage inflicted in recent weeks, we are awash in hope. We witness firsthand the critical role that cultural organizations play in making our region a great place to live and create.   Now more than ever, we believe that the arts and humanities are essential to building a new pathway for the nation. In this perilous moment, the fearless vision of our artists, historians, and educators can define our future.  Michael Bobbitt is executive director of the Mass Cultural Council.

MILFORD — The City of Milford has named Christopher Coleman as its next City Manager, following a nationwide search.
Coleman, who currently serves as Town Administrator in Westwood, Ma., will assume the role on August 4.
“I am deeply honored to have been selected as the next City Manager for Milford, and to follow in the footsteps of such a respected leader and individual as Mark Whitfield,” stated Coleman. “The inclusive and thoughtful selection process—which involved the Mayor, City Council, Department Heads, and surrounding municipal managers—left a strong impression on me.”

Coleman brings over 30 years of experience in municipal government, having worked in leadership positions across five Massachusetts communities.
His appointment follows the planned departure of current City Manager Mark Whitfield.
“Chris will be a welcomed leader to the City of Milford staff and the community,” Whitfield said. “His deep experience in local government and his strong commitment to community-centered leadership will be invaluable as we continue to grow and improve city services.”
Coleman’s career began with a summer internship in Marblehead, Ma.
He later served in various roles including Treasurer/Collector, Assistant Town Administrator, Director of Human Resources, and Assistant Town Manager.
In 2019, he was appointed Town Administrator in Westwood, a town of 16,000 residents and a $116 million municipal budget.
During his tenure in Westwood, Coleman played a key role in multiple initiatives, including the development of a new elementary school, managing the town’s COVID-19 response, and overseeing critical infrastructure projects such as a proposed new fire headquarters.
He also helped secure and manage over $4.9 million in federal ARPA funds for local improvements.
In a statement, Coleman said he was “deeply honored” to be selected as Milford’s next City Manager and praised the city’s inclusive hiring process.
Coleman is a Credentialed City Manager with the International City/County Management Association (ICMA) and is also affiliated with the Massachusetts Municipal Managers Association and the Massachusetts Interlocal Insurance Association. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Accounting from Clarion University of Pennsylvania.
“I am excited to collaborate with Mayor Culotta and the entire City Council in supporting and advancing the City’s goals,” Coleman said. “I look forward to
earning my place on this exceptional team and contributing to the work of passionate professionals who genuinely care about their city, their colleagues, and the positive impact they make every day in our community.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-02-at-6.27.07-PM.png,,,2025-06-02 19:06:00.364371

(Photo by Carlo Alberto Conti/Getty Images)The federal government is awarding Utah $3 million to purchase conservation easements in southern Utah near Zion National Park. 
The funding — awarded to the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands by the U.S. Department of Agriculture — was announced Monday and will go toward ongoing forest preservation efforts outside of the national park. 
Called the Zion Connectivity Project, the state will direct the funding at two properties totalling 766 acres near the north section of the national park. A conservation easement — a legally binding agreement between a landowner and government that places restrictions on the land for environmental purposes — will prevent the land from being fragmented or developed. 
That will help preserve the ecologically rich stretch of forest.

The region contains a number of springs and streams, including the La Verkin Creek, which feeds into the Virgin River and eventually the Colorado River. The creek supports six native species of fish, like the Virgin River chub and Woundfin, both federally endangered. 
The forest provides critical habitat for the endangered California condor and Mexican spotted owl, and preventing the area from being segmented will help black bear, grouse, deer and elk populations. Old-growth ponderosa pines, some of them hundreds of years old, can also be found in the area.
“The strategic location of this project, combined with the presence of California condors, garnered incredible support from Zion National Park, elected officials, neighboring landowners, and other organizations. Thanks to the efforts of these private landowners and The Conservation Fund, protecting this important forested area was recognized as a priority to the national program,” said Natalie Conlin, forest legacy program manager for the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands.
The Zion Connectivity Project is part of Utah’s Forest Legacy Program, which uses conservation easements throughout the state to safeguard forests from development, protect water resources and habitat, and keep wildlife corridors intact.
The Zion Connectivity Project is sandwiched between two existing Forest Legacy projects — the Zion Overlook and Viewtop projects. The three projects create a combined 1,752-acre stretch of projected land along the northern border of Zion National Park.

Free.,"Rubio in talks for return of wrongly deported 'Cristian,' in flip for Trump administration",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rubio-talks-return-wrongly-deported-cristian-flip-trump-administration,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is personally working to facilitate the return of a man wrongly deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, at the request of the Department of Homeland Security, the Trump administration said on Monday in court documents.If successful, the man, identified in documents in federal court in Maryland only by the pseudonym of “Cristian,” would be the first deported person returned from the brutal Salvadoran Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.Bringing him back to the United States would also contradict the Trump administration's long-running argument in the courts and to the public that El Salvador has custody over hundreds of men sent there in March, not the U.S.The Trump-appointed judge in Cristian’s case on Friday had blasted the administration for not detailing to her its actions to return him.The Trump administration has made the same argument in the case of another wrongly deported man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland, despite a U.S. Supreme Court order to facilitate his return.Trump and other top U.S. officials have alleged Abrego Garcia is a gang member, though there is no evidence of that. President Donald Trump has also acknowledged he could bring Abrego Garcia back if he wanted to do so.‘Prompt and diligent efforts on behalf of the United States’The court document in Cristian’s case filed Monday by U.S. Department of Homeland Security official Mellissa B. Harper says that Rubio “has a personal relationship” with El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele and Salvadoran government officials that dates back over a decade to the Florida Republican’s time on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.The case is being heard in Baltimore, in the District of Maryland.“Based on this deep experience with El Salvador and the Secretary’s familiarity with political and diplomatic sensitivities in that country, he is personally handling the discussions with the government of El Salvador regarding persons subject to the Court’s order detained in El Salvador,” according to the document.“Secretary Rubio has read and understands this Court’s order, and wants to assure this Court that he is committed to making prompt and diligent efforts on behalf of the United States to comply with that order,” the document continues.The document notes that DHS has asked the State Department for “assistance in complying with the Court’s order, including by entering into negotiations to facilitate Cristian’s return.”Harper, who submitted the declaration, works at Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division as the acting deputy executive associate director.Judge harshly criticized administrationThe document was filed after U.S. District Judge for the District of Maryland Stephanie Gallagher Friday slammed the Trump administration for its “blatant lack of effort to comply” with her order earlier this month to report steps taken to bring back Cristian, who in court documents is said to be 20 years old.On May 6, she affirmed her decision that the Trump administration must facilitate Cristian’s return.Gallagher, whom Trump appointed in 2018, gave the Department of Justice until Monday to comply with her order.Cristian was among roughly 300 men sent to the Salvadoran mega-prison CECOT. About 200 of those men were removed under an 18th-century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and the rest, such as Abrego Garcia, were removed under other immigration laws.Cristian arrived in the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor and was part of a class action that barred removal from the U.S. while his asylum case was pending in immigration court.Like the Abrego Garcia case, the administration said earlier it was powerless to compel the Salvadoran government to release Cristian, an argument Gallagher expressed frustration with Friday.“Defendants simply reiterated their well-worn talking points on their reasons for removing Cristian and failed to provide any of the information the Court required,” Gallagher wrote in her order.The Trump administration is paying El Salvador up to $15 million to detain removed immigrants from the U.S.“As a Venezuelan native, he is in El Salvador only because the United States sent him there pursuant to an agreement apparently reached with the government of El Salvador,” Gallagher wrote.",,,,2025-06-02 19:06:00.364371

Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) Director Karl Reifsteck on Monday appointed three people to work on the Behavioral Health Executive Committee, which is expected to meet for the first time later this month.
New Mexico this year enacted Senate Bill 3, which replaced the old Behavioral Health Collaborative with the new Behavioral Health Executive Committee, which will be responsible for reviewing and approving regional plans for delivering behavioral health services and overseeing the implementation and funding of those plans, according to an AOC news release.
Reifsteck appointed three people to the panel: Dr. Stacey Cox, of Silver City, chief executive officer of the Center for Health Innovation-New Mexico Public Health Institute; Dr. Violette Cloud, of Albuquerque, senior project associate with Policy Research Associates, Inc.; and former Democratic state Sen. Gerald Ortiz y Pino, of Albuquerque.
“Each of these individuals bring years of experience and valuable knowledge to the task ahead of improving how New Mexico responds to people struggling with behavioral health issues,” Reifsteck said in a statement.
Ortiz y Pino, in a statement, said he’s been working with “a great many others in the state to slow the steady stream of individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders brought before the courts who need help, not punishment.”
Ortiz y Pino described “the success of treatment courts and diversion projects” currently underway as “heartening,” and noted that now “our challenge is to find ways and resources to ramp those efforts up to full scale and to explore moving from pilots to policies.”
The executive committee will also include Reifsteck, the Health Care Authority cabinet secretary; the Behavioral Health Services Division director; and the Medicaid program director.
“This initiative is the culmination of sustained efforts by state agencies, governing bodies and community partners, and its passage signals a shared commitment to move beyond fragmented approaches and toward a unified strategy that prioritizes access, accountability, and long-term impact,” Cloud, who is also member of the New Mexico Supreme Court’s Commission on Mental Health and Competency, said in a statement.
The committee will hold meetings open to the public in Santa Fe and online every quarter, and report back to the LFC. Its first meeting will be held on June 24, AOC spokesperson Barry Massey told Source NM in an email.
“I am excited to bring the weight of my experience and enthusiasm to building behavioral health services and solutions to New Mexicans in a way that is strategic, measurable and meaningful to people’s lives,” Cox said in a statement.
Last month, AOC named Esperanza Lucero as its first-ever behavioral health integration and reform administrator, the person tasked with implementing major parts of SB3.

Scholten launched his campaign for U.S. Senate June 2, 2025 following U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst's comments on Medicaid cuts. (Photos via Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch and Iowa PBS livestream)Iowa Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, launched a run to challenge U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst Monday in the wake of her remarks at a town hall that garnered national backlash from Democrats and health care advocates.
Ernst made her controversial remark, “we are all going to die,” at a Parkersburg town hall Friday after a person in the crowd shouted “people will die” as she was discussing funding cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The cuts are included in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill passed by the U.S. House in May.
Though Ernst told the crowd there would likely be changes to the bill from the Senate, she supported the cuts that “make sure that those that are not eligible by the federal standard for Medicaid are not receiving Medicaid.”
Ernst posted an “apology” video Saturday after she drew national criticism for her response. Filmed in a cemetery, Ernst posted a video on Instagram where she sarcastically said she wanted to “sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall.”
“I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this earth,” Ernst said in the video. “So I apologize, and I’m really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well.”
She recommended “for those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life, I encourage you to embrace my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.”
Scholten announces run
The comments prompted Scholten, a professional baseball pitcher for the Sioux City Explorers and state legislator, to launch his campaign for U.S. Senate. In a video posted Monday, Scholten said he “wasn’t planning on doing this right now, but I just can’t sit on the sidelines” following Ernst’s comments.
“Cutting vital services to give bigger tax breaks to billionaires isn’t just bad policy, it’s theft from people like you and me,” Scholten said. “Maybe it sounds crazy to run against an insider with enough arrogance to laugh at her constituents, but I’ve ran hard races before.”
Scholten ran twice for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District seat, in 2018 and 2020. Though he lost both elections, he was short by an unexpectedly tight margin — losing 47% to 50% to former U.S. Rep. Steve King in 2018 in the longtime conservative stronghold. In 2020, backlash against King for inflammatory comments made on issues like abortion exemptions and white nationalism led to his primary defeat by U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who currently holds the seat.
The Democratic state lawmaker said he is running to tackle wealth inequality and improve America’s health care systems.
“I fundamentally believe that we deserve more than a GoFundMe broken healthcare system, a JBS food system and Dollar General economy,” Scholten said. “Ultimately, this race is not about Joni Ernst, and it’s not about me. It’s about the people in Iowa who deserve better: Better representatives who fight against the billionaire elites and special interests who hurt us.”
Nathan Sage, a Mason City Democrat, and Scholten are currently the only Democrats who have announced their bids for the seat. However, more Democratic challengers are expected to join the field, including Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville. Wahls released a statement Friday criticizing Ernst’s comments, saying Iowa “need leaders who will fight for us, not gut health care funding that over 700,000 Iowans rely on.”
“It is of course true that we are all going to die, but our Senators shouldn’t be the ones killing us,” Wahls said.
National Democrats blast comments
National Democrats were quick to respond to Ernst’s comments, saying it further proved that Republicans are aware the Medicaid cuts will lead to preventable deaths. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin made a statement denouncing Ernst’s video Saturday.
“Thoughts and prayers have a new meaning for the Republican Party with Joni Ernst doubling down on her cruel words,” Martin said. “It is immoral and un-Christian to do nothing to prevent people from dying but unfortunately, Trump, Ernst, and the Republican Party are hellbent on putting their own constituents at risk.”
Iowa’s junior U.S. senator is far from the only Republican facing backlash for their support of the budget reconciliation bill that includes substantial federal funding cuts to public assistance programs. GOP members of Congress nationwide have faced fiery crowds at public events for months, met by shouts and jeers from constituents upset about actions taken by Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service and potential cuts to public assistance programs including Medicaid as well as veterans’ benefits and Social Security.
Several Iowans who depend on Medicaid for themselves or their family also decried Ernst’s comments. Patrick Kearns, a registered nurse at the Iowa City VA Medical Center who has two adult children with disabilities on Medicaid, said he wished he was surprised by Ernst’s comments, but that he was not. Kearns said he believes Ernst’s comments reflect how many Republicans view people on Medicaid, pointing to Elon Musk, a former special government employee in the Trump administration, making social media posts referring to people on federal aid programs as a “parasite class.”
“She accidentally said the quiet part out loud … People are going to die, and why are we bothering to keep these folks alive?” Kearns said. “And I mean, (to say) that I’m horrified by it is pretty mild, but I guess the worst part of it is that I’m not surprised.”
Ernst and other Republicans have presented the changes to Medicaid as a means to stop waste, fraud and abuse in the system, and limit the public health coverage to people in need through restrictions like work requirements. At the Friday town hall, Ernst pointed to “illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits” and unemployed adults who do not have disabilities as the people being removed from Medicaid through the GOP tax and spending bill.
“What we do need to do is make sure that those that are part of a vulnerable population have access to Medicaid and receive those full benefits,” Ernst said. “So what we’re trying to do is strengthen Medicaid by directing the dollars to the people that actually meet the requirements of the program.”
Kearns said he doesn’t believe the people Ernst says are abusing the Medicaid system exist, though he does think there is major fraud and misuse of Medicaid funds happening through large health provider and insurance companies. The Medicaid cuts will not target entities or individuals actually abusing the system, Kearns said, but instead push people in need to drop out of the system by adding new barriers in getting coverage.
Kearns said he and his wife are “relatively savvy” through education and years of working in the Medicaid system — but that “every time one of those quarter-inch thick envelopes arrives from from the state, we’re like, ‘oh my God.'”
Receiving Medicaid is already an arduous process for the people it is intended to serve — and adding new requirements will only make getting care more difficult for these populations, he said.
“The idea that somebody that’s able-bodied and able to work would put themselves through the process to enroll in Medicaid, I think it’s laughable,” Kearns said. “… Folks that have disabilities or that have severe medical problems that necessitate them going into long-term care or whatever else — they need social workers to help marshal them through that system. This is not something that you know the general person off the street can do.”

Prevention is a key tool in fighting against domestic and sexual violence, Betsy Huggett, director of the Diane Peppler Resource Center in Sault Ste.

The center’s staff of 14  wear a lot of hats in order to maintain the shelter for survivors and their families and ensure individuals and their loved ones can exit dangerous living situations, Huggett said. She said she’s proud that the center has navigated many storms like keeping the majority of its staff on the payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic, but she wonders how much more the organization could do if it had more sustainable funding.

The Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA, the main federal funding program distributing states funds to provide services to victims of crimes such as child abuse, domestic and sexual assault, elder abuse and more has seen steep decreases nationwide in recent years.
Michigan saw a 42% chop in VOCA funding for victim services last year compared to the 2023 VOCA amount which is funded by fines and penalties from federal cases, with a large portion coming from the prosecution of white collar financial crime which has been on a years-long decline, expected to decline further under President Donald Trump.
Michigan, like most states, has taken on the cost burden of keeping domestic violence shelters and other resources open by supplementing the funds lost through use of the state budget. However, Michigan is still falling short as it struggles to maintain funding levels while the cost of services has shot up, Johanna Kononen, director of law and policy for the Michigan Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence, or MCEDSV, told the Advance. 
The 2024 fiscal year Michigan state budget allocated $30 million for victim services being provided by more than 100 organizations across the state. Now MCEDSV is seeking $75 million for organizations in the state budget through a campaign, “75 Saves Lives” to encourage lawmakers crafting the next budget to recognize the consequences for crime victims if organizations aren’t able to provide services.
When it comes to topics like domestic and sexual violence, which hold stigma and shame in conversations, there can be an illusion that those kinds of crimes happen to other people and don’t impact the lives of all Michiganders, Kononen said.
But nationwide estimates find that more than half of women and almost one in three men will experience sexual violence in their lifetime while domestic violence impacts 10 million Americans annually, including intimate partner violence and child abuse.
“Oftentimes, it’s easy to [say] ‘this hasn’t happened to me and so this isn’t impacting me. Why should we prioritize this as a state?’. But unfortunately, statistically speaking, if you don’t know someone who’s been impacted by domestic or sexual violence, it’s because they haven’t told you,” Kononen said.
Nobody wants to think about sexual violence, especially when it comes to children being the victims, Melissa Werkman, President of Children’s Advocacy Centers of Michigan said, but the reality is 1 in 7 children have experienced abuse or neglect in the last year in the U.S. which equals about 300,000 of Michigan’s kids.

VOCA dollars almost exclusively fund the frontline workers at Michigan’s 40 children’s advocacy centers, Werkman told the Advance, meaning the forensic interviewers for children who’ve experienced violence, victim advocates who guide families towards healing after abuse and medical professionals who offer care, all at low to no cost.
The goal of children’s advocacy centers is to respond to violence in a child’s life in a way that is geared towards them and their healing amidst systems that were not built for children, Werkman said. When talking to the public about the value of the centers, Werkman said a lot of people expect the centers to be shrouded in discomfort, sadness and confusion, but the truth is this work helps kids get back to being kids.
“The kids are excited to come to their therapy appointments. They walk right in and they know the intake coordinator and they’re excited to see the therapy dog. That is what we give kids back. We most importantly beyond the justice aspect of it, beyond the advocacy aspect and therapy aspect, we give kids their agency back,” Werkman said.
Without VOCA, there are no children’s advocacy centers, Werkman said, because as much as 85% of a center’s budget can come from those federal funds. Given the decline in funding, children’s advocacy centers in Michigan on average are operating on a funding gap of over $100,000 and smaller rural centers providing care to multiple counties where resources are strained are most at risk of closing their doors.
Having to stop funding a counselor or close down a shelter is a terrible decision for a victim organization to face, but it’s especially ominous for tribal communities where some programs for an area have only one victim advocate and there is only one tribal domestic and sexual violence shelter in the state, Stacey Ettawageshik, executive director of Uniting Three Fires Against Violence said to the Advance.
Uniting Three Fires Against Violence, a tribal victim advocacy group providing training and advocacy for the 12 tribal programs in Michigan providing domestic and sexual violence care, has done a lot of work to get tribal issues a voice in Lansing, Ettawageshik said. For a demographic of people who experience violence at a drastically disproportionate rate than their white counterparts, Ettawageshik said tribal groups have worked 10 times as hard as other violence programs to get their portion of funding.
There’s a historic lack of trust in non-tribal organizations claiming to help Native Americans, an example being Indian residential schools in Michigan which stole hundreds of Anishinaabe children from their homes and subjected them to years of abuse and culture erasure, Ettawageshik said.

Tribal programs come from a trauma-formed approach that includes historical knowledge of how violence has impacted Michiganders from tribal communities and can administer culturally honoring services and sacred medicines like sage, cedar, sweet grass and tobacco, Ettawageshik said.
“We’ve come so far [with] tribal programs getting access to these resources in the first place that it will just be taken away in a heartbeat and where does that leave us?,”  Ettawageshik said. “That leaves us back at square one… losing that funding. Losing that support is going to make a huge impact on our communities that already experience higher levels of substance use, homelessness, increased violence and that violence is really committed most of the time by non-natives.”
While President Donald Trump’s administration has placed a strong focus on cutting what it labels as erroneous federal spending and usage of taxpayer dollars for programs not aligning with the administration’s values, Kononen said it’s imperative for residents and policymakers to understand that VOCA is funded through criminals having to pay for their crimes.

“I think it’s very easy for people to see what’s happening in the federal government and think that that’s something that’s happening really far away… that doesn’t have anything to do with me here in my town in Michigan and the services that my community needs,” Kononen said. “It’s a tricky topic to broach with people, and it makes it seem kind of academic like this is a line item in the budget when these are real people who are getting life-saving help.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DSC_0849-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 18:05:57.083779

(Lori M. Nichols for New Jersey Monitor)The Senate on Monday joined the Assembly in concurring with Gov. Phil Murphy’s conditional veto of a bill that would create new criminal charges to deter disruptive pop-up parties that have harried some New Jersey towns in recent years, and the bill became law after Murphy signed it Monday afternoon.
The new law will allow authorities to charge those who provoke or attempt to provoke at least four others into disorderly conduct with inciting a public brawl or who conceal their identities to instill fear or frustrate authorities’ attempts to apprehend or prosecute them.
“This law makes it clear that if you incite a public brawl, you will be held accountable. We need to give law enforcement the tools to stop this kind of chaos before someone gets seriously hurt, or worse,” said bill sponsor Assemblyman Dan Hutchison (D-Gloucester).
Those who wear masks or disguises for medical, demonstrative, or religious reasons will not be subject to prosecution for concealing their identities.
The new law is a legislative response to pop-up parties and other large, unruly gatherings of young people that have spurred violence and chaos in some New Jersey communities in recent years. A push in favor of the law rose after Memorial Day weekend, when authorities in Seaside Heights said gangs of young people created havoc on the boardwalk.
In May, a brawl at the Menlo Park Mall broke out among 300 young people, forcing seven arrests and leaving one officer injured as locals called police from neighboring towns to bring the fracas under control, authorities said.
Later last month, officials were forced to shutter a carnival outside the Woodbridge Center after hundreds of teens responded to a social media post about the event. Authorities said they made no arrests at the scene to avoid an escalation.
“This bill is meant to make such incidents less frequent and to give our public safety officers more training and resources to help bring these situations under control,” said bill sponsor Sen. Paul Moriarty (D-Gloucester).
Murphy conditionally vetoed the bipartisan bill in early May over First Amendment concerns. The earlier version would have criminalized engaging or promoting others to engage in disorderly conduct and lacked exemptions for medical and other mask-wearing.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/081123-NJM-OC-LMN25160-1024x695.jpg,,,2025-06-02 18:05:57.083779

(Screenshot from City of Boulder livestream)The man suspected of attacking a group of demonstrators with incendiary devices in Boulder on Sunday, leaving multiple people hospitalized with severe injuries, faces state and federal charges for attempted murder and a hate crime, law enforcement officials announced.
Officials said the total number of victims in the attack had risen to 12, at least some of whom were participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. They suffered burns from Molotov cocktails and what FBI officials described as a “makeshift flamethrower.”
At least two victims remained hospitalized as of Monday afternoon, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohammed Sabry Soliman, was arrested by Boulder police and later told investigators that he targeted what he called a “Zionist group” after learning about it through an online search, according to an FBI affidavit filed Monday. Officials previously reported that Soliman, a Colorado Springs resident, was heard to shout “Free Palestine” during the attack.
“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the FBI wrote of the suspect’s interview after his arrest. “He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year.”
A criminal complaint filed in federal court charges Soliman with one count of “a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.”
“No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”
At a press conference later Monday, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said his office had charged the suspect with 16 counts of attempted murder in the first degree, two counts of the use of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device. A judge has set a $10 million cash bond on the state charges. Soliman made a brief appearance in Boulder County court on Monday afternoon, and is scheduled to return for a formal filing of charges on Thursday.
“Our office and the U.S. Attorney’s Office will be working closely together and in coordination with one another to ensure that the defendant is held fully accountable,” Dougherty said.
Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said Monday that Soliman was in the U.S. unlawfully, having entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023. An Egyptian national, he filed an asylum claim in September 2022, McLaughlin said.
J. Bishop Grewell, the acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, said additional federal charges could be forthcoming. In a press release Monday, the Department of Justice called the incident an “anti-Semitic terrorist attack.”
“We’ve moved to charge quickly, to send the message to the community that no acts of anti-Semitism are going to be tolerated,” Grewell told reporters. “Just because there’s only one charge that has been made so far doesn’t mean that we’re not considering other charges that could come in the future.”
FBI agents worked through the night to gather evidence at the scene and execute a search warrant at the suspect’s Colorado Springs residence, said Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office. The suspect was not previously known to the FBI’s local Joint Terrorism Task Force, Michalek said.
“While at this time it appears the perpetrator acted alone, we do continue to investigate all possibilities and pursue all investigative leads,” he added.
All evacuations and closures in downtown Boulder had been lifted as of early Monday morning, Redfearn said.
“This morning, I walked down Pearl Street with members of my team. I interacted with a lot of business owners community out there, and the way I felt leaving there was I was heartened,” said Redfearn. “I was heartened by the resilience of our community. … Once again, as a community, we’re going to recover after coming together.”

(Screenshot from campaign video by Friends of Dan McKee)A political consultant facing criminal charges for falsifying signatures on Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos’ campaign papers during the 2023 congressional special election changed her plea to no contest, avoiding potential prison time, as first reported by WPRI-TV 12.
Holly McClaren originally pleaded not guilty in May 2024 following a sealed grand jury indictment charging her with two felony counts of violating nomination papers and two misdemeanor counts of giving false documents to an agent, employee or public official. She appeared in Providence County Superior Court Monday, and was sentenced to three years of unsupervised probation, according to news reports.
Court records of the plea and judge’s sentencing were not immediately available Monday.
John Grasso, McClaren’s attorney, did not return calls for comment Monday.
McClaren’s company, Harmony Solutions, was hired by Matos’ campaign during her 2023 primary run for the 1st Congressional District seat. Once considered a frontrunner in the 11-way primary for the open congressional seat, Matos ultimately finished fourth, dogged for much of her campaign in the accusations of signature fraud. 
Yet Matos maintained her innocence even as the state opened a criminal investigation into her campaign after local election administrators in three separate municipalities flagged nomination papers on the grounds of suspected signature fraud, including of dead residents.
McClaren was one of two people charged in the signature scandal, along with another campaign worker, Christopher Cotham.
Cotham also pleaded not guilty to the same four changes as McClaren. His case remains pending in Providence County Superior Court, according to the public court docket, with a pre-trial conference scheduled for June 25.
Matos in a statement Monday said the conviction has cleared her name.
“I have supported this investigation at every step in the hopes that the truth would come to light,” Matos said. “With this case settled, the facts are clear: Holly McClaren committed a serious crime that undermined the sanctity of our state’s free and fair elections. I’m grateful to the law enforcement officers who handled this investigation thoroughly and professionally and whose work ultimately led to today’s results.”

(Photo contributed by Aaron Lehman)Farmers in Iowa had a productive week as warmer and drier conditions allowed plenty of time for in-the-field activities, including finishing up planting and beginning to spray emerged corn and soybeans. 
Nearly 80% of soybeans have emerged across the state, which is 10 days ahead of last year’s crop and four days ahead of average pace. Corn acres across the state are 87% emerged, putting the crop nearly a week ahead of last year and one day ahead of the five-year average. 
Organic farmers like Aaron Lehman, who farms in northern Polk County, had a slightly slower start to the planting season than conventional neighbors. 
On Friday, Lehman said he hoped to finish planting his soybeans and to replant the sections of corn that “didn’t emerge very evenly” due to an above-average dump of rain that hit central Iowa during the previous reporting period.

He said with organic farming, and a need to use seeds without synthetic coatings, he has to wait for warmer soil temperatures before he can plant and roll down his cover crops. 
“So I’m on a little bit of a different calendar than some of my neighbors, but in general, field progress is pretty strong,” Lehman, who is also president of Iowa Farmers Union, said. 
Across the state, corn and soybean conditions rated 84% and 81%, respectively, good to excellent. 
Lehman said farmers in his area were concerned the rain would lead to some overripe hay, but the Monday report shows 83% of hay rated good or excellent. 
Temperatures across the state were slightly below normal, with an average of 62 degrees Fahrenheit during the May 26 through June 1 reporting period. 
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, smoke from the Canadian wildfires reduced solar radiation in the state, and caused a copper colored sun on several days. 
The lingering wildfire haze is expected to clear from the state by midweek. State forecasts call for several inches of precipitation across the state. 
The state average for precipitation during the reporting period was two-tenths of an inch, but soil moisture conditions dropped only slightly from the previous report, with 70% of topsoil conditions and 65% of subsoil conditions rated adequate.

Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Public Information Services.Senate Taxes Chair Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, didn’t need much time to shoot down the “skinny,” 12-page tax bill proposed by Minnesota legislative leaders as they rush to button-up a two-year budget deal, without which the state shuts down at the end of the month.
“I rejected it right off the bat,” Rest said in an interview Monday. “As soon as I saw it, I told them I couldn’t vote for that and neither could half a dozen other Senate Democrats.”
The text of the bill was posted on Sunday, but Rest said it’s been obsolete since Friday morning when she expressed her opposition and asked that they continue working toward a deal.
Rest’s rejection raises the prospect of a two-year budget agreement without a tax bill, which isn’t necessary for ongoing government operations but would leave a bevy of lawmakers and interest groups fuming, their hopes for special tax treatments foiled.
The 12-page document largely maintains the status quo with a couple notable exceptions agreed to weeks ago: increasing the sales tax on cannabis 50% and repealing the electricity tax exemption for power-hungry data centers.
Those will still be in any final package, Rest said, but the “skinny” bill leaves out noncontroversial but nevertheless important policies.
For instance, more than a dozen cities are awaiting approval for local tax increment financing districts aimed at spurring development.
The skinny bill also leaves out continuing tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel, which has bipartisan support but was was absent from the leadership agreement signed off by Gov. Tim Walz, Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, and Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul.
Republican co-chair of the House Taxes Committee Greg Davids of Preston also unequivocally rejected the proposal in an interview with MPR News.
“We put five months of thought into something they put five minutes of thought into, and I know which one’s going to be better,” Davids said. “I’m just not sure why any Republican would even consider voting for this. I don’t think it would pass (the) House or the Senate.”
While the taxes working group was meeting in public, negotiations have moved behind closed doors and will likely remain so until a deal is reached, Rest said.
Building trade unions and business groups are banking on lawmakers extending sales tax exemptions for data centers on equipment purchases even as they sunset exemptions on electricity. They hope by extending the equipment sales tax exemption into the next century, the state will entice Meta, Amazon and other tech giants to build data centers in Minnesota.
The tax incentives are particularly important to the construction unions after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a public infrastructure package for the second year in a row. Building one large data center can cost upwards of $1 billion — more than an entire public infrastructure package — and create upwards of 1,800 construction jobs, according to a study of Wisconsin.
Opponents argue that tech giants will build data centers in Minnesota regardless of the tax incentives leaving regular taxpayers to subsidize some of the richest companies in the world at the expense of investing in schools, nursing homes and infrastructure.
The state expects to bring in an additional $56 million in tax revenue over the next two years by repealing the electricity exemption. The state will still exempt data centers from sales tax on equipment and software through 2042, which is expected to cost more than $200 million in forgone sales tax revenue over the next two years.
Amazon recently announced that it’s suspending plans for a large data center in Becker “due to uncertainty” — one week after lawmakers announced they were eliminating the sales tax exemption on electricity.
Lawmakers have also agreed to raise the tax on retail cannabis sales from 10% to 15%, pushing the total sales tax above 20% across the state when local and state sales taxes are added.
The tax hike would land before the state has even issued any cannabis sales licenses, although it has been collecting taxes on THC beverages and low dose edibles. Just one dispensary would be subject to the tax increase: The White Earth Nation opened its first off-reservation store in Moorhead last month after negotiating a compact with state leaders through a process exclusive to tribes.
State lawmakers voted to legalize cannabis in 2023 with a relatively low sales tax compared to other states, arguing that a higher tax would allow the black market to survive, and that cannabis sales should not generate funding for unrelated budget items.
The 15% rate would push Minnesota toward the higher end of taxes compared to the 23 states with legal cannabis sales, according to the Tax Foundation.
The bill would also repeal a law that sends a fifth of cannabis tax revenue to cities and counties to fund local enforcement costs.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GrE9lzpWQAAKeSW-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 18:05:57.083779

Bill Lee’s family, joined Amazon, FedEx, Nissan, Hankook Tire, 84 Lumber, AT&T and utilities such as Atmos Energy and Alabama Power in netting franchise and excise tax rebates of more than $10,000 each created by a 2024 state law. Memphis-based FedEx, with 13 subsidiaries, landed the maximum rebate for each one, and Japanese-owned Nissan filed for six subsidiaries that each received the rebate.
A governor’s spokesperson did not respond to questions Monday, but his office consistently says he put his interest in Lee Company into a blind trust during his governorship, though he could benefit when he leaves the post late in 2026.
Other notable companies among the 16,000 receiving the state’s maximum break in its business property tax include Bridgestone, Ingram Partners, Aegis Sciences, Ajax Turner, Ascension Care, BNSF Railway Co., Carhartt Inc., Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen, Coca-Cola Bottling, Denso Manufacturing, Elvis Presley Enterprises, Gannett Co., Frito-Lay Inc., Pilot and Pilot Travel Centers and Brown-Forman, the owner of Jack Daniel’s. 
Popular Nashville spots such as Frothy Monkey, Jeff Ruby’s, Von Elrod’s and Bourbon Street Blues & Boogie Bar took the rebate as well.
In all, about 60,000 companies received three-year refunds ranging from less than $750 to between $750 and $10,000.

The estimated $1.5 billion in refunds and tax cuts, a large number of them made to out-of-state companies, appears to be having an immediate impact on the state budget. Tennessee’s business tax collections on property and earnings are $335 million short of projections through the first four months of the year — 11% off the mark — according to the Department of Finance and Administration. The tax cut amounts to more than $400 million annually.
Tennessee lawmakers approved the refunds and franchise tax break in 2024 when Department of Revenue officials said the state faced legal threats over its business taxes.
Despite the shortfall, Republican Lt. Gov. Randy McNally said in a Monday statement: “I believe now, as I did at the time, that the rebates were the most responsible course due to the strong probability that the state would be in a worse fiscal position after impending litigation. Based on the advice of the attorney general, we were simply not willing to take that kind of risk with Tennessee’s financial future on the line and I stand by that decision.”
Other lawmakers such as House Majority Leader William Lamberth, a Portland Republican, said last year they supported Gov. Bill Lee’s legislation because it was good policy, not because of legal threats. Some 80 companies reportedly sent letters to the state requesting rebates.
“Conservative budgeting and fiscal responsibility over the past decade have placed our state in a strong financial position,” Lamberth said in a statement Monday. “The significant tax cut we approved last year reinvested dollars right back into the businesses, communities and workers that fuel the Volunteer State’s economy.”
The state’s lists, which will be on the Department of Revenue website for only 30 days, don’t detail the exact amount of rebates, but the largest amount could run from $10,000 to $75,000. 
State Sen. Heidi Campbell, a Nashville Democrat, blasted the move as a “corporate tax refund scheme” and encouraged people to check the list to see which companies are benefiting. Campbell said lawmakers approved the measure without a lawsuit or court ruling,
Tennessee’s largest companies secure sales tax exemptions for everything from jet fuel to water

“Just a letter from corporate attorneys and a political class eager to please.” Campbell added the state is dealing with its biggest budget deficit of the year as a result.
The legislature refused to take action this year on grocery sales tax reductions, one sponsored by Democrats accompanied by an effort to go after offshore accounts used to hide income and one backed by Republicans that offered no way to offset the revenue loss.
“This is the real cost of trickle-down economics: corporate handouts while working families get left behind. It’s fiscally irresponsible and morally indefensible,” Campbell said.
The advocacy group Tennessee For All, which supports elimination of the grocery tax, criticized the state’s refunds, saying companies are exploiting the program. 
“Instead of closing loopholes so families can get a break on groceries, the majority of legislators chose more corporate giveaways,” said Angela Wynn, a Rutherford County parent and member of Public School Strong, a partner in the Tennessee For All coalition.
The group pointed toward reports by two Democratic lawmakers using state information from 2022 and 2025 that show more than 60% of corporations operating in Tennessee pay nothing in excise taxes on income.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)New Mexico’s two U.S. senators are calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to fix rather than abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as she and other prominent officials have called for recently.
Democratic U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján wrote Noem a letter Monday outlining problems FEMA could fix, particularly regarding its response to wildfires and their aftermath, but also defending the agency as necessary to help people recover from disasters.
“We want to emphasize that serious, targeted reform is the answer to these pressing problems – not dismantling FEMA altogether,” the senators wrote. “The federal government has an important role to play in assisting state and local governments in the wake of natural disasters.”
Noem previously said she was devising ways to eliminate FEMA. She has backed off that language, though her department has cut billions of dollars in disaster resilience grants, including a $4 million allocation to New Mexico. 
The letter notes that states and local governments don’t have adequate money to pay for increasingly expensive disasters. In New Mexico, for example, a FEMA formula calculates the state can withstand only about $4 million in disaster costs before it needs the federal government to step in. 
Proposed cuts to FEMA could hurt disaster-prone New Mexico

When it comes to reforming the agency, the senators’ letter points repeatedly to the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire near Las Vegas, the biggest fire in state history. Since the fire, every rainstorm threatens to become a flash flood or debris flow that causes further damage. FEMA is not well-equipped to handle those kinds of scenarios, the senators wrote. 
“Western states face a distinct and growing threat: namely, catastrophic wildfires followed by cascading disasters such as landslides, flooding, and water system failures that compound damage and slow recovery,” the senators wrote. “These cascading events—which can happen years after an initial fire—are devastating, and FEMA has repeatedly struggled to respond effectively.”
The post-fire flooding in Las Vegas has continued each year since 2022, particularly in the summer monsoon season, after the fire destroyed vegetation and degraded the soil. The flooding has prompted the city to postpone the construction of a new water treatment plant, and caused the cancellation of Fiestas last summer, which is the single biggest annual event in Las Vegas. 
“As a result of these floods, the business community lost out on their largest income-generating event of the year,” the senators wrote. 
FEMA needs to improve its handling of “cascading events,” allowing disaster grant recipients to rebuild infrastructure equipped to handle future disasters, not just to their pre-disaster capacity. At the moment, FEMA’s Public Assistance program will only fully reimburse local governments and other public entities for the cost of rebuilding infrastructure such as bridges and culverts to the same size and specifications as they were before the wildfire. 
The federal government accidentally burned down their houses, then made it hard to come home

“While we understand the intent behind these rules—to restore essential infrastructure equitably—they do not adequately address the unique and escalating risks associated with post-wildfire environments,” they wrote. 
FEMA should also increase its disaster assistance to individuals and families, the senators wrote. During the 2022 wildfire, the maximum people could receive from FEMA, even if they lost their primary residence and all it contained, was about $37,000. 
The senators asked the agency to increase the payments, especially in light of challenges people in fire-prone areas face securing insurance. FEMA typically does not pay disaster victims if they have private insurance, but home insurance is becoming prohibitively expensive or is completely unavailable in areas like Mora and Ruidoso after wildfires there last summer. 
“FEMA must adapt its policies and funding levels and work with other federal agencies to meet the needs of those who fall into this widening gap and ensure that recovery is possible for those who, through no fault of their own, can’t obtain insurance,” Heinrich and Luján wrote.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_2094-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 18:05:57.083779

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Creating a public medical school at the University of Rhode Island (URI) could cost the state approximately $225 million over 10 years, but a consultant draft report suggests it may very well be worth the time and effort if it helps soothe the state’s primary care shortage.
“You don’t need all this money tomorrow, but you’ll need a good $20 million right away,” Paul Umbach, founder and president of Tripp Umbach told a special legislative commission Friday afternoon at the Rhode Island State House.
Umbach told the 21-member panel appointed last year by late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio that the hypothetical school could partially relieve the physician workforce shortage problem in the Ocean State, which has one only one private medical school at Brown University. 
Rhode Island now has a shortage of approximately 300 primary care physicians statewide, as previously reported by Rhode Island Current and cited in the Tripp Umbach draft report. In 2023, there were just under 4,200 physicians in Rhode Island, and only 327 of them were in family medicine or general practice, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Per the firm’s analysis, a URI medical school could accept about 100 students a year and, if the funding falls into place, possibly graduate its first students within a decade or so.
Tuition could cost about $50,000, which the firm said is comparable to other public medical schools. But tuition wouldn’t cover all expenses — hence the need for an annual infusion of about $20 million to $25 million in state money.  
“This funding must be supplemented by clinical revenue generated through partnerships with health systems, as well as ongoing philanthropic contributions to support scholarships, faculty development, and programmatic innovation,” the report reads.
New construction can wait
Umbach told the commission his firm has helped 20 medical schools get started. He outlined the phases of financing, from initial investments to hire leadership, get accredited, and make any necessary retrofitments to existing facilities. A dedicated building wouldn’t be a must-have at first, 
“You’ll be able to use existing facilities for a time to sit your first class,” Umbach said. 
But after four or five years, a new facility would likely be required, and consume about $120 million to $125 million — a cost that used to be around $50 million to $70 million around a decade ago, Umbach said.
Still, Umbach thought that URI’s has an advantage in its existing programs in pharmacy, nursing, and public health, each of which could be integrated into a new potential medical school. The report states that medical students would be able to “train alongside future nurses, pharmacists, and allied health professionals in team-based care environments that reflect real-world clinical settings.” Additionally, URI has research facilities and lab space that could be repurposed for medical education.
“You already have a strong network,” Umbach told the panel.

Despite recent federal challenges to National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding, Umbach cautioned against a shortsighted or pessimistic read of possible funding challenges. He said research based on clinical outcomes, like the kind that might take place at a medical school, “seems to be in a much better place” than more traditional biomedical research in large lab settings. 
Sen. Pam Lauria, a Barrington Democrat and the commission co-chair alongside URI President Marc Parlange, asked Umbach to expand on the school’s economic benefits.
“Let’s look at it like a rock hitting the pond,” Umbach said. “You’re building a medical school, and it’s going to have a budget of $60 (million), $70, million when it’s at maturity, and that’s going to help the economy.”
Data in the report shows existing medical schools typically generate around $150 million in economic impact and create 1,000 jobs directly and indirectly. Doctors trained at public medical schools who continue to practice locally can create $2.2 million in economic impact and subsidize 15 jobs directly and indirectly, according to the report.
But before the school can generate income or even be built, Umbach said the school needs to find a dean. The accreditation process for medical schools is tightly controlled by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), Umbach said. 
“They won’t talk to consultants. They’ll allow the president to talk if they want, but it’s really the founding dean,” Umbach said. “So your number one thing you have to do in the MD model is find the founding dean.”
After a dean is picked, the school must hire additional faculty and administrators, many of whom must be MDs or PhDs. 
“So, super expensive,” Umbach said. 
But fledgling schools can bulk up their coffers by having their new faculty practice medicine. That’s what happened at the recently accredited MD program at Roseman University in Nevada, Umbach said, where the founding dean built a self-sustaining clinical practice while the school developed toward accredited status.
“Faculty can also see patients and make money. Deans can even see patients and make money,” Umbach said.
The state’s small size, Umbach told the panel, is why the medical school needs to be envisioned as a statewide initiative, not a siloed endeavor on the URI campus. That would mean partnerships with local health systems and clinics not only to help students learn and succeed, but to firmly plant the school within the state’s wider economic context.
“If you think about this as URI’s medical school, that’s a dangerous way to think about it,” Umbach said. “Although it will be URI’s medical school — structurally, technically and in many practical ways —  it won’t work unless it’s a statewide medical school.”
To that end, the report recommends that URI “secure partnerships with a broad array of health care providers throughout Rhode Island” and work with community hospitals and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), like Thundermist Health Center in Woonsocket, to better acquaint aspiring doctors with community medicine and the needs of rural populations — something students lack when they “only see the inside of a large academic medical center, and you don’t ever leave,” Umbach said, underlining his recommendation for a community-based model.
Umbach’s firm carried out the $150,000 feasibility study for the special commission, which was created in June 2024 via a resolution from Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat. Former Senate President Ruggerio selected the panel’s 21 members in July 2024. The special commission, per the statute that created it, has until Dec. 20 to make its recommendations on a possible medical school.
 


				   A timeline and wishlist for a potential URI medical school  

The Tripp Umbach draft report outlines the decade’s worth of work ahead if the state wants to build a medical school at URI. The rough timeline as given in the report is as follows:

Years 1–2: Planning phase, including community outreach and laying groundwork for accreditation
Year 3: Apply for accreditation, and hire founding dean and leadership team
Year 4: Secure preliminary accreditation and begin recruiting students
Year 5: Enroll first class of medical students
Year 9 and beyond: First cohort graduates


It also suggests the following investments, totaling $225 million, over that 10-year period, including:

$20 million in seed funding from the community and university foundations
$40 million from a “lead” or private donor
$30 million in start-up money from the state
$25 million in annual state support
$50 million to “Seek initial legislative appropriation for feasibility and design”
$60 million in matching funds from private donors or fiscal commitments from health systems

(Courtesy of John Williams/MOFGA)The Maine Senate supported a measure to guarantee agricultural workers state minimum wage. 
On Monday, the upper chamber voted 22-12 with a couple Republicans joining the majority party in the initial passage of LD 589. The legislation will next go to the House of Representatives for an initial vote and will need enactment votes from both chambers before it could be sent to Gov. Janet Mills for approval. 
Granting minimum wage to farmworkers has been a years-long effort in Maine. Last year, Mills put forward a proposal that she ended up vetoing after the Labor Committee made changes to the bill. The bill this year mirrors the proposal Mills proposed last session. 
“With this legislation, we send a clear message, Madam President, to those who harvest our food, nourish our families and sustain our communities,” said Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland). “We say today: ‘Your work matters, your dignity is recognized, your contributions are invaluable and the state of Maine will no longer tolerate a system built on exclusion and inequity.’”
Talbot Ross, who sponsored the bill, also described the legislation as a way to “turn the page on a painful history,” referring to the historic exclusion of agricultural workers from labor rights. Later in the discussion, Talbot Ross clarified that she was not calling any individuals “racist” or “second-class,” but referring to a pattern of discrimination throughout history that excluded Black and brown workers from certain labor protections. 
The version of the bill supported by the Senate is pared back from the original proposal that also included overtime protections and a phased in overtime wage. Those were removed during the committee process. 
Multiple Republicans who spoke in opposition to the bill emphasized the importance of piecework for some farms in the state, such as the blueberry industry, which pay people based on how much they pick. 
Sen. Scott Cyrway (R-Kennebec) said that system encourages people to take pride in their work, while Sen. Joseph Martin (R-Oxford) said, “piecework is not evil.” Both voted against the legislation.
However, Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot), who co-chairs the Labor Committee, clarified that the bill does not prohibit piecework. 
The other issue raised on the floor stems from broader concerns about automatically updating the state’s minimum wage with inflation, as is already the case in state law. 
Though he said he was “reluctantly” voting in favor of the bill, Sen. Dick Bradstreet (R-Kennebec) reminded his colleagues that he believes automatic increases to the state minimum wage are hurting the economy. However, he noted that LD 589 doesn’t pertain to such cost-of-living increases. 
Bradstreet said there were components in the original draft of the bill that he did not support, but he backed the amended version because members of the agriculture industry expressed their approval to the committee. 
Tipping also noted during floor discussion that many agricultural employers in the state told the committee they already pay more than the state’s minimum wage of $14.65 an hour.

Hobgood-Wilkes said in a statement to Mississippi Today that she was removed as chairwoman over her advocacy for reforming pharmacy benefit manager practices in the state, a topic hotly debated by lawmakers earlier this year during their regular session. 
The Pearl River County lawmaker said the speaker’s decision to remove her as leader of the committee was “deeply hurtful,” because it wasn’t because of her objective performance as a legislator, but rather because she continued to speak up for her beliefs.
“I fought to lower drug costs for Mississippians and to support our independent pharmacists against the powerful PBMs working to drive them out of business,” Hobgood-Wilkes said. “I didn’t run for office to build my ego or pad my pocketbook. I ran because I love Pearl River County, and I love Mississippi.”
White, a Republican from West, did not respond to a request for comment. He replaced Hobgood-Wilkes as leader of the committee with Rep. Beth Luther Waldo, a freshman Republican from Pontotoc. 
Both chambers of the Legislature, earlier this year, introduced plans that sought to protect patients and independent pharmacists, who have warned that if legislators do not pass a law to regulate PBMs, which serve as middlemen in the pharmaceutical industry, some local pharmacies may be forced to close. They say that the companies’ low payments and unfair business practices have left them struggling to break even.
House Bill 1123, authored by the speaker, originally focused on the transparency aspect of PBMs. The Senate then beefed up the bill by adding provisions barring the companies from steering patients to affiliate pharmacies and prohibiting spread pricing – the practice of paying insurers more for drugs than pharmacists. 
Independent pharmacists, who flocked to the Capitol to advocate for reform during the session, widely supported the Senate’s version of the bill. Hobgood-Wilkes also continued to speak out in favor of stronger PBM legislation, even though White and other House leaders urged for a more middle-of-the-road approach.
Despite the legislative wrangling, a Democratic lawmaker defeated the bill by challenging it for violating procedural rules. 
It’s rare for a speaker or lieutenant governor to remove a legislator as a committee chair in the middle of a four-year term, unless there’s a vacancy or questionable behavior by the lawmaker. It’s even more notable that White, only halfway through his first term as speaker, appears to be punishing a fellow Republican over policy beliefs instead of conduct.
Another notable time a speaker relegated a House member to the sidelines was when former House Speaker Philip Gunn in 2019 appointed Rep. Doug McLeod, a Republican from Lucedale, to only one committee after he was arrested on charges of domestic violence. The former South Mississippi lawmaker was found not guilty of the charges.
White has also tweaked committee assignments for around a dozen Republicans and two Democrats, according to Rep. Robert Johnson III, the House Democratic leader from Natchez. 
White changed the committee assignments for Johnson and Rep. Daryl Porter, a Democrat from Summit. The two Democrats said they believed changing the committee makeup was to account for two new House members who were recently sworn into office and not a punishment from the leadership.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/02150256/hobgood-wilkes.jpg,,,2025-06-02 18:05:57.083779

krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images)An Iowa man who says he has no stable access to food is suing the state, alleging it has unfairly denied him access to food assistance based on a criminal conviction later voided by the courts.
Charles Hasselmann, 32, of Ankeny alleges that in 2023, he applied for food assistance while residing in a correctional facility as a result of a probation-revocation order that was premised on a finding of him being a habitual offender.
The sentence was later vacated by a district court judge, Hasselmann claims, with the judge finding the habitual-offender enhancement to his sentence on a theft conviction lacked sufficient factual basis. Because of that finding, the court also set aside the related order that revoked his probation, Hasselmann claims.

Court records indicate the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services later disqualified Hasselmann from receiving food assistance through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, for at least 12 months. It also demanded restitution for overpayment, citing “stolen” funds that Hasselmann says are due to others’ unauthorized use of his benefits card.
In his lawsuit against DHHS, Hasselmann is seeking an injunction that would award him SNAP benefits and halt any further efforts at collections for the alleged overpayments.
In his petition, Hasselmann claims he was recently released from more than two years of incarceration and now has no reliable access to food or income. The public interest, he argues, strongly favors his access to “basic nutritional support.”
The state has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, but in a related court case attorneys for the state argued that while a judge did find there was insufficient factual basis to impose the habitual-offender sentence enhancement on the conviction for theft, the court did not disturb the underlying conviction for theft.
The state’s lawyers say that under a plea deal that was later reached, Hasselmann had agreed to a prison term of no more than five years on the theft charge. The court then set aside the earlier probation violation order, the state alleges, not because it represented “an illegal sentence,” but because, through the subsequent plea deal, a five-year prison sentence had been agreed to and imposed.
Court records indicate that since 2012, Hasselmann has been charged with numerous felony and misdemeanor offenses, resulting in seven convictions for theft, five convictions for driving while barred, five convictions for forgery, two convictions for assault and two convictions for drunken driving.

When Courtney Leader gets the letter from the state each year telling her it’s time to recertify her daughter’s Medicaid eligibility, she scrambles to make sure the paperwork gets to the right place. 
Leader, of Ash Grove, considers herself adept at navigating her 8-year-old daughter’s complex medical needs and appointments, but even she has fallen through the cracks of Missouri’s safety net thanks to the state’s red tape.
Without Medicaid for her daughter, who has complex medical needs and developmental disabilities, Leader’s family wouldn’t be able to afford the thousands of dollars in monthly costs for her feeding tube and formula, specialty appointments and at-home nurses.
Yet despite Leader’s diligence, her daughter was once kicked off Medicaid after the state lost her paperwork. Even when the paperwork makes it through, she says it takes days to confirm.
She has waited hours on the phone for help, just to be automatically disconnected, and has refreshed the online chat again and again trying to get answers — knowing any delay could cost her daughter coverage.
Now, as Congress proposes changes to Medicaid that promise to add even more bureaucratic hurdles for families like hers, Leader worries about what’s in store for her daughter’s health care coverage.  
“I’m terrified that further red tape throughout the system will disrupt my daughter’s care and put her health in jeopardy,” she said…Medicaid is a lifesaver, but I’ve seen the challenges of an overburdened system firsthand, and felt the panic when my paperwork was lost.” 
‘Perfect storm’: Missouri advocates decry Medicaid application delays, coverage losses

Leader spoke on Monday alongside the leaders of several advocacy organizations gathered at the Missouri Capitol to sound the alarm on the potential ramifications of Congress’ planned changes to Medicaid. 
The federal reconciliation bill aims to extend President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, in part by cutting at least $600 billion nationally from Medicaid over a decade.
Proposed Medicaid changes include work requirements estimated to potentially kick over 100,000 people off in Missouri — many of whom would be still eligible but could lose coverage anyway due to procedural issues. Co-pays would be added for some patients, eligibility checks would increase to twice a year and thousands of adults would need to confirm their work status each month.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would also face enormous cuts under the proposed budget, potentially cutting thousands of recipients in the state.
Missouri would be in an especially vulnerable spot, advocates said, because the state Department of Social Services has struggled for years to administer safety net programs. 
The Family Support Division, which oversees benefits administration for the state, is understaffed. The agency’s request to fund 220 new staff this year was not granted by the legislature. And failures in the administration of Medicaid and food assistance programs have earned rebukes from the federal government and possible sanctions from a St. Louis judge. 
Emily Kalmer, Missouri government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said the Department of Social Services’ struggles to administer these programs could be exacerbated by the proposed federal changes to Medicaid and SNAP. 
“With all the challenges they already have, and then this timeframe,” she said, referring the Family Support Division and the proposed implementation of work requirements at the end of 2026, “…we’re just going to have a lot of things happening at the same time, and how the legislature decides they want to use their limited budget to deal with that — it’s going to be kind of the perfect storm.”
One in five Missourians is on Medicaid, or over 1.2 million people. Missouri’s Medicaid program covers 39% of all children in the state and pays for two-thirds of nursing home care.
A single person has to make under $20,814 annually to qualify for Medicaid. 
At various points in recent years, the state has had the worst, or among the worst in the nation processing times for Medicaid applications, prompting federal scrutiny last year. 
Missouri is also being sued over its administration of SNAP, with a judge concluding the state violated federal SNAP law and the Americans with Disabilities Act for the way it runs its call center eligibility interviews. 
The average wait time for the general call line, which includes Medicaid queries, was just over one hour in March, It was 49 minutes for the line specific to SNAP interviews. 
‘Broken system’: Call center backlogs impede Missouri families seeking food assistance

Thousands of callers are automatically disconnected before getting through to a person: Over 50,000 calls were automatically ended for the SNAP interview call line in March and nearly 16,000 for the general call line.
The work requirements being considered by Congress mandate 80 hours of work per month, or various exemptions, including for caregivers and those with disabilities.
Most adults on Medicaid are already working or would qualify for an exemption. But in the states that have tried work requirements, including Arkansas, thousands lost coverage even though they were eligible. It’s estimated that over 100,000 Missourians could lose coverage due to work requirements.
Kalmer shared the story of one cancer patient who struggled to get on Medicaid because of the state’s hurdles, but wouldn’t have gotten on at all under the proposed federal changes.
The woman had been working when she fell and had spinal surgery, and then found out she had thyroid cancer. Her private insurance wasn’t going to cover anything, so she applied for Medicaid and “didn’t hear anything,” so couldn’t go to the doctor for care. She reached out to Kalmer who was finally able to get her coverage.
During the course of her treatment for cancer, the woman wasn’t able to work, and didn’t qualify for Social Security. 
That means under the work requirements proposed by Congress, she wouldn’t have qualified for Medicaid.
Kalmer said to qualify as disabled and exempt, you must be officially declared disabled by Social Security, a process that can take months or years.
“This entire time that she’s been going through this cancer journey, she would not be necessarily qualified for the exemptions that are in the bill,” Kalmer said.
Congress also wants to require Medicaid recipients to pay copays of up to $35, which could discourage very low-income patients from seeking care. 
“All of this is really just creating more and more roadblocks for the valuable health insurance that cancer patients need and rely on to get the treatment that they need,” Kalmer said.
Traci Gleason, vice president of external affairs for the progressive Missouri Budget Project, said the changes will create significant “barriers to care” for Missourians. 
“There is simply no way that they can make those kinds of cuts to Medicaid without slashing health care for Americans, slashing health care for Missourians,” she said. “And I want to be clear that the consequences to Missourians, both on Medicaid and those who are not, really, can’t be overstated.”

(Inciweb photo)An 850-acre wildfire exploded in size on Sunday about four miles north of Plains.
The Banana Lake fire was discovered on Saturday and prompted a significant response from firefighting officials. As of Monday, 17 engines, two helicopters, two hand crews, a hotshot crew and three bulldozers are all assigned to the fire. 
The Western Montana Type 3 Incident Management Team, led by Ken Parks — the deputy director of the Missoula County Emergency Management Department — assumed command of the incident on Monday.
Firefighters were busy over the weekend with structure protection. 
(Information on what structures were being protected was not immediately available.) 
The fire started near Locust Hill in Plains and is burning along Highway 28 near Rainbow Lake. Fueling the fire is open timber, and a “full suppression response” is being implemented per the fire’s Inciweb situation report.
Fire officials asked the public to stay away from the area. The state’s Department of Natural Resources and Conservation media liaison listed for the fire did not immediately return a request for comment.
Montana could be gearing up for a long fire season. National Interagency Fire Center maps predict “greater than usual” likelihood of significant wildfires for half of the state by July and nearly all of it come August.
“Wildfires are a reality in Montana each year, but thanks to increased funding and innovative technology, DNRC is more prepared than ever before to respond quickly and effectively,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in a press release last week. “While our teams are equipped and ready to protect homes and communities in the event of wildfire, we also need every Montanan to take simple steps to join us in our efforts to keep our state safe.”
Gianforte signed two wildfire bills earlier this month, while vetoing two others that would have impacted local fire departments. How wildfires are to be fought is also a major topic both at the federal level and in the court system.
The state has already had several early season wildfires, including one near Wisdom that ended up burning more than 2,000 acres. According to Montana Fire Info, nearly 350 fires have burned in the state this year so far.
Rural firefighters throughout the state are starting to see things dry out. That includes Missoula Rural Fire District Lt. Phillip Mediate during an interview with the Daily Montanan regarding unseasonably warm temperatures over the weekend.
“We’ve had a pretty good wet spring,” Mediate said on Saturday morning. “We’re starting to see the spike in temperatures now. I think the fire danger has moved to moderate, just in the last couple of days, so we’re starting to see those grasses dry out … we’re starting to head into that season.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/INCIWEB-PhotoBanana-1024x871.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 17:08:24.935173

Scott,[...]","Rep. Jasmine Clark. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderDemocratic state Rep. Jasmine Clark has entered the race for Georgia’s 13th Congressional District to challenge U.S. Rep. David Scott, the longtime Democratic incumbent who has said he is seeking reelection. 
Clark’s announcement Monday comes at a time when Scott, who received treatment for back problems in November, faces questions about his health. Scott, who has represented the metro Atlanta district since 2003, will celebrate his 80th birthday at the end of the month.
Clark originally decided to run for a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives during the first Trump administration, setting her sights on a Gwinnett County seat that had been in Republican hands for over two decades. Clark ousted an incumbent to win the seat and went on to defend it in 2020, 2022 and 2024 – fending off a Republican challenger last year who was backed by Gov. Brian Kemp.
“I ran to be a voice for science and truth in the face of Republican disinformation and ever since I’ve been taking on the toughest fights for Georgia families,” Clark said in her campaign video.
Outside of her legislative duties, Clark is a microbiologist, mom, nursing school professor at Emory University and a podcast co-host.
Since she took office in 2019, Clark has introduced legislation that she said was intended to create  a “safer, healthier, more prosperous” state of Georgia. Clark is also a vocal defender of reproductive rights. 
As a metro Atlanta native and longtime Lilburn resident, Clark says she has always nurtured a passion for science and health care. She grew up with parents who both worked in the medical fields, watching her father work as a doctor and mother as a nurse. 
“I’ll stand up to Trump and MAGA when they try to cut Medicare, destroy Georgia jobs and gut medical research into cancer and Alzheimer’s,” Clark said in her video. “And get to work building a stronger future for all of us, not just a powerful few.”
Clark isn’t the only candidate hoping to steal Scott’s seat. Former Gwinnett County Board of Education Chairman Everton Blair Jr. and state Sen. Emanuel Jones of Decatur have announced campaigns. Jonathan Bonner, Joe Lester and Simeon Nunnally are all also planning to run. 
The primary election is set for next May. 
Scott faced six Democratic challengers in 2024 but ultimately won the primary outright with nearly 58% of the vote.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Great Salt Lake will likely have a tough summer.
The saline lake relies on mountain snow melt to fill it with water, and this winter wasn’t as good as the past two seasons. Enough snow fell in 2023 and 2024 to lift the state out of drought, fill reservoirs to above capacity and boost the withering Great Salt Lake.
It’s a different story this year. As of May 1, the amount of runoff that made its way to the Great Salt Lake basin is 72% of normal, compared with 108% at this time in 2024. Jordan Clayton, the Utah Snow Survey Program supervisor, predicted the lake would reach 4,193.7 feet by the end of the runoff season in July.
“The lake is at 4,193.3 feet right now,” Clayton said. “We’re already, unfortunately, seeing the lake past its peak in all likelihood.”



This article is published through the Great Salt Lake Collaborative, a solutions journalism initiative that partners news, education and media organizations to help inform people about the plight of the Great Salt Lake — and what can be done to make a difference before it is too late.


The lake rose about 1.5 feet from its seasonal low in November, according to the Utah Division of Water Resources. Great Salt Lake Commissioner Brian Steed said any additional runoff that makes its way to the lake won’t make much of a difference. The levels, he said, have already started to fall, and by the end of summer, the lake will lose as much – if not more – than it gained over the winter.
“I’m guessing we’re going to have probably a foot and a half more decrease this year.”
The good news, Steed said, is that the lake’s salinity is OK. When salt levels get too high, it essentially suffocates the organisms that call the lake home because fresh water carries more oxygen than saltwater.
The current projections are a disappointment to Steed and Clayton. Both anticipated water levels to creep up to at least 4,194 feet. The lake reached a historic low of 4,190.9 feet in 2022. At face value, where the lake stands now versus where it was predicted to be doesn’t seem like a big difference. But Steed’s established target range for the lake is between 4,198-4,205 feet. That allows for the ecosystem to support the survival of brine flies and brine shrimp. And keeps industries that do business on the lake, such as mineral extraction, able to do their jobs. And recreators can sail their boat or paddle their kayak without fear of hitting the lake bottom.
Bonnie Baxter, a microbiologist at Westminster University who studies lake organisms, told KUER’s RadioWest that she is seeing the ecosystem take a hit.
“We’re starting to see the shorelines recede again. We’re starting to see birds in strange places. We’re starting to see the place where the brine flies pupate, those are all being exposed,” she said. “We’re starting to see signs that we’re creeping towards that horrible place again.”
Still, Steed is grateful that “we’re not in the crisis that we were in 2022.” The last two years have bought Great Salt Lake some time, but he sees that buffer eroding. He’s also worried about impacts to the ecosystem as well as the dust from the exposed lake bed.
The summer months aren’t projected to ease the worry, either.

Climatologists are predicting a hotter-than-average summer. That means the lake will evaporate faster. Additionally, when it’s hotter, there is greater demand on Utah’s already strained water system. The upside, Steed said, is that the majority of reservoirs in the northern part of the state are full. The southern part of the state, which is back in drought, doesn’t have much impact on the lake.
Any precipitation will help Great Salt Lake’s cause. But the weather pattern is hard to predict right now.
The biggest message Utahns should take away from the summer forecast, Steed said, is to plan on using less water.
“We haven’t had the runoff that we wanted to see this year, and that puts us in a pretty perilous position heading into a dry summer,” Steed said. “That makes us all more worried about how we get more water to the lake, and it’s going to take all of us to get more water through intentional use and intentional reduction in use.”

Mike Bohacek, right, talks to Sen Greg Walker, R-Columbus, on the Senate floor on Jan. 23, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Charges are pending against Republican Indiana Sen. Mike Bohacek for a January drunk driving incident that remained under wraps for months — shielded by legislative immunity during the 2025 session.
Bohacek, of Michiana Shores, was stopped by police on Jan. 24 after a citizen reported him “drinking an open container and stumble out of his vehicle” at a Panda Express in Michigan City, according to charging documents obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle. He was later pulled over near Swan Lake Cemetery on U.S. 20, where he refused a breathalyzer test. 
Police then took him to a hospital, where a blood test showed a blood alcohol content of 0.28% — more than three times Indiana’s legal limit of 0.08%.
But Bohacek wasn’t arrested at the time. Under Indiana law, members of the General Assembly are shielded from arrest in most cases during the legislative session — a protection known as legislative immunity.
That meant Bohacek’s case was kept sealed and the senator remained uncharged for months.
Porter County Prosecutor Gary Germann, appointed as special prosecutor in the case, said the charges were filed shortly after his office was appointed in May but they weren’t made public until Monday afternoon.
Two other judges recused themselves and the current Special Judge is LaPorte Circuit Judge Julianne K. Havens.
Bohacek did not respond to the Capital Chronicle’s requests for comment. A Senate communications staffer also declined to comment, saying the incident “falls into the ‘personal matter’ category.”
Details emerge
Anonymous rumors about the incident circulated online after the January incident, but details were not publicly disclosed until Monday.
Charging documents provided by Germann show that Bohacek was stopped by a Michigan City police officer just before 3:30 p.m. on Jan. 24, a Friday. The senator was allegedly speeding while driving a 2023 Dodge Charger bearing his Indiana legislative license plate.
The officer at the scene claimed Bohacek’s speech was quiet and slow; that his eyes were “red, watery (and) bloodshot,” and that he had poor balance and staggered from his vehicle. Charging records additionally note that he was “covered in food.”
Panel advances 15-and-under social media ban

Bohacek “admitted to consuming his prescription medication Tramadol as prescribed prior to driving.” Tramadol is a prescription opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain, often after surgery or for chronic conditions, according to the Mayo Clinic.
After refusing a breathalyzer, the senator’s blood was drawn at around 4:30 p.m. the same day at Northwest Health Hospital in LaPorte. Results of that test later indicated a blood alcohol content of 0.283%, and no drugs present, according to the charging paperwork.
Bohacek was back taking votes in the Indiana Senate chamber the following Monday.
Online court records show Bohacek had several prior traffic citations, including ignoring a stop sign; speeding; and driving the wrong direction on a one-way.
Bohacek was first elected to the Indiana Senate in November 2016. He represents District 8, which includes Starke County, as well as portions of LaPorte, Marshall, and St. Joseph counties. He most recently served on the Corrections and Criminal Law, Health and Provider Services, and Local Government committees.
Before joining the General Assembly, Bohacek served as a two-term LaPorte County Commissioner and was a member of the Michiana Shores Town Council.
He additionally works as an enterprise consultant with Echo Global Logistics and owns MSL Services Inc., a company based in Michiana Shores, according to his legislative biography.
What is legislative immunity?
A specific section in the Indiana Constitution states that lawmakers are immune from arrest during session in all cases except treason, felony, or breach of the peace during the legislative session, as well as while traveling to and from the Indiana Statehouse. 
The most recent session started on Jan. 8 and adjourned on April 25.
Bohacek’s charges add to a series of other alcohol-related incidents involving separate Indiana lawmakers.

In May 2023, Republican Rep. Jim Lucas was arrested after crashing his vehicle into a guardrail and driving the wrong way on an interstate entrance ramp. Lucas, of Seymour, pleaded guilty to operating a vehicle while intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident, both misdemeanors. He received a suspended sentence, was placed on probation, and was removed from interim legislative committee assignments.
Lucas was reelected for a seventh term last November.
Before that, Democratic Rep. Dan Forestal was arrested in 2019 for operating a vehicle while intoxicated, resisting law enforcement, and impersonating a public servant. Forestal, of Indianapolis, died in 2021 after his legislative tenure had ended.
In 2009, former Democratic Rep. Dennie Oxley was arrested for misrepresenting himself as a state legislator to avoid arrest for public intoxication and was later convicted. Oxley claimed legislative immunity at the time of the incident, even though he was no longer an elected representative. 
And in 2002, Republican Sen. Johnny Nugent was arrested for DUI with a blood alcohol content of 0.13%. Voters repeatedly re-elected Nugent until he retired from the Indiana Senate in 2014.

Rusty Black, R-Chillicothe, chairs the Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force meeting Monday afternoon (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A group of state officials and business leaders tasked by Gov. Mike Kehoe with creating a new formula to fund Missouri’s public schools gathered for the first time on Monday under an expectation that funding should be below what lawmakers approved earlier this year.
Halle Herbert, the governor’s incoming policy director, told the group that Kehoe seeks funding “consistent with what is provided in the state fiscal year 2025 budget.”
Last month, lawmakers signed off on public education funding that was $300 million higher than what the governor recommended. 
“A lot of times when you ask a school superintendent, ‘where are the problems?….’ They ask for more money,” Kehoe told the group Monday. “That is not a great answer to me… That can’t always be the answer to every problem.”
Between fiscal year 2025 and 2026, a multiplier in the formula called the “state adequacy target” increased. This number is the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s estimate of proper per-pupil funding and is calculated by looking at top-performing schools in the state’s annual performance reports.
The change was driven by a new iteration of the state’s accountability system, called the Missouri School Improvement Program, which was introduced in 2022 and became more “rigorous” for districts to score high and produced a smaller number of districts that could be deemed top performers.
The program is required by law to be phased in, making fiscal year 2026 the first year with the updated state adequacy target. This change requires an additional $300 million to fully fund the foundation formula.
Kehoe’s proposed budget this January did not include the $300 million increase, and his comments in Monday’s meeting show an intention to tamp down the rising costs of public education.
Kari Monsees, deputy commissioner of financial and administrative services, said part of Kehoe’s intention with calling for a change to the formula comes from the “unpredictability” of the state adequacy target.
State Rep. Ed Lewis, a Republican from Moberly and former educator, pointed out that there was a 12% increase in the multiplier this year — but before now, it had only increased 4% in 16 years.

Superintendents have been asking for a formula that responds to inflation for years, arguing lawmakers “manipulated” the formula to keep funding flat.
A study commissioned by the department and released in 2023 concluded that the current formula hurts districts with more low-income students. Multipliers for serving sensitive student groups were “not based on any empirical analysis,” the study determined.
The study recommends looking at other states and the cost associated with desired performance outcomes to determine whether the per-pupil funding is enough.
But Kehoe is seeking financial incentives for high performance.
Monsees said there aren’t many states with performance in school funding formulas and alluded to a lack of information on that model.
The group that met Monday was created by an executive order Kehoe shortly after taking office. He appointed members representing public schools, agriculture, business and charter schools.
One member is to represent “a non-profit organization that works on expanding school choice in Missouri,” according to the order. Kehoe chose Chris Vas, a senior director with the Herzog Foundation. The foundation “advances K-12 Christian education primarily,” Vas said Monday.
There was some discussion that the formula, which was previously intended to fund public districts, should also be responsible for funding charter schools and vouchers for private education.
Committee member Michael Podgursky, an economics professor at the University of Missouri–Columbia, said there “was an active discussion of interdisciplinary school choice.”
“How do you design a funding mechanism with school choice, which really means thinking about tying it more to kids,” he said.
Podgursky has served as a fellow with various conservative research groups, such as the Fordham Institute and the George W. Bush institute and is a director at the conservative think tank the Show-Me Institute.

The gift is the largest donation in the 52-year history of Vermont Law and Graduate School, or VLGS.Allocated over a three-year period, the money will help fund initiatives at the school’s Animal Law and Policy Institute, which specializes in animal rights advocacy, and the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems, a research center focused on public health, food security and advocacy for farmers.“This generous gift is an incredible vote of confidence in the VLGS Animal Law and Policy Institute’s pathbreaking work to train tomorrow’s animal advocacy leaders,” Delcianna Winders, the institute’s director, said in the release.The money also will go towards the development of a new project dedicated to studying the environmental impact of aquaculture, which pertains to the breeding and harvesting of fish and other ocean species.Since the founding of its Environmental Law Center in the center of South Royalton in 1978, VLGS has garnered a reputation as a leading institution in environmental law. In April, the school was named No. 4 out of 183 schools in the U.S News and World Report’s annual ranking of environmental law programs.Comprised of roughly 700 students as of 2023, VLGS offers in-person and remote courses in a number of areas including animal law, restorative justice and food and agriculture law.The school’s operating budget was $31.6 million in the fiscal year ending in June 30 2024.News of the donation coincides with a period of change at VLGS. In mid-April, President Rodney Smolla announced he was stepping down from his leadership role at the end of this month to focus on teaching and research. Smolla, who specializes in constitutional and First Amendment law, has been the school’s president since 2022.On July 1, Beth McCormack, dean of the law school, and Dan Bromberg, dean of the graduate school, will take over for Smolla during a search for a new president.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Anonymous donor gives Vermont Law and Graduate School $10 million.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vermont-law-school-1-20201229.jpg,,,2025-06-02 17:08:24.935173

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)The Minnesota Department of Health has documented two new cases of measles in the Twin Cities area, according to a Monday news release. One case is an unvaccinated Dakota County child who was contagious while visiting Nickelodeon Universe in the Mall of America on May 24. 
The second case is a Washington County adult who was exposed during travel within the United States. Their vaccination status is currently unknown. The child with measles has not traveled recently and does not have known exposures to the illness. 
“Anytime we confirm a case of measles unrelated to travel that has no known source it is worrying,” said Jessica Hancock-Allen, infectious disease division director at MDH. “This is because it could be a sign that measles is spreading in the community undetected by public health and health care systems.”
MDH doesn’t yet know where the child was exposed and is working with local health officials to identify others who may have been exposed. These are Minnesota’s third and fourth known cases this year. MDH urged those who visited the Mall of America on May 24 to be aware of possible measles symptoms: fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and a rash. Measles can lead to hospitalization and even death.
Measles is a highly contagious airborne illness that can stay in the air up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. After being exposed to measles, a person could be asymptomatic for up to 12 days. 
The Minnesota measles cases come during a resurgent time for both the disease and anti-vaccine sentiments — President Donald Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed conflicting opinions on the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations. 
In April, Kennedy traveled to Texas, which is experiencing the largest measles outbreak since 2000. As of May 30, the Texas Department of Health has confirmed 738 cases of the illness since late January.

Two unvaccinated children have died since the outbreak began. Following the visit, Kennedy appeared to endorse the vaccine on social media. 
“The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” Kennedy said on X. 
 In an interview with CBS news three days later, however, Kennedy argued that measles cases are inevitable. 
“We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,” Kennedy said. 
While the measles case count in Minnesota remains low, MDH recommended that Minnesotans get vaccinated and check their immunization records.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-1140192021-1024x7371744799798-1.jpg,,,2025-06-02 17:08:24.935173
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-02 20:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Transformative CT early childhood education bill gets full passage,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/02/ct-early-childhood-education-bill/,The bill promises to transform early childhood care and education for generations by eventually allowing free access for qualifying families.,"The Connecticut House of Representatives passed a priority bill on Saturday that promises to transform early childhood care and education for generations of families.
Senate Bill 1, which also includes supports for special education, would create a new endowment for early childhood education that would draw up to $300 million from surplus funds each year. Depending on surplus funds available and how quickly the fund grows, it would eventually allow families making less than $100,000 to pay nothing for infant and toddler care and pre-K, while families making more than that would pay no more than 7% of their annual household income toward those expenses. 
The bill would also improve salaries for workers in the child care sector, and allows for funds to be spent on expanding or improving facilities. Those funds — $80 million — are expected to pass in a bonding bill. 
Gov. Ned Lamont, who is expected to sign the bill, reacted to its passage on X on Monday: “Working parents need childcare. It’s an essential part of keeping a job and growing an economy. I thank the legislature for approving my plan to enact the largest expansion of childcare access in state history. Let’s keep CT known as the most family friendly state in the nation!”
Though Lamont’s original plan was limited to an endowment for universal pre-K, S.B. 1 is the result of negotiations between his office, House and Senate Democrats, and advocates over the past few months. Those groups had started off the session with a variety of proposals to accomplish the collective goal of supporting families with the high cost of infant and toddler care and pre-K in a state where spots are often limited and providers struggle to retain workers. S.B. 1 intends to address those roadblocks by improving salaries for child care workers and investing heavily in the sector. 
The House also passed House Bill 5003 on Saturday, which would address another headache parents face: finding available spots. H.B. 5003 would create a portal to allow families to efficiently find the child care and pre-K spots they qualify for. That bill would also make it possible to care for up to 12 children, compared to the current limitation of nine children with a primary child care worker and assistant, in a child care home — provided certain requirements are met depending on the size of the facility and it has adequate staffing — and it would create a pilot program for hospitals to notify new parents of the child care centers and other services available to them.
Deputy Majority Leader Rep. Kate Farrar, D-West Hartford, said she hears from constituents daily about the high cost of living in Connecticut, and that child care is a key piece of that struggle. 
“So many of our businesses know how critical it is to have affordable and accessible child care,” she said. “Families deserve access to this care, because the greatest investment we can make is in our young children.”
But the bill has been criticized by Republican lawmakers, many of whom say that while they support the cause of funding early childhood education, they are troubled by using surplus funds to do so.  
Joe Polletta, R-Waterbury, talked about the fiscal crisis that the state found itself in back in 2017, and how the implementation of fiscal guardrails have helped the state dig itself out of that hole. “Little by little over the last eight years we have chipped away at those fiscal guardrails that got us to the land of steady habits that we are in today,” he said.
“We are going to fix something that’s not broke and I think future generations are going to pay for it. And I hope I’m wrong,” Polletta said.
Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect, ranking member of the Education Committee, spent more than two hours questioning the bill’s proponents. She concluded that while she believes it is “our responsibility to make sure we are providing the best for our kids, because they are the leaders of tomorrow,” she would not be supporting the bill.
“I hope that everything in here is going to make the difference that everyone says it’s going to, and I hope that our children are going to be better for it,” Zupkus said. “I hope I’m proven wrong for heaven sake.” 
Many House Democrats rose to speak in support of the bill. 
Rep. Brandon Chafee, D-Middletown, who worked on the legislation, said that “all too often in politics we think in the short term, offering a temporary program or funding that solves the immediate need but does not solve the underlying issue.” 
Chafee said he likes to think of the analogy of offering a hungry person an apple, a short-term fix, whereas planting a tree to address the deeper issue of hunger. “We’re planting a tree here to help future generations. It’s not gonna solve the immediate need, but over time as it grows, if we nurture it, if we nourish it, it will provide into the future year after year,” he said.
Farrar said that on Saturday, since school was out, the building was also full of children of legislators and advocates who had come to cheer the bill’s passage.
“There was an incredible moment, being able to walk out and meet up with the many advocates and parents in the hallways as they cheered, because this is the result of decades and decades of work,” Farrar said. 
“For too long child care was seen as something that just sort of happened and didn’t have a real importance or weight on what was going on in the rest of our communities or in our society or our state,” Rep. Mary Welander, D-Orange, said on Saturday. 
But she said those providers are truly the bedrock of the state’s economy and, “we need to compensate them, we need to have spaces for them to work in that are safe and clean, we need to make sure that they are able to care for themselves and their family.”
The bill also includes supports for special education, based on feedback collected by the Select Committee on Special Education.
That includes a $10 million grant to create better special education programming in some districts so that students don’t have to travel out of district. And it requires programs to send out notifications when staffing changes, like substitute teachers, last more than 10 school days — disruptions that can have a big impact on special education students. It also creates an educational ombudsman who would help mediate issues that arise when families are having trouble accessing services. The special education provisions in the bill complement those in House Bill 5001.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024_0717_ChildCareStory-8-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 17:08:24.935173

Montana health officials confirmed additional cases of measles in three counties across the state during the last weeks of May, bringing the statewide count to 15.
Gallatin County first reported cases in April — the state’s first measles outbreak in 35 years — and it reported an additional case on May 23 and another May 28. Both new cases are listed as “community acquired” by the Gallatin City-County Health Department, which states that both cases likely came from the same exposure site.
All Gallatin County cases are no longer in isolation.
In Flathead County, health officials announced Friday that a second case of the communicable disease had been confirmed in a county resident who had recently traveled outside the state.
The individual was hospitalized with symptoms of the illness and has an unknown vaccination status.
Flathead City-County Health Department investigation staff determined two locations of public exposure, and recommend anyone who visited the following locations during the specified dates and times may have been exposed:

Location: The Logan Health building, also known as “The Rock,” located at 350 Heritage Way, Kalispell, MT 59901, which includes the following Logan Health Clinics: Heart and Lung, Hematology & Oncology, Orthopedics & Sports Medicine-Heritage, Urology

Date & Time: Friday, May 23rd between 2:40 p.m. – 5:30 p.m.


Location: Logan Health Emergency Department, 350 Conway Drive Kalispell, MT 59901

Date & Time: Monday, May 26th between 6:40 p.m. – 9:10 p.m.



Those who may have been exposed can utilize the health department’s Measles Exposure SelfAssessment tool to help determine their next steps: Measles Exposure Self Assessment.
Health Officer Jen Rankosky said that any additional confirmed measles cases and associated exposure locations in the county will be posted on the health department’s website.
The Hill County Health Department in Havre also reported multiple measles cases where the individual has recovered and completed isolation as of May 30, and on June 2 confirmed two new cases with possible public exposure.
Hill County officials stated in a press release that both new cases are in unvaccinated children. Disease investigation staff determined a location of public exposure at the Walmart in Havre, on Friday, May 23, between 5:30 p.m. and 9 p.m.

Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that spreads when an infected individual coughs, sneezes or talks. Measles can also be spread through touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes. Symptoms typically begin with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body.
Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.
If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:


Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
Check your home state immunization registries.

A measles infection is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.
The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97% to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.
If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, please call your primary care physician as soon as possible.
