Olmscheid/Senate Media Services.Minnesota Sen. Matt Klein, DFL-Mendota Heights, a Mayo doctor first elected to the Legislature in 2016, announced Tuesday he’s running for Rep. Angie Craig’s congressional seat in the 2nd District.
“As a senator, I’ve worked across the aisle to pass common sense laws that protect Minnesotans from financial fraud and predatory lending, lower prescription drug costs by holding Big Pharma accountable, defend reproductive freedom, and make life more affordable for working families,” Klein said in a statement.
The 2nd Congressional District is Minnesota’s most competitive, but Craig’s centrist politics has helped her win four consecutive elections in the purple south metro district. In 2024, she won by double digit percentage points despite Republicans’ nationwide success. She recently announced her candidacy for U.S. Senate.
Klein currently serves as the chair of the Senate Commerce and Consumer Protection Committee.
Most recently, Klein has championed legislation to legalize online sports betting in Minnesota, but that effort has stalled again this year.
He’s also a vocal proponent of passing a revolving door ban, which would bar lawmakers from becoming lobbyists immediately after leaving office.
Klein, a married father of five, grew up in the east metro and attended the Mayo Medical School. Klein helped Gov. Tim Walz during his 2022 reelection by sharply calling out Walz’s GOP opponent, fellow physician Scott Jensen, who had raised doubts about the severity of the pandemic and the necessity of universal vaccination.

Laura Kelly sought assurances the six-person Kansas congressional delegation would oppose Medicaid cuts capable of harming the health of Kansans.,"Gov. Laura Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, asked the Kansas' six representatives in Congress to oppose large-scale federal funding cuts to Medicaid. The program serves more than 440,000 Kansans who are elderly, children, pregnant women or disabled. In 2023 and 2024, Kelly toured the state pitching the idea of broadening access to Medicaid, including this appearance at Southwest Medical Center in Liberal, Kansas. (Allison Kite/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly sent letters to the five Republicans and one Democrat in the Kansas congressional delegation urging the federal lawmakers to resist pressure to vote for Medicaid cuts that would deny health care to the most vulnerable people in the state.
Kelly, a Democrat who has campaigned for expansion of Medicaid in Kansas, said the latest proposal in Congress could cost the state up to $1 billion in federal funding in the first year of implementation. That would have a substantial effect on coverage for about 443,000 low-income seniors, children, pregnant mothers and people with disabilities.
“We must stand up against these changes to ensure the hundreds of thousands of Kansans covered under Medicaid can continue to receive quality, affordable care,” Kelly said in a letter released Monday. “Significant cuts to the Medicaid program will directly affect Kansans across the state, regardless of their political views. These cuts would be particularly detrimental to our rural hospitals and providers.”
Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said 64% of the state’s rural hospitals were at risk of closing and diminishing Medicaid funding would further strain those hospitals. She said the damage could come in the form of lower reimbursement rates to health providers or through growth of uncompensated care for individuals who lost coverage.
She said the decision by the Kansas Legislature to block expansion of eligibility for Medicaid meant the state’s hospitals currently carry a higher burden of charity care.
So far, the governor said, refusal to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act provisions broadening eligibility for Medicaid meant Kansas turned away approximately $7 billion in federal funding that would have flowed through the state’s health care economy during the past decade.
Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican who indicated interest in running for state insurance commissioner, said President Donald Trump and his allies were working to the cost of Medicaid to make certain it was sustainable for years to come.
“Our country cannot continue spending money like drunken sailors,” Hawkins said. “I applaud the Trump administration and those in our federal delegation for their efforts to preserve Medicaid.”
He said it was wrong for states to enroll “able-bodied adults” in the Medicaid program designed for the frail, elderly and disabled as well as children. He endorsed imposition of work requirements for adults in Medicaid ranging in age from 18 to 60 who weren’t pregnant or disabled.
“Governor Kelly should be less concerned about leading the DGA resistance to President Trump and focus more on the best interests of the country, the people of Kansas and the long-term future of Medicaid,” Hawkins said.
In response to the governor’s letter, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas said her GOP colleagues in Congress should reject large federal cuts to Medicaid enacted to help pay for tax breaks to wealthy Americans.
“I stand with Governor Kelly in urging all federal leaders to reject these devastating Medicaid cuts,” the 3rd District Democrat said. “I’ve fought time and again to protect and expand Medicaid in Kansas because our families shouldn’t have to pay more or travel farther just to get the health care they need.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/File_009-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-06 10:02:35.758460

Eviction court records are publicly available on the state Trial Court’s website, so even if a tenant won their case or it was dismissed, the record is accessible to everyone.
The post Eviction records can now be sealed in Massachusetts  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","RENTERS IN MASSACHUSETTS can now petition the courts to seal their eviction records online after a waiting period. The waiting period depends on the type of case and its outcome. Sealing the records means consumer reporting agencies cannot use the records in tenant background checks, allowing a fresh start. The record-sealing ability is the result of a law that was included as part of the Affordable Homes Act, signed last August by Gov. Maura Healey in a bid to increase housing supply amid high demand across the state. State Sen. Lydia Edwards, one of the proponents of the measure, compared eviction records to a “scarlet letter E.” Eviction court records are publicly available on the state Trial Court’s website, so even if a tenant won their case or it was dismissed, the record is accessible to everyone. Tenant advocates say people of color – Black and Latino households are twice as likely to rent – are disproportionately affected by eviction records, leading them to lose Section 8 vouchers or end up homeless because of the availability of the records. Black renters in Massachusetts are on average 2.4 times more likely to have an eviction filed against them than white renters, according to Attorney General Andrea Campbell, another supporter of the measure. “An eviction record, even one that has been dismissed, or brought in retaliation for a tenant exercising their legal rights, is a barrier to safe and stable housing that can have a long-term and devastating impact on a family and on an individual,” Campbell said. “As soon an eviction case is filed, the tenant has an eviction record even if they later win that case in court,” she added. “This law provides a process for tenants to not only petition a court to seal certain types of eviction records, but in doing so gives thousands of hard-working people across the commonwealth, with an eviction in their past, an opportunity to wipe that slate clean.” Edwards, Campbell, and state lawmakers joined renter advocates outside Edward Brooke Courthouse in Boston to bring public awareness to the new process going into effect this month. A new website lays out the process: SealMyEviction.org. Tenants can now petition to seal an eviction record immediately if they’ve won a case, had it dismissed, or it’s a no-fault case, meaning the landlord began an eviction even if the tenant paid rent on time and followed the rules. Landlords sometimes ask a tenant to leave if they’re seeking to sell or renovate the property, increase the rent, or allow their relatives to move in. Tenants can also petition to seal an eviction record after 4 years if it involves not paying rent due to financial hardship, and after 7 years for fault-based evictions which violate a lease or involve misconduct. Edwards, who represents parts of Boston, Revere, and Winthrop in the state Senate, has pushed the proposal for years, dating back to her time as a city councilor representing East Boston. “It’s about restoring dignity, opening doors, and recognizing that one tough chapter shouldn’t define a person’s future,” Edwards said. As part of her push, she had early meetings with Mike Moran, a state representative from Boston’s Brighton neighborhood, as well as Greg Vasil of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, which represents business interests like landlords. Vasil said he welcomed the discussion. At the press conference on Monday, Vasil criticized the “crazy world” epitomized by Washington, D.C., where people from different sides don’t talk to each other.“Our organization was grateful to be part of this process, where we talked over a number of years to come up with something that works for the people of Massachusetts,” he said. “Owners of property need tenants and tenants need a place to live. We need to work together.” The post Eviction records can now be sealed in Massachusetts  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250505_105528-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C775&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-06 10:02:35.758460

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)It was a pediatrician that first referred Laura Perez, now a mother of four, to an infant learning program in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough for her first son, who at almost 2 years old was showing some signs of developmental delays.
“It was more subtle with my oldest, but as it turned out, he was autistic, but he’s smart as a whip,” she said. Not only was Perez able to receive support from a developmental specialist for him, but also to enroll his next three siblings at earlier ages, in the following years. 
“They caught some of the social, emotional issues my oldest was having, and they caught some physical issues that with my second child, he’s got wonky ankles, which was, causing him to be a lot more clumsy. And … you know, I’m not a medical person,” she said. “It’s done so much good. It helped catch so much more, so much faster, and the faster you can intervene, the better the outcomes are.”
Infant learning programs provide early intervention services for families and children, from infancy to age 3, who are experiencing developmental delays. Interventions can include play and movement therapies, as well as language stimulation techniques, for children. In addition, parents can receive education and training on child development. 
An estimated 1,800 Alaskan families are served each year by 17 infant learning programs across the state, funded by the state of Alaska and federal Medicaid, at no cost to families. 
Perez and her family received support with speech, physical and occupational therapies. She said her second child is now an active prekindergartner at Big Lake Elementary. “He’s doing math! He’s throwing multiplication at us,” she said, laughing. “I’m like, you just turned 5, sir.”
Perez joined a group of advocates in Juneau to meet with legislators and attend the debut of a new short film that shows a week in the life of the staff at the Mat-Su Services for Children and Adults Inc. infant learning program. 
The April 29 screening drew a large crowd to the Gold Town Theater, including over a dozen lawmakers from Anchorage and the Mat-Su regions. Advocates are urging legislators to pass Senate Bill 178, to expand eligibility, and increase state general funds for these programs.

The film — made by filmmaker Joshua Albeza Branstetter — follows Yulia Smith, a developmental specialist making house calls in Mat-Su, sitting on floors with toddlers, and talking with mothers rocking infants. She discusses successes of early interventions, and ongoing challenges for the infant learning program.  
“Really, the beauty of this work is we get to influence the life of a child in the very first few years of their life,” Smith said. “There’s so much we can do with early intervention to influence that further life of a child. … And it all starts from when you’re born, really.”
Smith herself became a developmental specialist after receiving services from the Mat-Su program for her son, who was later diagnosed with autism. She wanted to become one of the specialists and supporters for families like hers. “Because I had never known what autism was until then. And I was growing through quite a grieving process, in terms of what does that mean for my son and my family,” she said. “Now looking back, I needed her as much as my son needed her. And I wanted to do that for other families.”
Under current state law, infants and toddlers must show a 50% delay to be eligible for infant learning programs. Smith describes how that forces the Mat-Su program to turn families away, telling them to come back in six months for reevaluation, sensitive weeks and months in a child’s brain development. 
Under the new proposed legislation, eligibility would be changed to a 25% delay, so that more children and families would be eligible for these types of interventions. 
Laura Norton-Cruz is a social worker and executive producer of the film, which was funded by the Mat-Su Health Foundation. She said expanding eligibility would open services to families. It would also reinstate eligibility for babies born prematurely or with low birth weight, after the state changed the guidance to remove them last year. 
“I witnessed that when we were filming. They went and visited a child in foster care who had been exposed to alcohol prenatally,” Norton-Cruz said, and he did not meet the 50% delay eligibility requirement at 1 year old. “So he had to be un-enrolled from the services, despite the services having made a really significant difference in his first 12 months, because he had been enrolled out of the NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit). So they helped him, and then they had to let him go. And a lot of those families who get un-enrolled come back, and they come back with more significant delays.”
The film also shows staff grappling with heavy case loads, back-to-back home visits, and discussion of the growing demand from families, as the Mat-Su has the fastest growing population in the state. 
Advocates and families are urging lawmakers to increase state funding for infant learning programs, which is funded through the Alaska Department of Health at $7.4 million in state funding last year.  
“It hasn’t been increased in 11 years,” Norton-Cruz said. “So the amount that the state provides has stayed the same, while costs have gone up. … In rural regions, airplane costs have gone up. Health insurance costs have gotten up. And the funding has remained flat.”
This year, the Alaska House added $5.7 million to early intervention and infant learning programs, but that addition was deleted by the Senate Finance Committee in its version of the operating budget. Committee leaders have said they are aiming to constrain spending in preparation for several financial challenges they expect the state to face over the next year. 
Norton-Cruz said an increase to infant learning programs would be an essential investment that legislators should fight for this year on a final budget vote. 
“If they continue to flat fund, it is a divestment, right, especially as federal funds disappear,” she said. “(It) is a divestment from children. And if you divest from children, things will get worse. Children will have worse outcomes in childhood, in adolescence and in adulthood, and that will be expensive … quality of life gets worse,” she added. 
She said these interventions also help reduce the costs and children’s need for services later in life, including hospitalizations and special education services in school.
In the final weeks of the legislative session, advocates are hoping to gather support for SB 178 to expand eligibility for children, which is currently being heard in the Senate Health and Social Services Committee.

For some communities across Michigan, Tuesday is Election Day.
In most of the townships and cities voting in May, the election features just a few issues and typically sees low turnout. Some communities will run an election for just a precinct or two; almost none will offer early voting or tabulate absentee ballots ahead of time.
So why do we have a May election in Michigan at all? There’s a state law involved, but mostly, it comes down to money.
 A 2003 law consolidated elections

For many years, Michigan didn’t have set dates for elections.
“There were just elections all the time,” said Chris Thomas, who served for decades as state director of elections before retiring in 2017. “School millages, filling vacancies, it was just all over.”
In December 2003, Sen. Beverly Hammerstrom — a Republican from Monroe County and a former clerk herself — introduced a bill that consolidated elections to just four days in the year. Those dates might be familiar to Michigan voters now: They were the fourth Tuesday in February, and the first Tuesday after the first Monday in May, August, and November.
The bill moved quickly through the Legislature, and Gov. Jennifer Granholm signed it on Dec. 31. It took effect in 2005. Later changes established that certain offices and issues were to be voted on in certain years, Thomas said, and the February election was “eventually dumped” — though Michigan recently resumed holding its presidential primaries in February.
One of the biggest reasons for consolidation was cost, Thomas said. Having a set election schedule allows communities to be more strategic with their election budgets.
“The tradeoff, of course, is you get this very long ballot,” he said. “We’ve got everybody on that thing. Other than a few cities, really, it’s all the schools, the villages, the townships, a good number of cities, all your county offices and state offices, federal offices.”
Thomas noted that more people tend to show up for school elections when there are other races and issues on the same ballot.
And there’s another key benefit for school districts: Holding their elections for bond issues, millages, and sinking-fund proposals in May means they can better estimate how much money will be coming in when their fiscal year starts, typically July 1.
A May election ensures those things can appear on the summer property tax bill, said Michael Siegrist, Canton Township clerk. It all but guarantees that revenue for the upcoming year.
“Waiting until August puts them in a bad spot where they have to basically set their budgets for the next school year without knowing if they’re going to have their mill renewal or if the [intermediate school district] is going to have enough money to do support services for special education and things like that,” he said.
 Should there be more consolidation?

Many clerks would prefer to see the August election eliminated altogether, moving every primary to May. Holding an election halfway between the May and November ones can distract election officials, Siegrist said, particularly during years with big statewide and federal races. August elections are also expensive and tend to have low turnout.
The Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks has been lobbying to combine the August and May election into a single election in either May or June, Siegrist said. Schools could still plan their budgets in time, and voters would be aware of their general election candidates earlier.
“The thought was if you merge them, you solve [the turnout] issue and satisfy all those interests,” Siegrist said.
While most Michigan cities hold their elections for city offices and other issues in November, a small number choose to elect their government in May. Wyandotte, a city of about 25,000 in downriver Wayne County, will elect its mayor, city council, assessor, clerk, and treasurer Tuesday.
That’s the result of an old state requirement that allowed cities to hold their elections without a primary if they held them in May, City Clerk Larry Stec — who is running unopposed Tuesday — told Votebeat.
It was an economical decision when it was made, Stec said, and it hasn’t caused Wyandotte any problems in the years since. It’s hard to tell if turnout for these races would be higher in November, he said, but residents still turn out in force for the local races.
“If nothing else, there could be a school election in May anyway,” he said. “Our job is to run elections. When we’re told we need to have one, we jump in and do our work.”

State lawmakers pushing their bills through committee hearings often invite people to testify how their lives have been affected by the issue at hand. Christine Matlock Dougherty made an impression on lawmakers and witnesses recently as she advocated for two health care bills related to insurance coverage. 
As CalMatters’ Jocelyn Wiener explains, Dougherty’s 23-year-old son, Ryan Matlock, died of a fentanyl overdose in 2021 after his insurance plan declined to continue covering his stay at an addiction treatment center.
Dougherty — who is also suing her health plan — traveled over 400 miles from Yucaipa in San Bernardino County to Sacramento on separate occasions to speak on behalf of two proposals that aim to hold health insurance plans more accountable.
One is Assembly Bill 669, which would require health plans to review a patient’s eligibility to stay in substance use treatment no sooner than 28 days from when the provider first approved the treatment; Matlock’s health plan decided it would no longer cover his stay at the treatment facility just three days into his stay.
The other, Senate Bill 363, would require health plans to report data to the state about how often they deny treatment.
Though it’s been five years since Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a landmark law requiring health insurance plans to provide enrollees with all medically necessary mental health and addiction treatment, serious shortcomings in behavioral health coverage remain. The Legislature is currently considering a handful of bills to address some of these issues, which include the bills Dougherty is championing. She says pushing for the proposals is what Ryan would have wanted her to do. 

Dougherty: “It helps me find a reason why it was him.”

‘Millions of people out on the street’

After President Donald Trump revealed his federal budget plan last week, advocates are sounding alarm bells over spending cuts that could worsen the state’s housing and homelessness crises, write CalMatters’ Ben Christopher and Marisa Kendall.
Trump’s budget plan guts half of the funding for the Housing Choice Voucher program, also known as Section 8, which helps low-income tenants with their rent. He is also proposing to cap how long a single person can receive help under the program to two years. 
To save about $5 billion, the administration is proposing to nix funds for local economic development grants, affordable housing developments and local initiatives that aim to speed up housing. The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, which oversees federal homelessness policy, would be eliminated too. In April all its staff was already put on leave following an executive order.
The federal budget for 2024 was $6.9 trillion, so $5 billion would represent a savings of about 0.07 percent. 
These cuts and others would essentially gut programs that California and its local governments depend on for housing and homelessness services, which serve millions in the state.

Matt Schwartz, president of the nonprofit California Housing Partnership: “You’d be looking at millions of people out on the street virtually overnight. There’s no way states could maintain the same level of assistance.”

Deep breath. 
Christine Matlock Dougherty inhaled, pursed her lips and exhaled slowly.
She stared intently at the Scrabble game on her phone, trying to calm her nerves as she waited to testify before the Assembly health committee. 
Deep breath.
She checked her texts. She moved on to a dice game. 
“It gets to be a little much sometimes,” she said, quietly.
On a sunny afternoon last month, hers was the privilege no parent wants: The chance to convince a roomful of lawmakers to fix the broken system she believes contributed to the death of her child.
For the second time in two weeks, she would testify before the state Legislature as a key witness for not one, but two separate bills targeting the health insurance industry. They were among several such measures percolating through the Capitol, hastened along by public outrage that boiled over after the fatal shooting of the chief executive officer of UnitedHealthcare this past December.
In an attempt to push through policy reforms targeting commercial health plans, lawmakers had invited Dougherty to share her family’s story. Matt Haney, a Democratic state assemblymember from San Francisco, has said her story inspired him to author one of the bills for which she would testify, a measure intended to prevent health plans from prematurely pushing patients out of substance use treatment facilities.

Today wouldn’t be her first time testifying; she had recently flown up to the capital to speak on behalf of a bill that would require health plans to report data to the state about how often they deny treatment. Before that, she hadn’t been to Sacramento for years, since her young family had taken a road trip here when the kids were little. They’d taken a picture of her son, Ryan, standing next to the bronze bear in the Capitol building.
Dougherty’s fingernails, painted in sparkly, bright pastels to delight the first graders at the Yucaipa elementary school where she works, rested on eight sheets of paper. There, double-spaced in 20-point font, was the chain of events that ended with Ryan dying of a fentanyl overdose at the age of 23. 
But how does one capture in two minutes a nightmare that has lasted four years? Her health plan’s denial of coverage for her son’s addiction treatment. His ensuing discharge from the rehabilitation facility. The wrongful death lawsuit she filed. 
The Assembly room grew crowded. 
Was it hot in here? 
In college, Dougherty had taken a public speaking class. The day she was supposed to deliver her first speech, she’d felt so nervous that she’d fainted. But now, after more than three decades teaching elementary school, she knew the trick: Sound confident and they’ll believe you.
She knew her being here is what Ryan would have wished for. She wanted to make him proud.  
“It helps me find a reason why it was him,” she said.
Dougherty had cried several times that morning on the flight from Palm Springs to Sacramento. Since Ryan’s death, even the smallest things could provoke tears. The color of a shirt. A song on the radio.
Some days were better than others.
“All I’m doing is breathing right now,” she told a reporter.

At today’s hearing, she’d testify for a bill that would stop health plans from reviewing a patient’s eligibility to stay in substance use treatment until at least 28 days after an in-network provider initially approved the treatment. Ryan’s health plan had decided it would no longer cover his stay in the treatment facility after he had spent just three days there.
Less than 48 hours after his sister picked him up and drove him home, he’d overdosed.
Dougherty took her seat in the middle of the crowded Assembly hearing room. She waited as committee members discussed other bills designed to rein in insurers’ power over patients.
An hour passed.
And then, finally, Dougherty’s turn. 
She walked to the front of the room and took her seat at the table facing the lawmakers. One of the bill’s sponsors had told her that if she felt nervous, she should train her eyes on the committee chair, Mia Bonta, a Democratic state assemblymember from Oakland. 
Bonta had a son.
Haney introduced the bill. Dougherty had never seen him before. Now he told the committee that while other states have already passed laws to address the problem, “California has failed to act.”
“The case of Ryan Matlock is a devastating example,” he said. 
Deep breath.
Haney slid a box of tissues in front of Dougherty.
“Without speaking to Ryan, they denied the care he needed,” she said, her voice tight with unspilled tears. “They said he could control his addiction if he really wanted to.”
His health plan has said it always follows the law.
“Four years later, I still miss him every day.”
Bonta called for a moment of silence for Ryan.
Representatives of several organizations lined up at a microphone to voice their support. A few dabbed their eyes.

Representatives of the insurance industry responded with their opposition to the bill: 
Steffanie Watkins, the representative from the Association of California Life and Health Insurance Companies raised concerns that the bill would prohibit the use of common health plan review processes to determine the length of a patient’s stay. She said the bill would keep health insurers from protecting patients from “falling victim to the unscrupulous practices” of some facilities,“putting patients at risk and driving up the cost of care.” 
“We believe this bill goes too far,” she said. 
Olga Shilo, representing the California Association of Health Plans said current health plan review processes help ensure that treatments are medically necessary, protect against fraud, waste and abuse, and provide safeguards against unnecessary costs. 
“We are concerned about the implications of removing accountability in the system without improving the quality of care,” she said.
Haney called a 28-day minimum stay a “no brainer” and “the bare minimum.”
 “That would have made a difference in Ryan’s life,” he said.
Dougherty swallowed.
Haney thanked her for her courage.
She blinked back tears. 
Later she would learn that the committee had voted in favor of the bill, 12-0. It would move on to the next step in the process. 
After her testimony, out in the hallway, Haney told Dougherty she had powerful people behind her. 
“Your story makes it real,” he said.
He wrapped her in a hug.
She patted her damp cheeks, then pulled on dark sunglasses. 
Outside, the roses in the Capitol garden exploded with color, filling the sunny afternoon with their divine perfume.

Let’s be clear from the start: The Constitution’s protections — including the First Amendment — apply to all individuals on U.S. soil, regardless of citizenship or immigration status.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jay Diaz and Jill Martin Diaz: What Vermonters should know about free speech and immigrants’ rights.","This commentary is by Jay Diaz, an attorney and civil rights litigator with Darby Kolter & Roberts in Waterbury, and Jill Martin Diaz, an immigration attorney and executive director of the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project.“Terrorist sympathizers.” “Operating on behalf of terror cells.” These are phrases recently used by a member of the Vermont House Judiciary Committee during ACLU of Vermont testimony about immigrant protesters. In recent weeks, Vermont made international news with lawful residents and visa holders being hauled to jail for their political views. Politically engaged students here are having their visas revoked with no notice.All this has many Vermonters asking, “Do noncitizens have First Amendment rights?” This conversation is a redux of the first Trump administration’s impact in Vermont. The administration is kicking those efforts into hyperdrive this time around, in Vermont and around the country.So, let’s be clear from the start: The Constitution’s protections — including the First Amendment — apply to all individuals on U.S. soil, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed this repeatedly. Immigrants have constitutional rights to due process, legal counsel, privacy, public education and, critically, free speech.A concurring opinion to Bridges v. Wixon famously summarized the court’s application of First Amendment rights to immigrant speech, recognizing they “possess(ed) the right to free speech and free press, and that the Constitution will defend (them) in the exercise of that right.”More recently, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in which Vermont sits, clarified in Ragbir v. Homan that Ragbir’s immigration reform advocacy “implicates the apex of protection under the First Amendment” and found it “egregious” that “the Government singled him out for deportation based not only on the viewpoint of his political speech, but on the public attention it received.”No matter whether someone is a permanent resident, a temporary visa holder or undocumented, they retain basic constitutional protections — including the right to express protected viewpoints free from the threat of arrest, jail or deportation.  There is no immigrant-speech exception to the First Amendment. Yet we see the Trump administration targeting immigrant activists for their political speech, claiming their words alone make them a national security threat. But the Constitution does not view political speech — even when controversial, “anti-American,” or sympathetic to U.S. “enemies” — as a danger justifying government retaliation.Supreme Court jurisprudence is replete with legal rulings protecting extreme and even heinous political speech — from Klan rallies and Westboro Baptist funeral protests to flag burning and foreign propaganda distribution. The First Amendment protects it all, limited only by narrowly defined incitement, defamation, discrimination, true threats, and the reasonableness of time and place.Why? Because handing the government the power to censor or punish opinions is the definition of tyranny. When officials can retaliate against dissenters, fear stifles speech. The marketplace of ideas central to our democracy withers. When one opinion or one type of speaker can be punished, it threatens the free speech of all.Today, immigrants face the loss of their education, homes, families and freedom for exercising their speech rights. Many are self-censoring out of fear of ICE action. They should not carry the torch of free speech alone.Citizens must step up to fight for more. We can call out and reject efforts to suppress immigrant speech under the guise of national security. We can push to reform immigration law that has for too long granted the executive branch king-like powers, creating fertile ground for extralegal abuses of sacrosanct rights, such as recasting lawful speech as “dangerous” because it comes from immigrants. The founders would demand no less. They wanted to eliminate the tyranny of monarchs who punished political dissidents. They enshrined their ideal in the language of the First Amendment: “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech.” Now, however, armed agents are pulling people from their homes and off the street for speaking out. People are scared to speak their minds. The founders’ dream of a country where no one could be punished for speaking against their government is turning into a nightmare.  Thankfully people across the ideological spectrum are speaking up. Gov. Phil Scott gets it. Our Statehouse representatives are making their voices heard, too. Vermonters must all take the high road — one that defends everyone’s right to speak, especially on political matters, even when we dislike the speaker or vehemently disagree with their opinion. Our fundamental rights rise or fall with those of our immigrant neighbors.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jay Diaz and Jill Martin Diaz: What Vermonters should know about free speech and immigrants’ rights.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-06 09:06:04.288758

About 280,000 children in Nevada will automatically receive a one-time payment of $120 starting May 17, thanks to a federal nutrition program known as the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (S-EBT).
Congress passed bipartisan legislation in late 2022, making S-EBT permanent for states that opt-in, including Nevada. The federal program now permanently provides families with $40 each summer month per eligible child to buy food at grocery stores, farmers markets, or other authorized retailers.
Last year, the S-EBT program delivered about $37 million in benefits to nearly 312,000 children, with about 80% of those benefits being fully utilized. 
In order to automatically qualify for the S-EBT program, a child must attend a school that participates in the National School Lunch Program or School Breakfast Program and be eligible for free or reduced-price meals.
Children who qualify for free or reduced-price meals due to their participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) will also automatically qualify for S-EBT, even if they do not attend a school that participates in the National School Lunch Program or School Breakfast Program.
Children on Medicaid in a household with an income at or below 185% of the Federal Poverty Level also automatically qualify for S-EBT, regardless of which school they attend. 
Children participating in the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) can also be automatically eligible for the S-EBT program.
Families can check to see if their child was automatically enrolled into the program through an online portal at Access Nevada starting May 17.
Not automatically eligible? Apply anyway.
Households that are not automatically eligible are still encouraged to apply for the S-EBT program starting May 17, when applications open on the Nevada Division of Welfare and Supportive Services website. 
While most Nevada Summer EBT eligible families will automatically receive the Summer EBT benefit, there is a group of income eligible families that must submit an application.
Last year, a total of 6,347 families not automatically eligible for S-EBT applied for the program, according to the Nevada Division of Welfare and Supportive Services. Of those applicants, 2,690 were ultimately determined eligible for the summer food benefits, or about 42% of all applicants. 
David Rubel, a New York City-based education consultant, said even more families were likely eligible last year, but never applied. He found that only 9% of potentially eligible households in Nevada submitted applications, leaving about $8.4 million in benefits on the table.
“Only a handful of Summer EBT eligible families submitted applications last year,” Rubel said. “Using a formula from USDA, the potential number was 70,400 families.” 
However, those funds are now lost. S-EBT is a one-time benefit tied to a specific school year and cannot be retroactively applied for or claimed for previous years, according to the Nevada Division of Welfare and Supportive Services.
“The Summer EBT money won’t get distributed and spent this summer unless families know about it,” Rubel said.
Nevada wasn’t the only state to lose out on benefits. Rubel looked at 14 states’ potential number of applications vs. applications submitted and found that the percentage of applications submitted in every state was less than 20% of potential applicants.
How benefits will be distributed
Eligible households that participate in SNAP or TANF will automatically receive their S-EBT benefits starting May 17 on existing EBT cards if the guardian listed by the Nevada Department of Education in the Summer 2024 program file remains the same.
Families that qualified last year can also receive benefits on their existing S-EBT cards issued last year, the program’s inaugural year. Families that need a replacement card can request a replacement S-EBT card from the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Division of Welfare and Supportive Services. Replacement S-EBT cards may take 2-3 weeks to receive. 
Children receiving benefits for the first time will be mailed a S-EBT card to the address of the guardian listed in the school’s registration system for the 2024-2025 school year. Mailed S-EBT cards may take 2-3 weeks to receive. 
S-EBT benefits expire 122 days after they become available. If the benefits are not used within 122 days, they will be removed from the card and cannot be replaced, per federal regulations.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is a federal program. (Getty Images)With a goal of cutting spending and promoting “self-sufficiency,” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, wants to overhaul the nation’s largest federal food assistance program by requiring states to pay a bigger share, starting with 5% more a year until states take on 50% of the costs. 
That would shift billions of dollars in food stamps costs to states and likely lead to slashed benefits. And if a recession hits — a time when state revenues usually fall and the need for food stamps increases — hundreds of thousands of Americans would fall into poverty who otherwise wouldn’t be if states don’t increase their spending. 
Lee’s home state of Utah could also be among the hardest hit states when it comes to loss of benefits per household. 
That’s according to two analyses that unpack the impacts of Lee’s proposal, which he introduced in March as the SNAP Reform and Upward Mobility Act. The legislation comes as Republicans in Congress consider expanding work requirements and other eligibility restrictions on programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid. 
Advocates sound alarm as Utah looks to impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion

A news release on Lee’s website described his proposal as “a bold piece of legislation aimed at strengthening work requirements” for SNAP and “closing loopholes that have contributed to its rapid expansion.” According to a two-page summary of the bill issued by Lee’s office, “the program has ballooned from 17.1 million food stamp recipients in 2000 to 41.1 million in 2022,” with a cost that’s risen from $17 billion to $119 billion in that same time period. 
“SNAP was designed to provide temporary relief to vulnerable people facing difficult times, not a permanent subsidy for able-bodied adults,” Lee said in a prepared statement in that release. “Work requirements are widely supported by the American public, save taxpayer dollars, and will strengthen the program for families who really need it. Our legislation tackles fraud and abuse while promoting self-sufficiency, which should be the goal of all such programs.”
The bill has also been introduced in the U.S. House by Rep. Josh Brecheen, R-Oklahoma, who accused federal government officials of “grossly” mismanaging SNAP by “loosening eligibility requirements, allowing more recipients to be totally exempt from work requirements, and overseeing massive fraud and abuse.” 
“This has created a culture of dependency instead of opportunity,” Brecheen said. 
But mandating that states cover even just a portion of SNAP benefits would shift “huge costs” to states, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an organization that was founded to analyze fiscal policies that impact low- and moderate-income Americans. 
“Requiring states to pay even a modest portion of SNAP benefits would radically change the program’s funding structure, abandoning the long-standing national commitment to provide low-income households a SNAP benefit sufficient to afford a basic healthy diet, and undermining SNAP’s important role as an economic stimulus during recessions,” the analysis said. “This unfunded mandate would hit state budgets hard at a time when state finances are already highly strained. States could pass along some of the cost to counties and cities, either directly or indirectly.”
In Utah, $383 million in total SNAP benefits were issued in 2024, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In 2026, if the state were to be required to pay 5% of the costs, it would cost the state about $19 million. At 10%, Utah’s share would be roughly $38 million; 25% would be $95 million. At 50%, Utah would need to pay an estimated $190 million. 
Between fiscal year 2026 and 2034, Utah could be looking at upwards of $907 million in costs — that is, if the state took on only 25% of the cost, according to the analysis. That number would be much bigger if states were required to take on 50% in that same time frame. 
Another analysis by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit founded by former Democratic President Lyndon Johnson that focuses on social and economic policy research, contemplates how a SNAP state cost share policy, like the one Lee is proposing, would play out in a recession scenario.

In the first year of a recession — if states were required to take on just 10% of the costs — the Urban Institute estimates states would need to spend an additional $980 million to cover increased benefit costs. 
However, if states don’t increase their spending during the recession and opt instead to cut benefits to control costs, “all SNAP participants — not just those who lost jobs — would face an average annual benefit reduction of $327 per household, and 862,000 people would fall into poverty who would otherwise be out of poverty if SNAP were fully funded,” according to the Urban Institute report. 
It also estimated Utah (if it was required to pay for 10% of the costs but also opted to prevent SNAP costs from rising in a recession by implementing across-the-board benefit cuts) would see one of the biggest losses in average annual benefits per household relative to what would be received during a recession under current rules. 
Utah would lose about $731 in average annual benefits per household under that scenario, the Urban Institute estimated. That’s compared to a national average of $327 per household lost annually, with annual benefit reductions ranging from $174 in Massachusetts to the highest loss of $776 in Wyoming. 
That’s only contemplating a 10% requirement on states. If Lee’s proposal is implemented, that share would eventually be 50%. 
Lee’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the impact analysis on Monday. 
Bill Tibbitts, deputy executive director of the Urban Crossroads Center, a low-income advocacy group that provides food pantry services, criticized Lee’s proposal as “out of touch” during a time when families are already struggling to afford rent, utilities, transportation and food. 
“Cutting federal funding in half for a program that helps thousands of Utah families to buy food shows how out of touch some people in D.C. can become,” Tibbitts said. “Do they not know how much inflation is already hurting Utah families? It makes you wonder when Mike Lee last visited a grocery store.”

HB 297, sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Fidler, R-Silverhill, is what remains of a bill that would have taxed international wire transfers, often used by immigrants to send money home to families. 
As filed, Fidler’s bill would have subjected all international wire transfers to a 4% tax. A House Financial Services Committee substitute changed that. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill requires data to be collected and stored on “suspicious” international wire transfers of $2,000 or more, and for the data to be stored for five years. The bill requires all transfers exceeding $1,000 to be recorded. Fidler said $2,000 being transferred internationally is suspicious, but the bill does not define suspicious transactions.
“The wire transfer companies will determine what suspicious is. The Securities Commission that regulates all these transactions, they’re the ones that are keeping an eye on it,” Fidler said.
Rep. Chris Blackshear, R-Smiths Station, said in the Committee on April 23 that the substitute removes the 4% per transaction tax that the legislation originally imposed. 
“Instead of a fee or a tax, it would now turn into a fine on any guilty findings they come up with,” Blackshear said at the committee meeting.
The fines would be collected by the Alabama Securities Commission. The proceeds would go to the Sheriffs’ Advancement in Education, Technology, and Training Fund, according to the Legislative Services Agency. The bill’s fiscal note says each civil penalty can generate up to $5,000 for the fund.
Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said during debate on the House floor last week that the current political climate made her concerned about the intentions of the legislation. 
“My rationale is because of the climate that we’re living in now that I would not want somebody falsely accused of something,” Moore said. “People are being falsely arrested and everything else and once it happens they have no way out when they are innocent.”
Moore said that parents could be sending money to a child that is studying abroad, not just immigrants with families abroad.
“If you’ve got a child living overseas going to school and every week you transfer them $1,000, that’s going to look suspicious,” Moore said.
Fidler said that the transaction would just have to be recorded and kept for five years.
The legislation requires the commission to record data on multiple transactions of $15,000 or more between the same people. The commission must also record all transactions of more than $1,000. The legislation makes evading recording the data a Class C felony on first offense and a Class B felony on multiple offenses; punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine, and up to 20 years in prison and a $30,000 fine, respectively.
Fidler’s bill effectively replaced similar legislation filed by Sen. April Weaver, R-Alabaster, which would have imposed a $7.50 fee on money sent overseas and a 1.5% fee on transfers over $500. The bill was held because the Constitution requires the legislation to start in the House. 
The bill passed 83-2 with 15 abstentions. It goes to the Senate Insurance and Banking Committee, which had not posted an agenda as of early Monday afternoon. There are three days left in the 2025 session.

“Over the years we have lost qualified, caring individuals due to former criminal records, particularly from marijuana convictions related to possession that were over 20 years old or longer.” Ashley Kennedy, a lobbyist for Clark County, told state lawmakers. Such convictions “no longer align with Nevada’s current laws.”
Assembly Bill 107, which the county requested, would change that. It would allow people convicted of marijuana possession for amounts that are currently legal to become foster parents. It would also remove the automatic ban on fostering for anyone with a marijuana-related conviction more than 5 years old and not related to selling.
Currently, any conviction for possession, distribution or use of any controlled substance automatically disqualifies you from becoming a foster parent.
AB107 would not change other licensing requirements for foster parents, which include training, background checks, home inspections and home studies. The bill, sponsored by Las Vegas Democratic Assemblymember Tracy Brown-May, received unanimous support from the Assembly and was heard by a Senate committee last week.
Kennedy said Clark County does not have formal data on the number of people who have been turned away by its family services department for having prior marijuana convictions, but anecdotally they believe it to be “at least 10 families a year.”
She added that, while 10 may appear to be a small number, most foster care homes take in more than one child per year, meaning the impact is “significantly larger.” Many foster homes also take in multiple kids at the same time, child advocates noted.
The need for more foster care homes is great in Clark County and Nevada.
“In Clark County alone, we have over 3,000 children in foster care on any given day but fewer than 900 licensed foster homes,” said Kennedy.
Republican Assemblymember Ken Gray, who signed on as a cosponsor of the bill, said it could be a “game changer.” He added that Lyon County currently only has seven foster families.
“We have so few beds,” he said. “Not only do these kids have to be taken away from their parents, they have to be taken away from their communities sometimes, and put in other counties and other schools. You’re adding more damage on top of damage that’s already been done.”

A federal judge sentenced Raymond Bledsoe to life for beating Black jazz saxophonist Steven Harvey to death in a Kansas City park because of his race. 
A Missouri jury had acquitted Bledsoe of murder, and afterward, he reportedly bragged to his girlfriend about killing a “n—–” and getting away with it. 
Harvey’s family members, Alvin Sykes and the Steve Harvey Justice Campaign convinced federal authorities to pursue the case. At the time, the conviction was reportedly the fourth under the Civil Rights Act of 1968. 
In 2013, federal corrections authorities denied parole to Bledsoe. To date, he remains the longest serving inmate convicted under that Civil Rights Act. 
Sykes later helped bring about both the Justice Department’s reopening of the Emmett Till case and the passage of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. 
Sykes died in 2021, and his New York Times obituary read, “Though he never took a bar exam, Mr. Sykes was a brilliant legal and legislative operator whose admirers included City Council members, politicians and U.S. attorneys general from both parties. … He led a monk’s life in the name of social justice. He rarely held a job, wore second hand clothing and lacked a permanent address for long stretches of time, staying with friends instead and living off donations and, later, speaker fees. He never learned to drive and so walked everywhere, most often to the reference section of the library in Kansas City, Missouri, where he did his research, or to a booth at a restaurant that he used as an informal office, his papers surrounded by cups of coffee and stubbed-out cigarettes.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/06120254/May6-AlvinSykesCentral-Library_0.jpg,,,2025-05-06 09:06:04.288758

“It kind of is a calling for me,” Doering says.
She’s just spent her afternoon helping an Afghan family apply for WIC benefits. Doering’s group of church volunteers helps new arrivals with everything — finding housing, grocery shopping, English lessons, trips to the mosque. Some are tasks that at one point may have been done by staffers at Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services, or IRIS.
But the refugee resettlement agency has been besieged by federal funding cuts. It was recently forced to close its main New Haven office space, and its staff of 100 is down to less than 50. Its Welcome Corps program, a national model for resettlement, was forced to shutter.
Volunteers like Doering have always been part of IRIS’s model, but in the face of downsizing, they’re more critical than ever.
“I don’t call it a burden,” Doering says. “I think if you volunteer you want to help. It makes it a little more challenging, let’s just say that.”
“The fact that these volunteers have stepped up and said ‘I will help’ – it’s working,” she says. “We’re solving these things. We’re getting it done.”
Today, Doering is getting things done for the Zazi family – Javid Zazi, his wife, and two young children. At their home in a Hartford suburb, Zazi, who worked with the U.S. military in his native Afghanistan, recounts hiding from and fleeing the Taliban.

“The situation was very difficult,” Zazi says. “It was very dangerous.”
But since arriving in Connecticut earlier this year, Zazi says Doering’s volunteers have helped the family get settled.
“They do everything for us, like personal growth, skills, shopping, development, goals, education,” Zazi says. “Everything they are doing for us, like a family. They are very kind people.”
‘It’s more than a job’
IRIS is known for those wrap-around services – everything from language classes to legal aid.
They even run a food pantry in New Haven. Executive Director Maggie Mitchell Salem spoke there recently.
“As the executive director of IRIS, I’m proud to say that because federal funding is cut, it does not stop our care for the people that we serve,” Mitchell Salem said.
The pantry could have been yet another casualty of hard times. But thanks to a collaboration with another local organization, the doors will stay open. Mitchell Salem says it’s just another way IRIS is getting creative. She says some former staff members are continuing their work completely pro bono.

“Many of them are,” Mitchell Salem says in an interview. “IRIS is more than just your employer. I think all of us that work there – it’s more than a job. You know, you see the need in the world. You see what we all see on screens now: people who are suffering.”
The Trump White House claims the U.S. lacks the ability to take in large numbers of migrants and refugees. Mitchell Salem sees the administration’s funding cuts and restrictions on refugee admissions as devastating and wrong.
“I feel like every day keeping us going is a way to say ‘you don’t tell us how to live our values,’ that ‘you’ being the U.S. government,” she says. “We will serve our mission because our mission is integral to who we are as Americans, to our nation, to our very DNA as a nation of immigrants. And we’re not stopping that.”
Mitchell Salem says IRIS will forge ahead in large part due to community support. That’s good news for new arrivals like Zazi.
“I’m very happy,” Zazi says. “I’m so glad to be with the volunteer teams. I’m so optimistic for the future – for the bright, bright new future.”
It’s a bright new future IRIS hopes to be able to provide for all those it serves, even as it continues to navigate through precarious times.

HB 285, sponsored by Rep. Jamie Kiel, R-Russellville, would require any law enforcement agency issuing citations to those under the age of 19 to make a “reasonable effort to notify the driver’s emergency contact, if available.” The bill says the contact could be a single phone call, text message, or letter sent by U.S. mail.
“You may know this, or you may not, but your child could be driving your vehicle, using your gas, your insurance, you are liable for that child, but if that child were to get a ticket, you may never know about it,” Kiel told members of the committee during the meeting.

The House of Representatives approved the bill on March 23. There are three days left in the 2025 legislative session.
Several amendments were proposed for that section of the code to lessen the burden on law enforcement when they issue the citation. First, a single phone call was enough to be considered a “reasonable attempt.”
Language was inserted into the bill that permitted text messages and sending a letter by U.S. mail. The legislation excludes citations for illegally parking the vehicle.
April Vafeas, whose son was killed in a collision in June 2022 after not wearing his seatbelt, told the committee that the bill was important to her.
“After he died, I found three traffic citations for not wearing his seatbelt,” she said. “They were all in our hometown and I had no idea. I am the kind of person who thinks that a seatbelt is important.”
Several members on the committee continued to express concerns about how much additional time that it would take law enforcement to comply with the provisions in the legislation because of the volume of citations they regularly issue.
“We keep putting guidelines, and we keep putting everything on law enforcement, I have got to vote against this just from being out there and writing tickets and knowing what is going on,” Sen. Lance Bell, R-Pell City, who has experience working as a law enforcement officer. “There is just no way. How do you find out the driver’s emergency contact? Things of that nature.”
Some senators on the committee suggested placing information on a website that parents can access to determine whether their children receive a citation.
The committee approved the legislation with the understanding that they will continue to update the bill as it moves into the Senate chamber.

As the top Democratic leader in her chamber, she had already spent the legislative session in constant, vocal opposition to the Republican-dominated legislative agenda.
“I thought: ‘Oh, this stupid flag bill once again,’” Wintrow said. “I’ll just vote ‘no’ quietly because I’ve just really been in people’s grille about things.”
But then the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Ben Toews, began passing out flyers about the legislation, one of two proposed bills to limit which flags can be flown at schools and on state and local government property. The only photos on the handout were of rainbow-striped Pride flags flying in Boise: one on a flagpole in front of City Hall, and then others on light poles along Harrison Boulevard, two blocks from Wintrow’s home.

“When he sat that picture in front of me on that desk, I thought: ‘That’s enough. Just always picking and bullying,’” Wintrow said. “The state’s going to tell us what to do, when they can’t even address the larger problems like affordable housing? That’s what’s on people’s minds. A good working wage, health care. It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.”
In recent weeks, both Idaho and Utah have enacted bans that prohibit Pride flags from being displayed on government property, pitting lawmakers in the Republican-dominated legislatures against the more progressive capitals of Boise and Salt Lake City, where the flags are often flown at city hall.











It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.


– Idaho Democratic state Sen. Melissa Wintrow


In Utah, the law allows the state flag, the U.S. flag, U.S. military flags, the POW/MIA flag, local government flags, tribal nation flags, university and school flags and Olympic flags. Idaho’s list is similar, but includes a provision in the school flag law that prohibits flags with political viewpoints, “including but not limited to flags or banners regarding a political party, race, sexual orientation, gender, or a political ideology.”
Lawmakers in Florida, Texas and at least 13 other states are considering similar flag prohibitions, said Logan Casey, director of policy research with the Movement Advancement Project, which studies LGBTQ+ rights. The flag bills go beyond symbolism, Casey said. Rather, they are part of a broad and coordinated legislative attack on LGBTQ+ people that seeks to strip them of rights and erase or make difficult their participation in public life.
“Sometimes those attacks are very material, like denying access to health care or the ability to participate safely in public life and activities,” Casey said. “Sometimes they’re a little more symbolic, like these flag bills.”

‘Get rid of everything’

The rainbow-colored Pride flag was conjured up by artist and drag queen Gilbert Baker in 1978, at the suggestion of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, as a symbol of progress and pride for that year’s San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade. Since then, the rainbow-colored flag and its many design iterations have grown into worldwide emblems of solidarity with LGBTQ+ rights.
Although the laws in Idaho and Utah don’t ban Pride flags specifically, bill sponsors and their supporters made it clear they want to see such flags removed from city halls, schools and state buildings. Idaho state Rep. Ted Hill, a Republican who sponsored the bill limiting which flags can fly at schools, said in an interview that Pride flags are disruptive to classroom learning because discussion about them takes up “an amazing amount of political bandwidth.”
“The best way to do it is to get rid of everything,” said Hill, who represents Eagle, a suburb northwest of Boise. “So the only thing you have in the classroom is the American flag, the state flag. And people will say inclusivity and all this. Well, the American flag is as inclusive as it can get.”
Despite the new law, Boise Mayor Lauren McLean, a Democrat, continues to fly a Pride flag in front of City Hall, just below the city’s own and adjacent to poles flying the U.S. and state of Idaho flags. The Pride flag’s presence, within view of the state Capitol, elicited a sternly worded letter from Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican.

Idaho’s law, which went into effect April 3, has no penalty for local governments or officials who fly flags in defiance of the ban, an oversight lawmakers told Labrador they’ll rectify in subsequent legislative sessions. Instead, the law relies on “the good will of elected officials for its enforcement,” Labrador wrote, warning McLean that she should “comply with the law out of a sense of duty to your oath of office.”
He threatened, too, that lawmakers could “deny state tax revenues and other appropriations to the City of Boise or any other governmental entity that does not follow state law.”
McLean countered that the new law is unconstitutional, and that the city will challenge threats to withhold funding. Pride flags have flown in Boise for a decade, she told Labrador, and represent a commitment to “a safe and welcoming city where everyone means just that — everyone.”
“The Constitutional rights of our residents are not subject to — cannot be subject to — the political whims of legislative disapproval,” McLean wrote, “and we will not step back from them simply because the principles our community cherishes make some in state government uncomfortable.”
Boise’s city council is considering a resolution confirming that any flags it flies, including Pride flags, are official city flags — a move the council says will ensure it is complying with state law. In the meantime, the city will “continue to fly the flags on City Hall Plaza that represent our community and speak to our values of caring for people and welcoming all,” McLean said in a statement.
Early on Easter morning, several people climbed a ladder propped up next to the city’s flagpole to cover the Pride flag and a separate flag (honoring organ and tissue donation) with trash bags. They also raised the Appeal to Heaven flag, a Revolutionary War-era flag that has come to represent sympathy to the Christian nationalist movement and to President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. A few hours later, the mayor lowered the flags, which are on a locked halyard, to remove the trash bags and the Appeal to Heaven flag.
It capped a challenging sequence of events in Boise and nearby Meridian, which drew national attention this spring when school officials ordered a middle school teacher to take down a sign with the phrase “Everyone is welcome here” from her classroom. Amid the backlash, people in Boise printed T-shirts and yard signs in support of the teacher and the sign’s message.

Similar signs emerged in Boise and surrounding communities this spring after school officials told a middle school teacher to take down a sign in her classroom containing the phrase.

The mayor’s response to the flag law and the support for the classroom message aren’t directly connected, but both reflect how many in the community insist on sending a welcoming message at this moment in American history, said Christina Bruce-Bennion, executive director of Boise’s Wassmuth Center for Human Rights, which helped coordinate support for the teacher.

‘It is very targeted’

In Salt Lake City, the flag ban threatens to end a long-standing annual tradition. Typically, the mayor’s office kicks off Pride Month festivities in June with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall, said Chad Call, executive director of the Utah Pride Center, which puts on the state’s annual Pride festivities. Events include a parade through the streets of Salt Lake City with a 200-foot Pride flag — which remains a legal form of First Amendment expression and has taken place most years since 1997.
“We have a city council that wants to celebrate Pride month,” Call said. “They want to celebrate the queer community in the month of June. And then we have a state government that does not want that happening in our capital city. And so it is very targeted.”

One of the flag bill’s sponsors, state Rep. Trevor Lee, said in an interview that his legislation was prompted by constituents who told him they’re “sick and tired of seeing a political agenda being pushed in their face” on government property, particularly with flags featuring transgender representation.
“It makes people feel uncomfortable if it’s something they don’t agree with,” said Lee, who represents a district north of Salt Lake City. “And so we’re trying to keep it very specific and let schools focus on teaching the things that they need to, and let government buildings just fly their city flag for heaven’s sakes, or the state flag or the American flag.”
One Utah parent, Republican activist Aaron Bullen, said he began objecting to Pride flags several years ago after one of his children, then a fifth grader, was “visibly upset” after school one day. Bullen said his son told him he’d seen what’s known as a Progress Pride flag, a newer iteration of the original rainbow-striped flag. It includes an arrow on the left side composed of pink, blue and white stripes to represent transgender people, as well as brown and black stripes to represent queer people of color. The flag was in the school’s computer lab.
Bullen said he complained to school leaders at the district, south of Salt Lake City, and the flag came down. But Bullen felt as though the flag’s presence undermined what he and his wife teach at home and model to their children as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, particularly how they interpret the church’s stance on transgender people and marriage for same-sex couples.
“It says, basically, ‘we approve of gay marriage’ when that flag is up,” Bullen said. “And that’s something that my religion is explicitly against. And so you have a teacher of my son, a person in authority that they’d like to be able to trust and to follow the instructions of, but they’re saying, ‘your parents who taught you this other thing, they’re wrong. Your religion is wrong.’ That’s what that flag means.”










It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would.


– Aaron Bullen, a Utah parent and Republican activist


He added: “It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would. Parents have the fundamental right and responsibility to rear their children. And it’s not a school’s place to oppose the religion of the parents or the teachings of the parents.”
Unlike in Idaho, Utah’s flag ban carries a $500 fine per day for failure to comply with the law. But in Utah, the law took effect without Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’s signature. The governor declined to sign the bill into law, saying the state’s residents are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix.”
Call, of the Utah Pride Center, said that while it’s discouraging for LGBTQ+ people to witness their representation further erased in public spaces, they refuse in Utah to allow the flag law to diminish the spirit of their Pride events, among the largest in the nation.
“Our counterculture here is really, really strong,” Call said. “And I think the thing that probably defines our Utah Pride as being kind of unique is the incredibly strong community that it brings together. There’s tens, hundreds of thousands of people that come out to support it.”

The son of independent senator and former governor Angus King Jr. is running as a Democrat in the 2026 gubernatorial election, according to a news release from his campaign. His candidacy paperwork was not available on the Maine Ethics Commission website as of early Tuesday morning. 
With multiple other Democrats in the race, including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, and Kenneth Pinet, King III will first face a primary election next June. 
Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under several Republican presidents, was the first major Republican candidate to enter the race to succeed Gov. Janet Mills, who is termed out. 
“I’m running for governor to build a better Maine — where it’s easier to start and grow a small business, where we can build our economy through innovation and hard work, and where it’s not so hard to afford the basic things you need to live and raise a family in the state we all love,” King III said. 
King III said he is running for governor to bring down costs for families, build more housing and help small businesses create good jobs. He has worked in the renewable energy sector having founded Peaks Renewables, which develops renewable natural gas and green hydrogen at a facility in Clinton.
Born in Skowhegan, King III now lives in Portland with his wife and two children. His campaign announcement video can be found on YouTube.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mellie MacEachern: Health care administrator, fire thyself.","This commentary is by Mellie MacEachern of Craftsbury. She moved to Vermont in 2021 with her husband to begin a family. She is a freelance health care policy reporter for industry publications in the Southwestern U.S., and formerly worked in health education and advocacy for Planned Parenthood Arizona. Last summer, she gave birth at Copley Hospital’s birthing center.I’ve worked in health care policy for 10 years, with a specific emphasis on reproductive health care access. In this time, it has become public knowledge that the United States leads the developed world in maternal mortality, and maternal morbidity has gone woefully understudied. Rather than addressing this issue, it has only become worse. A new report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association demonstrates that between 2018 and 2022, rates of maternal mortality rose by more than 25%.The brunt of these increases is borne by racially marginalized women in Black and Indigenous communities. But another major factor in these high rates of maternal mortality is geographic. Rural distance from health care services is highly correlated with poorer outcomes in maternal health care, lower uptake of preventative services and higher risk for postpartum complications.Except in Vermont. This state — despite its limited resources and difficulty attracting providers — is one of the best places in the country not only to give birth but also to be a woman with any sort of health concern. The Commonwealth Fund 2024 State Scorecard for Women’s Health and Reproductive Care not only locates Vermont as one of the states with the lowest rates of maternal death, but also ranks it second overall for performance on women’s health care.Copley Hospital’s birthing center is crucial for this ranking, this bucking of a horrifying national trend by a little rural state. Late last year, dozens of midwives, doctors and administrators signed an open letter to the community raising awareness that the hospital’s leadership has proposed shuttering the birthing center to cut costs.READ MORE





 


Practitioners and community members: Don’t close Copley Hospital’s birthing center 

by Opinion 
December 19, 2024, 7:01 amDecember 18, 2024, 2:56 pm 



I’ve also been made aware of Copley’s supposed financial difficulty. In the wake of Covid-19, hospitals across the country have slashed budgets by locating excesses in the actual delivery of care. It’s interesting that these excesses are never rooted out of the administrative side of hospital operations.Even the Act 167 report by consulting firm Oliver Wyman, which Copley’s consultants are using as guidance for hospital policy, notes that administrative costs at the University of Vermont Medical Center were remarkably high, contributing to burdensome costs for patients and payors. In a Front Porch Forum post last week, the Copley board of trustees explained that while UVM charges $17,000 for births, Copley only charges $7,000. They fail to explain how this could be relevant when the report they cite is explicit about the unfairness of UVM’s costs and the reason they’re so high.National estimates suggest that over half of all hospital employees are administrators — not those who deliver care. This fact has always interested me, so when I was visiting the birthing clinic at Copley Hospital prior to the birth of my daughter last summer, I asked the nurse how many administrative superiors her nursing unit had. She named six or seven positions in the 25-bed facility that oversaw nurses alone, and those nursing managers did not practice.Managers tend to cost facilities quite a bit more than actual nurse providers. It may be worth investigating these excesses before condemning an untold number of rural women to assured medical complications or even death in the name of an under-scrutinized bottom line. Administrators should consider cutting themselves before turning on these crucial resources.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mellie MacEachern: Health care administrator, fire thyself.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-06 08:02:01.693069

PCBs can cause cancer, as well as affect the body’s nervous, immune, reproductive and endocrine systems, according to the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation.PCBs are burrowed in the cinder block walls at Hartford High School, including the much-used gymnasium, auditorium and cafeteria, Garthwaite said.“To leave it in the walls, not only are we rolling the dice on air quality, we are also kicking a huge expensive liability down the road to someone else,” he said.Elsewhere in the district, Hartford Memorial Middle School tested negative for PCBs.Air testing at the White River School was conducted over April break and the results are expected in the coming weeks, Garthwaite said.Two other elementary buildings, Dothan Brook School and Ottauquechee School, which were built in the 1990s, are exempt from testing because PCBs were banned in 1979 by the federal Toxic Substances Control Act.Despite the mandate from lawmakers, money the state appropriated for testing has run out, leaving districts such Hartford to foot the bill for testing. Additionally, there are no state funds available to help with construction or remediation costs.“We have to do it. We didn’t choose Act 74. None of us in this building chose to have this building built when it was built, and we sure as hell didn’t choose to have contaminants used in its building,” Hartford High School Principal Nelson Fogg said at the April 23 meeting. “Too bad, that’s the state we’re in. So we can’t really dictate what happens to us, but we have all the authority in the world to deal with how we respond to what is happening to us.”Before PCB removal can begin, the district must fund what Garthwaite estimated to be “hundreds of thousands of dollars in soft costs,” which include further testing, along with working with architects and engineers to come up with a plan for a temporary kitchen to prepare school meals and relocate the heating plant, which is housed in the northeast corner of the gym, among other challenges.“Kids got to eat. We have to have phys ed. We have to have performing arts,” Garthwaite said during the meeting. “We have to do what we do and all of that has to happen while this chaos is going on around us. This is much more than a planned renovation where we have years to consider what we’re doing. We’re dropping a bomb here.”As much as $6.5 million of the $21 million bond voters approved last year will be used this summer to replace the roofs at the Ottauquechee School and Dothan Brook School, complete a drainage project at Ottauquechee School, replace the chimney and upgrade the elevator at the middle school, as well as repair and replace doors at various district buildings, Garthwaite said.School board Chair Nancy Russell appeared supportive of Garthwaite’s request to put money toward the PCB remediation planning and bulk sampling.“When we voted for that bond, we did not know that this was going to happen,” she said at the April 23 meeting. “I would hope that our public would be understanding enough to say, ‘This is a big emergency here and we need to take care of it.’ We need to be putting these kids and our staff first.”But Wilder resident Colin Butler told the School Board he was uncomfortable with using part of the bond to pay for PCB remediation planning costs.“The voters voted to spend $21 million on a list of stuff that the board told the public was absolutely critical,” he said during the meeting.Garthwaite is currently putting together requests for proposals to do additional bulk sampling at the high school and tech center and for phase one of the abatement project. Phase one would include demolishing and rebuilding the culinary arts kitchen and classroom, the health sciences classrooms, the auditorium, the cafeteria/kitchen and the gym.“The thought behind it is we do those spaces first, reconstruct them, and use them as swing spaces while we address the remainder of the impacted spaces,” Garthwaite said. “I would like to start abatement activities, removal of toxins as quickly as possible after graduation. That’s the intent.”The school district does not have any money set aside for the full remediation project.Right now, school officials are hopeful funding for the work will come from the Monsanto Corp. — which manufactured PCBs from the 1930s through the 1970s that other companies used for building materials. The district has joined about 100 other Vermont school districts — including a dozen in the Upper Valley — in a lawsuit against the company.Monsanto’s parent company, Bayer, has been settling other lawsuits brought against Monsanto for its manufacturing of PCBs. Last year, for example, the company agreed to multimillion-dollar settlements with the cities of Los Angeles and Seattle, according to news reports.“There’s no reason to think that we won’t recover these costs,” Garthwaite said. “When we get to the point where we have actual numbers related to abatement, that will be the point at which we discuss our funding options.”PCB contamination has already displaced some Hartford students.At the beginning of the current school year, the technical center’s culinary arts program relocated to a former American Legion hall off Sykes Mountain Avenue because PCB levels were found to be at “immediate action levels” as defined by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation.Culinary classes will remain at the off-campus site for the next school year as well, Garthwaite said.Two health sciences classrooms also had to be relocated, but officials were able to find space for them in district buildings.The School Board is scheduled to meet Wednesday and discussions about how to fund the “soft costs” are expected to continue then.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Hartford likely to demolish large portions of high school because of PCB contamination.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hartford-Area-Career-and-Technical-Center.jpg?fit=749%2C500&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-06 08:02:01.693069

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)For a second year in a row, Washington police accountability advocates have seen their priorities fall flat in Olympia.
They entered this year’s session wanting to grant the attorney general stronger oversight of local police departments. They also wanted to create an independent prosecutor to handle cases when police use deadly force; restrict when officers can pull drivers over; block law enforcement from lying during interrogations; and set new standards for police chiefs and sheriffs.
None of those proposals will become law this year. None even received votes from either chamber of the Washington Legislature, despite growing Democratic majorities.
“This is the saddest time of my life, because this is the world I have to leave my children,” said Nickeia Hunter, an advocate from the Coalition for Police Accountability, whose brother was killed by police. “We have to stay on top of fighting for what we started.”
It’s a far cry from a few years ago when police accountability gained momentum in the Legislature in the wake of George Floyd’s murder by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020 and the social uprising that followed. 
In the immediate aftermath, lawmakers passed a suite of laws to set additional guardrails for police. This included restricting when they could pursue people suspected of crimes — a move that drew such staunch pushback, lawmakers rolled back the policy last year. 
They also banned police from using chokeholds, created a statewide use of force database and established a first-of-its-kind Office of Independent Investigations to look into deadly force cases.
Legislators’ biggest move on policing this year was acquiescing to Gov. Bob Ferguson’s ask for $100 million to hire more officers, a request that drew frustration from many progressive Democrats. 
Steve Strachan, the executive director of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, noted that officials are still waiting to see how some of the big changes made in 2021 are playing out and called the shift since then “a more balanced approach.”
The difficult budget year also acted as a buzzsaw that sheared away police accountability bills that would’ve cost money. 
Meanwhile, fears of rising crime have emboldened opposition to policies believed to hinder officers trying to do their jobs. In 2023, the last year with available statewide data, the state saw a significant decrease in year-over-year violent crimes after years of increases, according to the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs.
More broadly, this has all powered a pendulum swing in the establishment conversation from fixing policing to helping police.
“Increased accountability helps everyone be able to do their job well, and to make sure that they have the supports and the infrastructure in place to do their job well,” said Rep. Darya Farivar, a Seattle Democrat and leading police accountability proponent in the Legislature. “It is, frankly, a little confusing to me why some folks don’t seem to understand that.”
A new sheriff in town
Ferguson’s rhetoric in his first few months in office played a part in the paradigm shift this year. 
Starting on the campaign trail and in his inaugural address, the new Democratic governor, who supported police accountability efforts while attorney general, was steadfast in his request for a new $100 million grant program to bring on more law enforcement officers. He hopes the money will turn the tide on Washington’s long-held last-place ranking nationwide in police staffing per capita.
After not including the funding in their initial proposals, Democrats relented under threat of veto to include it in the final budget that’s now on the governor’s desk. 
This sucked away some money that could’ve been used for police oversight measures, said Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma.
Strachan said that the funding tracks with the public’s priorities.
“There’s a general consensus, I think, among a lot of residents in our state, that, yes, we want to make sure that law enforcement is doing a good job and is being fair and transparent, but also that we need more officers and we need to support public safety,” he said.
Departments can use the $100 million for more than just officers on the beat. Under House Bill 2015, the money can also go toward peer counselors, behavioral health co-responders, training and other broader public safety efforts.
While Republicans generally supported the idea behind the grant program, many of them believe Washington’s police staffing difficulties are caused more by the state’s perceived hostility toward law enforcement than anything else.
The money also comes with strings. 
To access grant funding, for example, cities and counties need to either implement a new 0.1% sales tax for public safety or have already imposed a similar tax. They also need to follow state model policies as well as collect and report use of force data.
In a statement, Ferguson said increasing hiring and adopting police accountability measures “are not mutually exclusive.”
“They can, and should, go hand in hand,” the governor said. “For example, HB 2015 creates a $100 million grant program to hire more law enforcement officers and contains strong accountability conditions for agencies that will receive the grants.”
Ferguson has not yet approved the final budget or House Bill 2015. He has a couple weeks to do so.
Looking forward
Trudeau hopes once local law enforcement can address the staffing issue, the discussion can turn back to accountability.
Rep. Roger Goodman, D-Kirkland, plans to spend the interim before next year’s legislative session meeting with police officials. He wants to mend the relationship between Olympia and on-the-ground law enforcement.
“It’s, I believe, incumbent on me to do some repair work with the police community, because it’s been a pretty aggressive effort, all well meaning and I think good policy, but it needs to be done in a more collaborative fashion,” said Goodman, the chair of the House Community Safety Committee.
Hunter, with the Coalition for Police Accountability, described the path forward as “bleak.”
“But we’ll be damned if we sit down and be like, ‘Oh, we’re just going to have to have to accept it,’” she said.
With a short, 60-day legislative session in 2026, she isn’t hopeful for major gains. But she and others plan to keep telling their stories in hopes of convincing people about the importance of the issue.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1592-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-06 07:03:07.913941

(Photo by Getty Images)Have you ever heard of a “facility fee”?  
Even if you haven’t, I’ll bet that you’ve been charged one without even realizing it.  
Facility fees are becoming more and more common as a way for large hospital systems to charge extra for basic appointments at the clinics they own, driving up the cost of health care.
I learned about facility fees in April of 2024, after my husband took our 3-year-old daughter to a follow-up appointment for stomach pain. The clinic took her vital signs and then she played with cars on the floor while my husband and the doctor discussed her medication, eating habits, etc. It was a basic appointment that lasted about 15 minutes. 
We were shocked when the bill came. We had a $201 charge for the doctor’s services, which made sense. But the bill also included a $423 charge for “outpatient hospital services.” 
You can imagine our confusion since our child didn’t set foot inside a hospital for this appointment. After several rounds of customer service calls to both our health insurance and M Health Fairview, we learned that this charge was a “facility fee” that M Health Fairview was allowed to charge us because the clinic was affiliated with a hospital.  
No extra care or services were provided for this fee, and the clinic is not physically located within a hospital.
Traditionally, facility fees have been used by hospitals to cover the extraordinary cost of running a highly complicated, 24/7 facility.  
But in recent years, large hospital-owned systems have begun charging these fees at their affiliated clinics for routine care. 
The consolidation of medical care exacerbates the problem. A 2024 study by the Public Interest Research Group found that “When hospitals acquire independent clinics and physician practices, the new owner can raise prices at those practices by charging facility fees under the new hospital affiliation.  As a result, individuals and families now face these additional charges in the same clinics and doctors’ offices they have been going to for years.”  
A separate 2022 study found that because of facility fees, patients with commercial health insurance pay an average of 45% more for appointments in hospital outpatient departments compared to the same services provided in freestanding physician offices.  
Current state law offers inadequate protection against this practice. Minnesota law requires providers to notify patients in advance of an appointment that they may be charged a facility fee, potentially resulting in a higher out-of-pocket expense. 
This even applies to telehealth appointments as well, so you don’t even have to set foot in a facility to be charged this facility fee.  
The law also requires the facility to post the information on their website and in spaces accessible by patients. I asked M Health Fairview when they notified me of this charge, and their reply was that the sign at the front desk is the notification.
This bare-bones notification requirement puts the entire burden on the patient to notice and understand the sign, then do the legwork of calling their insurance company to see if they may be on the hook for an extra fee of an unknown amount. 
Additionally, a complicated sign in English is not adequate notification for anyone who is visually impaired or who does not read English.  Finally, while my metro-located family has the luxury of choice and were able to find another provider for our daughter who does not charge this fee, families in Greater Minnesota may not have that opportunity and end up geographically trapped into paying these higher costs.
These facility fees are another way for Minnesotans to be price-gouged out of getting the basic health care they need.  
That is why I’m working with my state legislators to ban hospital-affiliated clinics from charging facility fees for routine clinical care and telehealth appointments. Some may argue that this ban would take away an important revenue stream that pays for facilities, but the proposed bill does not affect facility fees for emergency care or inpatient hospital care.  Additionally, state law cannot supersede federal law, so this change will not impact Medicaid/Medicare payments to facilities.
There is still a larger debate to be had about our healthcare system and how it is funded. Major structural issues need to be addressed, not just in Minnesota, but nationwide. 
In the meantime, this bill will help protect patients from a predatory billing practice.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Tessa Hulls was making sandwiches in the Alaska Capitol when she learned she had won a Pulitzer Prize.
Her book, “Feeding Ghosts,” is a nonfiction graphic novel that documents three generations of women in her family, starting with her grandmother, who was a journalist at the time of the Chinese Communist Revolution.
It had already won three national awards by the time the Pulitzer announcement came on Monday, placing her among America’s top writers. She won for the category of memoir or autobiography, which is in its third year and comes with a $15,000 prize.
“I’m having a surreal day,” she said, shortly after this year’s winners were announced. “Now I’ve got to go back to making sandwiches.”
A few hours later, she had more time to talk to reporters and still appeared dazed by the news.
“It’s basically the highest award someone can get. And as somebody who spent nine years learning and working on this history, I felt a huge amount of pressure to try and get it right, because I knew that I would end up speaking for a generation that I didn’t live through and would come to be seen as an authority on these things,” she said.
“And so making this book made me both a historian and a journalist, and so to have this recognition at this high level, that this role that I stepped into, that I guess I got it right — it means a lot as somebody who really wants to be careful with the material I’m working with.”

Hulls’ book talks about a century of Chinese history that isn’t well known in the United States, using her family’s history to tell the story. In the process, she uncovers her grandmother’s memoir, which she learns might be full of twisted information.
“It’s really about how mothers and daughters both damage and save one another,” she said.
The book explores personal trauma, and reviewers have frequently found connections to that issue in their own lives.
“I think almost everyone has a complicated relationship with their mother, so that’s who my book is for: people with complicated relationships with their mothers,” she said. “I think in my case, it was a little bit more concretely tied to specific history, but I think all of us are trying to understand our parents and why they ended up the ways that they did.”
Hulls, who was raised in Northern California, has lived an itinerant life that has included stays in all seven continents. To see the world, she follows the food, getting jobs in food service, she said. When it came to Antarctica, she followed a job opening for a chef.
For the past four months, she’s been working in the Alaska Capitol’s lounge — the building’s version of a cafeteria — serving food to legislators, staff and visitors.
When the Pulitzer winners were announced, it was lunchtime, and the lounge was full of lawmakers.
“We were just in there when she got the call. The whole lounge gave her a round of applause,” said Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham.
Two representatives hurried downhill from the Capitol to the nearest bookstore, Alaska Robotics, which was already planning a book signing for Hulls on Tuesday.
One of the legislators grabbed a copy of “Feeding Ghosts,” then reconsidered and got three more, said the store’s owner, Pat Race.
Back at the Capitol, Hulls kept working behind the lounge’s food service counter until she finished her day.
Hulls enjoys cycling and the outdoors, so much so that she became known among friends for cycling to their weddings.
Juneau’s glum spring weather has given her plenty of time to be artistic, but she’s also looking forward to the end of the legislative session.
“Next month, I’ve blocked out a week that just says, ‘Tessa, go be alone in the backcountry.’ So that’s what I’m doing. Like, first available opportunity,” she said.

Pope Francis’ pontificate marked a distinct shift in the Catholic Church’s engagement with the Muslim world. While his predecessors fostered dialogue and tolerance, Francis sought more active engagement with Muslims, particularly in the Middle East.
Francis framed his efforts around the “culture of encounter,” which he explained in a 2016 morning meditation. Drawing inspiration from the Gospel of Luke, Chapter 7, he noted that this approach was about “active engagement” rather than passive observation. He urged individuals to embody Jesus by “not just seeing, but looking; not just hearing, but listening; not just passing people by, but stopping with them.”
In my 2025 book “Beyond Dialogue – Building Bonds Between Christians and Muslims,” I stress the importance of moving beyond mere tolerance to collaboration as a way to engage with religious diversity − something that Francis demonstrated in his interfaith dialogue efforts with Muslim countries.
Francis in Iraq after IS destruction
In 2021, Francis visited regions in Iraq once held by the Islamic State, or IS. This was the first papal visit to the country. He held masses in Irbil, the capital of the Kurdistan region of Iraq, and he addressed a gathering in the courtyard of the Al-Tahera church, the hub of the Syriac Catholic population in Mosul. The historic 18th-century church was partially destroyed by IS during its occupation of the city from 2014 to 2017. An estimated 5,000 Christians were killed and some 125,000 displaced in Iraq during that time.

At Church Square in Mosul, where there are four churches, Francis prayed for the victims of the conflict and called for harmonious coexistence between Christians and Muslims. He also invited displaced Christians to return to their homes and praised the young Iraqi volunteers – both Christians and Muslims – working side by side to rebuild the churches and mosques destroyed by IS.
In addition, he convened an interreligious gathering in Ur, the birthplace of Abraham, a prophet revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims.
His actions not only brought together Christians and Muslims but also helped break down stereotypes.
The year of tolerance
In 2019 he visited the United Arab Emirates, marking the first papal visit to the Arabian Peninsula, the birthplace of Islam. The visit coincided with the Emirati government proclaiming 2019 the Year of Tolerance, promoting coexistence, diversity and respect.
During his visit in Abu Dhabi in 2019, Francis celebrated a historic Catholic Mass in Zayed Sports City, drawing 180,000 attendees from over 100 countries, for which the UAE government declared a special holiday.
This unprecedented event challenged negative Western stereotypes about the Arabian Peninsula’s religious intolerance. The UAE Constitution, for example, guarantees religious freedom to all people, albeit with restrictions on proselytization among non-Islamic communities. It also offered a counternarrative of unity between Christians and Muslims in a region often viewed through a lens of religious strife and war.

Francis’ visit to the UAE also culminated in some crucial interfaith initiatives. In Abu Dhabi, Francis and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar University, Ahmed El-Tayeb, cosigned the document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together. The document stresses the need to work together to promote a “culture of reciprocal respect.” While the Emirati president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, did not directly sign the document, he supported the interfaith initiatives that followed Francis’ trip.
This document led to the setting up of the Higher Committee of Human Fraternity, a collaborative project of a diverse groups of academic, cultural and religious leaders and entities from around the world. The committee created the Human Fraternity Education and Leadership for Peace program, a global youth movement. It also worked with the United Nations General Assembly to designate Feb. 4 as the International Day of Human Fraternity.
The Higher Committee of Human Fraternity also guided the construction of the Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi, a shared space for a church, mosque and synagogue that opened in 2023.
I had the opportunity to attend the opening ceremony of the Abrahamic Family House in 2023. It was a memorable experience. A Christian girl, a Muslim boy and Jewish boy each brought a cube representing each house of worship to the center platform of the forum and placed them side by side on the ground. The simple act mirrored the architectural design of the Abrahamic Family House by bringing the abstract concept of interfaith harmony to life in a concrete and relatable way. The Emirati youth provided a glimpse into what a tolerant future could look like.
History of Catholic-Muslim relations
The closest historical comparison to the Document on Human Fraternity is the Nostra Aetate, a declaration from the Second Vatican Council of 1965, when major reforms were initiated in the Catholic Church.
Nostra Aetate marked a turning point in the Catholic Church’s relations with Islam and all non-Christian traditions. After a history of conflict, limited positive engagement and mutual suspicion, it emphasized harmony, dialogue and respect with Islam.
However, the Document on Human Fraternity went further. For starters, it was a joint declaration with prominent Muslim leaders, signifying a deeper commitment to Christian-Muslim partnership, whereas Nostra Aetate was an internal Catholic document. The document called for grassroot activities, pointing to a more action-oriented approach to Christian and Muslim relations. Given that it was signed by the pope, it held influence within the Vatican leadership and among liberal cardinals. Its core principles are being integrated into pastoral initiatives and interreligious dialogue at the national and international levels.

Francis’ approach to Christian-Muslim dialogue differed notably from his predecessors. While Pope John Paul II focused on intellectual exchange and theological dialogue, Francis emphasized that they were insufficient on their own. In turn, he prioritized direct action and personal engagement with others as a means to a deeper understanding of the other.
Pope Benedict XVI, despite his commitment to dialogue, faced challenges due to remarks that outraged Muslims worldwide. During his Regensburg address in 2006, he mentioned a medieval dialogue attributed to Manuel II Palaiologus, the Byzantine emperor who reigned from 1391 to 1425, a period of growing power of the Ottoman Empire. Manuel II had criticized the concept of jihad in Islam and referred to Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, as “evil” and “inhuman.” While Benedict repeatedly emphasized that he was quoting Manuel II’s views on the relationship between faith and reason and not personally endorsing the emperor’s assessment of Islam, the pope’s comments were perceived as disrespectful toward the Islamic faith and its prophet.
Upon Francis’ death, the president of the UAE – Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan – described him as “a symbol of human fraternity, cultural coexistence and interfaith dialogue,” adding that he inspired “future generations in upholding the values of tolerance and mutual understanding.”
Francis’ gestures of solidarity, personal relationships and frequent visits to Muslim countries, I believe, laid a tangible foundation to move beyond dialogue and toward human fraternity.

Ritchie faces a May 20 execution date for the 2000 killing of Beech Grover law enforcement officer William Toney. The condemned man has been on death row since his conviction in 2002.
With clemency, the governor — in tandem with Indiana’s Parole Board — can elect to commute a death sentence to life imprisonment or grant a pardon for a criminal offense.

The five-member board heard from only Ritchie Monday morning and will make a final recommendation after a second hearing scheduled for next week.
“That night … was a train that left the station with no brakes, and multiple bad decisions led to losing the life of a man that should be here today,” Ritchie said during the meeting, which was live-streamed to the public. A small audience, including some members of the victim’s family and two correctional officers, were also present.
Ritchie sat before the board — flanked by two of his lawyers — in a meeting room at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. His hands were shackled. A cross necklace hung around his neck.
“The horrible actions that I took … there’s not a night that doesn’t go by that I don’t think about that person,” he continued. “I was just a kid … I didn’t care about myself, I didn’t care about anybody — nothing … I’ve ruined my life and other people’s lives, and I’m so sorry for that night.”
Another clemency hearing is scheduled for May 12 in Indianapolis. Friends and family of the slain police officer are expected to testify against Ritchie’s clemency petition at that meeting.  
After both hearings, the parole board will submit a recommendation for or against clemency to Gov. Mike Braun.
He will then make the final decision about whether to commute Ritchie’s death sentence to life in prison without parole. There is no timetable for the decision.

Gwen Horth, chairwoman of the parole board, said the hour-long meeting was an opportunity for Ritchie to “share whatever you want to make sure we hear” amid the clemency deliberations.
“I mean, I can read all of this,” Horth said, referring to piles of case documents. “But you’re an eyewitness to all of it. And as I think back to that Sept. 29, that Friday night in 2000 … we want to hear your decision-making that ultimately lost a life.”
Per court documents, the underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at the officer.
Board members asked Ritchie to retell his side of what happened and questioned him about his “thinking” before and during the fatal event.










I was just a kid … I didn't care about myself, I didn’t care about anybody — nothing. … I’ve ruined my life and other people's lives, and I’m so sorry for that night.


– Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie


Ritchie said that on the night of the incident, he was with a group trying to steal rims from car dealers. They took a van and parked it at an apartment complex. When they went back to get the van, a police officer pulled in behind them. 
“Everything sped up then. It was like if you had a fast-forward button on a movie, and you hit the button, everything sped out of control,” Ritchie said.
“I ended up hitting and killing him. That’s something I have to live with every day. I wish I could take that back,” Ritchie continued, crying. “I don’t blame him. He was doing his job. I should have never been in a stolen car. I should never have had a gun. I should have just did the right thing when I got out.” 
Ritchie additionally apologized to Toney’s family — and specifically regretted his treatment of the officer’s widow, Dee Dee. Toney was also survived by two daughters.
At the 2002 sentencing hearing, while Dee Dee Toney read her victim impact statement, she was repeatedly interrupted by Ritchie, who laughed and later called her a “b**ch” when she said Ritchie was a coward. 
“I wish I could go back to the day in court, because that man’s wife deserved to say everything she needed to say to me, and that punk kid should have just kept his mouth shut and let her say whatever she needed to say, because that was her right,” Ritchie said. “I had no business mouthing off to that lady. … I just wish I could go back to that kid and tell him to keep his damn mouth shut, to take it like a man.”
Ritchie’s pleas for life sentence, not execution
Still, the board asked Ritchie how he could guarantee that he’d be able to “live productively” and not “detract” from society if allowed to carry out a life sentence in prison. 
The inmate said his “decision skills were below par as a young man,” but now, at 44, “I can definitely say I’m not the young man I was then.”
For years, Ritchie “didn’t take credit” for his actions and “was in a dark hole.” But since receiving mental health counseling in prison, he’s learned “coping mechanisms” and “gotten control” of himself.

“I’m just not that kid I was 25 years ago. That kid was lost. He needed guidance, and I have guidance now,” Ritchie added. “I have a strong, positive family unit now — something I didn’t have back then. I have people that talk to me everyday and help me everyday to cope.”
He told the parole board he “would never hurt anybody again,” and that he’s “never attacked” a correctional officer, “not one time.” He admitted, however, to having past issues with other inmates.
“I had to cover myself with tattoos because I’m in a land of predators,” Ritchie said, with visible tattoos covering his neck and arms. 
During incarceration, he’s learned to cut hair and give others tattoos. Ritchie said he uses those skills as opportunities to talk to younger inmates.
“I try to be encouraging … I try to help,” he said. “I wish I had that guy that pulled me to the side, because you don’t listen to guys in suits. They’re going to listen to the old convict, washed up, tattooed.”
“What I did was horrible. But it’s a blessing, because William Toney’s life could best be served by me helping other guys,” Ritchie reiterated. “I’m never going to go home. I’m OK with that. But if I’m in here, I’m trying to help guys not reoffend, not come back to this system.”
Ritchie further stated that he “crave(s) education” and is currently “cramming” for an upcoming GED exam. He said he’d always struggled academically but recalled “thriving” at a summer boot camp as a teenager and wished he would have “that structure” throughout more of his formative years.
And while “it waivers from time to time,” Ritchie said he’s developed “a stronger faith” as he’s aged.
“I don’t want to be one of those fake Christians that only prays to God when you need his help, but, you don’t get nowhere if you don’t try sometimes,” he told the board. “So, I just try to take it day by day and just ask God to give me strength to make it through one more day.”
How clemency works
Ritchie’s clemency petition, signed by the inmate on April 22, argued that he was “born with a severely damaged brain due to prenatal alcohol exposure.”
“His mother drank nearly every day during her pregnancy with Ben. She also smoked marijuana daily and took other drugs,” according to the filing. Lawyers additionally noted that a geneticist diagnosed Ritchie with Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS), “meaning his brain damage limits Ben’s functioning to that similar to a person with intellectual disability.”
Clemency hearings scheduled for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie

Last week, the state’s high court justices rejected a request by Ritchie’s defense team for a new hearing to reconsider the inmate’s request for post-conviction relief. The justices additionally denied a request for a stay which would have delayed the execution. 
The Indiana Constitution gives the governor exclusive authority to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons for all offenses — including capital crimes — except for treason and impeachment. The parole board is tasked by state law with assisting in that process.
The board, specifically, conducts an investigation into the merits of a clemency petition, which reduces an inmate’s punishment but does not overturn a conviction or declare the person innocent.
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita requested an execution date for Ritchie last fall.
Executions were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until convicted killer Joseph Corcoran was put to death in December. The state paid $900,000 for execution drugs but won’t say how much was purchased. 
Ritchie and six other men remain on the state’s death row at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.

The change, which was added by the Missouri Senate Appropriations Committee without any public debate, would open the door for lottery courier services — companies that charge fees to buy lottery tickets on behalf of customers. The business model has proven controversial in other states, even sparking a criminal investigation in Texas. 
The Senate finished debating the state operating budget about midnight on Tuesday of last week and by Thursday, lobbyists were bending the ears of lawmakers with seats on the conference committee that will decide the provision’s fate.
Lobbyists working for casinos and the bill to allow video lottery games — groups generally at odds — are opposing it. The major lottery courier companies like Jackpocket and Lotto.com have hired veteran Jefferson City lobbyists to push for their interests in Missouri.
“I had six or seven people come pull me off the (House) floor to talk about that language specifically,” said state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “They are concerned with doing it through the budget and making the argument that we’re legislating through the budget and that should be a statutory conversation.”
All budget decisions must be made before this week’s 6 p.m. Friday constitutional deadline. Conference committees on 13 spending bills making up the operating budget must settle differences on hundreds of items, including the lottery language, and close the $1.6 billion gap between the House and Senate on total spending.
The lottery provision in the Senate budget — about 125 words in all — directs the Missouri Lottery to launch a three-year pilot program “allowing the digital delivery of lottery tickets by lottery couriers through a brick and mortar licensed retailer to adults physically present in Missouri at the time of order.”
The language also exempts the sales from lottery rules barring retailers from altering the price of tickets. Courier services typically add a 15% to 25% surcharge on the cost of tickets.
That is far more than licensed lottery retailers make selling tickets. Lottery retailers are paid a 5% commission on the tickets they sell and 2% for cashing tickets up to $600.
“It doesn’t say that our Missouri lottery has to utilize this,” said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican. “It just kind of opens it up for them to use it if they wanted to.”
There are 45 states that have lotteries, but only nine allow lottery courier services. Some allow courier services to deliver their tickets anywhere in the world, while others, like the provision in the Missouri budget, only allow it for residents of their state.
Questions raised about courier operations led the Texas Lottery Commission last week to ban ticket sales through couriers, Texas Public Radio reported. The issues being confronted in Texas included an April 2023 drawing won by a consortium led by London-based trader Bernard Marantelli, which bought all 25.8 million possible number combinations to win a $92 million prize.
Lottery sales in Missouri fell by $50 million in the most recent fiscal year and transfers from sales to education programs are down 15% in the current year. The lottery provides about 4% of the state’s total education funding.
The Missouri Lottery, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on the proposal.
Hough said he did not know about the issues in Texas when he added the language and the lottery director was indifferent to the idea.
“My guess is it probably comes out,” Hough said.

 Transparency complaints

In the four months leading up to last week’s debate, Hough met with a parade of visitors to his office where they discussed budget requests in private.
Almost every change made by the Senate committee to the House’s version of the budget was done by Hough directing the decision. He made cuts, stated the new sections for earmarks and the other 12 members generally were silent.
In all,  the Senate put 169 earmarked items into the operating budget while cutting 57 of 105 House earmarks.
New state Sen. Joe Nicola, a Republican from Independence, complained at the end of the budget debate that the Senate should have more than five hours to debate the budget because of its complexity of the budget and the often-obscure language used to identify the target of earmarks.
The lottery courier language that appeared in the budget for the first time in the Senate Appropriations Committee is an example of the issue he has with the process, Nicola said.
“The whole chairmanship and the whole committee, and the way senators have to ask for budget items, all of that is bogus,” Nicola said. “It’s all deal making, bogus stuff.”
Hough defended the Senate budget process as transparent because each budget item, as proposed by the governor, was aired in a public hearing and the changes were announced in public.
“We run as open and transparent a budget process as there is in this business,” Hough said. “We go through requests from not just specific senators but also representatives and stakeholders and advocacy groups all over the state in a very open way.”
Nicola visited him to ask for budget items, Hough noted at a news conference Thursday.
“I visited with Senator Nicola a number of times on a number of specific items that I will more than gladly remind him are actually in the budget now, per his request,” Hough said. “So, in my opinion, I think it probably worked pretty well for him.”
Senate leadership from both parties said they are comfortable with that process and back Hough.
“I give credit to Sen. Hough, who’s run a good process there,” said Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck , a Democrat fromAffton. “Everybody has their say in it.”
What to some may appear to be mysterious is actually hundreds of hours of work and attention to detail that should be admired, O’Laughlin said.
“We’re in a strong position heading into conference with the House, and I’m confident that we’ll finish with the budget that Missourians can be proud of,” O’Laughlin said.
The biggest change needed in the budget process, Nicola said, is for the public to easily know which lawmaker or stakeholder asked for an earmark.
In the U.S. Congress, members put their earmark requests on their web sites. U.S. Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat, has six projects costing $21 million on his infrastructure list, while U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, a Republican from Tarkio, has $322 million on his list for the current fiscal year. 
The legislature should also publish the name of the lawmaker or entity requesting money, Nicola said.
“As much transparency as we can have, I am completely for,” Nicola said. “Transparency to our constituents and to everybody else of what’s going on here.”

 Conference questions

Missouri is sitting on an historically high surplus of general revenue, with $3.8 billion on hand at the end of April as well as another $1.4 billion that can be spent like general revenue.
Both the Senate and the House spending plans would reduce that surplus. The Senate would spend $15.7 billion on operations, the House would spend $14.4 billion and both are well above the $13.6 billion estimated as general revenue receipts for the coming year.
But with current revenues almost 2% from last year, the call on the surplus could grow. Based on revenues through Friday, that difference could be as much as $100 million.
Before the conference committees meet, Hough and House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton will meet privately to find agreement on as many items as possible and present those decisions at the meeting, which has yet to be scheduled.
The biggest issues that must be resolved are $300 million the Senate added money for public schools, plus $107 million for child care that the House did not approve. The Senate also spent more on state employee pay raises and higher education.
The House approved $50 million to expand a tuition scholarship program for private schools that the Senate omitted.
Democrats, who hold fewer than one-third of the seats in the General Assembly, are generally pleased with the budget, preferring the Senate version on several items. But House Democrats feel their negotiating position on two of the biggest — foundation formula funding and money for private school tuition scholarships — was undermined when House Speaker Jon Patterson rejected some of their selections for the negotiations.
During a news conference last week, Democrats said most of their caucus supports the Senate spending proposals on public schools and child care and opposes the scholarship funding.
But the party did not get its preferred representatives on the 13 conference committees — one for each spending bill — because instead of including the ranking Democrat from appropriations subcommittees, as recommended, Patterson chose another member.
The biggest surprise was the selection of state Rep. Marlene Terry, a St. Louis Democrat who does not sit on the Budget Committee but has sided with Republicans on school choice bills.
“To come down to the very end of this process and feel disrespected at the end is a huge disappointment to me,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City. “It’s a huge disappointment to our budget team, and to say that I am a little frustrated by it would be probably an understatement.”
Patterson said he appointed Terry because she is his Democratic appointment to a school funding task force created by Gov. Mike Kehoe and a long-time school board member. She also supports the scholarship funding, he noted.
“I want Rep. Terry to fight for school kids in the best way that she knows how. I think she is supportive of that,” Patterson said.
The conferees must also determine the fate of earmarked spending — items delivering money to a specific location or program at the request of individual lawmakers, state institutions or lobbying interests.
“I wouldn’t anticipate that all investments for our local nonprofits and for communities back home will see themselves across the finish line,” Fogle said.”But we as Democrats will be at the table to try to make sure that we’re making the fiscally responsible investments in our nonprofits, in our communities back home, whether it be an infrastructure investment or an investment with a nonprofit whose whose goal is to provide pathos out of poverty for families.”
Defending the earmarks at a news conference Thursday, Hough said that many provide only a portion of the money needed for a project and require local and private matching funds to spend the state funds.
“This invests,” Hough said, “in apprenticeship programs, workforce development programs, infrastructure projects all over the state.”

The bill heads back to the Senate, where lawmakers can either send it to the governor or request a conference committee to work out differences between the chambers. 
The legislation passed the Senate as a short bill barring Missouri colleges from punishing student groups for their beliefs. The House Emerging Issues Committee, whose Democratic members voiced concerns about the underlying bill, added other higher education legislation and anti-discrimination provisions.
And Monday, the House approved 10 additional amendments, such as a proposal that would grant in-state tuition to active-duty military from out of state serving in Missouri. Many of the amendments were heard on the House floor earlier in session and spurred little discussion Monday.
But a piece added in committee led to heated debate Monday about how to define antisemitism. The legislation includes a piece that would require higher education institutions to monitor for antisemetic incidents.
Critics worry it would bar criticism of the Israeli government, pointing to the bill’s adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of antisemitism and its examples. State Rep. George Hruza, a Republican from Huntleigh and the provision’s sponsor, amended the piece to clarify that the definition was not legally binding.
State Rep. Bridget Walsh Moore, a St. Louis Democrat, said she likes the idea of opposing antisemitism but could not support something that would limit criticism of Israel.
“We’re going to write a law that says it is non-legally binding,” she said. “Please make that make sense.”
She attempted to amend the bill to “allow for a more concise definition of antisemitism while removing the Israel language” but was not called upon until after the piece was amended by Hruza. The House ruled in a point of order that she could not offer her amendment.
Walsh Moore voted in opposition to the overall bill because of this piece.
“I hate that I have to do this because there is so much good in this bill, but to me, this is the poison pill,” she said.
Other proposals added in the House include a provision that would require Missouri’s public universities to coordinate on transferable 60-credit-hour degree programs in five areas of study.
Missouri State University would also be able to offer an undergraduate degree in veterinary technology and doctorates of philosophy other than in engineering.
State law currently limits some degree programs to the University of Missouri, including all doctorates of philosophy.
Bills filed this year sought to open the programs to universities statewide, but the legislation was narrowed during negotiations to only give Missouri State increased authority and continued the University of Missouri System’s exclusivity over some programs like engineering.
The amendments were not limited to higher education, with K-12 provisions added like a bill seeking to limit the presence of lead in school drinking water and a provision that would protect K-12 private schools from litigation because of single-sex restroom policies.
State Rep. Willard Haley, an Eldon Republican, added an education package he sponsored to the bill, saying he believes time ran out for it.
“I’m afraid that we don’t have time to get (the bill) through the Senate, so I’m adding it on to this as an amendment,” he said.
The amendment includes reimbursement of expenses for career-tech students and a requirement for universities to give credit for certain scores on International Baccalaureate exams.
The Senate must pass the bills before the legislation can make it to the governor’s desk for final approval. With multiple Senate priorities still outstanding, opportunities for other bills to get debate in that chamber are limited.

(Photo by Edwin J. Torres/N.J. Governor’s Office)NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri railed against the agency’s locomotive engineers union before Assembly lawmakers Monday ahead of a looming strike, saying their request for larger pay increases puts them at odds with economic realities.
The NJ Transit Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen could strike as early as May 15 if the two sides do not reach an accord. They’ve remained at odds over the level of wage hikes, with engineers seeking increases that would bring their average salary to $190,000, while the agency has pushed for a contract that would bring that wage up to $172,000.
“If there’s any citizen, private or government, in this environment who’d get a $25,000 pay raise and say, ‘No, no, that’s not good enough,’ does that sound like a group of people who are grounded in reality, or more importantly, on what is actually happening in the world we live in?” Kolluri told the Assembly’s budget committee.
In written responses to questions asked through the Office of Legislative Services, NJ Transit warned it could face cost increases as a result of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, though it said it lacks the information needed to gauge the impact tariffs would have.
The agency said it had not lost any federal funding to date but warned of “significant service reductions and drastic cost cutting” if the federal government reduces its funding. NJ Transit is set to receive $334 million, about 10.5% of its total budget, in federal dollars for preventative maintenance in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
But it’s the strike that could provide the more immediate threat to the agency.
Locomotive engineers have argued the higher salaries are necessary to compete with rail operators in New York.
A federal board that oversaw the dispute at an earlier stage found NJ Transit engineers were paid at least $10 less per hour than counterparts at Amtrak, the Long Island Railroad, and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, though it found engineers at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority were paid roughly 10% less than NJ Transit engineers.
“The conclusion is that they live in New Jersey, they work in New Jersey, but they want to get paid like they live and work in New York,” Kolluri said. “Nice dream, isn’t it?”
A spokesperson for the union did not return a request for comment. Tom Haas, the union’s general chairman representing engineers at NJ Transit, last week said in a statement that it’s NJ Transit that is not recognizing economic reality. The agency’s engineers are leaving to find jobs at railroads that will pay them more, putting NJ Transit at risk of a severe shortage of people to run its trains.
“It costs roughly $250,000 to train an engineer, and it takes time. High churn rates are not a good way to keep a railroad running. The better answer is to pay a competitive wage to help with both recruitment and retention,” he said.
Mark Wallace, who ascended to become the union’s national president on May 1, on Sunday warned his members “will likely be on strike at New Jersey Transit” this month.
Though NJ Transit and the union negotiated a contract earlier this year, locomotive engineers overwhelmingly rejected the agreement when it was put to a vote in April.
Kolluri has said the engineers’ contract proposal would require NJ Transit to raise fares by 17%, increase collections from a new corporate business tax that funds the agency by 27%, or drastically cut services to afford the engineers’ proposed wages.
Union officials have said Kolluri has overstated the cost of their proposal.
The agency last week unveiled a mitigation plan for an eventual strike. That plan relies on bus trips from four designated park-and-ride lots but would only handle about 20% of the agency’s daily rail riders. Kolluri on Monday repeated his plea that those who can work from home do so.
He added that New York’s congestion pricing tolls on certain crossings into Manhattan would not fill any of the agency’s forthcoming fiscal needs, warning that the steep tolls had not meaningfully increased ridership on NJ Transit trains.
“In January, our numbers were down. In February, it was up by 3%, and we’re back to even par in March,” Kolluri said.“There aren’t any wild fluctuations because of congestion pricing.”

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)It has been at least 30 years since an Idaho legislative session has featured as many prepared pieces of legislation as the recent 2025 session at the State Capitol in Boise.
During the entire 2025 session, legislators and bill drafters prepared 1,378 pieces of legislation, according to the official Sine Die report compiled and published by the Idaho Legislative Services Office.
That’s 140 more pieces of legislation than during the previous year’s legislative session.
Idaho legislators had so many pieces of legislation prepared – including draft bills, memorials, resolutions and proclamations – that it is difficult to find online records of another session that featured more pieces of legislation.
According to an Idaho Capital Sun review of online legislative records and previous Sine Die reports that tracked the volume of legislation dating as far back as 1994, the 2025 session is the only time that more than 1,300 different pieces of legislation have been prepared in Idaho.
The 1994 session came close, with 1,265 pieces of prepared legislation, according to a table embedded in the 2003 Sine Die report.
Online legislative records only date back to the late 1990s and early 2000s, so documenting and comparing legislative trends prior to that time period becomes more difficult.

 Model legislation makes its way into Idaho

At any rate, the increase in legislation this session was so pronounced the House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, noticed it stood out before the session ended for the year April 4.
  Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, speaks from the House floor on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
In an interview with the Sun in March, Rubel blamed some of the increase in the amount of legislation on an influx of out-of-state model legislation. 
Model legislation, or form legislation, is where an organization or advocacy group writes a bill template that can be easily introduced in different states simply by making a few minor wording changes or localizing a bill, the Sun previously reported. 
“A lot of this is being driven, frankly, by these out-of-state bill mills,” Rubel told the Sun in March.
Examples of form legislation that has appeared in Idaho and multiple states include bills restricting transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports and the Texas-style immigration bill allowing local law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of people being investigated for a crime.
From the 1,378 proposed pieces of legislation that were prepared for legislative committees and legislators, 790 bills, proclamations, resolutions or memorials were officially introduced in 2025, Idaho Legislative Services Office staffers wrote in the Sine Die report.
In the end, 341 of those bills became law this year, and most will take effect July 1.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office announced Monday that five officers from the Columbus, Ohio, police department will not be charged in the fatal shooting of Sam Sharpe, a man who was killed by the out-of-state officers during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on July 16. 
Sharpe, 43, returned to Milwaukee’s King Park, where he was living in a tent for the last time to gather his belongings and his dog Ices to avoid a man who’d allegedly begun harassing and threatening him, according to Sharpe’s family. Sharpe, who was remembered as positive and well-liked by other King Park residents, shared a fragile sense of shelter and community with numerous other unhoused locals. But when he encountered his alleged harasser that summer day, a confrontation ensued which ended in a volley of gunfire from police officers deployed to Milwaukee as part of the security force for the RNC. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The day before the shooting, a group of housing rights activists, who had slept in King Park overnight, marched on the RNC. Law enforcement officials said after the shooting that the prior day’s protest had drawn the officers to King Park. Body camera footage showed the officers standing together just before the shooting, then noticing a fight occurring in the distance. The officers immediately unholstered their weapons and sprinted over, yelling commands before unleashing a torrent of gunfire. 
The district attorney’s May 5 letter detailing the decision not to issue charges states that five officers fired a total of 23 times. Each of the officers — identified as Sgt. Adam Groves and officers Nick Mason, Austin Enos, Karl Eiginger, and Canaan Dick — told investigators that they feared that Sharpe, who was armed with knives, was an imminent threat to the other person in the confrontation, identified only as “AB” in the district attorney’s letter. 
Within hours people gathered at the scene to mourn Sharpe, who was known and beloved by housing outreach advocates and his family. Body camera and surveillance footage leaked online, and people were already beginning to discuss the fact that Sharpe had been the Columbus PD’s eighth fatal shooting so far in 2024. Milwaukee police Chief Jeffrey Norman held a press conference, saying that the officers had acted to save a life. 
The investigation found that the officers’ use of deadly force was justified under Wisconsin law, to prevent imminent harm to a civilian, that Sharpe ignored commands to drop the knives he was carrying and that the officers had a reasonable fear for the civilian’s safety.
Milwaukee PD officials said prior to the convention that their intent was to have out-of-state officers placed in positions “where they’re not necessarily forward facing”, and that outside officers were to be accompanied by Milwaukee officers, and were not to make arrests unless in urgent circumstances where local officers weren’t available.
The investigation of Sharpe’s killing was led by the Greenfield PD as part of the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team (MAIT), a local task force which investigates officer-involved deaths. Angelique Sharpe, Sam’s sister, recounted the day that detectives came to her mother’s home, escorted by Milwaukee officers. The department was already receiving criticism for not having accompanied the Columbus officers at King Park.

“They didn’t really care,” Angelique Sharpe told Wisconsin Examiner. The detectives had few answers to the family’s questions, she said. After Sharpe’s death, his family said that he had been living in the park doing street preaching for the unhoused community, when he began getting harassed by a man who allegedly threatened to destroy his tent and harm his dog. Sharpe was generally in good spirits, his family said, but he suffered from illness including multiple sclerosis. Sharpe had returned to the park to gather his things and leave that day, his sister said, armed with knives because he was worried about his safety. 
Angelique Sharpe told Wisconsin Examiner that MAIT detectives seemed uninterested in what she feels is important context. “I feel like nobody has really investigated this case fully for what it was. The only thing that they cared about was the actual shooting itself. Not anything that led up to it. Not why any of them were in the street, what led up to that, or what happened, or verifying that he was robbed and beat up,” Angelique said. “Nobody checked any of that stuff or cared about any of that stuff. All they cared about was the police [were] justified in the few seconds … and I just don’t feel like they was justified, because they should’ve never been there.”
Angelique blames the Columbus officers, who she feels acted in haste, as well as Milwaukee officials who assured residents ahead of the RNC that out-of-state law enforcement would not patrol neighborhoods unsupervised. “The whole case was handled poorly,” she said. 
The fallout from the shooting continues to weigh on the Sharpe family. Sam’s dog Ices was taken by animal control, much to the dismay of Sharpe’s family. Ices was eventually returned, and later found a new owner. 
Shortly after Sam died, someone mailed what appeared to be online court records of people with the last name “Sharpe” to the family, with a mocking letter saying “another criminal off the street,” Angelique told Wisconsin Examiner. Months passed before the family was able to obtain a death certificate, and organize a proper funeral for Sam, because of the ongoing investigation. Angelique said their mother’s health declined as  the whole ordeal took a toll.

In a press release put out by the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Angelique Sharpe stated that her brother was found to have been shot 23 times, yet sustained 34 wounds. “The math ain’t matching,” she said. “It’s a miscarriage of justice and gross neglect of oversight on the part of MPD, who lied to the public to let killer cops run loose in one of the most vulnerable communities in our city. My brother’s blood is on your hands regardless of the law continuing to support murderers behind badges.”
After the district attorney received MAIT’s investigation for review, prosecutors met with Sharpe’s family members and their attorneys at the Greenfield Police Department. It became clear to the family that prosecutors were leaning toward not charging the officers, and that the shooting officers had retained lawyers. All of the involved officers refused to have their interviews recorded. 
Attorney Nate Cade, who represents the Sharpe family, said that a lack of recorded interviews is a common frustration, as police investigated by MAIT have the option to forego them. “They don’t record, they dictate what they think they hear,” Cade told Wisconsin Examiner. Cade agrees with the Sharpe family that the lack of a Milwaukee police escort for the Columbus officers led to an avoidable escalation.

The Sharpe family is considering bringing a civil case. Protest actions are planned in the coming days.
“From the moment it was announced that the RNC would be held in Milwaukee, the community was clear,” the Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said in a press release, “we do not want outside law enforcement agencies unleashed on our community.” The Alliance blamed local officials, including Mayor Calvalier Johnson and Chief Norman, for welcoming  the RNC to  Milwaukee.

State's trona and soda ash industry is particularly vulnerable to losing global buyers, while Gordon sees potential bright spots for mineral commodities, as well as new manufacturing.
The post Governor sees ‘opportunity’ for Wyoming in Trump tariff war. Economist sees ‘disaster.’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Gov. Mark Gordon said he sees “opportunity” for Wyoming in President Donald Trump’s tariff wars. At a press conference last week, he echoed the Wyoming congressional delegation’s praise for Trump’s economic policies as a tool to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and level the nation’s trade imbalance with much of the world.
“The Trump tariffs have kind of shuffled the deck, in a way, and I think it’s a great opportunity for Wyoming to be able to pick up the game,” Gordon told reporters while highlighting his April trade mission to Japan and Taiwan. “Taiwan very much understood that they can buy more [U.S.] energy and that will help their situation in the trade deficit.”
But southwest Wyoming, the world’s largest exporter of natural soda ash, along with agricultural producers, businesses reliant on tourism and natural resource extractive industries across the state — as well as ordinary Equality State consumers of almost anything — have cause for concern, according to one Wyoming economist.
“There’s just no good way to spin the Trump administration’s economic policies in the short term,” University of Wyoming Associate Professor of Economics Rob Godby told WyoFile. “They’ve been disastrous, and they’re going to be disastrous.”

The global oil market dominates much of the world’s economy and plays an outsized role in the nation’s economic pulse, especially Wyoming’s, Godby noted. So far, the market’s reaction is pointing to economic decline. That’s bad for Wyoming’s economy across the board, he said, and portends lower revenues to the state’s coffers.
Godby also serves on the state’s Consensus Revenue Estimating Group, which consists of the state’s top bean-counters tasked with estimating revenues to fund state and local governments. While tourism and agriculture play vital roles in the state’s revenue picture, Godby and his fellow CREG members closely monitor coal, oil and natural gas. 
In addition to providing more than $2.4 billion in state revenues in 2023, the oil and natural gas industry supported nearly 59,000 direct and indirect jobs in the state, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. But U.S. oil prices have declined since Jan. 20, when Trump began his second term in the White House, slipping by about 20% to around $56 per barrel over the weekend.
“I would say that the biggest effect on our revenues is really the indirect effect that will be caused by world oil prices, which is really driving down [Wyoming] oil revenues, especially in the last month and a half,” Godby said. “We’re not quite seeing it yet in terms of reported numbers, but we know it’s going to hit us because these prices are well below what we expected.”

The CREG group is on the front lines of measuring Wyoming’s vulnerability in international trade and the overall U.S. economy, according to Gordon’s office. Gordon’s Communications Director Michael Pearlman told WyoFile, “We’re monitoring the tariff situation closely, which is constantly changing.”
Meantime, there are more acute concerns for Wyoming regarding Trump’s tariffs and potential retaliatory responses among U.S. trade partners, Godby said.
Trona and soda ash
Trona mined in Wyoming is processed into “natural” soda ash — a key component in the production of glass, baking soda and myriad other products. Wyoming’s trona and soda ash industry employs more than 2,000 workers, compared to about 4,100 direct jobs in Wyoming coal mining, according to the Wyoming Mining Association.
By far, soda ash is the state’s biggest foreign export commodity in terms of sales. Of Wyoming’s $2 billion in total exports in 2024, soda ash accounted for about $1.3 billion, according to Godby. China, Trump’s primary target in his tariff wars, typically accounts for about 10% of those soda ash purchases.

If the industry were to lose that 10%, it would be a significant blow, Godby said. What’s worse is the possibility that tariff wars might give a price advantage to synthetic soda ash, which Wyoming does not produce, and put a drag on exports to other nations.
“That could be a really significant impact on our [soda ash] exports,” he said, adding that it might even dampen plans for major expansions of trona mining and soda ash refining operations in the region.
WE Soda’s Project West, a multi-billion dollar trona solution-mine expansion project now under construction near Granger, will create 2,000 temporary construction jobs, more than 400 permanent jobs and boost annual production by 3 million metric tons, according to the company. Pacific Soda’s proposed Dry Creek Trona Mine Project south of Green River, which has also crossed several regulatory approval milestones, would bring in another 2,000 construction jobs and create about 300 full-time jobs, according to the company. 
“This vital development [the Dry Creek Trona Mine] will create hundreds of good-paying jobs for hardworking Wyoming families while strengthening our domestic supply chain for essential minerals that keep costs lower at the store for everyday Americans,” Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a prepared statement last week.

While the state’s trona and soda ash producers have been very “bullish” regarding exports in recent years, global dynamics for the commodities could change drastically if Trump’s trade wars escalate, according to Godby. Though the industry is not among the top three major influencers regarding the state’s overall revenue picture, “it does affect southwest Wyoming,” he said.
Though the industry may struggle in terms of past expectations to increase exports, Gordon said he hopes Trump’s policies might actually result in bringing glass manufacturing, which relies on soda ash, back to the U.S. and for the first time in Wyoming.
“This is a long shot, but we’re really talking about bringing in glass manufacturers,” Gordon said, noting that he and his team visited with glass manufacturer Corning while in Taiwan. “We talked about the possibility of being able to locate manufacturing here — a longtime dream of people in Wyoming. It may be a little bit more of an opportunity now with the backdrop of those tariffs.”
Oh, Canada, and China
Wyoming’s other vulnerability in international tariff wars is its reliance on Canada, the state’s largest international trading partner. The nation to the north accounts for about 20% of the state’s exports and 55% of imports, according to Godby. That translates into significant exposure for multiple goods, including robust trade of agricultural, manufacturing and heavy machinery components that both nations rely on in their natural resource extractive industries.
 “If you really wanted to sandbag the U.S. economy, you couldn’t have done much of a better job.”Rob Godby, University of Wyoming
“That clearly is going to have supply chain effects in terms of impacts on consumers, or impacts on what we produce, given the products that we bring in from Canada,” Godby said. 
“If [Trump] gets tough with Canada, they’ll get tough back,” he added, noting the recent election of Prime Minister Mark Carney, who promises to rebuke Trump’s policies. “Even though they know it hurts, they’re willing to do that, and Wyoming would be a victim of that trade war.”
Combined, Canada and China account for nearly 65% of Wyoming’s imports, according to Godby. “Clearly, Wyoming could be impacted much more than the nation as a whole, if we get into a kind of a trade dispute with those two countries.”
Still, based on his recent trade mission to Japan and Taiwan, Gordon said he believes the tariff and trade policy negotiations serve as motivation for those markets — as well as others — to balance their trade deficits with the United States. Though he heard concerns about Trump’s tariffs and retaliatory trade policies, he also heard assurances that Japan and Taiwan are interested in balancing their trade with the U.S. Ways to do that could include importing more Wyoming-produced coal, natural gas, uranium and soda ash, as well as nuclear microreactors that might be manufactured here.
“The Prime Minister [of Japan, Shigeru Ishiba] said, ‘Look, we were [at an 80% trade imbalance with the U.S.] in the 1980s and now we’re less than 20%. So, you know, we’re anxious to work with you to rebalance,'” Gordon said.

That type of interest includes potential investments by both Japan and Taiwan to expand port capacities in the U.S. and on their shores to increase the flow of Wyoming coal and natural gas to those and other Asian nations, he added.
Though Wyoming might see some new deals to ship energy commodities to Asian markets, Godby said, it would be despite escalating tariffs. The state may even land new manufacturing here at home, but those are long-term outcomes that first have to be built on investor confidence.
“Hope is not a strategy,” Godby said. Even if the Trump administration pumps the brakes on tariffs completely, he added, there’s already a certain level of damage done to U.S. trade relations — and a big part of that is the fact that nobody knows what the Trump administration will do next. 
“With just general uncertainty, you’re going to see [investments] go down, which is going to hurt our economy. There’s no way to win that,” Godby said. “If you really wanted to sandbag the U.S. economy, you couldn’t have done much of a better job.”

Species population declines could have a greater effect on park visitation than charging visitors to support conservation, new paper concludes.
The post Study: Most Yellowstone, Grand Teton visitors support added fee for wildlife conservation appeared first on WyoFile .","The majority of visitors to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks value wildlife viewing so much that they would support a park-related fee or tax toward habitat conservation, a new study finds. 
The study, “Tradeoffs and win-wins between large landscape conservation and wildlife viewing in protected areas,” was published Sunday in Conservation Science and Practice. Along with establishing support for paying conservation fees, the paper concludes that species population declines could have a greater effect on park visitation than imposing such fees.
“Visitors responded that they would be likely to visit the parks less if there were fewer wildlife to see,” said co-author Hilary Byerly Flint, a researcher with the University of Wyoming’s Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources. 
The study looked specifically at Wyoming’s two northwestern national parks, and co-authors include Byerly Flint and Drew Bennett with the Haub School; migration researcher Arthur Middleton with the University of California, Berkeley; Leslie Richardson with the National Park Service’s economics program and Aaron Enriquez with the U.S. Geological Survey. 
Authors say the study cements with data what many people already know: Seeing grizzly bears, elk, wolves or other animals in the wild is tremendously valuable to the public. So valuable that most would pony up to support conservation efforts beyond park boundaries.  
“For the vast majority of people who visit the parks, it’s mind blowing” to see something like an elk bugling, said Scott Christensen, executive director of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, which helped fund the study. “It’s almost a once-in-a-lifetime experience for them, and it has real, tangible value.”

The concept of a conservation fee in national parks is not new, though it has yet to gain required federal traction to be enacted. Authors hope the study can be used to continue the dialogue, Byerly Flint said. 
“I think we see this really as the start of a conversation about how to pay for conservation in these areas that are increasingly threatened,” she said. 
“We’re seeing the loss of habitat for these migratory ungulates at unprecedented rates,” Byerly Flint continued. And that leads to the question of: “How to pay for conservation of that habitat, while also maintaining the benefits and the wonderful experiences that park visitors enjoy when they come to Yellowstone and Grand Teton?”
Genesis
In 2018, former Wyoming State Rep. Al Sommers, a Sublette County rancher, sponsored a joint resolution relating to the collection of wildlife conservation fees at Yellowstone and Grand Teton. His resolution requested that the Department of the Interior and National Park Service enter into an agreement with Wyoming to collect a wildlife conservation fee at the parks to generate revenue for conservation efforts. 
The Legislature passed the resolution, and Gov. Mark Gordon signed it, but those fees have not gained federal approval.
“My priority was conflict resolution,” Sommers told WyoFile. 
“Whether it’s grizzly bears or wolves, or elk or, frankly, wildlife on highways,” Sommers said, the fee was envisioned as “a way to generate money from all of the public, from the national public that enjoys these wildlife in the park, to help mitigate some of the cost associated with that and to ensure wildlife’s viability.”
Two years later, Middleton co-authored a paper titled “Harnessing visitors’ enthusiasm for national parks to fund cooperative large-landscape conservation,” which further explored the concept. That study examined legal and political challenges and estimated that a fee of up to $10 per vehicle could generate up to $13 million annually for conservation projects.

The new study takes the issue a step further, Byerly Flint said, by examining “what park visitors themselves think about the idea of contributing towards conservation and how important the animals that require habitat beyond park boundaries are to park visitor experiences.”
In summer 2022, a research assistant spent two months surveying visitors of Yellowstone and Grand Teton parks — both inside their boundaries and outside in communities like Jackson and Cody. 
Researchers analyzed 991 responses. Just over 75% of respondents cited wildlife viewing as a primary reason for their trips to Yellowstone and Grand Teton. The majority also supported the idea of paying extra for conservation — with 93% supportive of a voluntary donation; 75% supportive of a tax or fee on goods and services; and 66% supportive of a mandatory wildlife conservation fee. 
The study also found that wildlife viewing generates an estimated $581 million in annual recreational value in the two national parks, representing a significant economic engine. Yellowstone tallied 4.74 million visitations in 2024 — the second highest year on record. Grand Teton, meanwhile, reported 3.62 million, its third highest. 
Nearly half of respondents, furthermore, said they would take fewer trips to the parks if there were fewer wide-ranging wildlife to view. That, researchers calculated, could result in about a 15% decrease in overall park visitation.

The results illustrate support for a basic trade off, the study concludes. Visitors are willing to pony up rather than risk long-term wildlife declines. 
“These wide-ranging wildlife, like elk and mule deer and grizzly bears, are hugely important to park visitor experiences, to the reasons they decide to visit the parks,” Byerly Flint said. 
Next steps 
Sommers’ resolution, along with a similar version passed in Montana, was nonbinding. Any change in park fees falls under the purview of the National Park Service. 
Wyoming’s park superintendents have indicated support for wildlife, Byerly Flint noted. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly declined to comment for this story; Grand Teton Superintendent Chip Jenkins didn’t respond by publication time. 
However, Byerly Flint said, the paper underscores the point that “the value of the experience within the park boundaries is contingent upon what’s happening outside of park boundaries.”

Support for a fee or donation was regardless of income or politics, the report found. In terms of diminishing returns, researchers found that a cost increase of more than $75 would equate to the same reduction in visits that might result from fewer wildlife to view. 
The study does not mean the co-authors are set on fees as a solution, Byerly Flint said. “This is one way. This isn’t necessarily the way. It’s just an idea that we’re exploring.”
Christensen of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition echoed that sentiment. 
“Every animal that spends time in the parks also spends time outside of the parks and in these unprotected areas,” he said. “And so our interest in this study is really around trying to come up with some innovative approaches for how to pay for conservation long term. I think what this study tells us, and gives us some hope around, is that people are willing to do that … there’s a willingness there.”

“I thought: ‘Oh, this stupid flag bill once again,’” Wintrow said. “I’ll just vote ‘no’ quietly because I’ve just really been in people’s grille about things.”
But then the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Ben Toews, began passing out flyers about the legislation, one of two proposed bills to limit which flags can be flown at schools and on state and local government property. The only photos on the handout were of rainbow-striped Pride flags flying in Boise: one on a flagpole in front of City Hall, and then others on light poles along Harrison Boulevard, two blocks from Wintrow’s home.
“When he sat that picture in front of me on that desk, I thought: ‘That’s enough.

A good working wage, health care. It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.”
In recent weeks, Idaho and Utah have enacted bans that prohibit Pride flags from being displayed on government property, pitting lawmakers in the Republican-dominated legislatures against the more progressive capitals of Boise and Salt Lake City, where the flags are often flown at city hall.

In Utah, the law allows the state flag, the U.S. flag, U.S. military flags, the POW/MIA flag, local government flags, tribal nation flags, university and school flags and Olympic flags. Idaho’s list is similar, but includes a provision in the school flag law that prohibits flags with political viewpoints, “including but not limited to flags or banners regarding a political party, race, sexual orientation, gender, or a political ideology.”
Lawmakers in Florida, Texas and at least 13 other states are considering similar flag prohibitions, said Logan Casey, director of policy research with the Movement Advancement Project, which studies LGBTQ+ rights. The flag bills go beyond symbolism, Casey said. Rather, they are part of a broad and coordinated legislative attack on LGBTQ+ people that seeks to strip them of rights and erase or make difficult their participation in public life.
“Sometimes those attacks are very material, like denying access to health care or the ability to participate safely in public life and activities,” Casey said. “Sometimes they’re a little more symbolic, like these flag bills.”

 ‘The principles our community cherishes’: Boise City Hall flies Pride flag despite new law

The rainbow-colored Pride flag was conjured up by artist and drag queen Gilbert Baker in 1978, at the suggestion of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, as a symbol of progress and pride for that year’s San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade. Since then, the rainbow-colored flag and its many design iterations have grown into worldwide emblems of solidarity with LGBTQ+ rights.
Although the laws in Idaho and Utah don’t ban Pride flags specifically, bill sponsors and their supporters made it clear they want to see such flags removed from city halls, schools and state buildings. Idaho state Rep. Ted Hill, a Republican who sponsored the bill limiting which flags can fly at schools, said in an interview that Pride flags are disruptive to classroom learning because discussion about them takes up “an amazing amount of political bandwidth.”
“The best way to do it is to get rid of everything,” said Hill, who represents Eagle. “So the only thing you have in the classroom is the American flag, the state flag. And people will say inclusivity and all this. Well, the American flag is as inclusive as it can get.”
Despite the new law, Boise Mayor Lauren McLean, a Democrat, continues to fly a Pride flag in front of City Hall, just below the city’s own and adjacent to poles flying the U.S. and state of Idaho flags. The Pride flag’s presence, within view of the state Capitol, elicited a sternly worded letter from Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican.
These anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced in 2025 Idaho legislative session. Where does each stand?

Idaho’s law, which went into effect April 3, has no penalty for local governments or officials who fly flags in defiance of the ban, an oversight lawmakers told Labrador they’ll rectify in subsequent legislative sessions. Instead, the law relies on “the good will of elected officials for its enforcement,” Labrador wrote, warning McLean that she should “comply with the law out of a sense of duty to your oath of office.”
He threatened, too, that lawmakers could “deny state tax revenues and other appropriations to the City of Boise or any other governmental entity that does not follow state law.”
McLean countered that the new law is unconstitutional, and that the city will challenge threats to withhold funding. Pride flags have flown in Boise for a decade, she told Labrador, and represent a commitment to “a safe and welcoming city where everyone means just that — everyone.”
“The Constitutional rights of our residents are not subject to — cannot be subject to — the political whims of legislative disapproval,” McLean wrote, “and we will not step back from them simply because the principles our community cherishes make some in state government uncomfortable.”
Boise’s City Council is considering a resolution confirming that any flags it flies, including Pride flags, are official city flags — a move the council says will ensure it is complying with state law. In the meantime, the city will “continue to fly the flags on City Hall Plaza that represent our community and speak to our values of caring for people and welcoming all,” McLean said in a statement.
Early on Easter morning, several people climbed a ladder propped up next to the city’s flagpole to cover the Pride flag and a separate flag (honoring organ and tissue donation) with trash bags. They also raised the Appeal to Heaven flag, a Revolutionary War-era flag that has come to represent sympathy to the Christian nationalist movement and to President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. A few hours later, the mayor lowered the flags, which are on a locked halyard, to remove the trash bags and the Appeal to Heaven flag.
It capped a challenging sequence of events in Boise and nearby Meridian, which drew national attention this spring when school officials ordered a middle school teacher to take down a sign with the phrase “Everyone is welcome here” from her classroom. Amid the backlash, people in Boise printed T-shirts and yard signs in support of the teacher and the sign’s message.

The mayor’s response to the flag law and the support for the classroom message aren’t directly connected, but both reflect how many in the community insist on sending a welcoming message at this moment in American history, said Christina Bruce-Bennion, executive director of Boise’s Wassmuth Center for Human Rights, which helped coordinate support for the teacher.

 Salt Lake City tradition for Pride Month

In Salt Lake City, the flag ban threatens to end a long-standing annual tradition. Typically, the mayor’s office kicks off Pride Month festivities in June with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall, said Chad Call, executive director of the Utah Pride Center, which puts on the state’s annual Pride festivities. Events include a parade through the streets of Salt Lake City with a 200-foot Pride flag — which remains a legal form of First Amendment expression and has taken place most years since 1997.

“We have a city council that wants to celebrate Pride month,” Call said. “They want to celebrate the queer community in the month of June. And then we have a state government that does not want that happening in our capital city. And so it is very targeted.”
One of the flag bill’s sponsors, state Rep. Trevor Lee, said in an interview that his legislation was prompted by constituents who told him they’re “sick and tired of seeing a political agenda being pushed in their face” on government property, particularly with flags featuring transgender representation.
“It makes people feel uncomfortable if it’s something they don’t agree with,” said Lee, who represents a district north of Salt Lake City. “And so we’re trying to keep it very specific and let schools focus on teaching the things that they need to, and let government buildings just fly their city flag for heaven’s sakes, or the state flag or the American flag.”
One Utah parent, Republican activist Aaron Bullen, said he began objecting to Pride flags several years ago after one of his children, then a fifth grader, was “visibly upset” after school one day. Bullen said his son told him he’d seen what’s known as a Progress Pride flag, a newer iteration of the original rainbow-striped flag. It includes an arrow on the left side composed of pink, blue and white stripes to represent transgender people, as well as brown and black stripes to represent queer people of color. The flag was in the school’s computer lab.

Bullen said he complained to school leaders at the district, south of Salt Lake City, and the flag came down. But Bullen felt as though the flag’s presence undermined what he and his wife teach at home and model to their children as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, particularly how they interpret the church’s stance on transgender people and marriage for same-sex couples.
“It says, basically, ‘we approve of gay marriage’ when that flag is up,” Bullen said. “And that’s something that my religion is explicitly against. And so you have a teacher of my son, a person in authority that they’d like to be able to trust and to follow the instructions of, but they’re saying, ‘your parents who taught you this other thing, they’re wrong. Your religion is wrong.’ That’s what that flag means.”













It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would.


– Aaron Bullen, a Utah parent and Republican activist





He added: “It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would. Parents have the fundamental right and responsibility to rear their children. And it’s not a school’s place to oppose the religion of the parents or the teachings of the parents.”
Unlike in Idaho, Utah’s flag ban carries a $500 fine per day for failure to comply with the law. But in Utah, the law took effect without Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’s signature. The governor declined to sign the bill into law, saying the state’s residents are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix.”
Call, of the Utah Pride Center, said that while it’s discouraging for LGBTQ+ people to witness their representation further erased in public spaces, they refuse in Utah to allow the flag law to diminish the spirit of their Pride events, among the largest in the nation.
“Our counterculture here is really, really strong,” Call said. “And I think the thing that probably defines our Utah Pride as being kind of unique is the incredibly strong community that it brings together. There’s tens, hundreds of thousands of people that come out to support it.”

The decision correctly finds nondiscriminatory school environment is ""legitimate state interest,"" columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Federal court ruling protects Wyoming student’s pronoun, name preferences appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming school districts and community interests have clashed for several years over gender identity policies and parental rights. 

Opinion

That’s not likely to end soon, despite a federal judge’s well-reasoned decision last week to dismiss a lawsuit filed by parents against a Sweetwater County school district that respects student requests to use their preferred name and pronouns in school. Under the policy teachers do not discuss the issue with parents unless they ask.
Lawmakers in Wyoming have passed several controversial gender-related bills, including a ban on transgender girls competing in sports against cisgender girls, and prohibiting gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. It’s part of a concerted far-right crusade to limit the rights of transgender youth.
At the heart of the Sweetwater County case is the important legal question of whether school districts must notify parents about changes in their child’s preferred name and pronouns. The “well-being” of children is typically cited, no matter what action is advocated.
In 2023, Rock Springs parents Ashley and Sean Willey filed a civil rights lawsuit against Sweetwater County School District No. 1, alleging it violated their rights during the 2021-22 school year by withholding information about their child’s request that the high school’s teachers and staff use a preferred male name and pronouns. 
The parents accused the district of keeping that news from them by continuing to use the high school student’s gender assigned at birth in their presence, while using the teen’s preferred name and pronouns in school.


U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl, dismissing the lawsuit and ruling in the school district’s favor, explained why the parents’ rights weren’t violated.
“A respectful and nondiscriminatory school environment is a legitimate state interest,” the judge wrote. “Referring to students by preferred names and even declining to proactively inform parents to respect a student’s choice are both rationally related to that interest. Thus, the district policies and staff members’ actions pass constitutional muster.” 
It’s a profound conclusion that has been voiced in other states, including a 2022 Wisconsin case that kept a school district’s policy intact. The Wisconsin ACLU said in an amicus brief that outing children to their families could be dangerous because one-third of transgender children are rejected by their families after coming out. 
According to the Human Rights Campaign, 22 states and the District of Columbia have laws requiring schools to provide non-discriminatory environments in which students can safely express their gender identities. Unfortunately, Wyoming is not one of them.
Skavdahl dismissed all of the parents’ claims, including a separate allegation that Ashley Willey, a special education teacher at another Sweetwater County school, said she didn’t follow the district’s policy to use students’ preferred names and pronouns but was never disciplined or retaliated against for her decision.
Still, she maintained the policy itself violated her rights to freely exercise her religious beliefs as a parent and as a teacher. Willey claimed the district’s failure to proactively inform her about her child’s gender identity changes interfered with her religious beliefs because it kept her from information she needed to counsel her child.
That’s a heck of a stretch, and Skavdahl noted why it’s out of bounds.
“A person’s constitutional right to freely exercise their own religious beliefs does not require that the state also exercise those same religious beliefs,” the judge wrote. “To conclude that the district’s failure to act in accordance with plaintiff’s religious beliefs is a constitutional violation would turn the First Amendment on its head.”
The Willeys asserted parents have a right to make decisions about their children’s well-being, including their physical and mental health. The judge agreed, but added there is a “laundry list of circumstances that could affect a child’s ‘well-being’ even in the slightest that would require constant, detailed information sharing from the school, with constitutional consequences.”
The judge noted the school district “merely respected” the student’s voluntary choices, didn’t withhold information from the parents, and when the Willeys sought it, the information was provided. Skavdahl added the district didn’t require the child to go by a preferred name or pronouns, or “discourage students from discussing their gender identities with their parents.”
The Willeys contended teachers facilitated the student’s gender transition socially, and invalidated the parents’ right to make medical decisions for their teen. But Skavdahl wrote there was no evidence the school provided any type of medical transition or social transitioning, “and defendants were not involved in changing the student’s clothing or hairstyle.”
I don’t think parents should blame the school district or teachers for not voluntarily providing answers to every question they have about their child, including gender identity. Educators are frequently reminded by parents that while they are paid to instruct their child during school hours, parents are primarily responsible for their well-being, medical needs, instilling religious values, etc. 
I find it improbable that a parent who may question a change in their child’s appearance or behavior can’t pick up some clues from observing their interactions with others, including family members and friends. Skavdahl is correct: parents are entitled to information about their children from educators, who must honestly answer these questions when asked.
But if teachers and staff are required to identify every change in a student’s “well-being” and notify each parent, not many lessons will be taught.
I have other concerns about how courts will handle future school gender identity cases. The Willeys’ lawsuit took two years to be dismissed. The parents, as is their right, will appeal, according to their attorney. 
I think it’s fair to say that across the country, the extreme right’s anti-trans campaign has picked up speed, particularly under President Donald Trump’s new administration, and public support is unfortunately waning for school district policies protecting students’ gender identities. 
How this will play out in the courts is anybody’s guess. Last May the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up a case about a Maryland school district’s policies to support transgender students and when parents may challenge them. But the high court declined it because the parents who sued did not have standing, not because of the case’s merits.
Several conservative groups and 17 red states filed a friend of the court brief, arguing “parents must have the right to ask for the court’s help in securing the fundamental right to know what schools are doing with their kids.” What will the conservative court do when a similar case isn’t dismissed for technical reasons?
In another Maryland case the U.S. Supreme Court heard last month, justices’ questions seemed to overwhelmingly favor allowing parents to opt out their children from language arts lessons that included LGBTQ books.
A Politico article took a stab at predicting how the high court will weigh the interests of transgender or gender-nonconforming children and “their public school protectors versus parents’ interests in making decisions regarding the health care, education and upbringing of their children.”
“It is easy to see where the trajectory is going,” Politico concluded. “Conservative ‘values’ will probably win.”Does a thoughtful ruling like Skavdahl’s stand a chance to prevail at a higher level? It deserves to and it’s a victory worth celebrating in Wyoming, but I too have little faith that in the end Trump’s conservative Supreme Court majority will allow that to happen.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — It’s crunch time for state lawmakers to rightsize Nebraska’s budget, by no later than May 15. Senators since November are considering a nearly $850 million combined in new revenue streams, less state spending and loose funding in the state’s couch cushions.
Those figures appear to represent senators’ goals to close the state’s budget gap, with about $710 million of that coming from the Appropriations Committee’s decisions on spending and cash transfers, the final scope of which remains a moving target with future amendments planned.

Lawmakers will head to the floor Tuesday saying they still need to close a $262 million projected budget deficit for the next two years. 
But the real figure is likely much larger.
In January, when the state faced an initial $433 million projected budget deficit, Speaker John Arch of La Vista said solving the state’s budget woes would “without a doubt” be the defining issue of 2025.
Lawmakers must maintain a minimum reserve based on the beginning cash balance for the biennium and estimated net receipts for the two-year period, which is accounted for in the budget bills.
Getting to zero
A significant portion of the projected deficit is a result of Nebraska taking on more of the Medicaid costs that the federal government previously picked up — the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP — which is based on a state’s average per capita income compared to the national average.


Proposed budget bills, other proposals to help fill the budget hole
Mainline budget advanced to the floor (LBs 260-264):

Net spending decreased versus the amount projected in November: $193.6 million.
Cash fund sweeps to general fund: $160.4 million.
Investment earnings: $50.3 million.
Fewer transfers to cash funds: $39.6 million.

Other bills already passed this session:

LB 645 (Sen. Beau Ballard) to change school retirement plan contributions: $84 million.
LB 650 (Sen. Brad von Gillern) to reduce or defund various tax incentives: $52 million.
LB 208 (von Gillern) to change sales tax collection fees and confidentiality: $1.2 million.
LB 478 (General Affairs Committee) to change the Nebraska Liquor Control Act: $20,000.

Proposed second-round debate amendment:

New cash fund sweeps or decreased state spending: $135 million.
Cash Reserve Fund transfer: $132 million.



The changes left Nebraska on the hook for nearly $300 million more over the next two years, and $55 million for the remaining part of the current fiscal year. The reductions would have been worse if not for a federal “disaster-recovery adjustment” following a string of Arbor Day tornadoes last year.
The state’s increased burden is unrelated to budget talks in Congress, including potential cuts to Medicaid. It is also only part of the story of Nebraska’s budget deficit.
The other part comes as the state faced two revised economic forecasts since the deficit was identified in November. In that time, the state now projects to collect a net $215 million in less revenue than anticipated from this fiscal year through June 30, 2027.
Members of the Appropriations Committee and legislative fiscal staff have largely declined to say what the starting point for the current deficit is before the proposed budget bills or other bills that have already passed this session.
If the budget bills — Legislative Bills 260-264 — are passed with an expected amendment during second-round debate to fill the remaining hole, lawmakers would have about $5 million left to spend.
About $2 million of the wiggle room is eyed to raise judges’ salaries by 1.5% each of the next two years, as provided in LB 513, and roughly $2 million is being eyed to cover approved state claims in LB 534.
The Appropriations Committee
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Appropriations Committee, said he overall felt good about the budget and praised his committee for what he said was a “fair job” of not “lashing anybody severely.” He said instead of cuts, many state agencies were left flat. However, state employees still got negotiated salary and health insurance increases.
“I’m a little bit amazed at how well they did,” Clements said, noting the increased Medicaid costs. “I’m pleased with what we were able to get done without doing anything drastic.”
However, not all members of the committee were impressed.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a first-time Appropriations Committee member, said she had trouble finding the right words to describe the process. She said instead of finding creative solutions, the committee stuck close to proposals from the governor. Cavanaugh has suggested looking at what the state spends on property tax relief or is losing via income rate reductions for top earners to close the deficit.
“It has been a much more limiting process than I thought, not very flexible,” Cavanaugh said. “I thought that we would do more work as a committee to create a budget that we felt represented Nebraska values.”
The budget as advanced by the Appropriations Committee two weeks ago has the following contours compared to November:

$193.6 million less spending than originally projected.
$160.4 million in sweeps of various cash funds or other transfers to the state’s main pocketbook (such as $27.7 million from the Water Recreation Enhancement Fund, $20.5 million from the Economic Development Cash Fund, $15 million from the Economic Recovery Contingency Fund, $13.5 million from the Site and Building Development Fund, $12 million from the Intern Nebraska Cash Fund, $10.2 million from the Youth Outdoor Recreation Fund, $8.6 million from the Health and Human Services Cash Fund, $7 million from the Vehicle Title & Registration System Replacement Fund, $4.4 million from the Jobs and Economic Development Initiative (JEDI) Fund and $4 million from the Lead Service Line Fund).
$50.3 million in investment earnings (such as from the Perkins County Canal Fund, Inland Port Authority Fund, 911 Service System Fund, Economic Recovery Contingency Fund and the Nebraska Capital Construction Fund).
$39.6 million in fewer transfers to existing cash funds ($22 million less to the Water Sustainability Fund, $16 million less to the Education Future Fund and $5 million less to the Property Tax Credit Fund, but $2 million more to the Public Advocacy Cash Fund).

Other bills and a future amendment
Four additional bills passed this session have already helped shrink the deficit. The two main ones are Legislative Bill 645 from State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln and LB 650 from State Sen. Brad von Gillern, which together save the state an additional $136 million.
Ballard, chair of the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee, brought LB 645 to lower annual state contributions to the school retirement plan for most school employees when the plan nears full funding. It is expected to lead to about $84 million in savings over the next two years, if the pension plan remains at more than 98% funded for the first year and is 100% funded in the second, as currently anticipated.
Von Gillern, chair of the Revenue Committee, brought LB 650 to reduce or defund recently passed tax incentives, including some supported by Gov. Jim Pillen, to the tune of about $52 million in savings.
Taken together, that left lawmakers grappling with a gap of $262 million more to close, which the Appropriations Committee met last Thursday to brainstorm closing. Those final deliberations will be discussed during the second round of debate on the budget.
The largest change from Thursday is $135 million in more cash fund sweeps or reduced spending, notably $3 million less to the Nebraska Supreme Court and $4.4 million less to the University of Nebraska than the committee previously approved.

An additional $132 million will also be transferred out of the cash reserves to help balance the budget. After the changes, about $689 million would be left in that “rainy day” fund.
Legislative leadership has already rebuffed ideas to take funds away from the pending Perkins County Canal in western Nebraska or to “pause” the lowering of income tax rates.
Plymouth State Sen. Tom Brandt’s LB 171 would pause the already approved income tax rate reductions for two years “to allow the state to catch its breath.”
But Pillen, von Gillern and Clements all argued that doing so could hurt rather than help the state.



University of Nebraska budget woes exemplify challenging budget environment
The University of Nebraska has faced a whirlwind with its budget, first requesting a 3% increase for both of the next two years, which was rejected by the Appropriations Committee in its preliminary budget report this February.

Instead, the committee adopted the suggestion of Gov. Jim Pillen to cut NU’s state-aided budget by 2% cut in the first year and kept NU at the lower level in the second year.
The committee revised the NU budget last month, giving the university a 1.25% increase next year and keeping the NU budget flat in the following year. With the committee’s changes, the Appropriations Committee spent $46 million more than Pillen’s budget after NU President Jeffrey Gold and Pillen continued negotiating. Federal uncertainty partly led to the change.
The committee again reconsidered NU’s budget last week with a suggestion from the Legislative Fiscal Office to possibly remove any increase to NU’s budget for next year and give the university a bump in the second.
An effort to maintain the previously approved bump failed, but in a last-minute negotiation, senators agreed to halve next year’s increase. Instead of an agreed $17.4 million bump over the next two years, NU would get about $13.1 million more the next two years than it currently does.

Gold has said that the less-than-anticipated state dollars could lead to tuition increases and additional hardships as officials weigh a path forward later this year.
Gold last month said the difference in NU’s original budget request and what lawmakers are considering “will, unfortunately, force us to have some very serious discussions regarding tuition in each year at the upcoming biennium and, thereafter, some very serious discussions about belt-tightening and further budgetary reduction across all of the campuses, colleges and institutes in the state.”
Pillen, who last week told the Examiner he respects “the heck” of Gold and is a “Dr. Gold fan,” said the two have had conversations of a needed strategic reimagination at the university, such as eliminating duplicative programs or reviewing programs with more instructors than students. 
Before becoming governor in 2023, Pillen served 10 years on the NU Board of Regents.
“If you’re in education and your solution is more money, more people, I’m not on your team,” Pillen said, repeating efforts to end unfunded mandates for schools. “I’m 100% on education.”

(Ron Cogswell | used by permission of the photographer)Madison attorney Shabnam Lotfi says her client, Krish Lal Isserdasani, was exceptionally responsible in the way he handled the news that the Trump administration had suddenly taken away his student visa.
Isserdasani, a 21-year-old computer engineering senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from India, was about a month out from his graduation on May 10 when he became one of thousands of students across the U.S. that had their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records cancelled by the Trump administration. According to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, SEVIS is a “web-based system for maintaining information on nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors” in the U.S. Once SEVIS records were canceled, students faced the termination of their student visas and their ability to remain in the U.S.
UW-Madison notified students of the changes to their SEVIS status, warning them that status termination generally means an affected person should depart the United States immediately.
“I admire him for acting quickly,” Lotfi told the Wisconsin Examiner. “He saw that his SEVIS record was terminated, immediately contacted the university to see what it means, did not attend classes for a week to figure out what’s going on, [and] hired a lawyer immediately.” 
In April, U.S. District Judge William Conley issued a temporary restraining order blocking the government from terminating Isserdasani’s SEVIS and from taking any further related actions. That order noted Isserdasani and his family had spent about $240,000 on his education, stood to lose $17,500 on the current semester’s tuition and would be responsible for four months of rent on an apartment he would vacate if he was forced to leave the country. 
With the temporary restraining order in place and providing some protection, Lotfi said he was able to resume attending classes. 
“That doesn’t necessarily mean he feels entirely welcome and free and comfortable,” Lotfi said, “but he’s doing the best he can with the cards he has in the situation.” 
At the end of April, the Trump administration started reversing the cancellations. Administration attorneys said in court that they were working on developing a policy that would provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations. Lotfi said she is “aware of what they’re thinking about” and that if they’re trying to find a way to make the terminations lawful, that “will likely be challenged again.”
Lotfi said the Trump administration’s step back from the cancellations is a win. This is not the first time she has fought a Trump order involving immigrants, having brought a challenge in 2018 to the Muslim travel ban during Trump’s first term.
“It was a coalition of attorneys nationwide bringing so many [temporary restraining orders], so many lawsuits on behalf of so many students all at the same time — and the government not having any defense to any of it — that caused them to have to reevaluate,” Lotfi said.
As of April 28, the 27 cancellations for UW-Madison students and alumni were reversed as were the 13 for UW-Milwaukee. However, the reversals are not the end of Isserdasani’s case.
When it comes to his case, Lotfi said it appeared during a hearing last week that the government attorneys were not changing their plan to eject Isserdasani based on the administration’s perceived change in stance on international students’ visas. She said the government’s attorney indicated her client’s SEVIS record was only active because of the temporary restraining order and that “it was not related to any change in a government policy.”
“The government attorneys also indicated that they maintain their right to terminate his SEVIS record again in the future should that be necessary,” Lotfi said. “It certainly surprised me, and I think it surprised the court that they were taking that position.” 
Lotfi noted that the government attorneys in Isserdasani’s case have been arguing, based on a declaration by Andre Watson, a Trump Department of Homeland Security official, that the SEVIS record and a student’s visa status are not the same. She said no one is buying the argument. 
“The vast majority of judges nationwide are asking, then, why do you terminate the SEVIS record? What was the point of doing this? If you guys say that SEVIS and student status are not the same, does that mean that Mr. Isserdasani is in a lawful student status right now?” Lotfi said. “They won’t say that. They’ll just say that the two are not the same, but they will not confirm that he is in a lawful student status with the SEVIS terminated.”
The case challenges the cancellation of the record in several ways, including arguing that the government cannot just take away his status without due process — the ability for him to know why his SEVIS is being terminated and to challenge the termination — and arguing the cancellation was arbitrary and capricious.
“It’s not that Isserdasani failed to go to class. It’s not that he had a criminal activity [or] he was convicted of criminal activity. It’s just because his name [was] in a database,” Lotfi said. In determining cancellations, the Trump administration had run international students’ names through an FBI database called the National Crime Information Center. It appeared that an arrest for disorderly conduct in November 2024 was the reason for Isserdasani’s SEVIS cancellation, but charges were never pursued and he never had to appear in court.
Lotfi said she and her client are waiting for the court’s written decision on whether the temporary restraining order will be converted to a preliminary injunction, which would prevent actions by the government through the course of litigation. Then, she said, litigation will continue, which can take time.
“It is in the interest of justice, and in the interest of the American people, that a final decision on the merits of the case is issued,” Lotfi said.
Lotfi said people shouldn’t accept the Trump administration’s accusations against foreign students as true.
“These students are in a foreign country. Many have learned a second language… They are young and alone without family. They are following this country’s rules and regulations, and they didn’t do anything wrong,” Lotfi said. “They don’t deserve this.”
“If it’s a U.S. citizen, we say innocent until proven guilty… Why do we not have that same mindset when it comes to foreign nationals?” she added. “It just seems like any arrest for anything then that’s guilt, and that’s not the case. We would never allow that for any of our neighbors, so we should not accept the administration’s description of international students having violated their status when they didn’t.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Even with a major budget hole to fill, Gov. Jim Pillen says he remains “100% confident” that Nebraskans will walk away by early June with a balanced budget and additional property tax relief.
Property tax relief has been a staple for the first-term governor with agricultural roots, who said of his formal 2026 reelection decision: “It’s not if, it’s when.” Getting there will first involve wading through the projected budget deficit that has grown through the course of the 2025 legislative session due to a variety of factors.
“We have to get more competitive, not say, ‘Well, we need revenue,’” Pillen said in a one-on-one interview with the Nebraska Examiner last week. “We just got to stop spending. We have to say, ‘No.’ We have to focus Nebraska government on what needs to be done.”
Medicaid cost-sharing
Pillen places much of the blame for what was an initial $433 million projected budget deficit for the next two years on the state needing to pick up more of the share for Medicaid costs. Medicaid is the state and federal partnership to cover essential health care for low-income individuals and people with disabilities.

The state’s portion of those costs rose because of a decline in the state’s Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP, the percentage at which the federal government covers state Medicaid costs based on a state’s average per capita income, which grew fast enough compared to other states that the federal share dropped. 
The federal government must pay at least 50% of Medicaid costs, but Nebraska’s FMAP fell by 1.58% to 55.94%, which was among the sharpest drops nationally.
The FMAP decrease left lawmakers on the hook for nearly $300 million in the next two fiscal years, plus $55 million this fiscal year. And it could’ve been worse if not for the Arbor Day tornadoes last year, which granted Nebraska a “disaster-recovery adjustment.”
‘Not a shadow of a doubt’
While lawmakers have until May 15 to rightsize the budget, Pillen has eyes set on what comes after: additional property tax relief.
“We’ll get that work done. Not a shadow of a doubt,” Pillen said.
The task, just as it did last summer, again will involve proposals seeking to add sales taxes to goods and services that are currently exempt and on increasing “sin” taxes on vapes or cigarettes. All of those measures fell short in a Pillen-led special session last August.

None reached a floor vote during that session in the face of steady opposition.
This time around, the bills are Legislative Bill 169 and LB 170, from State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, and LB 712, from State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward.
Brandt’s bills would add sales taxes to a series of 18 exempt goods and services, as well as to energy drinks and candy, the latter of which is likely to be taken out. LB 169 would also raise cigarette taxes from 64 cents to $1.36.
Hughes’ bill would increase the tax on electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as vapes, from 10% to 40%. The current tax on devices with 3 milliliters or less of consumable nicotine is 5 cents per milliliter.
A separate measure, Legislative Resolution 20CA, which would allow Nebraskans to decide whether to legalize online sports betting at the November 2026 election, fell short this spring. It could net an annual $32 million, according to sponsor State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln. 
Pillen reiterated that he was “not going to stick my stake in the middle of the field” for sports betting and that if it passed, he would support it. However, he said, he would not advocate for it.

Opponents to Pillen’s plan, including State Sens. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, place the blame for Nebraska’s budget deficit squarely on state spending, particularly on growing property tax relief programs and on declining state revenues from income tax cuts. They are also among those who have said sales tax increases would just shift the tax burden, not lower it.
Conrad has blasted the budget deficit as “self-created,” fueled by Pillen-led “inequitable, unsustainable tax cuts for the largest corporations and the wealthiest individuals.”
Sales taxes and other revenue
Pillen quietly celebrated a milestone this year when, for the first time in 26 years, property taxes statewide decreased. While it was a $6 million decrease from a $5.3 billion total in 2024. It was significant after two historic increases in 2022 and 2023 of nearly $300 million in each.
Why the decrease? For the most part, it’s because the state took over nearly all of the property taxes paid to community colleges.
Pillen said he is pleased and “we’re working our tails off … but sure not satisfied.”
“In spite of the keyboard warriors saying we’re broke,” Pillen pledged that lawmakers would balance the budget. He committed to keeping property taxes flat — at $5.3 billion statewide — which will be a major task as it is local governments, not the state, that sets property tax rates.

Another part of the puzzle could be Hughes’ LB 303, which is stuck in the Education Committee but seeks to have the state take on more of the property tax load of local schools, which represent about half of all property taxes levied.
After the most recent special session, Pillen said he’s learned he has to communicate his plan in a “much simpler way,” focused on cutting spending, broadening the sales tax base and having the state fund, but not run, K-12 education. The final goal would require the state to repurpose existing property tax relief programs and about $1.6 billion in additional state tax revenue each year.
“We’ll keep pounding away at that,” Pillen said.
Part of the shifted strategy is letting lawmakers such as Brandt and Hughes lead the fight on “sin” taxes and sales tax exemptions rather than Pillen doing it himself, as he did before and during the special session.
Pillen pledged to go “toe to toe with anybody” who argues that sales tax exemptions, of which the state has more than 120, didn’t exacerbate property tax increases.
“It does nothing but put a ‘closed for business’ sign on Nebraska,” Pillen said.
Income taxes
Brandt also has LB 171, which would “pause” a planned decrease in the top income tax rate for top earners and corporations.

Pillen, echoing comments from the chairs of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee and Revenue Committee, said that isn’t going to happen. He said the only way to attract and solve the state’s workforce challenges is to help businesses survive.
“I’m not signing off on pausing income tax,” Pillen said. “That’s a crazy thought.”
Lawmakers still might try, either through the budget over the next two weeks or through Brandt’s bills shortly after. State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln has already filed amendments to Brandt’s LB 169 and LB 170 to force the conversation.
Under those amendments, the top tax rates would fall to 4.99% next year, rather than 4.55% before going down to 3.99% the following year.
On whether his plans would be sustainable, Pillen said his solution is continuing to run state government like a business and improving services to save money and find more cuts.
‘Something’s out of balance’
The free market-focused Platte Institute think tank has similarly tossed cold water on “pausing” income tax rate reductions. In a Monday announcement, Platte Institute officials said one way to help close the budget deficit without raising taxes or sweeping one-time dollars from various cash funds is to “freeze” the current levels of property tax credits given by the state at $162 million.
  Jim Vokal, CEO of the Platte Institute in Omaha. Jan. 28, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Michael Lucci, senior policy advisor at the Platte Institute, described the proposal as seeking the best return on investment, a “prudent and reasonable approach to just hold the line.”
Lucci said every dollar for income tax relief goes back to taxpayers, while property tax relief credits aren’t guaranteed to lead to savings, because local property taxes are determined by the local school districts that get the spending offset. 
“We’re suggesting let’s just pause the credits for two years, see what the revenue stream looks like in a couple years,” Platte Institute CEO Jim Vokal told reporters. “But if we go down the road of changing the income taxes, cuts that were scheduled and promised or raising sales taxes, we’re actually passing along a tax increase to Nebraskans.”
Brandt, responding to the Platte Institute’s suggestion, laughed and said he thought it was funny, as property taxes continue to rise by nearly $300 million each year, except for the most recent year.
“Something’s out of balance,” Brandt said. “It just seems disproportionate to me, the cuts that we’ve done for income tax, for the benefits that we’re going to receive.”

CODY — Two days of discussion about the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population passed before anyone inquired about the status of the species the meeting was focused on.
Under a court order in January, the Biden administration’s Fish and Wildlife Service proposed continuing with Endangered Species Act protections in the Yellowstone region and all other portions of the Lower 48 where grizzlies reside. Shortly thereafter, pro-delisting leadership was installed by the Trump administration: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish Department director who’s now nominated to lead the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
For months, there’s been little official word about what’s going on with Fish and Wildlife’s proposal, though the agency delayed the deadline for the public to provide feedback. In Cody this week, the topic was barely broached at the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee’s semi-annual Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee meeting. It only came up because a member of the public, local resident Dewey Vanderhoff, asked “where we’re at in the overall picture with delisting” during the meeting’s closing minutes.

Hilary Cooley, Fish and Wildlife’s grizzly bear recovery coordinator, pointed out the proposal on the table — and said she couldn’t say much more.
“As far as what happens with that proposal, we’re waiting for leadership to be installed,” Cooley said. “Acting leadership is not interested in making decisions right now.”

As of Friday, 27 pending nominees appeared above Nesvik on the U.S. Senate’s Executive Calendar, which suggests the wait could drag on. The Trump administration also appointed another Wyomingite — mule deer advocate Josh Coursey — to a high Fish and Wildlife Service post, albeit one that doesn’t require Senate confirmation.
Even if expected Fish and Wildlife Service leaders don’t attempt to pull back the existing continued-listing proposal administratively, legislative efforts are underway to delist grizzly bears, including from U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming.
 DOGE impacts work of Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team

The gathering of Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear managers in Cody differed from typical meetings because of the turmoil and turnover the Trump administration has brought to the federal government via its Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Most federal members of the committee attended remotely due to travel and spending restrictions. There were also new faces, goodbyes and discussion about what the diminished Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team can realistically accomplish going forward.
“One way or another, the USGS is not going to have the resources they’ve had in the past,” Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Administrator Ken McDonald told the group. “At the November meeting, we better have a plan for the following spring.”
Biologist Matt Gould, the study team’s new leader, told the group that, despite changes in capacity, the committee’s science arm will continue with grizzly monitoring, data collection and administering the new population model to assess bear numbers — last estimated at 1,050 in the ecosystem’s core.

The Cody meeting was the last as a full-time employee for Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team Leader Frank van Manen. The longtime federal biologist retired earlier than expected, though he is staying involved in an emeritus role. He helmed the group for 13 years.
“I know there are some challenges ahead, but keep up the good fight,” van Manen told the group. “This endeavor has been successful for 50 years, for a good reason: Agencies working together.”

(Courtesy of City of Minneapolis)The number of measles cases is approaching 1,000 across 29 states, according to newly released federal statistics. Even as the outbreaks grow, more local governments are complaining that their efforts to combat measles with vaccination clinics have been shut down by abrupt federal funding cuts.
As of May 1, a total of 935 confirmed cases had been reported, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They were in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
There have been three confirmed deaths, two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all unvaccinated.
Metro Nashville, the combined county and city government in Tennessee, and three other local governments sued on April 24 over reductions in federal public health funding, saying the abrupt $11 billion in cuts nationwide forced Nashville to cancel vaccination clinics needed to combat this year’s measles outbreak. Colorado and a group of other states sued earlier in April, mentioning the impact of cuts on their ability to control measles, flu and other vaccine-preventable illnesses.
Others joining the April 24 lawsuit: Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri; and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. They called the cuts “a massive blow… at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.”
The funding cuts also forced Minneapolis to shut down clinics in March that had been scheduled to run through June, said Luisa Pessoa-Brandão, director of health initiatives for the city’s health department.
Last year the city’s clinics served 501 patients with 1,475 vaccination shots, including against measles, she said. About 30% of children in the city are not fully vaccinated, much too high to ensure unvaccinated children won’t fall victim to measles outbreaks like the current one, she added.
“There’s fear and hesitancy about the vaccine, based on some of the misinformation out there,” Pessoa-Brandão said. “There are other factors — access [to medical care] and the COVID pandemic, which delayed people getting vaccinations. We’re playing catch-up the last few years.”

(File Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)With only three days left in this year’s legislative session, the Senate will consider troubling changes to the energy bill adopted by the House of Representatives.
These changes will harm South Carolina ratepayers and property owners unless senators stand firm on the version they passed last month. These surprising House changes represent a betrayal of the public trust and should be soundly defeated by the Senate.
According to news reports, the House approved changes late last Thursday afternoon that were negotiated outside the public eye.
Key Senate leaders weren’t even consulted about these significant changes.
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey and Sen. Chip Campsen, chairman of the Fish Game and Forestry Committee — two who led the energy bill through the Senate in a serious examination — should be commended for their efforts.
Unfortunately, neither senator was consulted, they told reporters, even though they were instrumental in adding consumer protections to the Senate’s version of the bill.
By removing those protections, the House version would allow electric utilities to build new gas pipelines across South Carolina without having to give landowners notice in advance of seeking state permits and would also allow new data centers to be built without requiring them to pay their fair share of interconnection costs.
The House amendment was approved without any meaningful debate on the floor.
Now the Senate has the ability to summarily reject all of these House changes.
The Senate worked long and hard to fashion a reasonable compromise to what the House passed in February. If these utilities want to stick it to our state’s ratepayers and landowners, then let them go home without an energy bill.
If you care about keeping electric utility bills affordable and fair, if you think that new data centers should be required to pay their fair share of costs to connect to the grid, if you care about getting prior written notice before a new gas pipeline is authorized across your private property, then you better pay attention.
We need more transparency, accountability and fairness when it comes to protecting our ratepayers and private landowners in South Carolina.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/powerlines-2-1024x683-1-700x467-1.jpeg,,,2025-05-06 06:05:47.476196

Angela Witwer (D-Delta Twp.),Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy Director Phil Roos announced a $290 million expansion of the MI Clean Water Plan. | Kyle DavidsonWhen the MI Healthy Climate conference kicked off earlier this month, anxieties around the nation’s climate policy likely plagued the minds of attendees, with President Donald Trump once again pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement and working to dismantle efforts to combat climate change and environmental injustice. 
However, Michigan found itself in a similar position not so long ago, Phil Roos, the director of Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy told attendees while delivering the opening speech for the conference.
When Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist took office in 2019, the U.S. was also working to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. However, Whitmer brought Michigan into the U.S. Climate Alliance, joining other states in their commitment to advancing the Paris Agreement’s goals.

The Whitmer administration also assembled a council on climate solutions alongside the state’s environmental justice advisory council, Roos said, as the administration began to organize actions in state government around climate and justice, eventually looking at ways to capture the economic benefits associated with a transition to clean energy. 
This culminated in the passage of the state 2023 clean energy package, which laid out specific goals in shifting Michigan’s energy supply to clean energy resources, with the goal of 100% clean energy by 2040.

In 2024, EGLE’s efforts shifted toward implementing this plan, getting clean energy into communities that would benefit from it the most through programs like the catalyst communities initiative and the MI Justice 40 Accelerator, which provided disadvantaged communities with support in accessing federal climate funding. 
And it’s not just the state helping to roll out and support climate action, Roos said.
“It’s also a local government effort and it’s nonprofits, it’s for-profits, it’s government, it’s all of the above and that’s the way it has to be to make it work,” Roos said. 
While the 2024 election has led to anxieties around federal funding cuts, the turbulent dynamics of federal politics has some people asking whether the state should continue to work on environmental justice and climate. 
“What I wanted to say right now is we don’t have any choice,” Roos said, emphasizing that the science on climate hasn’t changed. 
More than 99% of peer-reviewed studies on climate conclude that climate change is caused by human activity, up from 97% reported in a 2013 study examining the level of consensus in scientific studies on climate change.
“The challenge that we have is as urgent and critical as it has ever been. We may have politics that have changed, but we, the people of Michigan, still need to be able to breathe clean air. We still have people in the state, we’d kind of like to lower their electric fields. We have people whose basements have flooded and might want us to continue to upgrade our infrastructure to protect from the next and the next 100 year flood,” Roos said. 
There are businesses looking to capitalize on Michigan’s transition to renewables, Roos said, stressing that this effort can’t wait. He later told the audience that just as Michigan began its healthy climate efforts without external and federal efforts, it can do so again today. 
Speaking with the Michigan Advance on the second day of the conference, Roos remained optimistic on the state’s efforts to continue working towards the goals laid out in Whitmer’s MI Healthy Climate Plan.

While the status of federal funding for a number of climate efforts remains uncertain, Roos noted that the Healthy Climate Plan predates the $145.4 billion authorized by former President Joe Biden to combat climate change. 
“We know what has to be accomplished,” Roos said. 
“We know what has to be achieved in different areas of the economy, society and we know that. I mean, we went after the federal funding because it was there and it can help accelerate certain aspects of the plan, but achieving those goals isn’t primarily dependent on federal funding,” Roos said. 
When speaking with the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on EGLE in March, Roos explained that 94% of the department’s ongoing funding comes from restricted revenue sources and federal funding, meaning that they are legally obligated to spend those dollars for a set purpose. Federal funding also makes up the largest share of its budget, almost 40%, he said. 
Roos told the Advance that the largest amount of that money comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in the form of categorical grants. The EPA delegates certain activities, like protecting the air and water, and partially covers those costs, he explained.
Thus far, the department has not seen signs that those funds will be cut, Roos said, and while there are federal funds that support efforts in the MI Healthy Climate plan, those are the minority. 
EGLE has similarly felt confident enough to move forward with the launch of its home energy rebate program, which provides eligible households with up to $34,000 in rebates for energy efficiency upgrades to their home and appliances. The effort is supported by $211 million in federal dollars. 
The other positive for Michigan’s climate efforts, is that the 2023 clean energy laws provide a legal standard for EGLE’s efforts on renewable energy, Roos said, setting clear targets for greenhouse gas reduction, energy efficiency standards and goals for state energy regulators in evaluating electrical providers. 
“Funding is great and helpful, and we can accelerate certain elements of it, and we will take it and hope to have it still on some of these areas, but we will continue to find ways to achieve those goals. We may have to take little detours around the way, but so far we’re just charging forward,” Roos said.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)Nearly a month after severe storms battered and flooded several West and Middle Tennessee towns, local officials and nonprofits are still helping residents pick up the pieces while awaiting the Trump administration’s decision on federal aid.
Gov. Bill Lee requested a major disaster declaration — which would unlock federal recovery assistance dollars for public entities and individuals — for select counties on April 17. The federal government has 30 days to respond.
Damage estimates for public property and recovery services throughout West and Middle Tennessee exceed $26 million according to assessments conducted by local, state and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials. To qualify for FEMA aid, damages must be beyond the response capabilities of local and state governments.
Tennessee Emergency Management Agency Assistant Director of Recovery and Mitigation Craig Hanrahan said he believes Tennessee will meet the eligibility threshold for federal public aid. But that’s not a guarantee that the Trump administration will approve the disaster declaration — Arkansas, West Virginia, and Washington have seen their requests for FEMA assistance denied as the federal government pushes states to take on more recovery responsibility.
Individual losses are more difficult to calculate, Hanrahan said. Around 300 homes and 14 businesses or nonprofits were severely damaged by the storms and flooding.
Obion County Mayor: FEMA dollars ‘would be vital’
In Obion County, most of the 100-plus families who evacuated their homes have returned, Obion County Mayor Steve Carr said Wednesday. The flood water has receded, leaving an estimated $1 million in damage to local roads. Several hundred acres of farmland were rutted by the force of the water and covered in sand.
Flooding devastates small West Tennessee town ahead of cold snap

This round of storms hit personal property hard, Carr said. In February, flooding devastated the small town of Rives. In April, Rives flooded again, but this time, the damage also extended to several other communities.
Mission teams from churches and other organizations have helped homeowners tear out wet floors, insulation, drywall and debris. Around four families were displaced, but most residential houses should be “in good shape” within a month or less, he said.
“We’re thankful for the help they’ve provided these folks, because they certainly needed it,” Carr said. “Still do.”
Carr is hopeful that FEMA assistance will come through, particularly for homeowners whose properties suffered major damage. 
FEMA calculates individual assistance for those who apply after a disaster declaration is granted, taking things like homeowners and flood insurance into consideration, Hanrahan said.
The Individual Assistance Program may help pay for rental assistance, home repairs and personal property replacement, but isn’t intended to cover all individual losses, according to FEMA.
Officials in affected counties are encouraging residents to document damage to their properties.
If federal aid is denied, “it’s just going to be more difficult for the individuals as they try to find ways to recover from this,” Carr said. “It would be vital to get that help, and we’re certainly hoping that the declaration will come through, but we know there’s a chance that it won’t. We will be here to try to work with them if we can, to help any way we can.”
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

Should Trump’s administration approve Tennessee’s disaster declaration request, the federal government will cover about 75% of certain recovery costs, with a 25% local match. In Tennessee, the state typically pays for half of that match, leaving local governments to make up the other 12.5% of the bill.
In the absence of public assistance, counties will be on their own to figure out how to recoup the cost of repairing damage.
If federal aid is denied, Tennessee will likely pursue the appeal process and lean on partnerships with nonprofits and faith-based organizations for help with recovery, Hanrahan said. TEMA also encourages local governments to form their own long-term recovery groups with charitable partners.
Nearly 500 tons of debris removed from Dyersburg
Dyersburg, a town with about 16,000 residents in Dyer County, saw damage from flooding and severe winds. A suspected tornado damaged 16 houses, one public building and seven businesses, totaling about $2 million, Dyersburg Mayor John Holden said. Flooding affected 121 properties inside the city limits, including 110 houses, 11 public areas, 48 businesses, five churches and a police precinct.
The community has rallied to help those in need, with churches and nonprofits helping provide meals, cleaning supplies and clothing for flood victims and those assisting in recovery. South Dyersburg, where flood water covered local roadways and crept into homes, is mostly composed of rental properties, Holden said. 
Local organizations and church groups have helped remove soaked drywall and insulation from about 75% of the owner-occupied homes in the area, and landlords are working on their properties. 
“Those that were displaced and owned their homes, we have got them assistance,” Holden said. Some are still in hotels.

The city removed nearly 127 tons of flood debris and 372 tons of debris from wind damage as of April 28. Combined, the debris is equivalent in weight to about 120 heavy-duty pickup trucks.
Holden said he believes the damage in Dyersburg meets the criteria for public assistance through FEMA, which would help reimburse the city for part of what they spent on cleanup, overtime, equipment and rescue efforts.
In the aftermath of the worst flood in Dyersburg’s history in 2010, the city used some of the federal aid it received to install mitigation measures to lessen the impact of future floods.
Lift stations at the wastewater treatment plant that were lost in 2010’s flood survived this time around because the controls could be lifted several feet above the water, Holden said. Residents of a mobile home park that flooded in 2010 were relocated and the area became the Dyersburg Soccer Complex. The fields were entirely under water in early April, but usable by the end of the month. 
If federal assistance doesn’t come through this time, the city will rely on volunteers, churches and relief organizations for help. 
“We’ll get it done locally, somehow, some way,” Holden said.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The 2025 Idaho legislative session may be over, but its impact on our children will last far longer — and not for the better.
As the session dragged past its intended adjournment, one thing became painfully clear: Idaho’s children were not a priority. Legislators found time to debate flags and push culture war bills into classrooms, but when it came to supporting our youngest citizens — those who will one day inherit this state — they failed.
Some Idaho education groups concerned with state’s new public schools budgets, operations funding

School buildings continue to crumble, special education remains underfunded, and child care providers are forced to operate under weaker safety standards due to legislative rollbacks. Meanwhile, children from undocumented families were denied food assistance, school lunches, and even health care through Medicaid — all because of their parents’ immigration status. These policies don’t just hurt children — they compromise the future of Idaho.
Instead of focusing on real issues, our lawmakers catered to special interests and pushed another round of income tax cuts — our fifth in four years. It’s true that everyone likes tax cuts. But we must ask: at what cost?
Since 2022, these income tax cuts have drained nearly $1.9 billion from Idaho’s budget, with another $948 million lost annually moving forward. That’s $2.8 billion in permanent revenue gone by the end of 2025—funds that could have been invested in updating schools, expanding health care, and keeping property taxes in check. This year alone, the Legislature cut $87 million from public education, let a $205 working families tax credit expire, and slashed $15 million from affordable housing while passing yet another tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthiest Idahoans.
The numbers don’t lie: Idaho’s wealthiest 1% received an average tax break of over $15,000. The average Idaho family? Just $337. And now, with the expiration of the Child Tax Credit, most families will actually see a tax increase.
This is not responsible governance, it’s a reckless redistribution of resources upward, leaving working families to bear the burden.
At Idaho Children Are Primary, we believe lawmakers should be judged on a simple question: Is this good for kids? That’s why we publish our Kids Matter Index (KMI), a non-partisan scorecard tracking legislators’ votes on bills affecting children — from school funding and day care licensing to Medicaid and public assistance.
This year’s results are sobering. Only 25% of legislators scored 80% or higher — a strong pro-child record. That’s down from 30% last year and 40% the year before. Meanwhile, 65% of lawmakers scored below 69%. The trend is unmistakable: Idaho’s Legislature is prioritizing children less and less each year.
And those who did stand up for children? Many were punished at the ballot box. In the 2024 primaries, several legislators with strong KMI scores were replaced by candidates backed by out-of-state money and extreme ideologies.
This should alarm every Idahoan. Our children’s futures are being shaped not just by what laws pass—but by who we elect to make those laws.
So what can we do?
First, hold your legislators accountable. Ask them how they voted. Ask why. If their priorities don’t align with your values, let them know — and vote accordingly. You can find your legislator at the Idaho State Legislature’s “Who’s My Legislator?” tool.
Second, engage with your community. Talk to neighbors, attend town halls, and show up to school board meetings. Real change starts locally.
Third, pay close attention to the 2026 May primary election. That’s when many key decisions are made — often by just a few hundred votes. Use tools like the Kids Matter Index to learn how your lawmakers vote, not just what they say.
Idaho’s constitution is clear: “All political power is inherent in the people.” If our representatives won’t prioritize kids, it’s time we elect ones who will.
Idaho’s children deserve better. Our families deserve better. And Idaho’s future depends on the choices we make today. Let’s ensure our lawmakers choose our children — by choosing our lawmakers wisely.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters.
Undocumented students in Colorado have gone on to be teachers, nurses, and business owners thanks to a program that allows them to pay in-state tuition at public universities.
Now the future of that program and ones like it in 23 other states are in doubt after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that seeks to punish states and cities with so-called sanctuary policies.
The order, signed on April 28, also specifically calls out programs that provide in-state tuition for undocumented students who graduated from high school in that state or who meet other residency requirements.
Allowing in-state students who are not citizens to pay less tuition than out-of-state students who are citizens represents discrimination, according to the order, which says that the attorney general, in cooperation with the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, “shall identify and take appropriate action to stop the enforcement of state and local laws, regulations, policies, and practices favoring aliens over any groups of American citizens that are unlawful.”

Advocates for immigrant students say that without in-state tuition, many undocumented students will struggle to afford college. They don’t qualify for any federal financial aid and face other barriers to college.
“This is absolutely essential for immigrant students,” said Raquel Lane-Arellano, communications manager for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, which fought to pass Colorado’s in-state tuition law in 2013. “It’s not these students’ fault that our immigration system is so broken. They deserve the opportunity, just like all of their peers, to access higher levels of education.”
So far, Colorado universities are not making any immediate changes to their policies. “The executive order does not provide enough details to truly know what federal actions will be taken,” said Colorado Department of Higher Education spokesperson Megan McDermott.
The Trump order sets up a possible legal showdown over the state-supported tuition programs that immigrant rights and higher education-advising groups have called essential to help undocumented students access higher education and educate them to fill in-demand jobs.
Twenty-four states, including Colorado, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey, along with Washington, D.C. have programs that allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition. While the programs have received bipartisan support, Republicans in several states have recently filed bills to consider rolling back in-state tuition for undocumented students. Last week, Florida lawmakers ended the state’s decade-old program.
The order adds to an already uncertain environment for immigrant students, who worry about the risks of filling out financial aid paperwork while grappling with deportation fears. Denver Scholarship Foundation’s Natasha Garfield said the college-advising nonprofit will continue to provide students information about their options and allow them to decide whether college is right for them during a time when Trump’s immigration stance has brought incredible uncertainty.
“There are some who are very, very concerned about the state of things, and I don’t think there’s anything that DSF or anyone else could say to reassure them,” said Garfield, the scholarship organization’s director of scholarships and financial aid. “I think that’s completely understandable given some of the actions that we’ve seen coming from (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and the federal government.”
The order is part of Trump’s larger push to crackdown on people in the United States without legal authorization. His directive to punish states with these programs also included several other enforcement actions such as punishing so-called sanctuary cities and states. The administration filed suit Friday against Colorado and Denver for its policies.










Blocking states from offering in-state tuition to undocumented students who have lived in these states for most of their lives would purposefully lock countless individuals out of the higher education system, waste years of educational investment, hurt local economies, and rob all Americans of future leaders.


– Todd Schulte, FWD.us president


The administration argues in the order that some state and local officials use their “authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of federal immigration laws. This is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law.”
States have a long history of offering in-state tuition at public universities to youth who were brought as children and without legal status. Texas and California passed the first laws in 2001, and other states followed with similar laws. Each varies in how they approach granting in-state tuition.
About 408,000 undocumented students enroll in higher education each year, although not all benefit from these state programs, according to the Higher Ed Immigration Portal. However, even in states without these laws, some private schools in Tennessee and elsewhere may offer in-state tuition for all students regardless of their residency or legal status. And in Pennsylvania, at least one public institution provides in-state tuition to undocumented students.
Colorado’s Advising Students for a Stronger Tomorrow law, or ASSET, updated in 2019, says students must have attended a Colorado high school for at least one year before graduation or been physically present in Colorado for at least one year to qualify for in-state tuition.
New York’s law says students must have attended at least two years of high school in New York and graduate or receive a general education diploma. Students must also apply to a college or university within five years and show proof of residency. They must also sign an affidavit saying they will file for legal status.
Illinois’ law has similar requirements, while New Jersey requires three years of residency.
National student immigrant advocacy organizations FWD.us, TheDream.US, and the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration all criticized the order. Collectively, they said states, colleges, and universities shouldn’t overreact and that the order hurts states that need qualified workers.
“Blocking states from offering in-state tuition to undocumented students who have lived in these states for most of their lives would purposefully lock countless individuals out of the higher education system, waste years of educational investment, hurt local economies, and rob all Americans of future leaders,” said Todd Schulte, FWD.us president.
State leaders are still working to understand the impact of the order, and a spokesperson for Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement the administration is looking into the impacts of this order. The state remains committed to ensuring the state remains a destination for all learners, the statement says.
The state has not filed any legal action against the order, but leaders have been willing to push back on Trump administration orders.
Colorado’s largest university system also doesn’t plan changes at this time. University of Colorado System spokesperson Michele Ames said its schools are committed to following applicable laws and will not make any changes at this time. Other universities, such as the University of Northern Colorado, are monitoring the actions.
Schools across the state have also said that they won’t release individual student information, such as information about undocumented students who attend schools through the ASSET program, to the federal government without a court order or warrant, per federal student privacy laws.

(Drew Costley/ Verite News)As a resident of St. James Parish, Barbara Washington is already surrounded by plastics manufacturers, chemical companies and natural gas refineries that populate the parish. But the local government is looking to pave the way for more industry — at the expense of her community’s health, she told Verite News.
Washington, a co-founder of environmental justice group Inclusive Louisiana, spoke with Verite days after the parish council voted to approve two motions that showed their support for growing the presence of the petrochemical industry in town last month.
The council approved at its April 2 meeting property tax exemptions for Air Products and Chemicals, along with a resolution expressing support for Formosa’s efforts to bring a plastics plant to the parish. The developments come as the Trump administration pulls support for environmental justice communities around the United States and threatens to roll back environmental regulations that could protect communities like the one Washington lives in.
Despite a federal court reopening a lawsuit brought by Inclusive Louisiana and other local environmentalists that could pause new industrial development, Washington said it feels “overwhelming” to fight against various industrial projects at once. That it doesn’t slow her down, though.
“We’ve been here before the plants ever came here,” Washington said. “And we know something is wrong, and we keep saying it’s wrong, and they keep ignoring us.”

St. James Parish is located in an area known as “Cancer Alley” for its disproportionately high cancer rates. Elevated cancer rates in parishes in the industrial corridor that stretches from New Orleans to Baton Rouge have been attributed to high levels of toxic air pollution from nearby facilities by researchers from Tulane University. Most of those facilities are located in predominantly-Black neighborhoods, which environmental justice activists have argued violates residents’ civil rights.
“The segregated and racialized land use system of St. James Parish is directly traceable to land use methods necessary to the system of chattel slavery and the subsequent periods of violence, dispossession, and residential segregation white people carried out during the post-Reconstruction periods of neo-slavery and Jim Crow,” the lawsuit reads.
Washington said the recent council votes came at the expense of the parish’s public health and infrastructure. The council unanimously voted to grant Air Products & Chemicals, a petrochemical company in Convent,  property tax breaks through the Industrial Tax Exemption program for the next decade. Washington said she was dissatisfied with the parish council’s decision.
“And here we see that our highways are really in need of fixing,” Washington said. “The burden of all of this falls on the community when they don’t pay their fair share of taxes.”
Air Products has resumed use of machinery that converts methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the cleaner fuel hydrogen, which had been sitting idle since 2020, said Art George, a spokesman for the company. The plant where the machinery, called a natural gas reformer, is located is a part of the company’s Gulf Coast hydrogen gas pipeline system, according to a state database.
The pipeline delivers refined hydrogen gas across the coast, making it the largest hydrogen pipeline system in the world, George said. But the reformer in Convent also produces gases that speed up climate change such as carbon dioxide and pose dangers to human health such as carbon monoxide.

“We feel left out, because every time we go to the council meeting or the planning commission, it seems like their minds have already been made up [to be] pro-industry,” Washington said. “They tell us that they’re looking at the economic impact, but they’re looking at wealth, and we are looking at health.”
The St. James Parish Council also voted to symbolically voice support for a controversial  petrochemical complex that would be one of the largest in the world if completed. Formosa’s “Sunshine Project” would manufacture plastic items and emit known carcinogens like ethylene oxide, benzene and formaldehyde into the nearby community, a predominantly Black residential neighborhood in St. James’ Fifth District. The project has faced several delays due to lawsuits and permitting issues.
Anthony “AJ” Jasmin, the council parish representative for 5th district, introduced the resolution reaffirming the parish government’s support for Formosa with the support of Parish President Pete Dufresne. All but one parish councilmember — Donald Nash, who represents the 7th district — voted yes on the resolution.
Sharon Lavigne, the founder of environmental justice organization RISE St. James, is one of Jasmin’s constituents. She said she was disappointed by the resolution he introduced.
“It felt like a betrayal,” she said. “I feel like he let us down.”
St. James Parish Council members did not respond to requests for comment.
The communities around the proposed Formosa plant are already at high risk of exposure to toxic air releases, according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s EJScreen, an environmental justice mapping tool that was taken down by the Trump administration in February.
“As a citizen of St. James Parish, naturally, me being here with all of the toxic pollution that we are breathing and getting sick from and dying from cancer, I’m very disappointed in them passing a resolution that will continue to harm our air, our water and our land,” Washington said.
The parish council passed the resolution despite the troubled economic outlook for plastic production. An April report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analytics recommended that Formosa abandon its project in St. James. Oversaturation in the plastics market, slow industrial growth and shifts to sustainable goods contribute to the poor projections for the project and the polyethylene sector as a whole, the report reads, and the company’s performance has declined over the past four years.
Despite the bleak picture painted by the report, a Formosa spokesperson, Janile Parks, reaffirmed the company’s commitment to the project.
Local say-so for carbon storage projects in Louisiana takes a blow

“FG is disappointed by the delays the project has faced, but remains confident that all permits were properly issued,” Parks said in a statement. “We do not intend to give up the fight for this important economic development project that will benefit the people of St. James Parish and Louisiana.”
But Formosa’s claim that it has all the permits necessary for construction is “misleading,” said Mike Brown, an Earthjustice attorney. Earthjustice represents Rise St. James in their lawsuit against Formosa.
Brown said Formosa can’t meet the newer and stricter standards for fine particulate matter and ethylene oxide emissions, which means that the company might not be able to renew expired permits. And although the Trump administration announced last month that the EPA is working to roll back standards for particulate matter, Brown said that effort might take years.
Formosa also cannot begin construction until it receive a wetlands permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In 2021, the Army Corps ordered Formosa to complete a full environmental review of the project, a complex process that takes years to complete.
Parks did not respond to questions about whether or not the environmental review process had even begun, or when it is set to finish. She said the project has been paused for the past four years while Formosa works with the Army Corps.
Lavigne said Rise St. James will do everything in its power to stop Formosa from completing the plans, including calling on other organizations and activists to join.
“We’re not gonna roll over and say, ‘Oh no, we lost,’” Lavigne said. “We will still fight. If we lose, we will continue to fight.”

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — More than a dozen state lawyers’ groups have signed onto to a letter affirming their “unwavering commitment” to the rule of law, including the preservation of an independent judiciary and a right to a legal defense.
The letter, drafted by the officers of the Nebraska Bar Association and released on Law Day, May 1, was designed to respond to the “noise” created about the meaning of the rule of law stirred up by actions of the Trump administration in recent weeks, a designated spokesman of the lawyers’ group said.
“This isn’t pointed at any particular issue or any particular case. This is what Nebraska lawyers say, when you hear talk about the rule of law,” said Ken Hartman, an Omaha attorney and president-elect designate of the Bar Association.
“There’s just a lot of noise out there about the rule of law, in a lot of different ways,” Hartman said. “This is what we see as the core principles of the rule of law.”
Statement doesn’t name Trump
The Bar’s statement — which doesn’t name Trump — comes as some legal groups have criticized steps taken by President Donald Trump and his second administration, including the disregard of a U.S. Supreme Court order to return a Maryland man wrongly deported, the hasty deportation of 200 other men to a prison in El Salvador and the “perp walk” arrest of a Wisconsin judge.
The statement comes a week after several current and former law professors at the University of Nebraska College of Law signed a letter stating that the rule of law “was in peril” and urged the state’s congressional delegation to take steps to safeguard it.
Hartman said Bar officials were unaware of the NU law professors’ letter. He did acknowledge, though, that the issuance of the letter was not a normal part of recognizing Law Day, and was in response to a perception that the rule of law was under “attack.”
“We think it’s important that Nebraskans know what we as lawyers think,” he said.
Principles of legal system matter
The letter, signed by 12 other legal associations in the state and the deans of the state’s two law schools, outlines four “foundational principles that uphold our democratic republic: the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, the separation of powers, and the right to a vigorous defense.”
“Upon our admission to the practice of law, Nebraska lawyers take an oath to uphold the constitutions of the United States and the State of Nebraska,” the lawyers wrote. “Regardless of practice area, political affiliation, or position, the undersigned organizations are united in their defense of the rule of law and these core principles of our constitution and justice system.”
“The law cannot defend itself; the rule of law endures because of the vigilance and commitment of those sworn to uphold it,” the letter concludes.
Judges, it states, should be “free from political pressure” or “fear of reprisal.”
Everyone, it states, is “entitled to a fair hearing and a vigorous defense” … “regardless of their popularity, public opinion or the nature of the legal issue at hand.”
It called the separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government the “cornerstone of our constitutional framework” that serves as a check and balance that “prevents abuse.”
“Everyone stands subject and accountable to the law,” the letter read.
Recent events spurred reaction
The Trump administration has come under fire from some for disregarding the high court’s order directing it to “facilitate” the return of the Maryland man wrongfully detained and flown to a prison in El Salvador — a deportation the administration later conceded was an “administrative error.”
Others have questioned whether those flown to the El Salvador prison were denied constitutionally guaranteed “due process” rights that require the government to provide evidence in court showing why someone should be deported, and allowing those targeted a chance to contest and rebut the evidence.
Trump has also retaliated against some private law firms that represented people challenging him and his administration’s actions. Some law firms cut deals with the president and others challenged him.
More recently, controversy stirred after a Wisconsin judge was arrested by the FBI for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant in her courtroom avoid arrest — an arrest that was highly publicized, leading some to say it was intended to intimidate judges.
Hartman said that once the Bar Association’s officers drafted the letter, other legal groups were invited to sign on. He said he could recall only one group, the Omaha Bar Association, that did not sign on. But Hartman said he was unclear if it was because of a timing issue or because they didn’t agree.

Former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada admitted to knowing his former top aide was behind a secretly-run political vendor after being told it was a federal crime to lie to the FBI.
When FBI agents raided his Franklin home on Jan. 8, 2021 in a prelude to a federal indictment on fraud and kickback charges, Casada initially told FBI agents he didn’t think his ex-chief of staff, Cade Cothren, ran Phoenix Solutions.
“Maybe he does something for them. That’s just my opinion,” Casada said on the audiotape prosecutors played as the corruption trial entered its third week in Nashville’s federal court.
But after FBI agent Austin Barger notified him it was illegal to lie to federal agents, Casada changed his story.
“Yes, I knew Phoenix Solutions was Cade, and I knew the state didn’t know it was Cade,” Casada said on the audiotape.
Testimony last week from former Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson, who pleaded guilty in the case and cooperated with federal authorities, showed she, Casada and Cothren met at an upscale Nashville bar in late 2019 and came up with the plan to make money on House constituent mailers and campaign and Republican Caucus work through Phoenix Solutions, which Cothren would operate. She described the postage and printing program for House members as “low-hanging fruit.”










Yes, I knew Phoenix Solutions was Cade, and I knew the state didn’t know it was Cade. 


– Former House Speaker Glen Casada


Casada told FBI agents he and Smith recruited business from House members and turned it over to Cothren, who had resigned from his chief of staff post in spring of 2019 in the midst of a racist and sexist texting scandal. Casada stepped down from the House speakership in August that year after a no-confidence vote by the House Republican Caucus.
Casada also admitted to FBI agents that Cothren couldn’t deal directly with House members. Lawmakers such as former Rep. Patsy Hazlewood and Republican Rep. Jay Reedy of Erin testified early in the trial they wouldn’t have done business with Phoenix Solutions if they’d known Cothren was running it.
Early in his interview with federal agents, Casada also said he had only “heard of Phoenix Solutions,” but then acknowledged the company did some of his constituent mailers and told the agents, “My brain’s not working this morning.”
His story continued to shift during the interview, as he said Phoenix Solutions “may be something Cade’s doing,” then added he didn’t know who was behind the vendor and didn’t know Matthew Phoenix, the bogus name for the company’s owner. 
Numerous documents introduced in court showed Cothren was owner of the New Mexico-based company. The defense has acknowledged that Cothren ran the company.
In addition, Casada told agents that morning he would collect a check from the state for constituent mailer work done for lawmakers and send it to Phoenix Solutions, which would write a check back to him as his commission. Casada and Smith made 25% each, and Cothren collected 30%, with the rest of the money going back into the company, according to previous testimony.
Federal prosecutors last week introduced evidence showing how the money flowed in the alleged money laundering scheme.
Reviving the 2019 voucher vote
When FBI agents raided Cothren’s Nashville home in January 2021, he told them he might have done things differently in looking back on his seven years working in the Tennessee Legislature.
  “I lied for members up there for years,” said Cade Cothren to FBI agents, on audio that was played in federal court on Monday. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“I lied for members up there for years,” to cover up their actions, Cothren said on the audiotape.
Yet he said “hard work” helped pass Gov. Bill Lee’s first voucher program that provides funds to low-income students in Metro Nashville, Memphis and Chattanooga to enroll in private schools. Cothren said he never offered anything for lawmakers’ campaigns to encourage them to vote for the bill, only projects for their districts.
Casada held the vote board open for 45 minutes that April day after a tie roiled the House. He and Cothren worked the chamber for one more vote and eventually passed the measure when Republican Rep. Jason Zachary of Knoxville agreed to vote for it as long as Knox County Schools was removed as a voucher district.
Former Democratic Rep. John Mark Windle has said he was offered a promotion to general in the National Guard in return for his vote. Casada has denied making the offer, though one lawmaker, former Rep. Kent Calfee, said he heard Casada say on the House balcony he was going to call the governor’s office to see if he could get Windle a promotion from colonel.
Cothren told FBI agents it came from a person in another office “who had no business having a conversation like that,” not from him or Casada. Cothren also termed it as “very innocent.” He declined to identify the individual.
“It was a stupid conversation that never should have taken place,” Cothren said on the recording.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) Metro Nashville and state officials continue to seek information about a Sunday immigration enforcement action, even as several city council members question what role city law enforcement may have played.
During a Monday press conference, Mayor Freddie O’Connell reiterated the traffic stops and resulting detentions were a result of a coordinated effort between federal and state agencies and that the Metro Nashville Police Department was not involved.
“What’s clear today is that people who do not share our values of safety and community have the authority to cause deep community harm,” O’Connell said. “We are working to determine more about what happened over the weekend  but what we know right now based on public statements is state and federal officials coordinated without us to engage in traffic enforcement clearly intended to target immigration concerns.”
In a public statement, the Tennessee Highway Patrol called the detentions — which followed approximately 150 traffic stops in a South Nashville area heavily populated by immigrants — as a “public safety operation that targeted areas of suspected gang activity with a history of serious traffic crashes.”
Metro Legal Director Wally Dietz said he has sent a letter to the Tennessee Highway Patrol asking for the names of those arrested and what those people were charged with. Officials with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, he added, have been “totally opaque in responding.”

But members of Metro Council’s Immigrant Caucus expressed skepticism about O’Connell’s claims Metro Police weren’t involved.
“The lack of transparency around coordination with federal agencies has raised serious questions,” said Councilmember Terry Vo, caucus chair.
Outrage from Davidson County’s state delegation 
O’Connell said he spoke with Gov. Bill Lee briefly about the detention action.
“I flagged that this seems like a moment of significant tension increase between local and state,” O’Connell said. “He’s aware of the complicated landscape.”
In a letter sent to the heads of Tennessee’s Department of Homeland Security and the Highway Patrol, members of the Davidson County legislative delegation were more pointed.
“By all appearances, government officials racially and ethnically profiled residents, requested driver’s licenses, inquired about tattoos, left cars abandoned on roadways creating traffic hazards, and too at least one mother from her children,” reads the letter, which is signed by all members of the delegation except for Sen. Mark Pody, a Lebanon Republican who represents a portion of eastern Davidson County.
Questions raised in the letter include those about which agency initiated the action, what — if any — interaction occurred between Metro Nashville officials and state agencies and how the action fits with the scope of the THP’s statutory authority.
20250505133956201
In a separate statement, Nashville Democratic Sen. Jeff Yarbro, in whose district the immigration sweep took place, denounced the action as “a sloppy attempt to round people up” in “what can only be described as a dragnet targeting Nashville’s largest Latino neighborhood.”
“Belonging Fund” launched to aid immigrant families 
Hal Cato, CEO of the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee, joined O’Connell at the Monday press conference to announce the creation of the “Belonging Fund,” set up to provide emergency assistance to immigrant families — and particularly those affected by Sunday’s enforcement action — in times of crisis.
Cato noted the funds can be used for housing, food, transportation and child care, but not for legal fees.
The Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, Tennessee Justice for our Neighbors and Conexión Américas are supporting the “Belonging Fund.”
A special meeting of the Metro Council’s Public Health and Safety Committee is scheduled for 4 p.m. Wednesday in council chambers at the Metro Courthouse.

(Lauren Love | Courtesy photo)West Virginia’s strict school immunization laws still stand after the state House of Delegates voted down a key Senate measure during the 2025 regular legislative session that would have permitted broad religious and philosophical vaccine exemptions for families. 
Although that bill didn’t pass, an executive order issued by Gov. Patrick Morrisey directs state health officials to offer a religious exemption to the state’s school-age immunization requirements. Morrisey made it clear on Friday that public schools must comply, and the state health department told West Virginia Watch on Monday that every school, including private schools, should be following the governor’s executive order. 
“The Department of Health treats all applications for religious exemptions the same, whether they come from a parent of a child enrolled in a public, private, or parochial school or daycare center,” a spokesperson for the department said. 
Morrisey’s unorthodox power move to bypass lawmakers has prompted a fractured response among the state’s public and private schools and spurred confusion among parents. The issue is likely to end up in court. 
And already, various schools are saying they don’t plan to follow the governor’s order until the state law changes.
The Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston — which operates 24 schools throughout the state — will not accept religious exemptions for required school vaccinations despite the executive order, said Tim Bishop, communications director for the church. 
Neither will the Linsley School, a private boarding school in Wheeling with 400 students. 
“Since the Legislature has not changed the state law and no religious exemption is provided in West Virginia law, we will continue enforcing vaccine requirements,” Justin Zimmerman, Linsley’s head of school, wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch. “As an independent and private boarding school with students from 24 countries and multiple states, the immunizations required under current law help to protect our community.”
Private school isn’t an option for 10 year-old Maxwell Jackson, who is diagnosed with FOXG-1 syndrome, a hereditary genetic condition that requires him to use a wheelchair and feeding tube full time. Maxwell, who lives in Kanawha County, requires a full-time nurse and other accommodations available only in public school.
Marisa Jackson, his mother, said that the syndrome also suppresses Maxwell’s immune system. A common cold can turn into pneumonia, she said. Now, as the nation is experiencing a wave of measles cases, Jackson, 42, worries about her son’s future should the executive order stand. 
“The governor is saying, ‘No, I’m going to do this because this is what I want,’” she said, noting that elected lawmakers declined to loosen the state’s vaccination requirements. “[Morrisey] is not representing the people of West Virginia.” 
     Morrisey forces public schools to comply 

According to Morrisey’s executive order, “a writing signed by the objector” is enough to establish a religious exemption to the state’s vaccination mandates. It doesn’t require a signature from a doctor or religious leader.
Families in West Virginia are already using executive order to bypass the state’s school vaccination requirements. As of March, DoH had approved 186 vaccine exemption requests. 
As students are enrolling for the coming year, state schools Superintendent Michele Blatt issued a memo May 2 to county superintendents recommending that students not be allowed to attend schools next year without the required vaccinations. 
“We are faced with the fact that state law has not been changed by the Legislature and there is no religious exemption provided for in West Virginia law,” Blatt wrote. 
Wood County school nurse Alisa Shepler said the memo from Blatt was a “solid document” that told them how to move forward with vaccination requirements in public schools. Prior to that, she said, nurses weren’t sure what the state policy was on immunizations following the legislative session. 
“When that memo came out Friday, I can guarantee that every school nurse in that whole State of West Virginia did a happy dance,” she said. 
Before the day was over, Blatt rescinded the memo at the request of Morrisey. She is now working with the governor’s office to issue clear guidance to schools about how to comply with the executive order. 
“The Governor’s office has informed me that the West Virginia Department of Health will continue to review and grant religious exemptions to compulsory school vaccine requirements, and counties should honor those exemption requests that have been duly granted,” Blatt wrote in a statement.
Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, issued a statement Monday, saying that the governor’s orders “can’t be trumped by bureaucrats.”
“Superintendent Blatt’s memo was wrong, both legally and morally,” Hess Crouse wrote in a statement. “School boards do not have the legal authority to defy the Executive Branch, and no bureaucrat has the power to erase parental rights with a single-page memo.”
Shepler said she was “highly disappointed” with the about face. 
“I went from like, ‘Thank goodness we have, like, clear, solid directions,’ to ‘I can’t believe this just happened,’” she said. 
Chandra Adkins, a mother and leader of West Virginians for Health Freedom leader, said schools currently enrolling students haven’t been informing families about the new religious exemption option. 
Additionally, she said that parents who have already used the religious exemption under the executive order are concerned about its future.
“Because the law didn’t pass, there’s a lot of confusion,” said Adkins, who lives in Beckley. “Parents are scared, and they want their kids to go to school, and if they utilize the exemption now, they want them to be able to go to school in the fall. People shouldn’t have to worry that a state agency is coming after them.”
Jackson said the changes to school immunization requirements may force her son, Maxwell, to now learn strictly from home.
“He couldn’t be around peers his own age,” she said. 
‘Taking a page out of President Trump’s playbook’
West Virginia’s school vaccination law is one of the strictest in the nation. All states require that students attending school be vaccinated for certain infectious diseases. Until this year, the state was one of only five states that allow only medical exemptions – not religious or philosophical exemptions to those vaccine requirements. 
Adkins, whose group has around 4,000 members, said parents should be informed of their rights. 
“People should have informed consent,” she said. 
Morrisey asked the GOP-led legislature to codify his executive order. Without the change to state law, he said that the exemption is being lawfully permitted through the Equal Protection for Religion Act, which was signed into law by Gov. Jim Justice in 2023.
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, said that after the memos on Friday, the only way to resolve the issue is through litigation. Someone needs to file a lawsuit to strike down the governor’s executive order, he said. 
“The Legislature does have authority and the governor does not. I think that’s clear,” Garcia said. “But the governor is kind of taking a page out of President [Donald] Trump’s playbook of just either ignoring or violating the law when it doesn’t suit his policy preferences. And I think he’s on a course to make someone or some entity challenge him, and he’s going to keep doing what he’s doing until that happens.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/0-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-06 06:05:47.476196

(Getty Images)Now that Gov. Patrick Morrisey has finished his actions on all of the bills passed during the legislative session, we can finally say it’s officially over.
On Wednesday, he vetoed six bills — because of “financial reasons” — and signed some of the most controversial bills from the session into law.
Morrisey was so proud of signing a voter ID bill into law, he held a news conference at the Capitol. He even had a little sign on his lectern that said “ELECTION INTEGRITY.” (Memo to self: Put in a public records request to find out how much is this administration spending on these signs for every event? Talk about financial waste.)
House Bill 3016 will require that voters provide some sort of photo identification when they vote at the polls. Even the governor said during his ceremonial signing of the bill that he and other legislators acknowledge that voter fraud is not widespread in West Virginia.
Voter fraud is extremely rare. Not only that, but voter impersonation is “virtually nonexistent.” Research has found that many instances of fraud are actually clerical errors or bad data matching practices.
Voter ID laws only prevent in-person voter impersonation, which according to the Brennan Center, is extremely low at 0.00004.% The report noted that it’s more likely that a voter would be struck by lightning than impersonating someone else at the polls.
What voter ID laws actually do is suppress voting access for older people, low-income individuals and people of color  — who tend to lean more Democratic than Republican. 
In another blow to marginalized groups, Morrisey also signed his legislation to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in West Virginia. This was one of his first executive orders he made on his second day in office. The only thing surprising about this is that he didn’t sign it sooner.
Possibly the most dangerous bill signed into law was Senate Bill 154, which prohibits instruction related to sexual orientation and gender identity. This bill states that if a student asks to be referred to by pronouns different from their biological sex or to be referred to by a different name, that the teacher must tell the student’s parents. Even if the teacher believes the student may be in danger if they do so, they are still required to report it or the parents can bring legal action against the school.
It’s disappointing that this bill was sponsored by a public school teacher. Sen. Amy Grady, R-Mason, has introduced several bills to help teachers and students, but this legislation will put children in danger.
“In cases like these, a teacher would be faced with choosing between following this new law or putting their student’s life at risk,” said Andrew Schneider, executive director of the LGBTQ civil rights organization Fairness WV.
Teachers know better than anyone that not all parents are accepting of their children and that school may be the only safe space for them, or a teacher could be the only safe adult they can talk to. 
Transgender people are much more likely to be abused by their immediate family and kicked out of the home, leading to depression, increased risk of suicide and substance abuse, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Trans youth, despite being a small percentage of the population, are overrepresented in the foster care system, juvenile detention centers and homeless shelters. 
Is it really worth telling a child’s parents they want to go by a different pronoun or name when doing so can result in that child becoming homeless or dead? 
About 54% of transgender and nonbinary children found their school to be gender-affirming, and reported lower rates of attempting suicide, according to the Trevor Project’s 2024 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Young People. The survey also found that LGBTQ+ children who said they lived in accepting communities attempted suicide at less than half the rate as those who said their communities were very unaccepting.
A child cannot learn if they don’t feel safe or respected. Accepting a child’s preferred name, nickname or pronoun is a great way to create a supportive learning place.
While it’s true that lawmakers took up — and even — passed other measures, that this was a priority in a session where much more needed to be done to help West Virginians, is ridiculous. For instance, they did nothing to fix health insurance for public employees, which has been a mess for years. No, thousands more of taxpayers money will be used for Morrisey’s special session to address that issue.

When Marcus Daly and William Clark, and later Augustus Heinze, were competing for who had the biggest mine shaft, one of their primary weapons was control of the press. Each man spent millions to […]","The front page of the Butte Miner on July 13, 1904, announcing the marriage of copper king William Andrews Clark and Anna LaChappelle. The announcement also noted their daughter, Audree, who later died of meningitis. The marriage rocked Butte and was scandalous because Clark was nearly 30 years older, and had alleged that they'd been married since 1901. Montana knows as well as any state in the union what it looks like when millionaires decide to control the narrative. When Marcus Daly and William Clark, and later Augustus Heinze, were competing for who had the biggest mine shaft, one of their primary weapons was control of the press. Each man spent millions to buy or start newspapers, hire top-notch writers, editors and cartoonists from back East, and then buy up competing publications. 
At first, their reasons for pouring all of this money into these papers was to badmouth the other guy, or dispute whatever propaganda was coming out against them. But once Daly died and Heinze left the state, the newspaper industry in Montana came exclusively under the control of Amalgamated Copper Company, which used its power to fight against every effort the miners made to gain a foothold in the fight for better working conditions, workable wages and more safety regulations. So rather than take care of the workers, these men spent millions fighting each other, and then fighting the truth, when it probably would have cost them a lot less money to simply give everyone a reasonable raise. 
We have seen echoes of this pattern play out ever since, as it has become part of the playbook of every autocrat who ever walked the earth. One of the first pages in the playbook is to control the narrative, and we see it playing out now, with the most recent maneuver by our current commander-in-chief who signed an executive order to eliminate funding for National Public Radio and Public Broadcasting System, two entities that President Donald J. Trump has always targeted as enemies of the state, simply because they don’t fawn over him, but actually do their due diligence and strive to tell the truth. 
Pat Harrison, the CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which includes both NPR and PBS, made a statement pointing out that “In creating CPB, Congress expressly forbade any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision or control over educational television or radio broadcasting or over CPB or any of its grantees or contractors.”
Katherine Maher, the President of NPR, stated that “America’s founders knew that an informed public is essential to a functioning democracy, and that commitment to serve an informed public is the heart of NPR’s mission.”
So what we have is a another classic example of a person in power trying to find a way around the law and intimidate the press into silence. It’s been part of Trump’s strategy from the beginning, and it has also played out in the way he has handled the press corps during White House press conferences. We all know about how he banned the Associated Press, one of the most highly regarded journalism organizations in the country, after it refused to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. 
As the newspaper industry continues to suffer the worst gutting in its history, we have seen too many of these publications fall into the hands of Trump’s fellow oligarchs, with Jeff Bezos taking over the Washington Post, and Rupert Murdoch taking over the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. Murdoch is of course the brainchild behind the one news organization that has served Trump more faithfully than anyone, Fox News. And then there is the most powerful oligarch of them all at the moment, Elon Musk, who reinstated Trump to Twitter when he first bought the company.  Not only did he dump millions of his own dollars into the Trump campaign, but that earned him a place on the public stage where he has dismantled many of the institutions and government agencies toward which he held a personal grudge, under the auspices of “waste, fraud and abuse.” In Trump’s world, anything that goes against his agenda qualifies, and that includes the arts, which have taken a beating under Musk’s DOGE. 
Meanwhile Congress, which has clearly fallen under the Trump spell, does nothing about any of this, leaving most of America in the same position as miners during the early 20th century in Montana. 
When the Speculator Mine Disaster struck in 1917, killing 169 men, the Amalgamated press machine shifted into high gear, beating away any suggestions that they were responsible for the accident, or that they were obligated to make any changes to their safety standards. This precedent, of doubling down when you’re wrong, has become standard fare in today’s America, and once again, it is the people who have been impacted most, by DOGE, and by the most egregious of Trump’s policies, who are suffering the most. And it is also those people who are most likely to support the man.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Butte-Miner-07131904.jpg,,,2025-05-06 06:05:47.476196

She was bullied, found it difficult to make friends and struggled in math while excelling in English classes. 
Then, at 11 years old, Coburn found out she had autism. 
“I didn’t really know what autism was. So it was scary, because … I thought of it as a disease. That’s all I had heard it portrayed as, and I didn’t know what to think. I thought I might die of a heart attack,” explained Louisville’s Coburn, a sophomore majoring in sociology at Centre College in Danville. 
She felt “an immense sense of relief” when a therapist explained autism to her, and life started to make sense. 
“It made me understand, once therapists started explaining it to me, that I wasn’t alone and that this was who I was, and eventually I understood it to be who I was meant to be as well,” said Coburn, who is a leader and student advocate with her campus’ Disabled Students Alliance. 
Therapists who work with Kentuckians diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder say there are deep-rooted misconceptions about autism that lead to stigma, including the debunked yet pervasive myth that vaccines cause autism. While there isn’t one known cause of autism, it’s largely hereditary, according to the UCLA School of Medicine. 
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump’s appointee, has also peddled misinformation about autism that experts say further stigmatizes people. 
Speaking of children with autism, Kennedy recently said: “These are kids who will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date.” 
His comments quickly drew criticism from experts and people whose experiences prove those statements false. 
Kennedy has also promised to find “the environmental toxins … that are causing” autism within months. 
“We know, as scientists, you don’t do research like that,” said Qusayy Godbolt, who has a doctorate in applied behavior and learning and runs his own practice, Godbolt Behavioral Consulting, in Hopkinsville. 
Putting an end date to research, said Godbolt, “sounds like some confirmation bias might be coming out a little later.” 
What is autism — and how does it manifest?

Godbolt, who is also an Army veteran, has worked with children and adults who have autism for many years. He said the name itself — autism spectrum disorder — should key people in: autism exists on a spectrum and can look very different person to person.  
“I got people who live independently. I have married couples who have autism — or one or the other has autism. It depends on the individual,” he explained, and cautioned against generalizing. “When you’ve met one person with autism, that’s exactly what you’ve met: one person with autism.” 
Some people who have autism may have learning delays, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some may also have trouble in social settings, according to the CDC. 
Dataya Hooks, a therapist with Louisville Mental Health Group, said some people may have trouble processing audio in loud environments. 
Often, children who have autism will practice “stimming,” she said — self-stimulating behaviors that may include flapping hands in excitement. The Cleveland Clinic reports stimming can help regulate emotions. 
“I’ve seen so many different cases. And while some (people) might stim this way, some might not stim at all,” Hooks said. “Or while some are verbal, some aren’t verbal. So it just looks different.” 
Godbolt said autism-related behaviors can vary greatly.
“You may have somebody with autism who’s struggling with being vocal or using the latrine appropriately or … you might have someone that their main problem is socially interacting.” 
Coburn, who also has several other diagnoses and is a wheelchair user, requires help with cleaning, cooking and other household tasks. She sometimes has difficulty with auditory processing and executive functioning as well. She cited rigid thinking as another trait of her autism, which leads her to “ruminate” on conversations she’s had. 
“It’s a really hard thing to live with. I’m not gonna sugarcoat it,” Coburn said. “And it’s something that can be very sugarcoated, especially when people with different support needs aren’t highlighted.”
The hardest part, however, is loneliness, she said. 
“Frequently in my school, at least … I have been isolated … to the point where people will full-on ignore me, even if I’m talking to them, and it’s hard,” Coburn said. “But also, I will say that I wouldn’t change the fact that I’m autistic. I know some people would. I would not. It’s made me who I am, and it’s given me a chance to advocate for other autistic people and for society to improve conditions. Because a lot of the stuff that autistic people experience could be lessened by improvements to the accessibility of society.” 
Godbolt acknowledged people with autism may need a variety of supports — noise-canceling headphones for coping with overstimulation, for example. 
But, he said, everyone uses supports in their day-to-day lives — from alarm clocks to calendars — so using aids to access the world shouldn’t be stigmatized.

Hooks said this need for resources could be a factor in why autism is often so politicized. 
“When you think of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder), the need for resources isn’t as much as someone with autism may need,” she said . “Maybe other people feel that they are disrupting society or things like that, when in reality, they’re not. I think it just depends on how you view that person and what you’re willing to understand and learn and educate yourself on.” 
Parents, too, need to learn to recognize behaviors that might indicate autism instead of misinterpreting them as simple misbehavior, Hooks said. 
“I think a lot of times it’s just seen as, ‘Oh, they’re a bad child,’ rather than: ‘They have this diagnosis that’s just not even in the open yet, and so it’s hard for them to even deal with it because they don’t have the tools to do so,’” Hooks said. 
‘It’s not a superpower.’

When Coburn found out she had autism, she had to educate herself on the spectrum and defeat misconceptions from television and movies. 
“One of the biggest misconceptions out there too, is that it’s a superpower. And it’s not a superpower. It’s not a curse either, but it’s a lifelong disability. I didn’t understand that at the time, obviously, as I was 11, but it really helped me as I began to age to know what was going on,” she said. 
“It’s a lifelong neurodevelopmental disability, and a lot of people just … see it as Sheldon Cooper,” Coburn added, referencing a scientist in “The Big Bang Theory” who some fans of the television show have theorized is autistic. “The reality is that’s not what autism looks like for a lot of people. It is what it looks like for some, but for the vast majority, that is not true.” 
Kentuckians who live with autism need more awareness and education about autism, which in turn can decrease stigma, the therapists and Coburn said. 
For Coburn, “the most important thing is, honestly, hands off our Department of Education,” she said. 
The Trump administration has signaled it wants to see the U,S, Education Department dismantled, which could upend the government’s ability to guard against discrimination through its Office of Civil Rights.
“That’s what protects autistic people — and disabled children are able to go to school because of the Department of Education, and because of laws like the ADA and the IDEA and the idea that that would be taken away would be disastrous, because there would be no protections,” Coburn said. “And if there are no protections, people might think, ‘Oh, no one would kick a disabled child out of school because of their disability,’ but … the disability community knows that’s not true. It would happen. It’s only a matter of time.”  
For Coburn, no other policy is more pressing. The department ensures that students are not discriminated against based on disability and that schools provide auxiliary aids as needed, such as interpreters and talking calculators. 
“I think that we can’t worry about anything else until we know that our Department of Education is safe,” Coburn said. “At least it’s very hard to think about other policies until we know that.”

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
  Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman
Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, a Republican, issued a consumer alert on April 9 and reminded Kentuckians of their rights under the state’s Genetic Information Privacy Act. “We have laws in place that protect Kentuckians’ rights and their personal information,” said Coleman. “Every Kentuckian who did business with 23andMe should consider taking the proper steps to safeguard their sensitive information.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.
23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(File photos)There is a good case to be made that North Carolina’s constitution provides for the election of too many statewide offices. This is especially true given that elections for the 10 “Council of State” offices take place during presidential election years when the ballot is long, and many voters know little-to-nothing about most candidates.
What purpose it serves for the state to hold partisan elections to fill mostly bureaucratic positions like those held by the commissioners of labor, insurance and agriculture – other than perhaps to provide platforms for politicians to run for other, more desirable offices, or to secure lifetime employment – is hard to articulate. Likewise, secretary of state – an office that just two individuals have occupied for 81 of the last 89 years – is another strong candidate to become an appointed office.
The argument in favor of partisan elections for five slots – governor, lt. governor, attorney general, treasurer, and superintendent of public instruction – is more obvious.
And that leaves one other office: the historically obscure position of auditor. The idea of providing the auditor – the state’s accountant – with a mandate from voters and some independent authority arguably makes some sense.
The national website Ballotpedia describes the position this way:

        “The auditor is a state-level position in 48 states that supervises and has administrative rights over the accounting and financial functions of the state. Additionally, auditors act as watchdogs over other state agencies, performing internal government audits and investigating fraud allegations.”    
 
Most states have an auditor. A little less than half fill the office with a partisan election. Several other states elect (and vest similar authority in) an office known as the controller.
All that said, if you’re like the vast majority of North Carolina voters, the choice you made last November in the auditor’s race was pretty low on your list of election priorities. Indeed, if Beth Wood — the Democratic CPA who was elected in 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020 — had not been forced to resign in 2023 in the aftermath of a post-holiday party car wreck, it seems likely that she would have prevailed in a fifth consecutive snooze of an election.
Wood’s resignation, however, provided Republicans with an opening and they seized upon it by nominating Dave Boliek, an ambitious lawyer and former Democrat with a familiar name (his father was a Triangle area TV news reporter for many years).
During the 2024 campaign, Boliek ran on a typical platform – promising to be a nonpartisan watchdog who would “leave the political party affiliation at the door.” But, as the saying goes, that was then, and this is now.
And as it turned out, for Republican lawmakers looking for ways to seize more powers from Gov. Josh Stein, Boliek’s victory in the contest turned out to be a convenient tool. Thanks to a bill rammed through during last fall’s post-election lame duck session, during which the GOP still maintained veto-proof supermajorities, Boliek was gifted with new powers that have absolutely nothing to do with the auditor’s traditional role – including bizarrely enough, appointing the state Board of Elections.
And last week, following an unsigned ruling from the overwhelmingly Republican state Court of Appeals blessing the transfer, the man who promised to be a nonpartisan watchdog did an about-face.
In addition to reappointing current Republican election board member Stacy “Four” Eggers, Boliek tabbed two of the most partisan right-wing ideologues imaginable from the state’s firmament of conservative politicos: Robert Rucho and Francis X. Deluca.
Rucho is a Matthews dentist and former state senator who, among other things, oversaw partisan gerrymandering as the chair of the Senate Elections Committee and helped shepherd the infamous 2013 “Monster Voting Law” through the Senate – a law whose voter ID provision, according to a federal court, sought to suppress the participation by Black voters with “surgical precision.”
Meanwhile, DeLuca is a one-time congressional candidate and former boss of the right-wing Pope-Civitas Institute – a group that long and passionately championed dozens of extreme (and sometimes downright strange) causes, including most relevantly, making it much harder for North Carolinians to vote.
All in all, it’s an amazing and absurd situation. A regulatory agency long and logically overseen by the state’s chief executive has been turned over to the state’s accountant for no reason other than blatant partisanship. No other state grants its auditor such power. One shudders to think of the staffing and policy changes that are in the offing. Senate GOP leader Phil Berger’s minions will no doubt be conveying a long list in short order.
Republican defenders claim that enacting such a shift is well within the legislature’s lawmaking authority, but ultimately, it makes no more sense, logically or legally, to place the auditor in charge of elections than it would to hand the duty to the agriculture commissioner – especially when voters had no inkling of the shift when they cast their ballots. Unfortunately, for Republican lawmakers bent on shamelessly seizing power at every turn, logic and the will of voters is rarely of much interest these days.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eggers-DeLuca-Rucho.jpg,,,2025-05-06 06:05:47.476196

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Redistricting school bus regions in Rhode Island could save approximately $3.5 million, according to the final report of the special legislative commission studying the statewide school bus transportation system.  
The 13-member joint commission found the student transportation network’s five regions are based on an outdated map of vocational high schools, as detailed in the report finalized April 16 but uploaded to the General Assembly website last week. The report suggests increasing the number of regions to nine serving students who attend schools outside the district where they live. 
“It is clear to us as Co-Chairs that the statewide student transportation system in Rhode Island is not efficient, and the significant cost to municipalities is not sustainable,” Rep. Terri Cortvriend and Sen. Linda Ujifusa, both Portsmouth Democrats, wrote in their introduction to the report.
The report summarizes the commission’s recommendations after eight months of meetings. Legislation in June 2024 created the commission, which began meeting in August and convened for the last time on April 7. Commissioners included six members of the General Assembly plus representatives from unions, school districts, state agencies, plus a student representative.
The commission’s main object of the study was the statewide transportation system managed by the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE). Debuting in 2009, the system coordinates transit for kids attending public, private, parochial, and charter schools, plus career and technical education (CTE) centers and special education programs. Participating school districts primarily fund the program, with RIDE collecting and dispensing payments via a restricted receipt account to pay third-party bus companies like Dattco and First Student. 
Municipalities participate in the program unless they apply for an exemption. The statewide transportation system does not bus students who attend school in the district where they live.  
“Rhode Island is one of a small number of states that provides unrestricted, fully-subsidized student transportation for children in private and parochial schools,” the report notes.
But the network’s five-region model is based on the location of CTE schools in 1977 — a much different landscape from the present day. There were only 10 state-owned Career and Technical Centers in 1977; there are over 250 CTE programs statewide today.  
On average, CTE and private school students now travel 7-mile routes to their schools, with some routes over 20 miles.
Redistricting bills central to the commission’s vision have been introduced in both chambers. Cortvriend introduced the House bill on April 11. It has not yet been scheduled for a hearing, but will go before the House Committee on Finance. The Senate, which is catching up after a week’s pause due to the April 21 death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, will hear Ujifusa’s bill, S0972, in its education committee on Wednesday. 
Cortvriend and Ujifusa represent the East Bay, which is disproportionately affected by the statewide system as it belongs to the colossally sized Region 3, which includes Providence and other urban municipalities.
“Eighty-five percent of private school transportation comes out of Region 3, placing a financial burden on public schools in this region, particularly Bristol-Warren at the southern end, resulting in some of the highest transportation costs in the state,” the report noted.
RIDE data cited in the final report suggested the cost of transporting students outside their home districts could reach $40 million in this fiscal year, which ends June 30. The state’s overall K-12 transit bill could exceed $140 million when accounting for in-district transportation provided locally, according to the RIDE numbers. 
The proposed nine smaller transportation zones could eliminate 30 buses from the statewide fleet and save $3.5 million in transit costs by reducing long-haul routes across bridges and transportation regions.
The nine regions specified in Cortvriend and Ujifusa’s bills are:  

Region 1 would stay the same and include Burrillville, North Smithfield, Cumberland and Woonsocket.
Region 2 would lose Coventry and West Greenwich to include only Warwick, West Warwick and East Greenwich.
Region 3 which previously spanned a huge swath of the state from the East Bay to Smithfield, would shrink and concentrate on the urban core and consist of Jonhston, Cranston and Providence. 
Region 4 currently encompasses all of Washington County plus Jamestown and West Greenwich. Under the new proposal, it would consist of Exeter, Jamestown, Narragansett, North Kingstown, South Kingstown, and West Greenwich. (New Shoreham, which would fall under Region 4, is not part of the statewide system according to RIDE’s website.)
Region 5 stays the same: Little Compton, Middletown, Portsmouth, Tiverton, and Newport.
Region 6 is new and would serve Barrington, Bristol, Warren and East Providence, formerly in Region 3.
Region 7 also new, would include Lincoln, Smithfield, North Providence, Central Falls and Pawtucket.
Region 8 would include Glocester, Foster, Scituate, and Coventry. 
Region 9 would include Charlestown, Hopkinton, Richmond, and Westerly.

The changes wouldn’t happen overnight: A grandfather clause would ease the transition by allowing private school students receiving transport before the end of 2025 to continue under the current model until July 1, 2029, the start of fiscal year 2030.
Alternatively, the state could create a new region for the East Bay within the existing system, then eventually move to the larger redistricting plan if local stakeholders agree.
The commission also wants to see more vans transporting students, as they’re cost-effective compared to minibuses, especially when serving routes with fewer students. A van is about $26,000 cheaper than a minibus, and school districts could save an approximate $750,000 annually if they replaced a few dozen minibuses with vans. Rhode Island’s school transit fleet now uses 150 vans.
Legislation to increase the number of students a van can carry from eight to 10 passed the House on March 25 and heads to the Senate for concurrence. The companion Senate bill by Ujifusa is slated for a Senate floor vote on Tuesday.
The report’s slate of 13 recommendations were crafted nearly unanimously. Rep. Joseph Solomon Jr., a Warwick Democrat, objected to seven of them. 
Solomon was concerned about unintended consequences of the redistricting at the commission’s final meeting. Solomon said potential savings “would essentially be passed on to the parents and families who are ultimately going to have to transport their children to schools that may be within those districts,” especially families who send their children to private schools.
“You’re suggesting, maybe if these lines were tweaked in a different way, that maybe you would be more open. Is that what I hear you saying?” Cortvriend asked Solomon.
“I’m not comfortable with any of them right now,” Solomon said with a laugh.
Solomon’s concerns echoed written testimonies submitted during the commission’s tenure from private and parochial schools and families who decried the possible loss of bus services as unfair 
“Families who choose private education still pay taxes that support public schools, yet this proposal would effectively penalize them by removing a critical service their tax dollars help fund,” Bonnie Cook, a Burrillville parent, wrote in a letter to the commission.

Emily Copeland, who served as designee on the committee for the Rhode Island School Superintendents Association, urged the commission at its final meeting not to “water down” the redistricting ideas, which she said had been well-received by public school committees across the state. 
“If you’re a taxpayer in whatever region you’re in, obviously you can go to schools in those regions, but that doesn’t mean you get transported halfway across the state,” Copeland said, arguing the recommendation is not meant to deprive private school students. 
“I don’t think we should water it down,” Cortvriend said. “I just think we might have to acknowledge there are multiple opinions.”
A footnote in the final report states asterisks are added to the seven recommendations opposed by Solomon.
Exorcising ghost riders
The study commission also investigated “ghost riders,” or students who sign up for statewide bus service but never actually use it. These students exert a phantom presence on the statewide system, the commission discovered, as routes and stops are planned with these no-shows in mind.
Mario Carreño, chief operations officer at RIDE who served as the agency’s designee, told his fellow commissioners that 550 students signed up last year and never took the bus.
“That’s the size of some small districts,” he said at the April 7 meeting.
Lilian Cordero Gagnon, a student at the Gordon School in East Providence and the commission’s student representative, offered that it’s not always clear who families need to contact.   
“I personally have had a friend who signed up for the bus, but that ended up not doing it, and I’m pretty sure she contacted the school, but the bus had been going to her stop for the first couple of months, and still opening the door, waiting a couple minutes and then leaving,” Gagnon told the commission. 
Carreño said parents need to call RIDE transit officials to remove a student from the list. He agreed that communication between RIDE, schools and families could be improved.
The full report is available on the General Assembly website, along with all other documents submitted and reviewed over the course of the commission’s meetings.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)While scrolling through my Bluesky feed recently I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as “White House.” I accepted the request and got a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group called “Kentucky Senate small group.” 
The group also included former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and 6th District U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, both declared candidates to replace the retiring Mitch McConnell of Kentucky in the U.S. Senate, along with CNN political commentator Scott Jennings and businessman Nate Morris, who are rumored to be considering that race. 
A message to the group said, “Kentucky GOP Senate candidates: Please complete and return the attached questionnaire ASAP!”
It continued, “POTUS will use your responses in deciding whom to ENDORSE in the 2026 Republican Kentucky Senate primary. His endorsement will decide the race, so don’t hold back in showing us how far you will go to get it. Self-abasement is highly encouraged! Repudiation of previously professed principles will be rewarded!”
Here’s the questionnaire:

Mitch McConnell may have helped in your political career, but he said President Trump was “practically and morally responsible for provoking” the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Are you willing to repudiate McConnell for this blasphemy?
Trump called Jan. 6, 2021, a “day of love.” What did you love most about the insurrection?
Trump pardoned persons convicted of assaulting police and seditious conspiracy. How do you praise those pardons while pretending to “back the blue” and support the Constitution?
Trump is a convicted felon and an adjudicated sexual abuser and financial fraud. Can you fake cry while contending he was a victim?
Trump says the 2020 election was “rigged,” but offers no evidence. Can you make some up?
While claiming he won the 2020 election, Trump advocated “termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.” What are some other reasons we should terminate the Constitution for Trump’s sake?
When asked recently, “Don’t you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president?” Trump replied, “I don’t know.”  Are you OK with that answer?
Trump’s first vice president, Mike Pence, refused to endorse him in 2024, saying, “Anyone who puts himself above the Constitution should not be president.” Can you make the case that Pence is a radical liberal communist?
Which did you think was funnier, Trump mocking a disabled journalist or Trump calling Elaine Chao a racist name?
Trump falsely blames Ukraine for starting the war with Russia. What are some other lies you will tell to help Putin?
Trump took classified national security documents and stored them around his resort, including in a bathroom. Are you willing to say, “I don’t give a sh*t!”?
Trump supporters Elon Musk and Steve Bannon have given fascist salutes. Will you show us yours?
At a recent cabinet meeting, MAGA hats were in place for every cabinet member. Will you wear one while campaigning like Trump does? If not, why not?
John Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general who served as Trump’s chief of staff, said Trump “thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all ‘suckers’ because ‘there is nothing in it for them.'” Trump denies it. How would you convince people Kelly is the liar?
Gen. Mark Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called Trump “a wannabe dictator.” Trump called Milley a “traitor.” Who has the better case?
The value of Trump’s meme coin jumped after he said the coin’s top holders would get a private gala dinner, an ultra-exclusive VIP reception and a special tour with him. How much meme coin can we put you down for?
Can you keep a straight face while saying, “Donald Trump is a good, decent, honest man, and I would be proud if my children grew up to be like him”?

With that, the chat initiator explained that he had meant to include Vice President J.D.Vance, but mistakenly typed “JDD” instead of “JDV.” He asked me if I would “do him a solid” and keep the mix-up “on the down low.”
“And if I don’t?” I asked. He would lie about it, have me abducted by masked goons, deny me due process, and send me to a prison in El Salvador, came the response. 
This column is satire, but for some people, including citizens and others who have done nothing wrong, that threat has proved all too real. Such Trump “mass deportation” practices are despicable, and often illegal, so Kentucky’s Republican Senate hopefuls will probably support them with pride.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)Contraception access is an issue resonating loudly within Virginia’s public and political spheres this year and last week, it manifested through state lawmakers contrasting Virginia’s twice-failed attempt to protect access to birth control medications against a similar measure that recently sailed through neighboring Tennessee’s legislature.  
For the second year in a row, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a right-to-contraception bill carried by Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who took to social media over the weekend to highlight how, unlike in the commonwealth, Tennessee lawmakers were able to come together and pass a bipartisan bill on the issue. 
“When I mentioned Tennessee was able to get something done, it wasn’t to say Virginia should become Tennessee,” Price said in a call with The Mercury Monday. “It was the fact that even Tennessee Republicans were willing to act on contraception.”
Del. Michael Webert, R-Faquier, who is among leadership in the House Republican Caucus and who voted against Price’s bill, replied directly to Price online, posting that he’d be “happy to work on a detailed version of the Tennessee bill if you’re game.”  
This was after Garren Shipley, a communications director in the GOP House Caucus, suggested that had Price’s bill mirrored Tennessee’s, she’d have found “90 or more” people willing to vote for it. 
“A lot of us had real concerns with the bill Delegate Price brought forward. It seemed much more concerned with setting up lawsuits than actually protecting contraception in law,” Webert said Monday, in a statement relayed through Shipley. 
Webert was unavailable for a phone call Monday as he was busy with work on his farm. He texted The Mercury a picture of his cattle that were being rounded up for their annual vaccines. 
“I haven’t done a head count, but I’m confident that our Republican caucus would bring at least 40 or more votes to the table for a bill like the one from Tennessee,” Webert’s statement said. 
But Price emphasized that her bill would have legally protected people’s access to contraception if their rights were to be infringed. 
“People need to know that their leaders are going to stand up to protect their rights,” she said. 
Tennessee’s bill says that the state “unambiguously acknowledges the right of a healthcare provider, instead of an individual, to perform, and the right of a person to receive or use, fertility treatment and contraceptives in this state.”
The bill goes on to clarify that the bill “does not create an entitlement” to the treatments, or to coverage or funding of them. 
Prices’ bill, on the other hand, would create an avenue for individuals to sue if their access were denied.
“The Virginia statute is broader and stronger than the Tennessee statute (when it comes to contraception),” said Meredith Harbach, a law professor at the University of Richmond. 
While the Tennessee contraception bill also includes in vitro fertilization (a topic Virginia lawmakers in both parties have carried legislation on), Harbach emphasized that both Virginia’s and Tennessee’s bills were ways to offer state-level support for reproductive health care options. 
She said the Tennessee bill is “not especially controversial” because it supports a person having a right to engage in fertility and contraception treatments, but stops short of legal cause of action. Meanwhile, Virginia’s bill establishes a state-level right for contraceptives and creates a cause of action to sue if that is infringed upon. 
For Price, her bill was also personal, as contraception helps her treat her polycystic ovarian syndrome symptoms. Beyond preventing unplanned pregnancies, contraception is used to treat conditions like Price’s as well as endometriosis. 
Harbach found it “interesting” to see Virginia Democrats employing a legal pathway that Texas Republicans had used in a state law allowing individuals a cause of action to sue people who perform abortions or assist in accessing them after six weeks of pregnancy. 
Just as the Texas law had been controversial among Democrats and reproductive rights advocates for its legal pathway, the lawsuit component in Price and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond’s bills have proven controversial among Virginia’s Republican Caucus. 
 Campaign talking points

The surge of discussion from Republicans on contraception access comes as GOP gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears remains largely silent about it and in a year where the state’s entire House of Delegates is up for election. 
Earle-Sears technically weighed in on contraception earlier this year after Democratic maneuvering forced her to vote in the Senate on that chamber’s version of Price’s bill. The Democratic Party of Virginia has pointed out Earle-Sears’ opposing vote in press releases for months. Her Democratic opponent, former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, has said she will sign the bill into law if it comes to her as future governor. 
Meanwhile, Virginia Democrats have stressed urgency on the matter as other states have pursued restrictions on contraception and congressional efforts to establish stronger safeguards have stalled. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas suggested contraception access laws should be revisited after the court ruled to overturn federal abortion protections in 2022.
Though state Republicans have largely dissented on contraception access and progressive reproductive health care measures, some GOP lawmakers have recently broken from the pack. 
Webert recalled that Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, carried a bill to allow an income tax deduction for people seeking IVF treatment to start or continue their families. The bill did not advance this legislative session.
Republican abortion bill banned from Virginia’s 2025 legislative session

Taylor also sponsored a bill to affirm protections specifically for non-viable pregnancies. With no national definition, doctors handle non-viable pregnancies on a case-by-case basis.
Defined in Taylor’s bill, a “nonviable pregnancy” is one that “cannot result in a live-born infant, including an ectopic pregnancy or failed intrauterine pregnancy.” 
That bill also did not advance. 
Taylor, who held her seat against her Democratic challenger Kimberly Pope Adams last time by 53 votes, faces her again this year. The seat is among several that are crucial to determine partisan control of the House. 
With Democrats dominating both the House and Senate, some policies have been able to advance to the governor for his acceptance or veto purely on partisan lines this year.
Price’s right-to-contraception bill advanced on a bipartisan basis before facing Youngkin’s rejection. 
Virginia may not need a bill like Price’s or Tennessee’s, if an effort to enshrine broader reproductive rights into the state’s constitution succeeds.
Having passed the legislature once already, a constitutional amendment to protect reproductive health care ranging from abortions to contraception and in vitro fertilization must pass again next year before appearing as a ballot referendum for voters around the state to consider and vote on. That measure, however has advanced only because of a Democratic majority in both chambers, setting up as a potential key motivator as voters head to the polls this year.

(Courtesy of Virginia Military Institute)The Virginia Military Institute Board of Visitors named Brigadier General Dallas Clark acting superintendent Saturday afternoon, but didn’t set a firm date for when a new superintendent will be selected. It’s the first significant decision the school has made concerning its leadership since the board drew scrutiny for opting not to extend the contract of the institution’s first Black superintendent in February. 
Clark, a graduate of VMI, has been working with the institution intermittently as the institute planning officer and deputy superintendent for finance and support at VMI, overseeing several offices, including finance and budget, auxiliary services, and facilities management.
Clark’s appointment comes after the board launched a search for a new superintendent following its vote against offering an extension past June to Ret. Major General Cedric Wins, the first Black superintendent. The institution desegregated in 1968.
VMI board ousts first Black superintendent in controversial vote

The board cast the controversial 6-10 vote without any reasoning, saying only it was “supremely grateful” for Wins’ service after being appointed superintendent in 2020, when the institution was facing public allegations of racism. The Washington Post first reported  the accusations, and a state-commissioned investigation later confirmed deep-rooted racial and gender disparities at the school.
A resolution read by the board stated that Wins assumed the duties of superintendent “amid a tumultuous time.” Still, VMI successfully navigated “a worldwide pandemic, social unrest, and a decade-long decline in admissions applications under his leadership,” the resolution stated. 
Highlights of Wins’ tenure included the school receiving the second-largest number of applications in the institution’s history and increasing state funding and major funding for capital projects.
Tensions between the superintendent and some of those connected with the institution escalated in 2022 when Wins requested funding to expand Title IX and bolster diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. His effort ignited backlash from a faction of alumni, parents and students tied to the Spirit of VMI PAC, a political action committee that urged supporters to “reject the woke assault on VMI.” 
Wins did not comment immediately after the Feb. 28 vote but later defended his leadership, opining that his tenure ended because of “bias, emotion and ideology” rather than sound judgment.
A class of 1986 graduate, Vince Allen, commended the board on Saturday for rolling back the diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. 
“The BOV has displayed great courage in facing political pressure in trying to undo the damage done to VMI,” Allen said. “I encourage continued effort to restore the honor, the ideals and traditions of VMI.”
Other speakers, including class of 1975 graduate Ronald Norman, expressed disappointment with the board’s decision against Wins, who “did nothing, but great things for this institute,” Norman said. 
“Like some, maybe you blame him for things that occurred even before he got here, if so, odds were stacked against him from day one, no matter how great his performance,” Norman said. “Did this board make fair and impartial decisions for the good of VMI, or were they personal and hidden agendas?”
Cadet Isaiah Glover said Wins inspired him to attend VMI after watching his 2021 Business Insider interview, and experiencing the “inclusive culture” through sports and the various programs. He hoped VMI would be “just as inclusive” for future cadets.  
Thomas Gottwald, interim board president, did not respond to comments about Wins, but commented on Glover’s remarks about inclusion.
“I’ll tell you, sir, that there’s not a person on this board that doesn’t share your desire to have an inclusive culture here at VMI for everyone,” Gottwald said. “The proof’s in the pudding. So, I’m telling you you can judge it by our actions.”
As of April 22, the superintendent search committee learned around 35 people have expressed interest in becoming the next superintendent.

(Photo courtesy Port of Virginia)By Katherine Hafner/WHRO 
Dominion Energy expects to pay more to complete the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project because of the Trump administration’s new taxes on imported goods including monopile foundations and turbine towers.
The $10.8 billion offshore wind farm about 30 miles off the Virginia Beach coast will be the nation’s largest, consisting of 176 turbines that generate about 2.6 gigawatts of electricity, or enough to power up to 660,000 homes.
Dominion CEO Bob Blue told investors last week that if current tariffs continue through construction of the project late next year, the utility would expect about $500 million in added costs.
“Of course, changes to future tariff policy could affect these estimates,” he said. “It’s difficult to fully assess the impact tariffs may have to the project’s final cost, as actual costs incurred are dependent upon the tariff requirements and rates, if any, at the time of delivery of the specific component.”
Dominion says new offshore wind deal won’t impact ratepayers






So far, import taxes have increased project costs by about $4 million, Blue said.
That’s on top of other rising costs Dominion announced earlier this year. The utility said in February that the initial price tag of the project, $9.8 billion, jumped by nearly 10% because of higher costs from building onshore electrical interconnection and network upgrades mandated by the regional electric grid operator.
Under a settlement approved by state regulators a few years ago, Dominion is only allowed to surcharge customers for about half of the additional costs.
As a result, the utility said the average household in Virginia can expect to pay about 43 more cents per month over the life of the wind farm.
To account for an expected $120 million in added tariff costs through the end of the next quarter, Dominion now plans to add another 4 cents to monthly energy bills.
“Let me be clear: CVOW remains one of the most affordable sources of energy for our customers,” Blue said Thursday.
He said the company does not anticipate problems with actually receiving materials needed for the wind farm including turbines from Siemens Gamesa, a Spanish-German subsidiary of Siemens Energy that is the world’s largest maker of offshore wind turbines. It’s just added costs while doing so.
Dominion is about halfway through constructing the project and plans to finish on time late next year. It’s expected to start generating electricity by early next year.
The Virginia offshore wind project is one of only a handful that are fully permitted and under construction along the East Coast, as the Trump administration ramps up efforts to halt the industry.
Dominion is also fending off a lawsuit from a coalition of conservative groups that argue federal officials failed to adequately consider the wind farm’s potential impacts on endangered whales.
The company says its permitting process was rigorous and that several measures are in place to protect whales, including trained observers who watch for marine mammals and “bubble curtains” to dampen the sound of underwater construction.
It’s unclear whether the federal government under Trump will continue to defend the Virginia Beach project in court. The government’s lawyers are expected to file their latest response to the lawsuit later this summer.

(PhotoThe N.C. Coalition to End Homelessness (NCCEH) on Monday stepped up its opposition to a House bill that would make it unlawful for local governments to allow or authorize camping or sleeping on public property.
A day before the bill was scheduled to be taken up by the House, the coalition issued a statement condemning the bill and tech-industry capitalist Joe Lonsdale who it contends is behind controversial House Bill 781 and similar bills across the country. The House is scheduled to take up the bill Tuesday at 2 p.m.
HB 781 would allow local governments by “majority vote” to designate local government-owned property located within its jurisdiction to be used for a “continuous period of up to one year for public camping or sleeping purposes.” Local governments can renew the one-year period.
Lonsdale founded the Cicero Institute, a conservative think tank, that has led efforts to pass similar legislation in Arizona, Missouri, Tennessee, Iowa, Georgia, Florida, Wisconsin and Kentucky.
“While Cicero describes itself as a think tank, its policies promote industries that potentially profit from criminalizing poverty,” said Dr. Latonya Agard, executive director of NCCEH. “States that adopted Cicero laws find they are funneling more public money into incarceration, so while these bills could lead to the financial enrichment of out-of-state investors of privatized jails and  prisons and monitoring technologies, they will worsen conditions for North Carolinians without housing.”
Cicero has been a staunch opponent of the Housing First approach to addressing homelessness. The model prioritizes providing individuals and families with permanent, affordable housing as the first step in ending their homelessness. 
“With no proof-of-concept for sanctioned encampments or apparent awareness of North Carolina’s diminishing supply of affordable housing and subsequent  increases in first-time homelessness, Lonsdale blames Housing First,” NCCEH said in its news release. 
Rep. Brian Biggs (R-Randolph) said last week that he sponsored the bill after leaders of local municipalities came to him looking for guidance in handling homelessness. Biggs insisted the bill doesn’t criminalize homelessness as some critics contend.
“It addresses the use of public property for camping and sleeping without prohibiting homelessness,” Biggs said. “It does create clear guidance. We need guidance.”
NCCEH noted that Iowa and Arizona lawmakers rejected similar bills this year. It describes such legislation as “unfunded mandates” that increases liability for local governments.
“Absent state fiscal support, the NC bill diminishes local autonomy while making cities and counties both fiscally responsible and legally liable for the implementation of state-sanctioned encampment policies,” NCCEH said.
Local governments across the state are reviewing the proposed legislation to determine their liability if it becomes law, NCCEH said.
“Just a month after the Florida law went into effect, the first lawsuit was filed — resulting in a hasty sweep of an encampment without a plan for where people would go,” the group said.
NCCEH is referring to a homeless camp in Marathon, Florida that was cleared by the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office in February after a group of local residents and business owners sued the city claiming it was in violation of new state law regulating such encampments, WLRN Public Media reported.
The lawsuit cited Florida law passed last year that bans public sleeping and camping. The law went into effect last October. Similar to the one proposed for North Carolina, the Florida law allows public sleeping and camping only after a municipal government officially designates an area for that purpose and provides restrooms, running water, security and access to mental health and drug rehab services. The law also allows residents to sue their municipalities for non-compliance, WLRN reported.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2910-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-06 06:05:47.476196

Republicans have started to come back around to the CDC’s vaccine information, with their level of trust increasing from 40% to 51%.Altogether, trust in CDC has dropped from 63% to 59%, according to the survey.“The overall level of trust in each case is similar to where it stood in September 2023, though the poll reveals significant partisan shifts as the second Trump administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have started to change vaccine policies and messaging,” the poll states.Local sources trustedHealth care providers and local public health departments are overwhelmingly looked to as trusted sources for reliable information on vaccines, according to the survey.Eighty-two percent of respondents said they either have a great deal or a fair amount of trust in doctors and health care providers to give them reliable information about vaccines.Eighty-one percent said they trust their child’s pediatrician, 66% responded they have confidence in their local public health department, 59% believe in the CDC, 57% trust the FDA and 51% have confidence in pharmaceutical companies to provide factual information about vaccines.Those polled held less trust in politicians, with 41% believing Kennedy’s comments about vaccines and 37% trusting President Donald Trump “to provide reliable information about vaccines,” according to the poll.A majority of those surveyed, however, are somewhat or very confident in the safety of several vaccines, including 83% for measles, mumps and rubella, or the MMR vaccine; 82% for pneumonia; 79% for shingles; 74% for the flu; and 56% for COVID-19.The poll included 1,380 U.S. adults contacted online or via telephone from April 8-15, for a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.",,,,2025-05-06 06:05:47.476196

(Photo by Catherine J. Hibbard/USFWS)The upheaval of federal support for climate change work could not have come at a worse time.  Communities across Massachusetts and the U.S. are generally under-prepared to handle the current impacts of climate change, let alone the far greater challenges projected for the years ahead.
Here in New England, where rates of heavy rainfall have increased by approximately 60 percent since the mid-20th century, frequent flooding threatens neighborhoods and cities. Stormwater systems are unable to deal with the increased frequency and intensity of deluge rainstorms. Other socioecological systems essential to community well-being, including food, housing, energy, waste management, and drinking water, are also vulnerable. In areas experiencing more frequent extreme storms or wildfires, insurance is becoming both harder to obtain and significantly more expensive. This unavailability or unaffordability of insurance threatens the stability of real estate markets. Even before a catastrophic storm hits, communities are already experiencing the impacts of climate change through increased property risk and the potential instability of tax revenues.
The future of Massachusetts and New England depends on reconsidering regulation that stifles innovative nature-based design and projects and scaling up effective adaptation to accelerating climate change. Effective adaptation will require system agility — the forward-leaning ability to adapt continuously to changing conditions.
Massachusetts and neighboring states have been taking positive steps. Over the past decade, best-practice resilience planning incorporated powerful analytical tools to understand both climate change threats and the full scope of vulnerabilities, particularly those worsened by social inequities like poverty and racial disparities.
By integrating climate impacts such as sea-level rise and extreme rainfall with social vulnerability assessments and nature-based risk reduction strategies, communities can secure a thriving future grounded in greater equity and health for both people and the environment.
In coastal Massachusetts communities such as Wellfleet, Nantucket, and Plum Island accelerating shoreline loss is taking homes and threatening vital infrastructure and high value natural habitat. Massachusetts is giving our 78 coastal communities extra funding to develop risk-based coastal resilience plans. Using advanced modeling tools developed from the explosive growth of information technologies, these plans assess risks to valuable habitats, critical infrastructure, and community recreational assets. Informed by data sensing and analytical tools, the strategic placement of near-shore, habitat-friendly structures can slow erosion rates and create opportunities to avoid using hard structures that deflect energy and cause erosion elsewhere. The design process requires getting extensive site-specific data and most recently developed with the aid of artificial intelligence.










By integrating climate impacts such as sea-level rise and extreme rainfall with social vulnerability assessments and nature-based risk reduction strategies, communities can secure a thriving future grounded in greater equity and health for both people and the environment.


But, implementing these projects requires working within the existing outmoded environmental management system that was not built to address the accelerating impacts of climate change. Procedural overload — multiple reviews, siloed rules, and an overly risk-averse perspective — undermine timely progress. For example, innovative nature-based measures like floating wetlands or naturalized reef structures that can reduce the wave energy on a shoreline face regulatory burden that is often higher than what is required for sea walls and other more traditional but more destructive alternatives. It took years for regulators to embrace green infrastructure as the better way to address stormwater pollution. Communities don’t have years for coastal regulators to embrace nature-based strategies to address coastal erosion that threatens vital infrastructure and habitat.
In the face of accelerating climate change, the scale and scope of resilience work is growing far beyond what policy makers in the late 20th century thought possible. The general risk of not acting at the needed scale far surpasses the downside risk of any single action negatively impacting an ecosystem.  Eventually a fundamental rethinking of the environmental management system is crucial for building the resilience necessary to thrive in the coming years.
Unfortunately, redesigning the national environmental management system is unrealistic in this political environment. But there is way forward. Community-based public-private partnerships are a tested approach to scale the level of projects needed to meet an environmental challenge.
The ingredients for this partnership model start with a long-term source of revenue.  The second ingredient is a planning framework that defines the scope of what must be done. The next ingredient is a local or regional government that creates a partnership with private firm and an engagement program that effectively recruits the input of stakeholders.  With the promise of a large number of green infrastructure projects, the firm procures the needed design and build services at a scale necessary to meet the performance goals defined in the planning and permit framework. Most importantly the firm takes on the legal responsibility for achieving the goals of the program.
Like the challenge to build green infrastructure at scale to address stormwater pollution and flooding, using the extensive resilience planning work to create nature-based infrastructure to address community resilience challenges is a problem of scale and implementation speed. Community-based public-private partnerships offer a solution that has been endorsed by the EPA and is available to states and local governments.  However, these partnerships will only work if regulators rethink how they regulate nature-based work.
Climate change is progressing rapidly and unpredictably. An environmental management system that does not acknowledge this urgency does not effectively serve governments or their citizens. By adopting a systemic approach to resilience planning and aligning our environmental management programs with the urgency of the climate crisis, we can better prepare for and mitigate its impacts.

States are moving to strengthen protections against human trafficking, but some advocates warn that federal funding cuts could undermine efforts to support survivors.
This year, lawmakers in several states have introduced bills to expand education, strengthen penalties and fund survivor support. But some victim service providers say these efforts might fall short, with millions of dollars in federal cuts threatening programs that help trafficking victims heal and rebuild their lives.
Human trafficking is the exploitation of people through force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of sex or labor. It often involves victims who lack control over their circumstances — whether due to threats, manipulation or economic dependency — and can occur in both illicit and legal industries, from commercial sex work to agriculture, domestic work and construction.
A poll released in March by the University of California, Irvine and the anti-trafficking nonprofit EverFree found that while nearly 99% of Americans view trafficking as a global and national issue, only about 80% believe it’s a problem in their own state — a gap that hinders local prevention efforts, experts say.
The poll, which was conducted in October, also found that just 19% of respondents ranked human trafficking as a top national concern.

“Because it’s such a dark, challenging issue, there’s a dissonance that happens where you don’t want to believe that [trafficking] happens in your community,” Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree, said in an interview. “To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.”
Lawmakers across the country are considering or have already passed a range of bills this year aimed at curbing human trafficking and supporting survivors. Many approaches focus on prevention, education, tougher penalties and expanding support services.
In Michigan, a pair of new laws will allow certain hearsay statements from trafficking survivors to be admitted in court and permit relevant prior acts to be used as evidence in human trafficking cases. In March, Utah enacted a law that increases criminal penalties for sex and labor trafficking offenses. In Tennessee, a new law set to take effect next year requires tattoo artists to complete up to one hour of training on recognizing and reporting signs of trafficking.
In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish a “Survivor Support Fund” and criminalize loitering with the intent to purchase sex. The Oregon House passed legislation in April targeting illicit massage businesses by expanding enforcement authority and increasing criminal penalties and fines.
Other states are taking steps to raise awareness and improve accountability. The Florida and Montana legislatures passed bills mandating trafficking prevention education and training in schools. Both bills await action by governors.

A bill in Indiana would require gas stations, rest areas and welcome centers to display trafficking awareness posters, and mandate training for employees at food and lodging establishments. It passed in April and was sent to the governor.
Lawmakers in Florida and Georgia also have passed legislation that aims to strengthen criminal trafficking penalties, particularly in trafficking cases involving children or people with disabilities.
Minnesota is weighing several new proposals, including one to increase oversight of adult entertainment venues and massage parlors. The governor signed into law another measure that will require biennial legislative reports on the state’s child trafficking prevention efforts.
Funding to help victims recover
Some advocates say the legislation nationwide reflects growing awareness of trafficking’s scope — but caution that without consistent funding for victim services and a deeper public understanding of the issue, laws alone won’t be enough to support survivors or prevent trafficking.
Illicit massage parlor language added to weakened Indiana anti-human trafficking proposal

In late April, the U.S. Department of Justice canceled 365 federal public safety grants — including some that supported anti-human trafficking programs — disrupting a wide range of services for crime victims, local police departments and correctional facilities.
Since then, the department has restored at least two of the canceled grants — one supporting a national crime victim hotline and another funding a national domestic violence network.
The cuts, which totaled $811 million, were administered through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, which awarded roughly $3 billion in competitive grants during the 2024 fiscal year, according to Reuters.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way.
Underreported to police
Human trafficking data in the United States is limited, but available figures suggest the problem is both widespread and underreported.
FBI data shows that in 2023, there were 2,584 reported trafficking incidents and 3,117 identified victims — a sharp increase from just 22 incidents in 2013, when the agency began tracking trafficking through its Uniform Crime Reporting system. The rise is largely attributed to more law enforcement agencies participating in the data collection system.
Separate data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which offers support to victims, identified 9,619 trafficking cases in 2023 — up from 5,551 in 2015. In 2023, the hotline received more than 30,000 tips, or “signals.”
Experts and advocates emphasize that both the hotline and the crime data capture only a fraction of trafficking incidents, given the hidden nature of the crime and the barriers victims face in reporting to police.
Although national data struggles to capture the full scope of trafficking, Minnesota is among the states that have taken extra steps to build their own data collection systems to better understand the issue and support victims.

Its efforts have drawn attention for state officials’ focus on both urban and rural communities, as well as on Native populations that often face barriers to accessing services.
Experts say it’s a common misconception that trafficking is primarily an urban issue — in reality, it can and does happen everywhere.
Still, some victims — including boys and men — may be overlooked.
“Sometimes for male youth, they are not identified as victims. They may show up in the criminal justice system as defendants or they may be adjudicated as juvenile delinquents,” said Caroline Palmer, the human trafficking prevention director at the Minnesota Department of Health. “There’s not really a close look at what might be happening in the background in terms of their victimization and trafficking exploitation.”
Palmer noted that while Minnesota offers programming for all genders, some male-identifying people may not feel comfortable with certain services, highlighting the need for more tailored support to meet everyone’s unique needs.
More than three-quarters of respondents to the UC Irvine-EverFree poll said being a woman greatly increases the risk of trafficking, but only 2% of respondents said the same about men — despite the fact that trafficking affects people of all genders.
Public perceptions about survivors were also influenced by the victim’s age: While 83% of respondents believe minors who are trafficked are always victims, only 61% say the same about adults — a gap that, advocates warn, can contribute to the criminalization of adult survivors.

While it’s no surprise that President Donald Trump is undoing years of hard won national progress in combating discrimination, the decision by many corporations to cowardly follow suit is shameful.
Take North Carolina-based Duke Energy.
As researchers at the Energy and Policy Institute recently reported, Duke once held itself out as a leader in fighting injustice. Its former CEO led her presentation at a 2020 earnings call by stating quote “issues surrounding racial equity and social justice are front and center, as they should be.”
“Now, more than ever” she continued, “we are relying on these values to cultivate a workplace rooted in diversity and inclusion.”
What a difference a few years make.
Today, the report notes, Duke has been busy scrubbing numerous references to diversity and inclusion from important corporate documents.
The bottom line: While some corporations are proudly reenforcing their commitment to fight discrimination, Duke bosses have sadly but predictably folded like a cheap suit. One suspects it’s a sign of their true colors.

(Erika Bolstad/Stateline)BOISE, Idaho — The day the flag bill came up for a vote in the Idaho Senate this spring, state Sen. Melissa Wintrow had no plans to speak against it. As the top Democratic leader in her chamber, she had already spent the legislative session in constant, vocal opposition to the Republican-dominated legislative agenda.
“I thought: ‘Oh, this stupid flag bill once again,’” Wintrow said. “I’ll just vote ‘no’ quietly because I’ve just really been in people’s grille about things.”
But then the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Ben Toews, began passing out flyers about the legislation, one of two proposed bills to limit which flags can be flown at schools and on state and local government property. The only photos on the handout were of rainbow-striped Pride flags flying in Boise: one on a flagpole in front of City Hall, and then others on light poles along Harrison Boulevard, two blocks from Wintrow’s home.
“When he sat that picture in front of me on that desk, I thought: ‘That’s enough. Just always picking and bullying,’” Wintrow said. “The state’s going to tell us what to do, when they can’t even address the larger problems like affordable housing? That’s what’s on people’s minds. A good working wage, health care. It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.”
In recent weeks, both Idaho and Utah have enacted bans that prohibit Pride flags from being displayed on government property, pitting lawmakers in the Republican-dominated legislatures against the more progressive capitals of Boise and Salt Lake City, where the flags are often flown at city hall.













It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.


– Idaho Democratic state Sen. Melissa Wintrow





In Utah, the law allows the state flag, the U.S. flag, U.S. military flags, the POW/MIA flag, local government flags, tribal nation flags, university and school flags and Olympic flags. Idaho’s list is similar, but includes a provision in the school flag law that prohibits flags with political viewpoints, “including but not limited to flags or banners regarding a political party, race, sexual orientation, gender, or a political ideology.”
Lawmakers in Florida, Texas and at least 13 other states are considering similar flag prohibitions, said Logan Casey, director of policy research with the Movement Advancement Project, which studies LGBTQ+ rights. The flag bills go beyond symbolism, Casey said. Rather, they are part of a broad and coordinated legislative attack on LGBTQ+ people that seeks to strip them of rights and erase or make difficult their participation in public life.
“Sometimes those attacks are very material, like denying access to health care or the ability to participate safely in public life and activities,” Casey said. “Sometimes they’re a little more symbolic, like these flag bills.”
 ‘Get rid of everything’

The rainbow-colored Pride flag was conjured up by artist and drag queen Gilbert Baker in 1978, at the suggestion of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, as a symbol of progress and pride for that year’s San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade. Since then, the rainbow-colored flag and its many design iterations have grown into worldwide emblems of solidarity with LGBTQ+ rights.
Although the laws in Idaho and Utah don’t ban Pride flags specifically, bill sponsors and their supporters made it clear they want to see such flags removed from city halls, schools and state buildings. Idaho state Rep. Ted Hill, a Republican who sponsored the bill limiting which flags can fly at schools, said in an interview that Pride flags are disruptive to classroom learning because discussion about them takes up “an amazing amount of political bandwidth.”
“The best way to do it is to get rid of everything,” said Hill, who represents Eagle, a suburb northwest of Boise. “So the only thing you have in the classroom is the American flag, the state flag. And people will say inclusivity and all this. Well, the American flag is as inclusive as it can get.”
Despite the new law, Boise Mayor Lauren McLean, a Democrat, continues to fly a Pride flag in front of City Hall, just below the city’s own and adjacent to poles flying the U.S. and state of Idaho flags. The Pride flag’s presence, within view of the state Capitol, elicited a sternly worded letter from Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican.
Idaho’s law, which went into effect April 3, has no penalty for local governments or officials who fly flags in defiance of the ban, an oversight lawmakers told Labrador they’ll rectify in subsequent legislative sessions. Instead, the law relies on “the good will of elected officials for its enforcement,” Labrador wrote, warning McLean that she should “comply with the law out of a sense of duty to your oath of office.”
He threatened, too, that lawmakers could “deny state tax revenues and other appropriations to the City of Boise or any other governmental entity that does not follow state law.”
McLean countered that the new law is unconstitutional, and that the city will challenge threats to withhold funding. Pride flags have flown in Boise for a decade, she told Labrador, and represent a commitment to “a safe and welcoming city where everyone means just that — everyone.”
“The Constitutional rights of our residents are not subject to — cannot be subject to — the political whims of legislative disapproval,” McLean wrote, “and we will not step back from them simply because the principles our community cherishes make some in state government uncomfortable.”
Boise’s city council is considering a resolution confirming that any flags it flies, including Pride flags, are official city flags — a move the council says will ensure it is complying with state law. In the meantime, the city will “continue to fly the flags on City Hall Plaza that represent our community and speak to our values of caring for people and welcoming all,” McLean said in a statement.
Early on Easter morning, several people climbed a ladder propped up next to the city’s flagpole to cover the Pride flag and a separate flag (honoring organ and tissue donation) with trash bags. They also raised the Appeal to Heaven flag, a Revolutionary War-era flag that has come to represent sympathy to the Christian nationalist movement and to President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. A few hours later, the mayor lowered the flags, which are on a locked halyard, to remove the trash bags and the Appeal to Heaven flag.
It capped a challenging sequence of events in Boise and nearby Meridian, which drew national attention this spring when school officials ordered a middle school teacher to take down a sign with the phrase “Everyone is welcome here” from her classroom. Amid the backlash, people in Boise printed T-shirts and yard signs in support of the teacher and the sign’s message.

The mayor’s response to the flag law and the support for the classroom message aren’t directly connected, but both reflect how many in the community insist on sending a welcoming message at this moment in American history, said Christina Bruce-Bennion, executive director of Boise’s Wassmuth Center for Human Rights, which helped coordinate support for the teacher.
 ‘It is very targeted’

In Salt Lake City, the flag ban threatens to end a long-standing annual tradition. Typically, the mayor’s office kicks off Pride Month festivities in June with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall, said Chad Call, executive director of the Utah Pride Center, which puts on the state’s annual Pride festivities. Events include a parade through the streets of Salt Lake City with a 200-foot Pride flag — which remains a legal form of First Amendment expression and has taken place most years since 1997.
“We have a city council that wants to celebrate Pride month,” Call said. “They want to celebrate the queer community in the month of June. And then we have a state government that does not want that happening in our capital city. And so it is very targeted.”
One of the flag bill’s sponsors, state Rep. Trevor Lee, said in an interview that his legislation was prompted by constituents who told him they’re “sick and tired of seeing a political agenda being pushed in their face” on government property, particularly with flags featuring transgender representation.
“It makes people feel uncomfortable if it’s something they don’t agree with,” said Lee, who represents a district north of Salt Lake City. “And so we’re trying to keep it very specific and let schools focus on teaching the things that they need to, and let government buildings just fly their city flag for heaven’s sakes, or the state flag or the American flag.”
One Utah parent, Republican activist Aaron Bullen, said he began objecting to Pride flags several years ago after one of his children, then a fifth grader, was “visibly upset” after school one day. Bullen said his son told him he’d seen what’s known as a Progress Pride flag, a newer iteration of the original rainbow-striped flag. It includes an arrow on the left side composed of pink, blue and white stripes to represent transgender people, as well as brown and black stripes to represent queer people of color. The flag was in the school’s computer lab.
Bullen said he complained to school leaders at the district, south of Salt Lake City, and the flag came down. But Bullen felt as though the flag’s presence undermined what he and his wife teach at home and model to their children as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, particularly how they interpret the church’s stance on transgender people and marriage for same-sex couples.
“It says, basically, ‘we approve of gay marriage’ when that flag is up,” Bullen said. “And that’s something that my religion is explicitly against. And so you have a teacher of my son, a person in authority that they’d like to be able to trust and to follow the instructions of, but they’re saying, ‘your parents who taught you this other thing, they’re wrong. Your religion is wrong.’ That’s what that flag means.”













It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would.


– Aaron Bullen, a Utah parent and Republican activist





He added: “It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would. Parents have the fundamental right and responsibility to rear their children. And it’s not a school’s place to oppose the religion of the parents or the teachings of the parents.”
Unlike in Idaho, Utah’s flag ban carries a $500 fine per day for failure to comply with the law. But in Utah, the law took effect without Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’s signature. The governor declined to sign the bill into law, saying the state’s residents are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix.”
Call, of the Utah Pride Center, said that while it’s discouraging for LGBTQ+ people to witness their representation further erased in public spaces, they refuse in Utah to allow the flag law to diminish the spirit of their Pride events, among the largest in the nation.
“Our counterculture here is really, really strong,” Call said. “And I think the thing that probably defines our Utah Pride as being kind of unique is the incredibly strong community that it brings together. There’s tens, hundreds of thousands of people that come out to support it.”

Now the state Senate gets its turn to tweak the two-year spending plan.
OEC executive director Phil Richter went before a Senate committee last week to make the case for his agency.
The Ohio Elections Commission is a seven-member body that operates as an independent agency with oversight of campaign finance laws. The governor appoints three Democrats and three Republicans who in turn select the unaffiliated seventh member of the commission.
Richter warned state senators that turning campaign finance laws over to an official appointed by the secretary of state or the county board of elections will create chaos.
“Instead of one statewide decision-making body, there will be 89 separate applications of Ohio’s campaign finance laws,” he said. “Instead of one bipartisan, collegial panel, there could be 89 separate decisions made along party lines.”
Richter added the new responsibilities could create an “unfunded mandate” for the offices that would begin handling campaign finance cases. He also noted the Ohio House version of the budget zeroes out funding for the commission starting in July, but doesn’t actually abolish the agency until Jan. 1 next year.
“It is unconscionable to me,” Richter said, “that the current budget would expect the commission and its staff to work for six months without any funding.”
Ohio House budget would eliminate independent campaign finance oversight

 
Critics argue the commission process is too slow and too burdensome for many of the people that come before it. They contend the process itself — driving multiple times to Columbus to sit for hearings — is more punitive than the OEC’s eventual fines.
State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, who’s leading the House budget process has been on the receiving end of a long-running campaign finance complaint.
“I’ve had a four-year front row seat to how inept this process is,” he said in an interview last month.
Far from seeing that as a conflict of interest, he argued “those who have spent years being drug through the mud” are the best ones to reform an agency.
Lawmakers’ questions
State Sen. Paula Hicks-Hudson, D-Toledo, asked if the House’s plan would lead to a “patchwork of decisions.”
“That’s a very real possibility,” Richter said, adding that it would be “challenge” to have the same office running elections and judging campaign finance violations and still deal in an “independent, nonpartisan, unbiased way.”
The committee chairman, state Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster, wondered what was so bad about the House’s plan. He described serving on a board that got advice from the county prosecutor.
“What’s the problem with that model, as long as they have an assistant prosecutor who has knowledge of election laws?” he asked.

Without an independent voice to break a potential tie between the two Democrats and two Republicans on a board, he said, decisions could easily break along partisan lines.
State Sen. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, complained about candidates putting up untruthful signs. As a hypothetical, he described hearing complaints about a candidate using a sign describing themselves as a commissioner when they haven’t yet won office.
“The commission is not going to look at it for 45 to 60 days — that person is either going to be elected or lose their election by the time it happens,” Koehler said. “It’s almost as if, again, I’ve said these words: There’s really nothing you can do.”
Richter acknowledged his frustration but explained there’s little the commission can do following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that invalidated Ohio’s law against false campaign statements.
Koehler pressed Richter to ensure the commission holds people accountable. He argued too many candidates get fines that amount to a slap on the wrist for significant violations.
“I don’t know what the Senate is going to do,” Koehler said about the possibility of restoring funding for the Ohio Elections Commission. “If that happens, I’m just going to say that I hope the election commission uses more teeth.”

(Source: Bright Line Watch, April 2025) As President Donald Trump completes his first 100 days back in the White House — which were marked by a firehouse of controversial deportations, political retribution, and dramatic cuts to the federal government — political scientists and the general public alike are more concerned about democracy in the U.S. than they have been in at least seven years.
That’s the latest finding from Bright Line Watch, an initiative created by John Carey and Brendan Nyhan, both Dartmouth College professors, in partnership with professors Sue Stokes from the University of Chicago and Gretchen Helmke from the University of Rochester. The group has been tracking how political scientists and a representative sample of Americans view democracy in the U.S. since 2017 and 2018, respectively. Their latest report, released Monday, found confidence at new lows. Carey called the results “troubling.”
“I’m more alarmed now than I have been at any point in the past,” Carey said. “And we did this work all through the first Trump term, through the Biden term as well. But the first couple months of the second Trump administration have been unlike anything we’ve seen before.”
In April, the researchers’ expert sample — from which they typically receive around 500 to 800 responses from political science and government professors from across the U.S. — rated the state of U.S. democracy lower than they ever had before: an average of 53 on a scale of 1-100. For reference, their rating never dipped below 61 before Trump took office in January. However, from November — before Trump was inaugurated but after he was elected — to February the average expert rating plummeted from 67 to 55.
The general public gave U.S. democracy an average rating of 49 out of 100 on the same scale in April. That’s down from February, when the people gave it an average rating of 53. This is the first time it’s ever dipped below 50.
Confidence dropped among both Democrats and Republicans. For Democrats, the rating fell from 49 in February to 45 in April, while the Republicans’ rating fell from 59 to 56 during the same period. That marked the sharpest Republican rating decrease since November 2020 to January 2021, a time in which the U.S. Capitol was attacked, Trump exited the White House, and Congress impeached Trump for a second time.
The survey also asked experts their views on Trump failing to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia after it erroneously deported the Maryland man to a Salvadoran prison, his executive order targeting the Democratic fundraising apparatus ActBlue, and his revoking of funds for some universities. In all three cases, more than three-quarters of the experts called the actions serious or extraordinary threats to democracy. Carey himself is also concerned about these developments.
“The rate at which democratic transgressions are being done is so fast that it’s kind of hard to believe,” Carey said. “If you went back a month, obviously we wouldn’t have been talking about those things, but we would have been talking about the arrest, for example, of student demonstrators. And if you went back two months, we’d be talking about refusal to spend funds that had been appropriated by Congress. I mean, these are all things that are, if not unprecedented, they have very few precedents in American history. The list of transgressions is long, and things are happening so quickly that it’s easy to be focused just on what’s in front of us this week.”
They also asked experts to predict how democracy in the U.S. will look in the future. Carey’s takeaway: “People are watching what is happening, and they don’t think it’s going to end well.”
“I take the projected ratings with obviously more of a grain of salt, because they’re based on speculation,” he said. “But, we’ve been asking for those projections for the last three or four years now anyway, and the steepness of the decline is greater than what we’ve seen previously.”
Carey acknowledged that their expert sample likely leans heavily liberal because university professors are more often liberal than conservative. He also noted that over the course of their study, Democrats tended to rate democracy better when a Democrat was president while Republicans tended to rate democracy better when a Republican was president.
“Part of what’s going on, I think, in our most recent survey, is that most of these experts are Democrats, and they don’t like what the Trump administration is doing,” he said. “But that’s not all of it.”
Carey believes there’s more to it. He pointed out that throughout their research, both while Trump was president and Biden was president, the expert ratings were roughly 10 points higher than the general public’s.
“The reason, I think, for that is the experts tend to have a broader perspective,” he said. “They know what’s going on at home, but they also tend to know much more than our public sample about what a democracy operates overseas. And you know, when you have that information, you tend to rate American democracy higher.”
After Trump was elected, expert ratings were still almost 10 points higher than the public’s, but after his inauguration, they were only two points higher (55 to 53).
“It wasn’t just like Trump won the election, so they think democracy stinks,” he said. “It only kicked in once he became president and started to implement his policies.”
Like the researchers he surveyed, Carey is concerned.
“I consider Trump an authoritarian,” he said. “I wouldn’t go so far as to say that our political system is an authoritarian political system yet, because I don’t think Trump has centralized his authority to that degree. He hasn’t demonstrated to me yet that he is unconstrained, but he’s gone a lot further down that path than I would have predicted three months ago. … And I’ve got my fingers crossed for how things are going to go in the coming months, but I’m not confident anymore.”
The four release a report every few months and have been doing so since February 2017. Carey said it was his work not as a researcher of U.S. politics but of Latin American politics that inspired him to do this work. He said the four (Stokes and Helmke also studied Latin American politics) were corresponding during the 2016 election and noting similarities between the 2016 campaign and political moments in some Latin American democracies that have fallen to corruption.
“There was a general consensus up until that election that democracy in some countries — and the U.S. would be included in that — was sort of indestructible,” he said. “And those perspectives started to change pretty dramatically that year.”
Carey said the project’s name, Bright Line Watch, is a reference to the group’s initial motivation for this work.
“Our question was, is there a line that, if it’s crossed, will prompt pushback on a massive scale from both sides of the political aisle,” Carey said. “Because we were watching all of these transgressions, and generally speaking, the other party would scream, but the co-partisans of whoever was committing the act were like, ‘No, this looks OK to us.’ And there’s a general and kind of theory among political scientists that goes way back that democracy is only stable if there are some bright lines that, when they’re transgressed, even co-partisans are going to resist. And so our question was, ‘Can we find such a bright line in this current context?’ And I gotta say, in the years since we started the project, my confidence that there are such bright lines has diminished considerably.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/democracyratings-1024x609.jpg,,,2025-05-06 06:05:47.476196

Ned Lamont and the Democratic majority.","Emails from the Senate Republican minority arrive daily in the mailboxes of the reporters covering the state Capitol, a new strategy for a caucus at its lowest ebb in nearly 40 years. On matters great and small, partisan and not, Connecticut’s tiniest legislative caucus is intent on being heard.
Statements are offered decrying the release of a “killer cannibal” from prison, a motorist cited for traveling asleep in a self-driving car on I-91, and the attack on the Pennsylvania governor’s residence. There is applause for deportations by the Trump administration and grief for the passing of a pope who criticized them.
“Visibility is a positive thing. I’ve always believed that, and when we have smaller numbers, you need to work harder to be more visible,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “And that includes speaking up on stories that aren’t necessarily political.”
Most, but not all, of the GOP messaging comes in the name and voice of Harding, who unexpectedly emerged as the Republican leader after the caucus chased his predecessor, Kevin C. Kelly, from the job in February 2024. Harding had just begun his second year in the Senate after eight years in the House.
Harding is 37, a practicing lawyer, married and the father of two young children. He was born in New York to an Irish Catholic extended family of mixed political preferences. While a toddler, his parents relocated to the Fairfield County community of Brookfield, then a community of 14,000.
There is a bit of a throw-it-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks feel to the new communications strategy.
“There’s kind of a thought process of you speak on everything, and then once in a while you may find some issues that resonate with folks, and you never know what issue hits with people or may change a vote or open a mind. And I think that that’s part of the rationale,” Harding said.
A less popular topic for Harding is President Donald J. Trump, whose rise in national politics has coincided with hard times for blue-state Republicans — even more so in Connecticut. Harding’s caucus issued no assessment of the president’s first 100 days.
Republicans, who had come close to parity in the General Assembly when Trump took office in 2017, lost more state legislative seats in Connecticut than any other state during Trump’s first term. They now hold 11 of 36 seats in the Senate and 49 of 151 in the House.
“I’ve given my assessment when asked about those things,” Harding said of Trump. “And my communication style, and our Senate Republican communication style, continues to remain consistent: We’re focusing on the things that we actually can control here in the state.”
For Harding, that means honing a sharper edge on criticism of Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democratic governor with a high approval rating, and the Senate Democratic majority. In mid-April, Harding led Republicans in a boycott of a confirmation vote that he says was produced by a deal that bordered on bribery.

Lamont had agreed in February to give Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, a seat on the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority. Fonfara then dropped his opposition to the confirmation of Lamont’s choice for a second term as chair of PURA, Marissa Gillett. Fonfara had the votes to keep her nomination bottled up in committee.
Harding called the deal a “blatant quid pro quo.” Last week, he gave new life to the issue with an amendment that would have barred Lamont from nominating Fonfara  for the remainder of the governor’s term. It had no chance of passage, but the ploy signaled an intention to aggressively hit the majority when possible.
The same week, he excoriated Lamont for tolerating the Board of Regents for Higher Education nudging aside the embattled Connecticut State Colleges and Universities chancellor, Terrence Cheng, while allowing him to continue collecting his full salary for duties to be determined until his contract expires on July 1, 2026.
“Last I checked, when you get a salary of $442,000, you should darn well know what your job is going to be for that amount of money. It is breathtaking. What waste of the taxpayers’ money,” Harding said. “He should have been fired.”

CT Insider had reported that the chancellor had charged tens of thousands of dollars to his state credit card on travel and meals, including chauffeured rides to and from his home in New York, despite his contract providing stipends for a car and apartment in Hartford.
“We need to set a tone with our state employees that the taxpayers’ money should be held sacred,” Harding said.
Days later, he tweaked the Democratic majority by offering an amendment during a floor debate that would have required any higher-education salary exceeding $400,000 to come for approval by the General Assembly. It was an attempt to make them part of the Cheng story, and they pushed back.
“I share the good senator’s frustration, dismay, disgust with the judgment and sloppy bookkeeping that we have seen at the very top of the leadership of the CSCU system that Sen. Harding mentioned,” said Sen. Derek Slap, D-West Hartford.
But Slap, the co-chair of the Higher Education and Employment Committee, accused Harding of grandstanding, noting that his committee already had crafted legislation imposing greater oversight.
“That’s the right way to do it. It’s been through a public hearing. It has been vetted, and it’s good government,” Slap said, while Harding’s “amendment is ripped from the headlines. This amendment has not gone through a public hearing, and it contemplates significant structural changes to how we function as state government.”
Harding’s amendment was rejected on a party-line vote.
One advantage of being in the minority is the ability to avoid hard votes.
Harding did not join House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, in proposing a GOP alternative to the budget crafted by the Lamont administration and revised by the legislature’s money committees.
The House Republican budget called for a pay freeze, which would have complicated the Senate GOP’s desire to vote for the state police raise that came before the Appropriations Committee on Monday. Most House Republicans on the committee voted against it.
“We appreciate the House Republicans offering a budget,” said Harding, an Appropriations Committee member. “I think it’s a far better alternative than what the governor proposed and far better than what the the Democrats ultimately passed out of Finance and Appropriations.” 
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said he was not surprised by Harding and the Senate GOP ramping up their communications.
“We all find different ways in which to communicate with people and see if it see if it resonates,” Duff said. “They communicate, we communicate. And it’s always a battle the ideas, to try and talk about what we stand for. So I think it’s kind of simple.”
But Duff said Harding will find it more difficult to remain circumspect on Trump.
“They have to communicate whether they’re with him, or they’re separating from him. And that is up to them to communicate,” Duff said. “That is, I think, their mission at this point. Because, while their base may be pro-Trump, the rest of the state is clearly not pro-Trump, and they have to figure that part out.”
Act Local NWCT, an anti-Trump group that claims more than 700 members in Harding’s district, accuses him of using state issues as an excuse not to speak out on the president. They are holding an “empty chair” town hall 7 p.m. Thursday in New Milford that Harding is declining to attend.
“We have a lot of questions regarding how we’re going to combat D.C.’s cuts, tariffs, and policies here in CT,” the group’s founder, Jackie Eaton said in a statement.
Harding said many of the Act Local members quizzed him during a town hall meeting last week in Torrington, and he is declining to attend Thursday because the Senate session that day is likely to conflict.
Any suggestion he is ducking the group, Harding said, “is unbelievably misleading.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7394-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-06 06:05:47.476196

There was no discussion among the four other members of the commission. 
Two other pieces of land on the agenda up for a vote were also brought up only for discussion by White — 382 acres of land in Jockey Hollow Wildlife Area in Belmont and Harrison counties  owned by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and nearly 10 acres of land along State Route 821 in Guernsey County owned by the Ohio Department of Transportation. 
There was no discussion among the commissioners on these pieces of land either. All three nominations will be up for discussion again at the next OGLMC meeting.
Fracking is the process of injecting liquid into the ground at a high pressure to extract oil or gas.
In a rare move, the commissioners denied a nomination for 52.619 acres of land in Belmont County along the right-of-way of State Route 7. 
“I want to point everyone to the comments we received from ODOT stating that they do not own the fee simple mineral rights for four of the parcels involved in this nomination,” White said. “I believe the statute is clear that we cannot approve a portion of a nomination. It has to be the whole thing. So as such, it would be my recommendation that we deny the nomination.” 
The commissioners unanimously voted to deny the nomination from moving forward. 
OGLMC did approve two areas of land to move forward to bidding for fracking during Monday’s meeting.
The pieces of land are 3.64 acres in Valley Run Wildlife Area owned by the ODNR and less than an acre in Harrison County along the right-of-way along State Route 151 owned by ODOT. The nominations that were approved will go out to bid in July.
Monday’s meeting started with about a 20 minute presentation from the Ohio Attorney General’s Office on procurement collusion. 
“It is a standard presentation that Ohio agencies may request,” ODNR spokesperson Karina Cheung said in an email. “The OGLMC had the presentation during its public meeting to be transparent and to provide the information to the commission which is tasked with evaluating and awarding bids.”
A handful of people spoke out against fracking before the meeting started. 
“Fracking will cost us much more than it is ever worth,” said Leatra Harper, managing director of the FreshWater Accountability Project. “When the economic, environmental and public health harms from fracking can no longer be denied, and it is too late, what will your conscience tell you?”
There were approximately 2,000 incidents associated with oil and gas wells in Ohio from 2015-2023, according to FracTracker Alliance — a nonprofit that collects data on fracking pipelines.

(Photo Bill Hinton/Getty Images)The Maine Legislature is again considering enacting a comprehensive data privacy law.
Last session, after a dozen public meetings, countless hours of behind-the-scenes work and sizable lobbying influence from Big Tech, the Legislature rejected two competing data privacy proposals, which the bills this session build upon. 
The sponsors of three proposals heard in the Judiciary Committee on Monday each described their legislation as a means to put Mainers in control of their personal information, however the bills diverge on how best to do so. 
The key difference between the versions remains the same: how they limit data collection.
LD 1822, sponsored by Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), uses a standard called data minimization, which limits companies to collecting only information directly relevant and necessary for their operations. Maine’s attorney general and privacy advocates testified in favor of this version last session and again on Monday, pushing for a plan that would make Maine’s regulations on companies that collect online consumer information among the strictest in the country.
Conversely, the version that was backed by businesses and technology companies last session is the basis for LD 1088, sponsored by Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford), and LD 1224, sponsored by Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick) and bipartisan co-sponsors. These bills use a consent-based model, which allows companies to collect the data they’d like so long as it’s disclosed in the terms and conditions consumers agree to.
Other tensions that arose last year regarding how to approach enforcement and exemptions, as well as whether to repeal Maine’s current internet service provider-specific law to instead regulate all businesses under one comprehensive law, are among the key points of division among proposals this session. 
There is currently a patchwork of state laws and parts of federal legislation governing the current landscape, as there remains no one federal law regulating internet privacy, despite several proposals. 
Legislature rejects paths to a comprehensive data privacy law in Maine

Because of this, all of the bill sponsors highlighted the importance of enacting a law that is interoperable among other states, though argued for different reasons why their version would best allow for it.
The bills last session morphed considerably as lawmakers attempted, though ultimately failed, to reach agreement on one proposal and the same tedious work is expected again this session. 
As Henderson put it on Monday, “I am happy to be here but I also want to offer condolences to everyone who now has to sit through more privacy bills, and if you have not had the honor of doing so, welcome and buckle up.”
Data collection
The average consumer is likely more familiar with the data collection approach in the Republican and bipartisan measures, LD 1088 and LD 1224, which rely on privacy notices that consumers must agree to before accessing a website or app. Data collection can still occur in that case, whereas LD 1822 — which only has Democratic cosponsors — would prohibit businesses from collecting certain information. 
The arguments for and against each largely felt like déjà vu, with businesses and tech groups on one side and privacy advocates and civil rights groups on the other. 
Testifying in favor of LD 1822, Maine Assistant Attorney General Brendan O’Neil said data minimization would reduce consumer burden and better align data practices with what consumers expect. Health care providers and immigrant rights groups also argued explicit bans on sensitive data are crucial. 
“We know from firsthand accounts in Maine that immigrants avoid accessing healthcare, education or even emergency assistance because they fear where that information may end up,” said Ruben Torres, policy lead for the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition.
Representatives of Maine Family Planning and Planned Parenthood argued data minimization would shore up Maine’s shield law, noting they currently hear from patients who fear data logged in menstrual tracking apps could be used in legal action in states where abortion and other sexual reproductive health care is banned.
All three bills approach “personal” and “sensitive” data differently. 
LD 1088 and LD 1224 would limit the collection of personal data to what is “adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary” to provide the product or service requested by the consumer, and require what’s collected to be disclosed in a privacy notice. 
However, the bills would require “affirmative, informed consent” for the collection of sensitive data, such as information about a consumer’s sexual orientation, immigration status and geolocation data — though how that would differ from a privacy notice was not clear on Monday.
LD 1822 would limit the collection of personal data to what is “reasonably necessary and proportionate” to provide the product or service requested by the consumer, but that the collection of sensitive data must be limited to only what is “strictly necessary.” 
Last year, the bill Kuhn modeled hers after had also also regulated the use of data, which this version does not, much to the disappointment of privacy advocates. 
Kuhn also made some changes based on concerns raised by businesses last year that data minimization would limit their ability to do targeted advertising and limit reach to new consumers. Essentially, the version this year now ensures small businesses that have to stretch their advertising dollars can access ad exchanges, which are marketplaces where companies can buy and sell advertising. 
Of note, while more supportive of LD 1088 and LD 1224, L.L. Bean did not testify against the data minimization bill this year. 
Now neither for nor against, Christy Van Voorhees, legal counsel for the Freeport-based retail giant, said Kuhn’s version is “very close” to something they could get behind but that the data minimization standard still raises concerns that she hopes lawmakers can clarify.
“This is a very challenging time for businesses,” Van Voorhees added, “and I hope that that’s taken into account.”
Interoperability 
Last session, business interests argued in favor of enacting a law most consistent with those adopted by other states, whereas consumer advocates maintained that greater protections should not be sacrificed for consistency’s sake. 
More than a dozen states have modeled their laws off of one first passed in Connecticut, the model LD 1088 and LD 1224 use. 
Patrick Woodcock, president and CEO of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, said the group has sent a letter to Maine’s congressional delegation requesting change on the federal level, however, “absent that, we would strongly encourage the committee to avoid anything that puts Maine businesses at a disadvantage.”

However, this session the interoperability argument has become more muddled, as Kuhn pointed out that some of the states that have adopted the Connecticut model are now amending their laws to bring them closer to the data minimization standard. 
Also, Maryland passed a law last year that is very similar to Kuhn’s proposal. Maryland’s move marks a divergence from the years-long trend of state-level proposals being watered down. Lawmakers in Connecticut have also proposed an amendment to change its standard to match Maryland’s data minimization model.
“We should settle on interoperability that actually is protecting consumers,” Kuhn said. She added, “If you think of Wayne Gretzsky: where’s the puck going? This is where the puck is going.” 
Building off of that analogy, Woodcock argued it’s unclear where the puck is going because there remains ambiguity in how Maryland law will be implemented and how companies will comply. 
That was also the view shared by other business interests, including Charlie Sultan, an attorney representing the Maine Association of Insurance Companies, who argued a pending amendment is only that, an example of lawmakers advocating for a position but not a change that the state has officially made. 
Exemptions 
During floor debates last year, the most common critique from Republicans was that the version with more data minimization offered too many exemptions to several types of companies, such as higher education, banks, hospital systems and nonprofits. 
That remains a key difference between the two buckets of data privacy bills being considered this year.
While Kuhn said on Monday that in an ideal world a data privacy law would not have entity level exemptions, she included the exemptions for certain businesses settled on in negotiations last year. 
“I felt it was very important to the business community that we not ask people to come back here and relitigate all of those,” Kuhn said. She also noted that her bill includes previously proposed data-level exemptions, which exempt regulated data maintained by a company but require that company to otherwise comply with the privacy law.  
Overall, her more stringent proposal has more data minimization and, as a result, offers more exemptions to the law. Meanwhile, the more business-friendly proposals do not have as much minimization, leading to fewer exemptions.
One key difference between LD 1088 and LD 1224, however, is that the former would repeal the current law governing the privacy of internet consumers, which was enacted in 2019. 
The version favored by businesses and tech last year initially proposed such a repeal but later removed it as a concession made during negotiations. Henderson is pushing for the repeal again. So is Senate Minority leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook). 
Also on Monday, the Judiciary Committee heard LD 1284, sponsored by Stewart, which would solely repeal that law. 
Advocating against the repeal, Michael Kebede, policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said the internet provider law affords stronger protections than those proposed in Henderson’s bill and LD 1224. 
But Stewart said the fact that lawmakers are considering a comprehensive data privacy law underscores the need for a different approach. 
“Privacy today is no longer just a technology or telecom issue,” Stewart said. “It’s a legal issue, a civil rights issue and a consumer protection issue. The fact that the Legislature itself has recognized this complexity is a signal that we can no longer afford to treat privacy as if it starts and ends with [internet service providers].” 
Enforcement 
Through the course of deliberations last session, the data privacy proposals ended up taking a very similar approach to enforcement. This year the proposals are all starting out largely in agreement in this regard. 
All bills only allow enforcement through the Maine Attorney General’s Office, rather than allowing people who feel their privacy has been violated to take a company to court, known as a private right of action. 
“Again, we’re going to honor that negotiated conclusion,” Kuhn said on Monday. 
The Maine Attorney General’s Office and the ACLU of Maine still urged the committee to consider adding a private right of action.
In contrast to the other proposals, Kuhn’s bill also includes a cure period, so that businesses have an opportunity to comply without facing consequences. 
All three bills would require the Attorney General to regularly submit reports on enforcement to inform the Legislature on any amendments that might need to be made, which has been the approach in Connecticut and other states.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal)A panel of economists overwhelmingly said that if federal and state cuts to public library funding become reality, it will harm “human capital” — knowledge and skill that can be used as an economic resource. A smaller majority said it would also reduce the state’s economic output.
The budget proposed by the Republican-controlled Ohio House would spend almost $91 million less on public libraries than the draft proposed by Gov. Mike DeWine, reports the Ohio Library Council.
“Additionally, the Ohio House changed how library funding is allocated,” the library council said last month. “Instead of receiving 1.7% of the state’s General Revenue Fund (GRF)—as established in permanent law—the Public Library Fund (PLF) would become a line-item appropriation. This change could put future library funding at greater risk, as line-item appropriations are more vulnerable to elimination.”
In addition, a group led by Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has moved to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a federal grant-making agency with a budget of $290 million a year.
Benjamin Franklin in 1731 “invented the library as we know it,” Smithsonian Magazine reported last year. That’s when he founded the Library Company of Philadelphia, which was cheap enough for average people to join and improve themselves.
Franklin himself was self-taught and would go on to be the most famous American in the world. He knew that access to books and other materials had vast potential as an improving, democratizing force.
“These libraries have improved the general conversation of the Americans,” Smithsonian Magazine quoted Franklin as saying. And they “made the common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other countries.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIn 1833, the first completely tax-supported library opened in New Hampshire. Between 1886 and 1919, industrialist Andrew Carnegie put up money to open more than 1,600 public libraries, then nearly half of the free public libraries in the United States. More than 100 of the Carnegie libraries opened in Ohio.
“A library outranks any other one thing a community can do to benefit its people,” the Ohio History Connection quotes Carnegie as saying. “It is a never failing spring in the desert.”
As did Franklin, Carnegie believed that public libraries were fundamental to a functioning democracy.
“There is not such a cradle of democracy upon the earth as the free public library, this republic of letters, where neither rank, office, nor wealth receives the slightest consideration,” he said.
Not able to afford college, future President Harry Truman was a voracious reader of American history. He later claimed that by the time he was 14, he had read every book in the Independence, Mo., Public Library.
“Not all readers become leaders,” Truman said. “But all leaders must be readers.”
In 2025, public libraries offer more than books. They’re an important economic resource, especially for underserved Americans, the American Library Association said last month. 
“Public libraries are essential infrastructure in every American community, and that especially is so during times of economic uncertainty,” the group said. “The elimination of federal funding for public libraries will be felt in every community across the country, and particularly in rural areas. Public libraries provide people with job skills training, entrepreneurship support, homeschooling and education materials, and access to food services that are at risk without federal funding. As many people face job reductions and layoffs, there is an increased need for the services libraries provide to help people improve workforce skills.”
In Ohio, Scioto Analysis put several questions about library funding to a panel of 14 economists.
Asked if “cutting funding from Ohio’s public libraries will reduce human capital development of Ohio residents,” 11 said it would, one said it wouldn’t and two were uncertain.
In the comments section of the survey, Kevin Egan of the University of Toledo spoke of weekly library visits with his kids.
“Every time we went to the public library it was full of citizens utilizing its resources: many different types of human capital development beyond just reading, including public access to computers for online job applications and resume preparation; study rooms for students to prepare for their classes and do homework, helpful staff to locate whatever you are interested in learning,” Egan wrote.
The only economist who said cutting library funding would not sap human capital was David Brasington of the University of Cincinnati.
“Other sources of information have made libraries redundant or replaced them,” he wrote.
A strong majority of the economists also agreed that “cutting funding from Ohio’s public libraries will reduce statewide economic output in the long run.” 
Nine agreed, two disagreed and three were uncertain. 
“I’m not clear how much libraries will increase economic output, and it is probably hard to measure, but I’m sure they help at least a little bit,” said Jonathan Andreas of Bluffton University. “This was one reason Andrew Carnegie spent a large portion of his fortune on libraries.”
Brasington strongly disagreed.
“Libraries are increasingly irrelevant in the information age,” he said.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)In the current climate, the daily headlines never cease to amaze. Just when you thought some of our politicians might have begun to grow a backbone, or to show some evidence of moral principles, more head-shaking events occur.
Such was the case recently when the U.S. Senate failed to pass a resolution expressing opposition to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. This was not an attempt to impeach Trump. It was not an effort to censure him. It was very simple. Should we be surprised that neither Kansas senator voted for the resolution?
Sadly, the answer is no, and that goes right to the heart of this dilemma that our nation faces.
Likewise, reports are that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s Health and Human Services secretary, is suggesting that some vegetable seed oils, such as those made from soybeans or sunflowers, should be banned for health reasons. Products such as palm oil, which is not produced in the United States, would take their place. As with many of the pronouncements from the current administration, the statements are not grounded in scientific fact.
Where are the Republicans, especially those who represent farm states, when this sort of drivel is put forth in the public realm? Such proposals would drive another knife into the heart of the exports that are so important to Kansas farmers.
We have a group of Republicans who might best be described as milquetoast. One would think that, in a state where agriculture is such an important sector of the economy, our two senators would have at least shown some semblance of support for this tariff-related measure, and our entire delegation would have spoken out about Kennedy’s proposal, besides.
Dream on. They are scared of Trump. Who do these folks represent?
Here is the scenario that will play out. The tariffs supported by the Republicans will continue to hammer farmers, and many others, including all consumers. Anyone who doubts that that will happen would never have passed a basic test in economics. We will see a huge effect on Kansas agriculture, and then farmers will be asking for help to recover their losses. Look at the recent history of agriculture and politics. It is littered with all sorts of ad hoc disaster payments and subsidies for farmers.
Yes, farmers are price takers, not price makers, and the farm sector represents only about 0.8% of the American economy. Farmers are a tiny percentage of eligible voters.
How, on one hand, does one fail to oppose tariffs, but on the other hand think it is OK to ask all taxpayers to subsidize a small segment of the economy and population? This comment has nothing to do with whether farmers deserve the subsidies. Instead, it highlights, yet again, the irrationality of Trump’s chaos parade.
What would Elon Musk have to say? How, on the one hand, are slash-and-burn techniques being applied to so many facets of the government, while on the other, money may be handed out to “help” farmers harmed by the tariffs? By that logic, should consumers harmed by tariffs also receive checks from the government?
With all of the talk about slashing budgets, how can farmers expect to escape unscathed if Kennedy and his cronies succeed in their goal with respect to vegetable oils? How can any of this make sense?
They are but two examples of many, and as the saying goes, “we ain’t see nothing yet.”

The number of measles cases is approaching 1,000 across 29 states, according to newly released federal statistics. Even as the outbreaks grow, more local governments are complaining that their efforts to combat measles with vaccination clinics have been shut down by abrupt federal funding cuts.
As of May 1, a total of 935 confirmed cases had been reported, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They were in Ohio, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
There have been three confirmed deaths, two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all unvaccinated.
Metro Nashville, the combined county and city government in Tennessee, and three other local governments sued on April 24 over reductions in federal public health funding, saying the abrupt $11 billion in cuts nationwide forced Nashville to cancel vaccination clinics needed to combat this year’s measles outbreak. Colorado and a group of other states sued earlier in April, mentioning the impact of cuts on their ability to control measles, flu and other vaccine-preventable illnesses.
Others joining the April 24 lawsuit: Columbus, Ohio; Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located; Kansas City, Missouri; and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. They called the cuts “a massive blow… at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe funding cuts also forced Minneapolis to shut down clinics in March that had been scheduled to run through June, said Luisa Pessoa-Brandão, director of health initiatives for the city’s health department.
Last year the city’s clinics served 501 patients with 1,475 vaccination shots, including against measles, she said. About 30% of children in the city are not fully vaccinated, much too high to ensure unvaccinated children won’t fall victim to measles outbreaks like the current one, she added.
“There’s fear and hesitancy about the vaccine, based on some of the misinformation out there,” Pessoa-Brandão said. “There are other factors — access [to medical care] and the COVID pandemic, which delayed people getting vaccinations. We’re playing catch-up the last few years.”

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal). A series of executive orders by President Donald Trump targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have many companies and organizations scurrying to determine if they need to change or even scrap their diversity and inclusion policies. Those in Ohio may even be more worried and confused, due to a new state law that prohibits DEI in public higher education.
This confusion is likely exacerbated by the fact that, as any labor and employment lawyer will attest, there is no standard definition of DEI in the human resources universe – leaving much to interpretation. What is certain is that sweeping changes to DEI are underway, and Ohio’s private companies need to quickly come up to speed on what may be required of them soon.
A good place to start is a review of a series of presidential orders in January. Although these orders target primarily federal agencies and their contractors, federal agencies are directed to submit reports identifying private sector companies with the most “egregious and discriminatory” DEI programs. As a result, several high-profile companies – including Meta, Target, Walmart, Google and PepsiCo – either reduced or eliminated their DEI programs.
Then, in late March, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine signed legislation banning DEI programs at the state’s public colleges and universities. Before the bill even passed the Ohio legislature, the state’s largest school – Ohio State University – closed two campus offices focused on DEI and eliminated more than a dozen staff positions. Other schools, including the University of Cincinnati and Miami University, followed suit once the ink was dry on the legislation.
While the new state law doesn’t target Ohio’s private employers, it has left some wondering if they, too, will be required to scale back or end their DEI initiatives. This confusion isn’t helped by the fact that the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) – whose job it is to investigate complaints of discrimination and sue employers who violate federal employment discrimination laws – is itself in disarray after the commission’s two Democrats were fired in January.
Yet, there are some recent “technical assistance documents” from the EEOC that, while not as impactful as commission regulations and guidelines, provide insights to employers on how they should consider various DEI questions. In a newly released document titled “What You Should Know About DEI-Related Discrimination at Work,” the agency poses a series of questions and responses that may be helpful to companies.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXSome of the questions and answers are well-known to many corporate HR specialists and employment lawyers, such as whether an individual can file a federal discrimination lawsuit related to DEI at their work without taking any other steps. The answer is no, because an individual must first file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, which then must complete an administrative process before the person can file a federal lawsuit.
Another question asks whether protections under federal Title VII “only apply to individuals who are part of a minority group.” Again, the answer is no, because these protections apply equally to all workers, the EEOC states, and “different treatment based on race, sex, or another protected characteristic can be unlawful discrimination, no matter which employees or applicants are harmed.”
Other questions have sound answers, but may not be reflective of actual practice in some workplaces. For example, in response to the question, “When is a DEI initiative, policy, program, or practice unlawful under Title VII,” the EEOC provides several examples of such unlawful conduct, including separating workers into groups based on race, sex or another protected class for administering DEI or other training.
The agency notes that employers should provide “training and mentoring that provides workers of all backgrounds the opportunity, skill, experience, and information necessary to perform well, and to ascend to upper-level jobs.”
In truth, however, I’m fairly certain this practice has taken place at some companies – and recently.
A different question asks whether a client preference or request for diversity is a defense against intentional race discrimination. The answer is no, with the EEOC stating a “client or customer preference is not a defense to race or color discrimination” and “basing employment decisions on the racial preferences of clients, customers, or coworkers constitutes intentional race discrimination.”
The EEOC goes on to say that “employment decisions based on the discriminatory preferences of clients, customers, or coworkers are just as unlawful as decisions based on an employer’s own discriminatory preferences.”
That certainly sounds like the correct legal answer. However, in everyday business, it is not unusual for some clients/customers to require their vendors to provide race information of their employees, with the insinuation of stacking accounts with minority employees.
Even more confused? All the more reason Ohio companies should, against this backdrop of anti-DEI measures, immediately begin reviewing their DEI initiatives and programs, as well as information about those programs posted on their websites, in public filings and social media.

(Erika Bolstad/Stateline)BOISE, Idaho — The day the flag bill came up for a vote in the Idaho Senate this spring, state Sen. Melissa Wintrow had no plans to speak against it. As the top Democratic leader in her chamber, she had already spent the legislative session in constant, vocal opposition to the Republican-dominated legislative agenda.
“I thought: ‘Oh, this stupid flag bill once again,’” Wintrow said. “I’ll just vote ‘no’ quietly because I’ve just really been in people’s grille about things.”
But then the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Ben Toews, began passing out flyers about the legislation, one of two proposed bills to limit which flags can be flown at schools and on state and local government property. The only photos on the handout were of rainbow-striped Pride flags flying in Boise: one on a flagpole in front of City Hall, and then others on light poles along Harrison Boulevard, two blocks from Wintrow’s home.
“When he sat that picture in front of me on that desk, I thought: ‘That’s enough. Just always picking and bullying,’” Wintrow said. “The state’s going to tell us what to do, when they can’t even address the larger problems like affordable housing? That’s what’s on people’s minds. A good working wage, health care. It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.”
In recent weeks, both Idaho and Utah have enacted bans that prohibit Pride flags from being displayed on government property, pitting lawmakers in the Republican-dominated legislatures against the more progressive capitals of Boise and Salt Lake City, where the flags are often flown at city hall.














It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.


– Idaho Democratic state Sen. Melissa Wintrow






In Utah, the law allows the state flag, the U.S. flag, U.S. military flags, the POW/MIA flag, local government flags, tribal nation flags, university and school flags and Olympic flags. Idaho’s list is similar, but includes a provision in the school flag law that prohibits flags with political viewpoints, “including but not limited to flags or banners regarding a political party, race, sexual orientation, gender, or a political ideology.”
Lawmakers in Florida, Texas and at least 13 other states are considering similar flag prohibitions, said Logan Casey, director of policy research with the Movement Advancement Project, which studies LGBTQ+ rights. The flag bills go beyond symbolism, Casey said. Rather, they are part of a broad and coordinated legislative attack on LGBTQ+ people that seeks to strip them of rights and erase or make difficult their participation in public life.
“Sometimes those attacks are very material, like denying access to health care or the ability to participate safely in public life and activities,” Casey said. “Sometimes they’re a little more symbolic, like these flag bills.”
 ‘Get rid of everything’

The rainbow-colored Pride flag was conjured up by artist and drag queen Gilbert Baker in 1978, at the suggestion of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, as a symbol of progress and pride for that year’s San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade. Since then, the rainbow-colored flag and its many design iterations have grown into worldwide emblems of solidarity with LGBTQ+ rights.
Although the laws in Idaho and Utah don’t ban Pride flags specifically, bill sponsors and their supporters made it clear they want to see such flags removed from city halls, schools and state buildings. Idaho state Rep. Ted Hill, a Republican who sponsored the bill limiting which flags can fly at schools, said in an interview that Pride flags are disruptive to classroom learning because discussion about them takes up “an amazing amount of political bandwidth.”
“The best way to do it is to get rid of everything,” said Hill, who represents Eagle, a suburb northwest of Boise. “So the only thing you have in the classroom is the American flag, the state flag. And people will say inclusivity and all this. Well, the American flag is as inclusive as it can get.”
Despite the new law, Boise Mayor Lauren McLean, a Democrat, continues to fly a Pride flag in front of City Hall, just below the city’s own and adjacent to poles flying the U.S. and state of Idaho flags. The Pride flag’s presence, within view of the state Capitol, elicited a sternly worded letter from Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican.
Idaho’s law, which went into effect April 3, has no penalty for local governments or officials who fly flags in defiance of the ban, an oversight lawmakers told Labrador they’ll rectify in subsequent legislative sessions. Instead, the law relies on “the good will of elected officials for its enforcement,” Labrador wrote, warning McLean that she should “comply with the law out of a sense of duty to your oath of office.”
He threatened, too, that lawmakers could “deny state tax revenues and other appropriations to the City of Boise or any other governmental entity that does not follow state law.”
McLean countered that the new law is unconstitutional, and that the city will challenge threats to withhold funding. Pride flags have flown in Boise for a decade, she told Labrador, and represent a commitment to “a safe and welcoming city where everyone means just that — everyone.”
“The Constitutional rights of our residents are not subject to — cannot be subject to — the political whims of legislative disapproval,” McLean wrote, “and we will not step back from them simply because the principles our community cherishes make some in state government uncomfortable.”
Boise’s city council is considering a resolution confirming that any flags it flies, including Pride flags, are official city flags — a move the council says will ensure it is complying with state law. In the meantime, the city will “continue to fly the flags on City Hall Plaza that represent our community and speak to our values of caring for people and welcoming all,” McLean said in a statement.
Early on Easter morning, several people climbed a ladder propped up next to the city’s flagpole to cover the Pride flag and a separate flag (honoring organ and tissue donation) with trash bags. They also raised the Appeal to Heaven flag, a Revolutionary War-era flag that has come to represent sympathy to the Christian nationalist movement and to President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. A few hours later, the mayor lowered the flags, which are on a locked halyard, to remove the trash bags and the Appeal to Heaven flag.
It capped a challenging sequence of events in Boise and nearby Meridian, which drew national attention this spring when school officials ordered a middle school teacher to take down a sign with the phrase “Everyone is welcome here” from her classroom. Amid the backlash, people in Boise printed T-shirts and yard signs in support of the teacher and the sign’s message.
The mayor’s response to the flag law and the support for the classroom message aren’t directly connected, but both reflect how many in the community insist on sending a welcoming message at this moment in American history, said Christina Bruce-Bennion, executive director of Boise’s Wassmuth Center for Human Rights, which helped coordinate support for the teacher.
 ‘It is very targeted’

In Salt Lake City, the flag ban threatens to end a long-standing annual tradition. Typically, the mayor’s office kicks off Pride Month festivities in June with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall, said Chad Call, executive director of the Utah Pride Center, which puts on the state’s annual Pride festivities. Events include a parade through the streets of Salt Lake City with a 200-foot Pride flag — which remains a legal form of First Amendment expression and has taken place most years since 1997.
“We have a city council that wants to celebrate Pride month,” Call said. “They want to celebrate the queer community in the month of June. And then we have a state government that does not want that happening in our capital city. And so it is very targeted.”
One of the flag bill’s sponsors, state Rep. Trevor Lee, said in an interview that his legislation was prompted by constituents who told him they’re “sick and tired of seeing a political agenda being pushed in their face” on government property, particularly with flags featuring transgender representation.
“It makes people feel uncomfortable if it’s something they don’t agree with,” said Lee, who represents a district north of Salt Lake City. “And so we’re trying to keep it very specific and let schools focus on teaching the things that they need to, and let government buildings just fly their city flag for heaven’s sakes, or the state flag or the American flag.”
One Utah parent, Republican activist Aaron Bullen, said he began objecting to Pride flags several years ago after one of his children, then a fifth grader, was “visibly upset” after school one day. Bullen said his son told him he’d seen what’s known as a Progress Pride flag, a newer iteration of the original rainbow-striped flag. It includes an arrow on the left side composed of pink, blue and white stripes to represent transgender people, as well as brown and black stripes to represent queer people of color. The flag was in the school’s computer lab.
Bullen said he complained to school leaders at the district, south of Salt Lake City, and the flag came down. But Bullen felt as though the flag’s presence undermined what he and his wife teach at home and model to their children as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, particularly how they interpret the church’s stance on transgender people and marriage for same-sex couples.
“It says, basically, ‘we approve of gay marriage’ when that flag is up,” Bullen said. “And that’s something that my religion is explicitly against. And so you have a teacher of my son, a person in authority that they’d like to be able to trust and to follow the instructions of, but they’re saying, ‘your parents who taught you this other thing, they’re wrong. Your religion is wrong.’ That’s what that flag means.”














It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would.


– Aaron Bullen, a Utah parent and Republican activist






He added: “It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would. Parents have the fundamental right and responsibility to rear their children. And it’s not a school’s place to oppose the religion of the parents or the teachings of the parents.”
Unlike in Idaho, Utah’s flag ban carries a $500 fine per day for failure to comply with the law. But in Utah, the law took effect without Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’s signature. The governor declined to sign the bill into law, saying the state’s residents are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix.”
Call, of the Utah Pride Center, said that while it’s discouraging for LGBTQ+ people to witness their representation further erased in public spaces, they refuse in Utah to allow the flag law to diminish the spirit of their Pride events, among the largest in the nation.
“Our counterculture here is really, really strong,” Call said. “And I think the thing that probably defines our Utah Pride as being kind of unique is the incredibly strong community that it brings together. There’s tens, hundreds of thousands of people that come out to support it.”

(Photo by Jon King/Michigan Advance)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced Monday that her office was dropping charges against seven pro-Palestinian protesters at the University of Michigan.
The seven individuals; Oliver Kozler, Samantha Lewis, Henry MacKeen-Shapiro, Michael Mueller, Asad Siddiqui, Avi Tachna-Fram and Rhiannon Willow, were charged last September with trespassing and resisting and/or obstructing a police officer after an encampment by pro-Palestinian protestors on the university’s Diag on the Ann Arbor campus was broken up by police in May 2024. 
All seven previously pleaded not guilty and were in Ann Arbor District Court Monday morning awaiting a decision on a motion for Nessel to recuse herself from the case when they learned of the dismissals.
In announcing the decision to drop the charges, Nessel called the recusal motion a “diversionary tactic,” and that because the case had become “a lightning rod of contention,” it was no longer in the public’s best interest to proceed.
“These distractions and ongoing delays have created a circus-like atmosphere to these proceedings,” Nessel said. “While I stand by my charging decisions, and believe, based on the evidence, a reasonable jury would find the defendants guilty of the crimes alleged, I no longer believe these cases to be a prudent use of my department’s resources, and, as such, I have decided to dismiss the cases.”
Another factor in Nessel’s decision was a letter the Detroit Free Press reported was sent to the court last week by the Jewish Federation of Greater Ann Arbor, defending Nessel against accusations that she was biased against the Muslim and Arab American communities.
“We have learned that a public statement in support of my office from a local non-profit has been directly communicated to the court,” Nessel said in her statement. “The impropriety of this action has led us to the difficult decision to drop these charges.”
In response to the news, the TAHRIR Coalition, made up of dozens of pro-Palestinian student groups at the University of Michigan, said on social media that the decision “is what happens when we resist and refuse to cower.”
The protests were part of a wave of demonstrations at college campuses across the nation that began in the aftermath of Israeli military strikes in Gaza following the October 7, 2023, surprise attack by Hamas on Israel.
Meanwhile, Nessel’s office continues to carry out an investigation of pro-Palestinian protesters accused of causing approximately $100,000 of damage at up to a dozen locations, including at the homes of University of Michigan President Santa Ono and University of Michigan Regent Jordan Acker.
A warrant sweep in conjunction with that investigation was carried out last month at locations in Ann Arbor, Canton and Ypsilanti. Charges have yet to be filed in those incidents.
On Sunday, Ono announced he would leave the university later this summer to become the president at the University of Florida.

,California,2025-05-06 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Clash over teen sex solicitation reveals the rift within the California Democratic Party,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/clash-sex-crimes-california-democrats/,The image that emerges after a recent dustup over a bill seeking to increase penalties for sex solicitation is one of a Democratic Party at war with itself as the governor tries to distance himself from his party’s leftish tendencies.,"A reliable political axiom — at least in California — is that when one party achieves dominance in some arena, it fragments into factions defined by ideology, gender, economics, ethnicity, geography or even personality. The axiom has been demonstrated at the local level for decades, such as the perpetual infighting among San Francisco’s dominant Democrats, or the ceaseless squabbling among Republicans when they controlled Orange County.
Democrats achieved absolute dominance in state politics over the last quarter-century, holding all statewide offices and capturing supermajorities in the Legislature and within the state’s congressional delegation.
One might think that such hegemony would manifest itself in sweeping responses to California’s most pressing issues, such as homelessness, poverty, water supply, wildfires and housing shortages — particularly after Gavin Newsom became governor on promises to seek “big, hairy audacious goals.”
It was not to be. The issues that were plaguing California when Newsom took office in 2019 are as formidable as ever, reflecting not only their complexity but the tendency of the dominant party to become a collection of often hostile quasi-parties.
The disunity has appeared on multiple occasions, but what’s happened over legislation to crack down on sex crimes against children is a stark example.
Two years ago, state Sen. Shannon Grove, a Republican from Bakersfield, carried legislation that would have added human trafficking of a minor to the state’s list of serious felonies, thereby qualifying an offender for tougher penalties. Democrats stalled the bill, which was opposed by criminal justice reform groups. But when reporters asked Newsom about it, he intervened, essentially compelling the Legislature to pass it.
Last year, Grove took up the issue again with legislation that would increase penalties for anyone who solicited sex from a minor, but Democrats insisted that they wouldn’t apply if the minor was 16 or 17 years old. Gay rights advocates demanded what was termed a “carveout,” contending that including older teens could backfire if the law was used to punish consenting relationships.
Grove grudgingly accepted the amendment as the price of getting the measure approved, but the issue was rejoined this year with a bill carried by Assemblywoman Maggy Krell, a Sacramento Democrat who had been a sex crime prosecutor.
Krell’s measure would eliminate the carveout for 16- and 17-year old victims but in a replay of the previous year, fellow Democrats on the Assembly Public Safety Committee struck that provision of the bill, leading to a public squabble on the Assembly floor last week.

Republicans sought to restore the bill’s original purpose and Krell endorsed the effort, saying “We need to say, loud and clear, that if you’re under 18, a child, a minor … the person buying that person should be charged with a felony. It’s plain and simple, sex without consent — that’s rape.”
She picked up vocal support from some other Democrats but Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas beat back the effort and punished Krell by taking her name off the bill and inserting a phrase declaring an intent to deal with the issue later.

“No one in the room is OK with” minors being sold for sex, Rivas said. “This is a nuanced issue and conversation.”
That, however, is not the end of it because Newsom once again entered the debate. 
“The law should treat all sex predators who solicit minors the same — as a felony, regardless of the intended victim’s age,” Newsom said in a statement. “Full stop.”
The image that emerges from this dustup is that of a Democratic Party at war within itself, with Rivas trying to be an “ayatollah,” as former Speaker Willie Brown once described himself, and Newsom distancing himself from his party’s leftish tendencies as a prelude to running for president in 2028.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderAn influential conservative lobbying group has allegedly failed to file the proper disclosures in connection with advertisements for Gov. Brian Kemp and Lt. Gov. Burt Jones in the 2022 election, according to a complaint filed with the State Ethics Commission.
  Cole Muzio speaks at the unveiling of the House transgender sports ban bill, which also would have removed references to gender in state law, replacing them with sex. The bill was a priority of House Speaker Jon Burns, right. A Senate bill including the sports provisions but not the other code changes ultimately passed, but not the House version. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Frontline Policy Action is an evangelical 501(c)(4) organization that successfully lobbied during the 2025 Legislative session for bills including the so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act and a ban on transgender women and girls playing on women’s school sports teams.
The complaint, submitted April 30 by attorney Bryan Sells, alleges that Frontline Policy Action violated multiple state laws in the runup to the 2022 election in which Kemp won a rematch against  Democrat Stacey Abrams.
Failure to Report Advertising spending
According to the complaint, Frontline produced and distributed several advertisements in October and November 2022, including a 30-second video featuring a transgender swimmer winning a competition that appeared on Facebook and Instagram.
Sellers says Frontline did not file required disclosure reports containing the expenditures for those advertisements on the four dates required by the state, and he says that amounts to four separate violations.
Failure to Disclose Contributions and Expenditures
Between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023, Frontline reported bringing in $246,831 in contributions and spending $237,311 on its IRS filings, but the complaint alleges Frontline did not report either its income or its expenditures to the State Ethics Commission, which Sells alleges amounts to two more violations of the law.
Failure to include required statements
Under state law, any time an independent committee like Frontline pays for a political advertisement, the ad needs to clearly state that it was funded by the committee.
Sells found three advertisements he says does not contain that required statement, which he says equals three more violations.
Coordinated Campaign Contributions
State law forbids anybody from making contributions to any candidate for statewide elected office above certain inflation-adjusted limits. For the 2022 election, that limit was $7,600.
There are ways to get around that limit, but only under certain conditions, including that payments must not be made with the “cooperation or consent of, or in consultation with, or at the request or suggestion of any candidate or any of his or her agents or authorized committees.”
The complaint alleges that Frontline failed this test because a member of its board was also an agent of the governor.
According to Sells, Brad Hughes, director of field services at Kemp’s office since 2019, was also a member of the Board of Directors of Frontline Policy Action Inc. since 2021.
Previous allegations

Last November, the Southern Poverty Law Center, which designates Frontline as an anti-LGBTQ hate group, filed a complaint alleging that Frontline’s president and founder Cole Muzio and attorney Chelsea Thompson had been lobbying lawmakers under the Gold Dome without properly registering. According to that complaint, Muzio had not registered as a lobbyist since 2022 and Thompson had never registered.
A February open records request with the ethics commission for all documents related to that complaint yielded only the complaints themselves. The commission confirmed Monday that there was nothing new to report.
Thompson dismissed the complaint in a text message.
“This is a non-issue stemming from site technical issues. I’ve been in communication with the Commission and have exercised due diligence throughout the process, and expect the matter to be resolved soon.”
Thompson added that she is registered as a lobbyist but Muzio is not because that is not part of his role.
“It would be inaccurate to say ‘y’all/we’ registered as lobbyists,” she said. “I became the sole/lead lobbyist for our organization following the 2024 legislative session. Also, it would be false to suggest that we registered as lobbyists in response to the complaint, our registration reflects a change in role and responsibility, not a reaction to any complaint.”
Kemp’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
During the session, it is common to see Frontline activists speaking with lawmakers around the Capitol.

Muzio and Thompson stood behind Speaker Jon Burns as he unveiled the House’s transgender sports ban bill and behind Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler as he made his final pitch for his ultimately successful RFRA bill. Thompson is often seen sitting alongside lawmakers in committee meetings as they present red meat conservative bills.
The group’s considerable influence and legislative successes have made them a major pain for Democrats.
“I don’t think the general public has a real grasp of just how deeply embedded this Christian nationalist organization is in making policy for the state of Georgia,” said Rep. Karen Lupton, a Chamblee Democrat.
“Everybody down here knows exactly who’s with Frontline, who they’re talking to, who they have in their pockets, and it’s just kind of accepted as, ‘well this is the way we do business in Georgia,’ and that’s not acceptable to me,” she added.
Lupton, who was raised as an evangelical Christian and planned to major in Bible studies, said she thinks Frontline uses its significant influence to launder hateful ideology.
“If people can see past the quote-unquote issue that’s on the page whatever issue they’re bringing up and look past it to where it is coming from – those anti-trans bills, those quote-unquote ‘sports safety bills’ did not come from athletic organizations, they did not come from athletes, they did not come from coaches, they came from the Christian nationalist far-right, and people need to know that.”

Ballah was one of 41 corp member dismissed after cuts to the federal AmeriCorps program. (Photo courtesy of Ballah)Maria Fetter was cutting a downed tree with a chainsaw, helping a Boy Scout troop restore an old archery range in Gunpowder Falls State Park, right before she got the news.
Her program, the Maryland Conservation Corps, had been terminated, just before the busy summer season. It was among the Maryland casualties of President Donald Trump’s cuts to AmeriCorps.
The 22-year-old — who adored her work maintaining hiking trails and teaching visitors at the park and around the state — was crushed.
“I had never felt such a big pit form in my chest and my stomach within a split second,” Fetter said. “It just — it happened so fast.”
It wasn’t just losing her job. The program’s termination has also thrust her housing at Gunpowder into question, along with other benefits. Now, she will only get a portion of the educational stipend she had planned to use to finish her associate degree and pursue additional schooling.
Fetter was one of 41 Conservation Corps members, between ages 17 and 25, who had been signed on to work at Maryland state parks until August, before the sudden cuts came down.
More than 8,000 young people have participated in the program in Maryland since its inception in 1984. I exchange for housing, a modest cost-of-living allowance and an educational stipend, corps members spend their days constructing hiking trails, battling invasive species, educating park visitors and more.
  Maria Fetter, 22, clears a trail in Gunpowder Falls State Park. (Photo courtesy of Fetter)
The Maryland Department of Natural Resources planned to contribute more than $1.6 million to the program this year, and expected another $922,000 from the federal AmeriCorps program, a DNR spokesman said.
The Conservation Corps was mentioned in a recent lawsuit challenging the AmeriCorps cuts, brought by Maryland and 23 other states, as well as the District of Columbia. The suit argues that the cuts, directed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, are unconstitutional because the programs were funded by Congress, and only Congress can undo them.
But the White House has pointed to financial audits of AmeriCorps, the latest of which found the agency “could not provide sufficient appropriate evidential matter in a timely manner” because of “inadequate processes, controls, and records.”
“Americorps has failed eight consecutive audits and identified over $45 million in improper payments in 2024 alone. President Trump is restoring accountability to the entire Executive Branch,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement Monday.
AmeriCorps notified states after hours on Friday, April 25, that it was cutting $400 million in program funds; Maryland members got the news the next day, a Saturday.
That day, Makaila Ballah, a Conservation Corps worker based in Patapsco Valley State Park, was directing traffic at the Fort Frederick 18th Century Market Fair in Western Maryland, when she and her crewmates were immediately sent home.
Ballah knew about cuts to the National Civilian Community Corps, another AmeriCorps program, but had been told by higher-ups that funding for Maryland’s program had already been earmarked, and that any cuts would likely only affect future years.
“We were told the whole time that we’re safe,” said Ballah, 24, from Randallstown.
She planned to apply for a second year with the Conservation Corps, in hopes of getting more experience in wildlife management — and another education stipend — before pursuing her master’s degree in the field.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Truly, my world is flipped on its head right now,” Ballah said.
Fetter, who worked with the Conservation Corps by day and as an EMT by night, was considering using her education stipend for paramedic school, after obtaining an associate degree. Without the full stipend, which can equal the amount of a federal Pell grant, Fetter isn’t sure what she will be able to afford.
“This is a very big wrench thrown into that plan,” said Fetter, who grew up in Harford County. “It’s hard to really deter me from anything, but this is definitely a big discouragement.”
She’s losing out on other opportunities, including advanced chainsaw training, and her goals of restoring bluebird boxes and planting native gardens in the park may never be realized now.
But Fetter could also lose Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits — SNAP, formerly known as food stamps — which helped her afford groceries despite her low pay in the corps.
Nat Leinbach, a Conservation Corps worker dismissed from Patapsco, is searching for a new job, with a looming deadline at the end of May, when health insurance through the program lapses.
“It’s going to be really tough, because most places that are hiring for environmental conservation are seeing similar funding cuts,” said Leinbach, 26, who uses they/them pronouns. “Grants are literally disappearing out from under people’s noses because of this administration.”

Leinbach said they were grateful, however, to learn that they could remain in their Patapsco housing through the program’s original end date in August.
At Patapsco, the crew was planning to treat ash trees to ward off the invasive emerald ash borer. They were also planning to continue monthly water sampling, and maintain a fish ladder transporting American eels over the Daniels Dam in the Patapsco River.
“There’s so many projects where it’s just left hanging,” said Leinbach, who is from Bowie. “I don’t know what’s going to happen to these projects that have been in the works for so long.”
At the Evergreen Heritage Center in Western Maryland, the loss of five AmeriCorps members from the Appalachian Service Through Action and Resources (ASTAR) hit hard. The loss of manpower forced education manager Lacey Day to reallocate staffing at the center, to ensure that young students attending field trips could still receive educational programming.
The center includes farm houses, a shuttered coal mine, gardens and nature trails, which are all used to teach children about the environment and land use, as well as the region’s mining history and its impact on water quality. AmeriCorps members helped teach the curriculum and provide hands-on assistance, including for students with special needs, Day said.
“I had to restaff our entire social studies program, just to make sure that I was covering all the bases,” Day said. “And I’m just thinking about going forward, how we’re going to staff our summer camps, because having those extra hands really, really makes a difference.”
But even after their terminations, several Conservation Corps members have continued to participate in outdoor service projects. Ballah volunteered for a state survey of bog turtles. Fetter helped remove a downed tree blocking a trail at a local wildlife center.
“We can’t do that as AmeriCorps members, but they still needed the help, and they still needed the work to get done,” Fetter said.
Though she’s been crushed by the news, Fetter said she is trying to keep the faith.

But the desire for speed shouldn’t come at the expense of equity, accountability, or common sense.
The proposed Superconducting Maglev (SCMaglev) train between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore is being pitched as a revolutionary leap forward—a 15-minute ride connecting two cities. But when you look closely, it becomes clear that this project is a costly distraction from the real transportation needs of Marylanders.
I’ve followed the SCMaglev project for nearly a decade, through meetings, hearings, and glossy presentations. One moment sticks with me to this day: During a presentation to the Maryland General Assembly, a representative claimed the Maglev would reduce regional traffic by 30%. When I asked for the methodology or data behind that estimate, no one could provide an answer.
That kind of vague, unverified projection isn’t just irresponsible — it’s dangerous when we’re discussing a multibillion-dollar project with lasting impacts on our communities, environment and transportation landscape.

Let’s talk dollars. A one-way Maglev ticket from D.C. to Baltimore is projected to cost between $60 and $80. That’s not a commuter fare — it’s a luxury option targeted at business elites and tourists. The average Marylander isn’t budgeting $120 a day for transit.
We already have underfunded, overburdened systems like MARC, Metro and local buses that residents rely on every day. Why not invest in expanding those services — adding more stops, increasing frequency, reducing costs, and improving reliability?
As a resident of Laurel, I’m particularly alarmed by the impact the route would have on the Patuxent Research Refuge. My twin boys and I spend time there often, enjoying trails and spotting wildlife. It’s one of the last intact green spaces in our region — and SCMaglev would cut right through it.
That’s not innovation. That’s ecological devastation in the name of elite convenience. Our green spaces are not expendable.
Even if you set aside the environmental costs, the communities most affected by the Maglev — like those in Prince George’s County — see none of the benefits. There are no planned stops here, yet our neighborhoods would bear the brunt of construction, land disruption and noise. No reliable jobs. No meaningful investment in our mobility. We’ve been promised a few short-term construction jobs, but no long-term transit improvements or economic uplift. That’s not equity — it’s extraction.
Let’s also examine the travel time savings that Maglev promoters like to tout. A 15-minute ride between D.C. and Baltimore sounds great in theory, but it does not include the time it takes to get to the Maglev stations — both of which would be deep in the urban cores of each city. Real commutes aren’t point-to-point miracles. They involve walking, transfers, delays and often multiple systems.
Without meaningful integration with existing transit, the Maglev could actually complicate travel, not streamline it.
Supporters often point to Japan as a shining example of high-speed rail success. And it’s true — Japan’s Shinkansen and Maglev lines are marvels of engineering. But Japan also has the infrastructure, culture and density to support that kind of system.
Tokyo, for example, has over 39,000 people per square mile in some areas — vastly higher than any corridor between D.C. and Baltimore. Japan also has a deeply ingrained public transit culture that makes high-speed rail practical. Maryland simply does not have the same conditions to justify this scale of investment.
We need bold transportation investments — but bold does not have to mean flashy. It means practical, people-centered solutions: Expanding bus routes, extending service hours, modernizing fleets, integrating systems, improving accessibility and making transit affordable. It means investing where people already are — and where they’ve been asking for improvements for years.
A truly visionary transportation system does not just move people quickly — it moves people equitably. It respects the communities it runs through. It protects the ecosystems it touches. It closes gaps in mobility and opens doors to opportunity. SCMaglev may be fast, but it’s not right for Maryland — not now, and not at this cost.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/maglev-1.jpg,,,2025-05-06 02:00:02.050671

Brown has already led or joined more than two dozen suits against the administration since Trump was sworn into office Jan. 20, including taking the lead in a suit challenging the summary firing of thousands of probationary federal workers. A U.S. District judge in Greenbelt issued a preliminary injunction in that case on April 1, ordering 20 agencies to give workers their jobs back while the case went to trial.
The newest suits challenge the administration’s plan to lay off thousands of workers at the Department of Health and Human Services, and to stop federal approval of wind-power projects across the country. The motion seeks to block the president’s order that would set strict new ID requirements for voting.
In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for Rhode Island, Maryland joined with 18 other states and the District of Columbia challenging Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s plans to slash staffing and close agencies at the department.
As Trump hits 100 days, Brown among attorneys general battling him at every turn

The suit, first reported in the Rhode Island Current, a part of the States Newsroom network, focused on the firing of 10,000 HHS workers and the shuttering of dozens of agencies in the department as part of Kennedy’s so-called “Make America Healthy Again” initiative.
When termination notices went out on April 1, the suit says, “employees were immediately expelled from their work email, laptops, and offices, work across the vast and complicated Department came to a sudden halt. Throughout HHS, critical offices were left unable to perform statutory functions.”
“There was no one to answer the phone, factories went into shutdown mode, experiments were abandoned, trainings were cancelled, site visits were postponed, application portals were closed, laboratories stopped testing for infectious diseases such as hepatitis, and partnerships were immediately suspended,” the suit said, just a fraction of the impact of the layoffs it cited.
The second suit Brown joined Monday, with 16 other states and the District of Columbia, targets an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office that ordered federal agencies to pause approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore.
The suit says Trump’s order claims unspecified “inadequacies” in previous agency reviews of project applications and ordered “an amorphous, redundant, extra-statutory, and multi-agency review of unknown duration” of already approved plans. The order has “stopped most wind-energy development in its tracks,” the suit says.
The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, cites a project that was under construction off Long Island, New York, when an order to “cease all construction activities” came on April 16 from the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, an agency within the Interior Department.
In September, the federal government approved an offshore wind project in Maryland. The suit claims U.S. Wind’s project would provide 1,710 megawatts of clean energy from a maximum of 114 turbines and create 13,600 jobs and more than $6 billion in economic benefits to the state.
“The Trump Administration’s outrageous and unlawful freeze on wind energy development is nothing short of a direct assault on Maryland’s future climate security and economic prosperity,” Brown said in a statement announcing the suit.

“With this lawsuit, we are protecting the livelihoods of thousands of families and standing firm against President Trump’s reckless attack on an industry that offers to secure reliable, affordable, and clean energy for every Marylander,” he said.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) said in the statement that Trump’s actions run counter to the state’s efforts to lower utility costs for Marylanders by increasing energy production through wind power. “At a moment when families are feeling the strain of high energy bills, we should focus on cutting red tape, not halting critical infrastructure projects,” Moore said.
Meanwhile, Brown joined a coalition of 19 attorneys general who filed a motion Monday for a preliminary injunction in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts seeking to block Trump’s March 25 executive order that would impose sweeping voting restrictions nationwide.
If allowed ot take effect, Trump’s order would require voters to prove their citizenship with a U.S. passport, a REAL ID, a military identification card, or a federal or state government-issued photo identification.
Brown and the other attorneys general filed a lawsuit April 3 challenging the order.
“The lawsuit underscores that the power to regulate elections rests exclusively with the states and Congress – not the President,” Brown said in a statement released by his office Monday. “The attorneys general argue that they are likely to win on the merits of their lawsuit, that their states have unique and profound interests at stake in the litigation, and that their states will suffer irreparable harms without court-ordered relief.”
In all, 21 states and the District of Columbia are parties to the three actions today. In addition to Maryland, the states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DSC_0400-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-06 02:00:02.050671

The state legislation was signed into law on Friday, May 2, by Gov. Bob Ferguson. It means church leaders will now be required to report child abuse or neglect to authorities, and unlike many other states, it mandates that clergy do so even if they learned of the allegations during a confession. 
The Justice Department said it would open a civil rights investigation “into the development and passage” of the bill, “which appears on its face to violate the First Amendment.” 
In a statement Tuesday evening, Ferguson stood by the legislation.
“We look forward to protecting Washington kids from sexual abuse in the face of this ‘investigation’ from the Trump Administration,” Ferguson said. 
The bill’s passage came after three straight years of intense debate within the state Legislature, often spurred by strong opposition from Catholic lobbyists who opposed any requirement that priests report child abuse if the allegations were revealed during a confession. 
The announcement from the DOJ expressed similar opposition, noting that the law includes “no exception for the absolute seal of confidentiality that applies to Catholic Priests.” 
But in signing the bill on Friday, Ferguson noted that as a Catholic himself, he believes the bill “protects Washingtonians from abuse and harm.” 
“I always have a personal perspective on this,” Ferguson said. “For me, this is very clear and important legislation.” 
State Sen. Noel Frame, who introduced the bill, rejected the notion that the bill is targeting Catholics, pointing out, as she has repeatedly in legislative hearings, that she introduced the legislation after reading InvestigateWest’s coverage of the way Jehovah’s Witnesses hid sexual abuse for decades and how Washington was one of the few states that did not require clergy to report such allegations. 
She also disagrees with the argument that the bill is a violation of the First Amendment. 
In its press release, the DOJ argues that the law “singles out” clergy by making them the only “supervisors,” as defined by state law, “who may not rely on legal privileges” to avoid reporting child abuse. 
“Perhaps they should read the bill,” Frame quipped. 
Under already-existing Washington state law, confessions to clergy were one of many so-called “privileged communications,” which includes doctor-patient confidentiality and attorney-client privilege. The new law specifies that when it comes to making a report of child abuse or neglect to authorities, the privileged communications statute no longer applies to clergy. 
But Frame said that isn’t singling clergy out. Domestic violence advocates, therapists and unions — all groups with “privileged communications” under state law — already lose the privilege in child abuse cases and still must follow mandatory reporting laws. Doctors can also be called to testify during judicial proceedings of child abuse cases. Clergy, meanwhile, still don’t have to testify in court during such cases — the new law only applies to reporting information to authorities.
A survivor of child sexual abuse herself, Frame, D-Seattle, first tried to make clergy mandatory reporters of child abuse in 2023.
She said ultimately she isn’t too surprised at the news of the investigation.
“I shouldn’t be surprised that the Trump administration is launching an investigation into a law that seeks to protect children from child abuse and neglect,” she said in an interview.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-06 04:01:44+00:00,CT Mirror,Opinion: Keep private prisons out of Connecticut,Anthony Dominguez,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/06/keep-the-prison-industrial-complex-out-of-connecticut/,Recent history has taught us that the restorative services of correctional facilities can be most faithfully delivered through public ownership and regulation.,"Beginning in the 1980s, federal budgetary constraints and increasing incarceration rates moved the U.S. government to issue its first contracts with the private prison industry.
This action fired off a trend that saw states incorporate for-profit models into their own prison systems. As of 2022, 28 states had contracts with private prison firms.
Connecticut stands apart from these 28, as all its correctional centers are state-owned. Connecticut’s Department of Correction is tasked with managing and supervising its correctional facilities, overseeing everything from high-security central prisons to local correctional facilities. The DOC is responsible for keeping facilities accountable and ensuring that the needs of both incoming and outgoing inmates are sufficiently met; this includes enforcing internal operating standards and supporting reintegration programs for transitioning inmates.
In an effort to reinforce the current system’s integrity and prevent the abuses perpetrated by private prison institutions, Connecticut state legislators have raised bill S.B. 1328. This bill, if made law, would categorically prohibit private companies from owning, operating, or managing correctional facilities in Connecticut. Such a forward-thinking policy would safeguard Connecticut’s criminal justice system from succumbing to the harmful private prison industrial complex. A look into the many ills privatization has brought to many states across our country makes clear the necessity for taking S.B. 1328’s preventative action.
Research surrounding America’s private prisons reveals to us the negligence that privatization opens up prison management to. A comprehensive 2016 report by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General analyzed 14 American federal prisons run by private companies alongside a set of 14 comparable facilities operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Using data from 2011-2014, they investigated these facilities’ levels of contraband, reports of incidents, lockdowns, inmate discipline, telephone monitoring, selected grievances, urinalysis drug testing, and sexual misconduct. The study revealed that, in all categories except for drug tests and sexual misconduct, private prisons had more transgressions per capita than BOP institutions.
Most shockingly, the private prisons had significantly higher rates of assault —both by inmates on other inmates and by inmates on staff— and had confiscated eight times as many contraband phones annually. 
Many technical causes might help explain the failures captured here. But, even then, it is clear that these specific shortcomings are only symptoms of a greater disease: the model’s sickening for-profit essence. Incentivized to keep costs low, private prisons tend to sacrifice their quality of service for financial gain. The prevalent belief that electronic surveillance —a relatively cheap mode of monitoring— can replace certain employees leads to substantial staffing and supervisional inadequacies; and, overall, cost-cutting efforts can lend themselves to drastic dips in living conditions for inmates.
Having been raised in Florida, a state with seven private prisons, I am all too aware of the staggering waste, fraud, and abuse that follow. A 2017 investigation by Florida Rep. David Richardson revealed that, during a seven-year period, the state government had paid well over $16 million in overcharges to CoreCivic, a private prison goliath. Rep. Richardson identified this waste as the consequence of either governmental mismanagement or calculated fraud.
In addition to the pernicious corruption exemplified by this instance, the internal management of Florida’s private prisons presents severe operational deficiencies. An audit from the Florida Auditor General of the Department of Management Services found that the state’s three private prison providers failed to comply with basic standards: they had failed to maintain sufficient levels of security personnel, they had failed to procure functional fire safety systems, and they had failed to provide proper training for security personnel. The violation of these basic, regulatory necessities unambiguously shows the lack of integrity plaguing for-profit correctional facilities.
But perhaps the most egregious reality of the for-profit system is the common practice of incorporating minimum occupancy clauses. These clauses require the government to maintain a specific percentage of occupancy in the private prison, typically ranging from 80% to 100%. If the government fails to meet this occupancy requirement, it must pay a compensatory penalty to the private prison company for unused beds. In Florida, the minimum occupancy clause guarantees a ridiculous 90 percent occupancy of their facilities. If such a policy were to ever take root in Connecticut, it would likely present taxpayers with additional burdens and terribly increase incarceration rates.
One of President Donald Trump’s first actions of the year reversed former President Joe Biden’s 2021 executive order against the renewal of federal contracts with private prison corporations. As this new administration launches a slew of regressive criminal justice policies, it is more important than ever for states to take a stand at the local level.
Connecticut has the opportunity to do just this with S.B. 1328. Recent history has taught us that the restorative services of correctional facilities can be most faithfully delivered through public ownership and regulation. 
America’s incarceration system is steeped in a legacy of pain and trauma. This legislative act is by no means enough to redress the iniquities perpetuated by the current system —but it is a necessary step in the long path towards extensive reform. For the enduring health of today’s criminal justice system, we must be proactive. 
Now is the time to contact the offices of your local representatives and senators and demand their support in keeping correctional facilities free from the corruption of privatization.

So why do we fund schools that way?
Connecticut continues to invest in schools through a model that treats all students equally despite dramatically different needs. Over the past five years, the state has incrementally added more than $250 million to education. Even with this additional funding, our most vulnerable students —particularly those in special education— are being left behind.
At the same time, educators are leaving the profession at an alarming rate. This isn’t only unjust; it’s a policy failure that’s limiting student success and destabilizing the teaching profession.
Special education makes the consequence of this failure especially clear. In Hartford alone, 31% of teacher vacancies are in special education, even though those roles account for just 15% of the workforce.
Disproportionate vacancies in Hartford’s special education programs aren’t a coincidence; they are mirrored statewide. These roles demand specific training, dedicated support services, and additional resources. Districts can’t keep up if the state doesn’t fully fund those needs. These aren’t isolated gaps but instead symptoms of a broader crisis playing out across the state.
The staffing crisis is also driving educators out of the profession altogether. A 2025 national survey found that only 16% of educators would recommend the profession -–a clear sign of the burnout and frustration that comes with being asked to do more with less. Connecticut’s latest NAEP scores in math and literacy also showed no improvement, reflecting the academic toll of underinvestment and high teacher turnover.
And now, the threats are escalating. The Trump Administration is pulling back remaining pandemic relief funds that districts had already budgeted for -–and they’re even threatening to withhold Title 1 dollars from states that don’t comply with their stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion.  Districts like Hartford, New Haven, and Bridgeport are already struggling to keep enough teachers and support staff. As the impact of federal rollbacks looms, unless Connecticut takes immediate action, more layoffs will follow, and students will bear the consequences.
Fortunately, Connecticut is already taking action. Recently introduced bills like SB 1511: (An Act Concerning Disconnected Youth) and HB 7167 (An Act Concerning Education Funding), are promising proposals for upcoming budget negotiations, but not nearly enough.  
 To see success, we need to make massive permanent funding changes statewide. The baseline funding amount in Connecticut has not changed in nearly a decade, even with increased inflation. Connecticut needs a long-term, student-centered funding model that goes beyond temporary fixes and directs resources where they’re needed most. That includes a dedicated weight in the funding formula for special education and a commitment to ensuring that all public schools -–not just some– have access to these resources.  
 Gov. Ned Lamont has pointed to the state’s rainy day fund as a sign of fiscal health. But for students and teachers, that rainy day is here. Lawmakers must act now to design a funding system that truly delivers for individual students. Every child deserves a classroom led by a qualified teacher who is equipped with the resources to thrive. It’s time to invest in the education system tailored to the students -–and teachers— it serves.

The limited list of services PPSNE offers to low-income women was constantly repeated. Every press report repeated PPSNE’s claims, almost verbatim, without challenging any of the facts given. When Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz kept thanking her “media partners” one later realized she met that literally. The news coverage of its message was excellent. Unfortunately, not covered was the real story.
The freezing of $1.8 million should have no impact on PPSNE’s ability to provide services covered by Title X. PPSNE’s extremely strong financial position, and the generosity of our state leaders over the last 12 months, would easily allow it to continue these services to low-income women.  But that reality does not play as well in trying to protect its bottom line and attacking the Trump Administration.
Unknown to many, and never mentioned in the press, is the fact that PPSNE had an endowment fund, outside of its operating budget, totaling $47 million at the end of its 2022-2023 fiscal year, based on its most recent publicly available 990 filing with the IRS. The filing also revealed that 95.76% of this fund is unrestricted and can be used for client services. This endowment fund grew dramatically when PPSNE transferred $20 million from its operating budget into its endowment fund during the 2023 fiscal year.
The wealth of PPSNE is also reflected in the large pay increase given to its officers. The PPSNE 990 filings also reveal that between 2022 and 2023, the CEO of PPSNE received a wage increase of $41,823, and the Chief Equity and Learning Officer received an increase of $38,321. Organizations facing financial hardship do not give out raises of this size.
Despite its large endowment fund, PPSNE and its advocates have convinced the controlling Democratic political leadership that they are in need of more state funding. Over the last 12 months the legislature and governor has approved over $6.3 million in additional funds to PPSNE:

$3 million in leftover American Rescue Plan Act funds, which were allocated in the 2024 budget adopted by the legislature, and to be used for general operating expenses,
$500,000 increase in the federal Social Services Block Grant allocation made in January 2025,
$800,000 in the emergency budget passed at the beginning of the 2025 legislative session. PPSNE stated it will use some of the funds to stockpile abortion pills, but there was no such limitation of use mentioned in the budget, and
Over $2 million for the relocation of their New London facility in the bonding package authorized on April 11, 2025.

Our political leaders in the Democratic party must stop giving PPSNE most favored nonprofit status. The numbers clearly show it has the funds it needs to be a viable organization for many years to come. 
How many nonprofits failed to receive needed funding because the funds went to PPSNE? Other nonprofit agencies that provide food, mental health services, and services to the homeless, beg the state for additional funding, while taxpayer money just keeps flowing into PPSNE. Hopefully the fake claim that PPSNE will have to cut services, due to a reduction in Title X funds, will not result in another financial win for PPSNE and a fiscal loss for Connecticut taxpayers.

Click Bishop, at right, have each filed letters of intent signaling they will run for governor in 2026. (Alaska Beacon file photos)Former Republican state Sen. Click Bishop of Fairbanks and Republican Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom are running for governor.
On Monday, Bishop filed a letter of intent with the Alaska Public Offices Commission, an act that signals his readiness to begin raising money for the 2026 election. Hours later, Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom filed a similar letter of intent. 
Incumbent Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy is term-limited and unable to run for reelection in 2026. Bishop was the first person to formally launch a campaign in next year’s governor’s race.
“I got bib No. 1 coming out of the starting chute,” Bishop said. “I just hope that we can maintain that through to the election.”
Dahlstrom did not answer a call on her listed number or immediately respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. 
Dahlstrom, 67, has been Alaska’s lieutenant governor since replacing Kevin Meyer in 2022. A resident of Eagle River, she ran for Alaska’s lone U.S. House seat in 2024 but withdrew from that race after finishing third in the primary election. That decision helped consolidate Republican support behind the eventual winner, Republican Nick Begich.
Bishop, who served 11 years in the Alaska Senate, often as a member of a bipartisan coalition, declined to run for reelection in 2024. At the time, he said he was not done with public service, a comment that was widely interpreted to mean that Bishop was taking a break before running for statewide office.
“People have mentioned it over — about the last eight years, ‘Man, we think you’d make a great governor.’ And of course, your friends are going to tell you that, and they’re sincere. I don’t mean that in a flippant way. And, I got to thinking … (I’m) going to be 68 in July, and I think that if I’m going to do it, now is the time to do it,” he said.
Alaska’s next governor is likely to face immense challenges. The state’s budget is expected to be in deficit, and lawmakers are predicting that they will seek to tap the state’s main savings account next year, possibly leaving the incoming governor with few financial levers. 
The state’s public schools are performing poorly by national testing standards, its population has plateaued for more than a decade, its violent crime rate is among the worst in the nation, and it has a large problem with homelessness.
In the Senate, Bishop governed as a moderate, willing to work across party lines while representing his district.
Asked if he governs like U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, he said, “I think that’s it. I don’t get mad and take all my toys home because I don’t get my way. I mean, you have to continue to work with people. … If somebody’s wanting an incendiary bomb-thrower, I’m not that person.”
While in the Senate, he proposed a per-person tax to benefit schools and an increase in the state’s lowest-in-the-nation gas tax. Neither proposal became law. He was able to create a statewide education lottery system based around the Permanent Fund dividend. 
Monday’s filings are unusually early by historical standards. When Dunleavy applied for the 2018 governor’s race, he filed a letter of intent in July 2017. Ahead of the 2022 election, the three leading candidates all filed letters of intent in August 2021. 
The 2026 governor’s race is expected to feature a crowded field of candidates. It will be the first time since 2002 that an incumbent governor is not on the ballot.
“I don’t know — you might see a dozen (candidates),” Bishop said when asked how many people he expects to enter the race.
Under Alaska’s election system, governor and lieutenant governor candidates run together, on a single ticket. 
Bishop said he’s thought about some names for his lieutenant governor, but he isn’t ready to make a decision.
“I will not commit to anything as far as lieutenant governor at this point; we’re a long ways off, but we’ll see how it goes,” he said.
He added that a bellwether for his campaign will be his ability to raise money.
Alaska currently has no limit on the amount of money that an individual can donate to a political campaign. In the 2022 governor’s race, the top two candidates each reported raising more than $2 million. The third raised more than $1.5 million.
“I know a lot of little people and big people, but we’ll see,” he said. “We’ll give ‘er our best shot. Now we’re going to see who was serious about me running or not serious about me running.”
Bishop owns a small gold mine in Interior Alaska and when reached on Monday said he plans to spend the next week working there before fully launching his campaign. 
“We’re going to mine this summer, but we’ve got strategic events — listening sessions — over the course of the summer, but they will ramp up after freezeup,” he said.
“I’m just looking forward to seeing and meeting with the people of Alaska to hear them.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Tessa Hulls was making sandwiches in the Alaska Capitol when she learned she had won a Pulitzer Prize.
Her book, “Feeding Ghosts,” is a nonfiction graphic novel that documents three generations of women in her family, starting with her grandmother, who was a journalist at the time of the Chinese Communist Revolution.
It had already won three national awards by the time the Pulitzer announcement came on Monday, placing her among America’s top writers. She won for the category of memoir or autobiography, which is in its third year and comes with a $15,000 prize.
“I’m having a surreal day,” she said, shortly after this year’s winners were announced. “Now I’ve got to go back to making sandwiches.”
A few hours later, she had more time to talk to reporters and still appeared dazed by the news.
“It’s basically the highest award someone can get. And as somebody who spent nine years learning and working on this history, I felt a huge amount of pressure to try and get it right, because I knew that I would end up speaking for a generation that I didn’t live through and would come to be seen as an authority on these things,” she said. 
“And so making this book made me both a historian and a journalist, and so to have this recognition at this high level, that this role that I stepped into, that I guess I got it right — it means a lot as somebody who really wants to be careful with the material I’m working with.”

Hulls’ book talks about a century of Chinese history that isn’t well known in the United States, using her family’s history to tell the story. In the process, she uncovers her grandmother’s memoir, which she learns might be full of twisted information.
“It’s really about how mothers and daughters both damage and save one another,” she said.
The book explores personal trauma, and reviewers have frequently found connections to that issue in their own lives.
“I think almost everyone has a complicated relationship with their mother, so that’s who my book is for: people with complicated relationships with their mothers,” she said. “I think in my case, it was a little bit more concretely tied to specific history, but I think all of us are trying to understand our parents and why they ended up the ways that they did.”
Hulls, who was raised in Northern California, has lived an itinerant life that has included stays in all seven continents. To see the world, she follows the food, getting jobs in food service, she said. When it came to Antarctica, she followed a job opening for a chef.
For the past four months, she’s been working in the Alaska Capitol’s lounge — the building’s version of a cafeteria — serving food to legislators, staff and visitors.
When the Pulitzer winners were announced, it was lunchtime, and the lounge was full of lawmakers.
“We were just in there when she got the call. The whole lounge gave her a round of applause,” said Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham. 
Two representatives hurried downhill from the Capitol to the nearest bookstore, Alaska Robotics, which was already planning a book signing for Hulls on Tuesday.
One of the legislators grabbed a copy of “Feeding Ghosts,” then reconsidered and got three more, said the store’s owner, Pat Race.
Back at the Capitol, Hulls kept working behind the lounge’s food service counter until she finished her day.
Hulls enjoys cycling and the outdoors, so much so that she became known among friends for cycling to their weddings.
Juneau’s glum spring weather has given her plenty of time to be artistic, but she’s also looking forward to the end of the legislative session. 
“Next month, I’ve blocked out a week that just says, ‘Tessa, go be alone in the backcountry.’ So that’s what I’m doing. Like, first available opportunity,” she said.

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story by Briana Brady was first published by the Shelburne News on May 1.Shelburne Museum’s opening day is Saturday, but some of the six new exhibits the museum is hosting have been in the works for more than a year.While the museum is known for its dedication to New England history, from quilting to the massive Ticonderoga steamboat, the new exhibitions each year draw in contemporary art that often stands in conversation with its more historical collection, according to Leslie Wright, the museum’s communication director.“That’s what Electra Havermeyer Webb, the museum founder, was doing when she passed away in 1960,” Wright said. “She was starting to look at modern art, and she had a shopping list and she was definitely looking to connect the past and the present. And we continue that. It keeps us relevant.”This year, the six new exhibitions run the gamut as far as medium and subject. The museum lawn is dotted by Karen Petersen’s large bronze horse statues, their rounded shapes and thick necks echoing the lines of cave drawings. The museum is also hosting an exhibit of Higher Ground gig posters throughout the years, a series of fiber and textile animal sculptures from Dahlov Ipcar, a series of Mara Superior’s porcelain creations, and a textile and sound exhibition focused on Indigenous artists.A rearing horse at Shelburne Museum stands in the middle of other sculptures on the lawn. Photo by Briana Brady/Shelburne NewsThe contemporary exhibit with the most direct link to the museum’s collection, however, might be the series of cyanotype photographs by David Sokosh. The blue-and-white photographs Sokosh developed using one of photography’s oldest methods feature the museum’s collection as their subject.“I’ve been always interested in technology, technological objects, outdated technologies, typography and strange juxtapositions of different objects, either showing an object in a way that’s surprising or different, or showing it in a way that separates it from what it what it was used for,” Sokosh said.Sokosh said he often visited the museum as a child. Now, he credits the collection as having been part of what spurred his interest in objects and old technology. A few years ago, he reached out to the museum, asking if he could photograph pieces from its collection for a personal project.After he visited and started taking photographs, a curator from the museum, Carolyn Bauer, approached Sokosh and asked if he’d be interested in putting together an entire exhibit.It took Sokosh months to shoot and put together the exhibit. Not only does he have photographs, but he also put together a cyanoanimation, a term he says he didn’t coin but is uncommon. After shooting on his iPhone, Sokosh split the digital movie into traditional frames — 12 per second — printed negatives and developed them using traditional cyanotype processes, using ultraviolet rays to create the blue and white images. Sokosh estimates there are well over 6,000 frames in the 9-minute film.A mermaid weather vane eclipses the moon in David Sokosh’s cyanotype photograph. Courtesy photo via the Shelburne NewsIn using such an old form of photography — cyanotype was first developed in 1842, only a few years after the advent of photography in general — and focusing on historical objects as his subjects, Sokosh creates that conversation between past and present that Wright said Shelburne Museum seeks out in its contemporary exhibits.“I don’t think that people would necessarily mistake them for an image made in 1850 or 1900,” Sokosh said. “To me, they don’t look particularly old fashioned. They have a contemporary, kind of abstract, mysterious quality that wouldn’t necessarily remind you of something earlier.”The progression of the exhibit moves through in a way that highlights this contemporary composition. Sokosh said that, throughout the exhibit, the photographs become increasingly abstract, often utilizing composite images or duplicating things to create a new image. However, it never loses site of the past.Sokosh took some of his more geometric photos, such as a grid of bottles, and created a quilt out of fabric panels with the photos printed on them. With the museum’s own quilt collection nearby, the piece becomes almost a collection of a collection of a collection.READ MORE

The other new exhibits this year often do this same kind of echoing. Superior’s porcelain creations often take the shape of plates, putting a contemporary artistic creation in the form of a centuries-old trade. The animal sculptures made by Ipcar look almost quilted themselves. The bronze horses stand in front of a replica of a historic barn. Even the Higher Ground gig posters, while seemingly the most starkly contemporary pieces, are still pieces of local history and the community’s connection to music.Wright said the museum has a host of programming, from connections to children’s literature to ink print workshops to the museum’s summer concert series on the lawn planned for the season.

Wes Moore (D) to veto four bills that would increase state fees on various licenses, permits and other filings.","A Maryland state flag flies outside the State House in Annapolis. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)House Republicans on Monday called on Gov. Wes Moore (D) to veto four bills that would increase state fees on various licenses, permits and other filings.
The letter from the 39-member House Republican Caucus was released a day before Moore was scheduled to hold his third post-legislative bill signing of the 2025 session.
“On numerous occasions, you have indicated your concerns about the impact federal actions can have on Maryland families and businesses,” the caucus wrote in its letter to Moore. “We would respectfully submit that the hundreds of new or increased taxes and fees Maryland’s families and businesses have had to absorb over the last several years have had a more significant and immediate impact on every Marylander.”
None of the bills objected to in the letter are among the 193 set to be signed during a noon ceremony Tuesday. Moore has until May 27 to decide to sign, veto or allow bills to become law without his signature.
“As Gov. Moore reviews the hundreds of bills put forward this session, he will continue to work with the state legislature, local leaders, and all partners involved to ensure that we are signing legislation that will make Maryland safer, more affordable, more competitive, and the state that serves,”  a Moore spokesperson said in an email.
Included on the Republican list are four bills: Senate Bills 250 and 425, which increase Maryland Department of Environment fees, and allow the state to collect fees on coal combustion byproducts from former coal plant operators, respectively; and House Bills 719 and 796, which raise boat title, license and other fees, and increase the cost to file a foreclosure action, respectively.
Some fees of the Department of the Environment fees in SB 250 have not been increased since the 1990s.
Combined, all four bills are projected to bring in tens of millions in additional revenues. Much of that money is earmarked for specific programs such as the clean air and private dam restoration funds.
The caucus, in its letter, noted a budget containing “numerous taxes and fees, representing the largest tax increase in ” state history in addition to the fees contained in the four bills.
The budget passed this year by the General Assembly includes roughly $1.6 billion in tax and fee increases. That package includes a new 3% sales tax on data and IT services.

The budget proposed from the White House on May 2, proposes more than $900 million in cuts to National Parks. (Photo from the National Park Service)Billions in proposed curtailment of federal conservation projects and land management programs would leave New Mexicans vulnerable to losing public lands access, worsen wildfire responses and water contamination, members of local conservation nonprofits said Monday.
The Trump Administration submitted a 46-page proposed budget to Congressional Appropriations Chair Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) on May 2, which includes reducing the budgets of the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. National Forest Service by a combined $5.1 billion.
The budget also proposes cuts to health, education and public safety budgets, prompting U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, New Mexico Democrats, to issue a joint statement on Monday describing the budget request as one that “would drive up the cost of health care, groceries, housing, and utilities; gut public school and pre-K funding; defund cancer research; weaken law enforcement’s ability to fight drug trafficking; and strip resources from wildland firefighters, farmers, Tribes, and rural communities. It also threatens our public lands — paving the way for Republicans’ massive sell-off.”
In the case of public lands, the budget proposes broad cuts — such as ones to conservation programs — but does not drill down to list specific grants, facilities or staff positions that should be eliminated.
While a proposed budget is typically an aspirational document given to Congress,“what’s distinctive in this situation with the president’s budget here is that President Trump and his administration have been arrogating power to themselves to make budget decisions,” Western Environmental Law Center Executive Director Erik Schlenker-Goodrich told Source NM, pointing to cuts and layoffs implemented by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.
“It’s the prospective implementation of this aspirational document that is a concern, given DOGE,” Schlenker-Goodrich said. “It looks less to me like aspiration and more like an intention of what they’re going to be doing relative to public lands, waters and conservation in general.”
Schlenker-Goodrich said  cutting federal land agencies’ budgets will put “heightened pressure” on state government to try to fill the gaps, and might take the “public” out of public lands.
“We may see public lands closed down, national parks access limited,” he said. “It may impact all ability to get hunting access onto public lands, to be able to go fish on public lands, to be able to just walk on public lands — all these things are at issue.”
‘A middle finger to regular Americans’
The budget claims to eliminate federal funding “committed to radical gender and climate ideologies,” according to the accompanying letter from Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, which notes that reducing species conservation would further the “deregulatory agenda.”
Mark Allison, the executive director New Mexico Wilderness Alliance, said the Trump administration sees public lands as a profit-venture, including increasing large-scale logging and undermining environmental protections.
“These are his priorities, this is his vision and I think it’s a middle finger to regular Americans,” Allison, told Source NM. “It’s a fundamental uprooting of the park system, national monuments and how we care for our lands and waters.”
The proposed budget recommends cuts of $900 million to National Parks, claiming that many “receive small numbers of mostly local visitors” and should instead be managed by states. National Parks received 331 million visits in 2024, breaking the record for most visits set in 2016. The budget also proposes a $198 million reduction of Bureau of Land Management conservation programs, writing it will undo “excessive” protections from “development, recreation, grazing, hunting, mining, etc.”
The budget would further cut $73 million worth of construction of facilities at national parks and$170 million of U.S. Fish and Wildlife grants to local, federal and tribal communities.
Allison noted Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s April 17 order ceding authority to his senior advisor on policy, Tyler Hassen, who previously worked at DOGE. Hassen will oversee the “consolidation, unification and optimization” of Interior bureaus, including the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management.
“We would have a DOGE guy with zero experience, you know, with wildlife, wildfire, recovery assessment, protection, general firefighting — responsible for all that,” he said. “It’s dystopian.”
Allison said New Mexicans already experience impacts from climate change, including worsening fires, less land for cattle, and shrinking water resources.
“You can call it whatever, but it is getting hotter, it is getting drier, there’s less snowpack, and we have to figure out how to live with this,” Allison said. “Cutting all of these agencies that help with land management and climate resilience is exactly the wrong direction, we need to be doubling down our investments there.”
The proposed cuts would also impact more than $1 billion in U.S. Environmental Protection “categorical grants,” according to Rachel Conn, the deputy director of Taos-based water conservation nonprofit Amigos Bravos.
“Those are very much tied to public health, helping state employees on the ground monitor for water quality in our state’s river streams, lakes, reservoirs,” Conn told Source NM. “They help to understand if it’s safe to swim in these waters, if it’s safe to eat the fish that are coming out of our waters.”
If the federal program is cut entirely, it removes financial incentives for states to apply matching dollars, Conn said, and would mean water quality would suffer while states take the time to build up funding to run their own programs.
“It’s like yanking everything all out at once, you’re going to have programs across the nation that will collapse,” she said.

State Republicans used the meeting in Cody to elect new leadership. But an ongoing conflict over an election in Hot Springs County also flared up.
The post As Wyoming GOP gathers, old disputes resurface appeared first on WyoFile .","CODY—Joe Martinez and Phillip Scheel sat in the back row of the Cody Auditorium, apart from the action that unfolded Saturday as the Wyoming Republican Party elected new leadership. 
It was a beautiful spring morning, but the two Thermopolis men had driven over that morning to spend the day inside, watching the party conduct its business. 
Martinez and Scheel watched the roll call. All 74 state central committee members — each county GOP’s chair, committeeman and committeewoman — were either present or represented by a proxy voter. Those members sat at the front of the room at tables designated by county. 
The two men listened to remarks by Republican elected officials praising the Trump administration, and emotional farewell speeches from party stalwarts preparing to leave the organization’s top posts. They watched as party treasurer Bob Ferguson presented outgoing Chairman Frank Eathorne with a deluxe lever-action rifle, engraved with his name on one side, the mantra “ride for the brand” on the other. 
They watched the party unanimously reelect Secretary Donna Rice, who ran unopposed. They watched an election snafu resulting from miscounted ballots, which was resolved with a revote for vice chair. Ferguson won that race over Ginger Bennett. 
And they watched as the party voted to elect Bryan Miller over Rebecca Bextel to replace Eathorne as chairman. Both candidates align with the further-right block of the party that gained traction under Eathorne, so the election was seen as unlikely to impact policy.

Martinez and Scheel also watched as their Republican peers voted to sideline them. 
In March, the Hot Springs County GOP elected Martinez and Scheel its chairman and state committeeman respectively. But the validity of the election was quickly called into question when a complaint was filed with the state party, alleging that ousted precinct committee members had a right to vote due to a party bylaw. Soon after, Martinez and Scheel’s victories were overturned. 
The two men then filed a lawsuit, alongside the county’s new vice chair and secretary, alleging the state party interfered in their local elections. 
Martinez and Scheel both appeared Saturday to reiterate that point. When the meeting opened for public comment, Martinez stood up from his chair to speak. 
“I’m here because on March 17, our county did elections and they did it by law. And I just believe that we as a body are to follow the law. And we should be the ones up there representing Hot Springs County, myself and Phillip Scheel as state committeeman,” Martinez said. 
The party considered allowing Martinez and Scheel to cast provisional ballots, but the proposal failed in a voice vote. 
The dispute represents the latest development in a years-long debate over the extent to which the state should govern political parties — private organizations that sometimes make decisions with public implications. Eathorne expressed optimism at Saturday’s meeting that the court would treat the Hot Springs County complaint as a First Amendment issue. 
“As this litigation goes forward, this case will be about the government’s authority or not, over a private organization,” Eathorne said. 
“This can be an exciting outcome for all of us,” he said. 
How did we get here?
In March, an attorney for the Wyoming Republican Party advised several county parties to disregard state statute and a Wyoming Supreme Court ruling when considering who should be allowed to vote in local party elections. 
Instead, the attorney advised county Republicans to follow a contested party bylaw since the matter involves a private organization. 
“I understand some have alleged county officers who are no longer precinct persons may not vote in your upcoming elections,” attorney Brian Shuck wrote in a letter. “They argue that, if there is conflict between a GOP bylaw and a state statute, the statute controls. I disagree.” 
Shuck’s advice was centered on the fact that the dispute involves a private organization, which was also at the heart of a 2021 case in Uinta County. 
In that case, the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled that the bylaw “violated clear and unambiguous language” of state law. But because the high court did not decide whether the state law violated the party’s constitutional right to freedom of association, Shuck told county parties the bylaw — and ultimately, the U.S. Constitution — supplants state statute. 
However, Hot Springs County instead stuck to the law and the high court’s decision when it held officer elections. But sometime after the meeting was adjourned, Cheryl Aguiar filed a complaint with the state party. 
Aguiar, former chairman of the Hot Springs County GOP and now a state committeewoman, disputed the validity of the county party’s elections and asked that the “provisional ballots” be counted. 
The Wyoming Republican Party’s Dispute Resolution Committee sided with Aguiar. A revote including the provisional ballots followed in Hot Springs County, resulting in a new chair, Brady Harvey, and a new state committeeman, Russell Lewis.

Saturday’s meeting 
It was Harvey and Lewis who cast votes in Saturday’s leadership election in Cody, but not before some pushback. During roll call, former Sweetwater County GOP Chairman Elizabeth Bingham raised a point of order. 
“I move that the state central committee not accept the officers from Hot Springs County who were elected in the second, unauthorized election due to the improper use of provisional ballots and the lack of proper authority to conduct a revote,” Bingham said. 
After the motion failed, Bingham made a second attempt by proposing an amendment to the rules of procedure for its officer elections. More specifically, the amendment would have allowed Martinez, Scheel and Aguiar to cast provisional ballots, which would have been set aside and kept private until the ongoing litigation is resolved. 
While the amendment was drafted by Shuck, Bingham said she supported it as a placeholder. 
“I’m not trying to be difficult. I promise, guys, I truly do believe we will not prevail in this lawsuit. I just want us to have that protection,” Bingham said. “It really is simple.”
Aguiar pushed back on having any provisional ballots after supporting their use at the local level. 
“The fact that there is a lawsuit out there that will intimidate this body to circumvent our bylaws and my right to vote on a secret ballot is disgusting,” she said.

While the amendment didn’t fix the larger issue, Sublette County Chairman and former Speaker of the House Albert Sommers stood in favor of its adoption. 
“The problem is that we are choosing to violate the state law. Any private organization, if they violate state law, runs up against the law,” Sommers said. “And so I’m going to stand in favor of this amendment and really against violating state law.”
Goshen County GOP Chairman Kirk Haas disagreed. 
“We’re magnifying the issues that have developed in Hot Springs County,” Haas said.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A federal judge has temporarily halted the removal of a Venezuelan barber detained in Central Falls as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) seeks to completely block the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.
Rhode Island U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose on Monday ordered federal authorities to give the court 48 hours notice before moving the man, referred to as “G.M.G.” in court documents, out of the state.
The national ACLU and its Rhode Island chapter filed an emergency lawsuit to try to stop the Trump Administration and Wyatt Detention Facility from sending G.M.G. to El Salvador.
The Alien Enemies Act has only been used during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. President Donald Trump invoked the 18th century law in March in order to remove Venezuelans suspected of being in the transnational criminal organization Tren de Aragua.
ACLU of Rhode Island Executive Director Steven Brown did not immediately return a request for comment.
The lawsuit states G.M.G. entered the country with his fiancée and her son in 2023 after he was repeatedly detained and threatened by police in Venezuela due to “his perceived political opposition.” He has had a pending application for asylum since August 2024 and was scheduled for an immigration court hearing in Massachusetts on May 15.
G.M.G. was working in Rhode Island as a barber, according to court documents.
Despite his asylum claim, G.M.G was arrested and detained while he was at work on March 26, and has been held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls ever since, according to the lawsuit.
Attorneys claim he was wrongly detained by ICE for being associated with Tren de Aragua because of his tattoos. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security submitted to an immigration court an I-213 form that stated G.M.G. had no known criminal history, according to the ACLU’s lawsuit.
“His tattoos are for personal reasons, and he himself fears persecution by the TdA based on his experiences in Venezuela,” the lawsuit claims.
But federal officials remain adamant that he is a criminal and must be removed.
“The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law to our immigration system,” a senior Department of Homeland Security official said in a statement Monday. “No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that. We have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.”
Because of federal officials’ claims, the ACLU claims G.M.G. is at grave risk of being deported to El Salvador.
The ACLU’s lawsuit claims that ICE’s checklist on who constitutes an “alien enemy” relies on “several dubious criteria” including tattoos, hand gestures, graffiti and what certain people wear. 
Attorneys also argue that Trump’s proclamation provides no way for those accused of being gang members to contest the government’s claims and that the administration’s use of a wartime law should be invalid because the U.S. did not declare war with Venezuela.
“Tren de Aragua, a criminal organization, is not a nation or foreign government and is not part of the Venezuelan government,” the lawsuit states. “And neither Venezuela nor Tren de Aragua have invaded or threatened to invade the United States.”
The national ACLU has already convinced federal judges in New York and Texas to halt such removals under the Alien Enemies Act. Those rulings came after the U.S. Supreme Court permitted Trump to deport suspected gang members of Tren de Aragua, though the nation’s highest court agreed that those removed needed to have due process and a hearing to challenge their removal.
The ACLU has also filed a temporary restraining order to further halt removal as the Rhode Island lawsuit proceeds. DuBose will hold an online hearing on the matter Wednesday, May 7.

Bill Lee, pictured March 20, 2025, issued his first veto in his six-plus years in office on May 5, 2025. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee issued the first veto of his six-plus years Monday against a measure that would have expanded authority of the state Probation and Parole Board.
Lee sent a veto letter to the speakers of the House and Senate saying he is returning SB455/HB527 because the new bill would be a “step backwards” from the advances of the Reentry Success Act of 2021.
That measure passed overwhelmingly with a single no vote “because we all know we cannot tackle crime without tackling recidivism. Together we recognized that the vast majority of offenders will return to our communities, and their successful reentry impacts the safety of every neighborhood for the better,” Lee said.
The governor said two years after the Reentry Success Act passed, the state recorded its lowest recidivism rate in history, the rate for which convicts return to prison, “meaning fewer crimes and fewer victims.” Lee added he is “confident” the board and other “safeguards” can make sure parole is “awarded appropriately.”
Current statute allows the parole board — which is appointed by the governor — to deny parole based solely on the seriousness of the offense for 22 violent felonies. The bill seeks to broaden that authority beyond those crimes.

Republican Rep. Rick Scarbrough of Oak Ridge and Republican Sen. Paul Rose of Covington passed the bill with little debate along party lines, 75-16 in the House and 22-4 in the Senate.
Scarbrough, former police chief of Clinton in East Tennessee, issued a statement saying he had dedicated his career to protecting his community and in January 2026 would work to override the veto, which takes a simple majority of the House and Senate. 
“While I have deep respect for Gov. Lee, I am both surprised and disappointed by his decision to veto this bill,” Scarbrough said. “This legislation addresses critical gaps in our parole system while strengthening public safety and confidence, ensuring that serious offenses aren’t minimized.”
The law currently allows the parole board’s finding to be the sole basis for denial for offenses including murder, voluntary manslaughter, vehicular homicide, kidnapping, human trafficking, especially aggravated robbery, rape of a child and sexual battery.
The bill increases the number of offenses for which the board would be able to revoke parole and probation, including aggravated assault resulting in death, fentanyl delivering resulting in death or injury, reckless homicide, carjacking, aggravated robbery, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on a first responder, reckless endangerment and several other offenses such as money laundering, financial exploitation of a vulnerable adult, terrorism offenses, abuse of a corpse and official misconduct/oppression.
In a March Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, Rose said the bill allows the parole board to have “more discretion in granting or denying parole” in situations where “releasing the inmate might erode public confidence in the legal system and signal that certain crimes aren’t taken seriously.”
The bill gained  support from the Tennessee District Attorney General Conference.
“The parole board should be given the greatest discretion to determine which among those inmates deserve to be kept from among us, and those which can be released back into society,” Executive Director Stephen Crump said at the hearing.

In a 68-page ruling, Myers said the state Board of Elections should certify the election results based on the tally of all eligible votes in November, which means Democratic incumbent Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs would prevail in the race for the seat on the high court over Griffin. Her 734-vote lead over Griffin was affirmed by two recounts.

In the long-running dispute over voter eligibility, Griffin was seeking to throw out more than 60,000 votes covering three categories of voters.
The state Supreme Court majority said most of those votes should be counted, but ruled that military and overseas absentee voters should have had to show photo ID. The few hundred votes from people who said they had never lived in North Carolina but were connected to the state through their parents should not be counted, the court majority ruled.
The state Board of Elections did not require military and overseas absentee voters provide ID. Griffin had challenged military and overseas absentee votes from a handful of Democratic counties.
The state had counted votes from what Griffin called “never residents” for years without controversy. A reporter writing for The Assembly found that some of the “never residents” on Griffin’s list live in the state. Griffin did not want the state Board of Elections to give those voters a chance prove their residency before their votes were thrown out.
Myers ruled that election rules cannot be changed after the fact.
“[T]his case concerns whether the federal Constitution permits a state to alter the rules of an election after the fact and apply those changes retroactively to only a select group of voters, and in so doing treat those voters differently than other similarly situated individuals. This case is also about whether a state may redefine its class of eligible voters but offer no process to those who may have been misclassified as ineligible.
“To this court, the answer to each of those questions is ‘no.”

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)In the final hours of Montana’s 2025 Legislative session, a long, drawn-out war over whether to allow the state’s highest elected judges to run with partisan affiliation had its final battle. 
Judicial reform was a stated priority for the GOP-dominated Legislature this session, an idea backed by Gov. Greg Gianforte. In particular, he sought to have state Supreme Court justices elected on a partisan basis, instead of the current, nonpartisan elections.
Many Republicans said a party affiliation would offer voters transparency to better understand the candidates on the ballot, while opponents of the idea said politicizing the court system would lead hurt a justice’s impartiality. 
Even recently elected Montana Supreme Court Chief Justice Cory Swanson, a more conservative member of the state’s highest bench, warned lawmakers against making the judiciary partisan.

 Lawmakers seemed to take Swanson’s words to heart, killing a half-dozen bills that proposed different ways to bring about the partisan change to the judiciary branch. But during the last two weeks of the session, Gianforte remained optimistic, telling the press repeatedly that there was “still time.”
On the morning of April 30, the last day of the session, during a round of votes on a few final pieces of legislation, House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, received a text. And then another. 
The governor’s office, a lobbyist told her, was planning to attach an amendment to House Bill 710, a bill titled “Generally Revise Laws Related to the Judiciary,” that would have made Supreme Court races partisan. 
The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment on this story. However, in Montana, a governor can make a suggestion to a bill with an amendatory veto, meaning it’s a suggestion until it’s approved by the state House and Senate.
Sullivan said she never saw the specific amendment — though a previously published gubernatorial amendment to another bill would have allowed Supreme Court candidates run with a partisan affiliation — but she confirmed the governor’s office was working on a similar amendment.
The amendatory veto would have dropped the drastic and much debated issue in the closing moments of a long Legislature that had been in session nearly constantly since Jan. 2.

And she wasn’t going to have it.
“I was going to leave,” she told the Daily Montanan.
Using her own legislative power, Sullivan sent word back that if the governor proposed the change, she was ready to stand up and make the motion to sine die, adjourning the Legislature on the spot. If the Legislature adjourned right then and there, it would have ended the process of reforming the judiciary – and halted several other key bills Republicans supported.
One of the few bills left for the chamber to vote on included final approval of one of the major property tax bills, which gave Sullivan additional leverage in her threat to leave. With 42 Democrats, she only needed nine Republicans who wanted to end the session, and 39 had opposed the property tax bill. She could tank that bill to keep partisan elections at bay. 
There still would have been a property tax relief bill — another one had already passed — but the bills were linked and Sullivan said it would have created difficulties in the implementation. 
It was the “last thing I wanted to do,” she told the Daily Montanan. But “something as explosive as that issue was all session… why do it in a governor’s amendment at the end unless you’re trying to play games and cause chaos?”
Ultimately, through discussions with other legislators including Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, the architect behind the property tax bill and close legislative ally of Gianforte, the governor’s amendment never materialized. 
The Legislature adjourned hours later, and in 2026, an open seat for the Montana Supreme Court will be decided in a nonpartisan election — even though some politicians question that. 
“We have nonpartisan races in Montana in name only,” Gianforte said during an April 17 press conference. “We should call a spade a spade, and attribute them to the party from which they come.”
The last-minute attempt to implement changes to the judicial system was “super irritating” to Sullivan. 
“How many times do we have to vote on the same bill?” she said. “It was a fitting end for a session of playing whack-a-mole with partisan judges and it was my last whack-a-mole moment that was about to come in at the last minute.”

During the interim, the Senate Special Select Committee on Judicial Oversight and Reform requested nearly 30 bill drafts related to changing the judicial branch, including one, Senate Bill 42, which would have required judges at every level to run with partisan affiliation. 
During the session’s 85 days, an additional four bills hit the floor with various versions of partisan elections, along with adjacent bills allowing political parties to fund judicial candidates and allow candidates to take part in political events.
But among the 150 lawmakers, the appetite for injecting additional politics into the court system wasn’t there — at least not for a majority of legislators. 
Lawmakers voted against all five bills directly changing how judges are elected — some voted down in the House, others by the Senate. 
In fact, from the original 27 bills that came from the interim committee, only a handful were sent to the governor’s desk.

“I’ll say this, what we do have is a great foundation for reform,” Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, who served on the committee, told reporters after the session adjourned. “I think that judicial reform is critical, continuously. It’s important for our judges to have accountability. It’s important for preventative transparency, and what we did this session helps start that process.”
Among the bills that passed was Senate Bill 40, which requires that any closed meetings involving judicial deliberations be recorded and made public once a case is finalized; Senate Bill 41, which ensures that when a district court judge is substituted from a case, the process for replacing them is randomized; and Senate Bill 45, which establishes a judicial performance commission that will evaluate justices and give the public more insight into their effectiveness. 
“You all know, when it comes to voting for judges, it is very difficult to know who they are, what their track record is, and how they rule on the bench. This bill will give greater transparency to that,” McGillvray said. 
Another win for the GOP majority was passage of House Bill 39, which allows political parties to donate to judicial candidates, offering at least a little bit of partisanship into elections.
“I think we had a good session on judicial reform,” McGillvray said. “We’re undaunted in our efforts to continue that, and we will do so next session.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-05-05 20:03:37.693854

The legal counsel cited in the suit were unable to comment on the record, citing ongoing litigation.It’s likely that the two suits could be consolidated, explained Pat Parentau, an emeritus professor at Vermont Law School’s Environmental Law Center, since they rely on such closely aligned arguments. The Department of Justice also argues that the state law clashes with the federal government’s power over foreign affairs, an argument unique to its case.Both suits draw on arguments that the federal Clean Air Act preempts the state law and the federal government’s role in regulating commerce among states.READ MORE





 


Vermont set to become first state in the nation to ‘make big oil pay’ 

by Emma Cotton 
May 30, 2024, 8:18 pmMay 30, 2024, 8:18 pm 



But that argument misses the point of what the law actually addresses, Iarrapino said. “The crux of the fight comes down to how you characterize this law,” he said. “Vermont’s legislators have been very clear about the purpose of this law from the very beginning. States who are joining the fossil fuel industry’s lawsuit are saying this is something very different. They’re trying to mischaracterize this law about controlling emissions going forward, and that’s not correct.”The climate superfund, which became state law last year, places a retroactive, one-time fee on fossil fuel companies in accordance with their role in climate-driven damages, like floods or heat waves, experienced between 1995 and the end of 2024. The federal Clean Air Act attends to future emissions and air pollution.In their challenge, the attorneys general argue that those “self-described retroactive fines on traditional energy producers for their purported past contributions to greenhouse-gas emissions, […] were lawful operations endorsed and even promoted by both federal and State authorities.”Here, the case becomes “head spinning in the contradiction and hypocrisy,” Iarrapino said. The attorneys general argue that the “Clean Air Act gives the federal government the chief role in determining interstate emissions standards” — meaning federal policy preempts any state laws on emissions standards.Yet, this suit is helmed by the same state that argued in a precedent-setting case for a significant limit in the scope of the Clean Air Act. In West Virginia v. EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the federal law does not give the Environmental Protection Agency the ability to regulate sector-wide greenhouse gas emissions.“Now (West Virginia is) turning around and saying that the state of Vermont has no room to regulate greenhouse gas emissions,” Iarrapino said.He also questioned the plaintiffs’ claim that the law will raise prices on consumers of fossil fuels, in other states, citing research by economics professors at New York University’s Institute for Policy Integrity which outlined that oil companies are unable to pass on one-time fixed payments for past actions to consumers, leaving prices instead subject to production levels and economic competition.  “These are just shameless arguments,” Parentau said of both West Virginia’s and the Department of Justice’s involvement. EPA Director Lee Zeldin announced he intends to repeal the clause of the Clean Air Act that includes greenhouse gases, and the federal government has withdrawn the U.S. from the international Paris agreement to limit carbon emissions. “So how can you, with a straight face, say this is interfering with international relations?” Parentau asked.The federal government’s filing of its own case is surreal to Parentau, who has been working in environmental law for nearly 50 years.  “Normally, what you would see is the state passes the law to impose costs on an industry, and the industry resists, and that’s it. So it’s two parties. But this has the feel of a Netflix movie,” he said. “I just have never seen anything quite like this.”One claim the suits make that does hold merit, Parentau added, is what he called the “pot calling the kettle black argument.”The suit notes that Vermont has high fossil fuel consumption and is seeking to offset that outside of itself: “Vermont seeks to have its cake and eat it too, by both reaping the benefits of affordable and reliable fuel, yet penalizing the entities that help produce such fuel billions of dollars for their trouble,” the attorneys general write in the suit. “Vermont has something to answer to,” Parentau said. “The state is having a hard time implementing its Global Warming Solutions Act, whether it’s already off track or not, it certainly isn’t in any shape to achieve those goals. So don’t get so up-high on your high horse, Vermont.”The additional plaintiffs and the Department of Justice’s suit come as the state Agency of Natural Resources and Office of the State Treasurer, both of which are tasked with implementing the law, are in the middle of asking the Legislature for additional cash to hire top-of-the-field climate scientists to complete the damage assessments. That scientist should be prepared to testify in court, representatives from the offices added in April testimony to the Senate Natural Resources Committee. The Agency of Natural Resources also hopes to allocate additional funds to hire an attorney who can navigate the lawsuits. The real impact of these additional plaintiffs and the Department of Justice suit will have on the state is one of scale, Parentau said. “Now they’re going to have teams of lawyers – there are 24 state attorneys general offices, and then you have the Department of Justice. The point is, there’s just no end to the number of lawyers creating mischief.” This is the consequence of the state being the first in the country to pass such legislation, Parentau said. “My grandfather, an old Irish farmer, had a great expression. He said, Patrick, just remember, the higher you climb on the flagpole, the more people can see your arse,” he said.The Agency of Natural Resources, whose secretary Julie Moore and Climate Action Office director Jane Lazorchak are specifically named as defendants in this case, referred VTDigger to the state Attorney General’s Office for comment.Read the story on VTDigger here:  West Virginia and 23 other states join lawsuit targeting Vermont’s Climate Superfund Law.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/big-oil-pay-2-20240116.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 20:03:37.693854

(Photo courtesy of Oregon Department of Transportation/Flickr)If the once-every-500-year Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake doesn’t do enough damage to the coastal Northwest on its own, frequent and widespread flooding from rising seas that follows will take care of the rest, new research found.
Oregon, Washington and California are overdue for the recurring seismic event — popularly referred to as “The Big One” — which last occurred in 1700 and could cause Northwest coastlines to lower and retreat by more than 6 feet as land erodes into the sea.
Coupled with rising seas from climate change, many more coastal communities, such as Seaside, Oregon and Aberdeen, Washington, will essentially be on top of newly created floodplains and tidal zones amid rising waters.
The findings from researchers at Virginia Tech, the University of North Carolina, the University of Oregon and scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey were published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They found that if The Big One were to occur in 2100, when waters along the Pacific coastline might be three feet higher than today as global ice sheets melt, it’s likely 6.6 feet of Northwest coast would subside into the sea.
That means more than 17,000 people in the region would soon be living on top of expanded coastal flood plains, double the number currently living in such flood zones today.
Researchers’ modeling shows that triple the number of structures, such as hospitals, airports and water and electricity plants, as well as roads, would be exposed to frequent flooding in the aftermath as are today, and could remain that way for centuries.
“One of the best ways to think about it is that you could have a coastal forest or a salt marsh that you’re walking your dog along, and then this earthquake happens, and that land, physically, almost instantaneously, in a few minutes, subsides, potentially half a meter to almost 2 meters,” said Andrea Hawkes, a professor of earth and ocean sciences at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington who worked on the study.
“All the sudden, instead of standing on dry land, you are now in the tidal zone.”
 Mega earthquakes

It’s not just a hypothetical. The study mentions several historical earthquakes that led to fundamental changes in coastal landscapes and the loss or relocation of whole towns.
The Great Chilean Earthquake of 1960 — the biggest ever recorded at a magnitude of 9.5 — caused more than 8 feet of coastal land in some parts of the country to slide into the sea, submerging pine forests and farms underwater and turning them into tidal marshes.
The Great Alaska earthquake in 1964 lowered coastal areas by more than 6 feet, the researchers wrote. In the aftermath, some communities had to relocate to higher ground because of increased tidal flooding. Similar coastal earthquakes in Sumatra and Japan in more recent history have also led to land loss and migration.
The Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake could reach a magnitude similar to that of the Great Chilean Earthquake, between 8.0 and 9.0, according to seismologists.
Hawkes said the point of the study is to improve preparation and planning in the coastal Northwest, not panic.
“The earthquake is kind of something you can’t really do anything about, right? It’s gonna happen,” she said. “But as you plan where you build in the coastal zone, something to keep in mind is that the sea level is continuing to rise, and that when you have these events, they will cause land farther upland to subside.”
She said there are communities along the coast that are already planning on moving or building critical infrastructure further inland because of projected sea level rise. The study Hawkes was part of, she said, can help them go further, by considering the impacts of The Big One.
“A lot of places are doing really good work in terms of moving schools, hospitals, community centers, to higher places, or, they’re really thinking about it,” she said. “It would be a shame if you missed it by X meters because you didn’t think about this other thing that’s coming.”

Oh, what a difference 20 years has made in how Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association views energy. An organization that in 2005 wanted to build a giant new coal plant now sees a future almost entirely devoid of coal. It expects to be at 70% renewables by 2030.
Perhaps Tri-State failed to get the executive order from President Donald Trump, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful, Clean Coal Industry.” It’s an echo of the past. During a campaign stop in Grand Junction, Trump in 2016 promised to bring it back. It was an empty promise. Prices of, first, wind and then solar had slid downhill on trajectories steeper than Interstate 70 descending from the Eisenhower Tunnel. Reduced emissions were a bonus argument for renewables.
In an April 11 filing with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, Tri-State proposes adding 700 megawatts of new renewable resources, the majority on the windy, sun-drenched and sparsely populated plains of eastern Colorado, and also 650 megawatts of short-term battery storage.
“That’s a lot of steel in the ground,” said a member of an electrical cooperative on the Western Slope.

Natural gas is also part of the mix. Tri-State proposes a 307-megawatt plant somewhere near Craig. There, in little more than three years, it will close all three coal-fired power units it now operates. It also proposes to replace five aging combustion turbines near Fort Lupton at the J.M. Shafer Generating Station, boosting capacity modestly to 281 megawatts.
This proposal fits in with a broad theme in Colorado. More than 2,300 megawatts of new natural gas capacity is being built, has been approved, or is proposed by Colorado’s major electrical utilities. In a sense, we’re swapping coal for gas. That represents a net reduction in emissions.
Will these very expensive gas plants be stranded by new technologies during our journey to a mid-century goal of net-zero emissions? The answer is complicated. Utility resource planners given responsibility for keeping lights on today think we need gas, at least if we want to avoid giant price increases in electricity. A study released by the Colorado Energy Office in early 2024 reached a similar conclusion. 
In 2005, our utilities thought our future was in coal. Xcel Energy had started building Colorado’s largest coal unit ever, the 750-megawatt Comanche 3 in Pueblo. It was expected to operate until 2070. Now, it is to close in 2030.
Tri-State was also dreaming big coal in 2005. It wanted to build 1,400 megawatts of new coal-burning generation in southwest Kansas. A partnering utility, Sunflower Electric, was to get another 700 megawatts.
In 2007, the two utilities suffered a setback. Kansas denied a permit for these coal-burning castles because of greenhouse gas emissions. The denial, shocking then, became a blessing. When the utilities finally got their permit in 2017, the economics of electricity had turned upside down. Imagine the financial albatross hanging around Tri-State’s neck had it succeeded. As it was, Tri-State spent $100 million or more on this errant path.
By 2018, Tri-State was imagining a different future. A new chief executive, Duane Highley, was given a mandate to explore the new economic terrain. In November, Jared Polis won election as Colorado governor after running on a platform of 100% renewables by 2040. That December, Xcel executives announced their plans to leave coal.
Beginning this year, Tri-State will close its three coal units by September 2028. In 2031 it plans to close its coal unit at Springerville, Arizone. In this transition, Tri-State hopes to get federal assistance promised it under the Inflation Reduction Act for stranded assets. It will then have coal-burning ownership only in Wyoming’s Laramie River Station, a short railroad trip from the Powder River coal fields.
“Just transition” is also part of Tri-State’s pivot. State legislators in 2019 said that coal-dependent communities should be given aid as they made their career shifts. In a 2024 agreement, Tri-State pledged to pay Craig and Moffat County $22 million between 2026 and 2029 and committed to support investments with $48 million in additional benefits between 2029 and 2038. Tri-State payments can be reduced if taxable property is added. A gas plant in Moffat County will do just that.
Tri-State still has challenges. For example, it is still losing members. And questions remain for it and other utilities about where to hedge bets. Natural gas is a conservative bet, the way coal was 20 years ago. At that time, few among us were carrying a smartphone. We were mostly beholden to land lines. Will a still nascent technology fully emerge to replace gas, too?

A provision carried into a bill markup on Tuesday would prohibit ‘implementation, administration or enforcement’ of the controversial land-use plan for Red Desert, Little Mountain areas.
The post Despite reports, BLM’s Rock Springs plan lives on. But congressional budgeting could kill it. appeared first on WyoFile .","As the Wyoming Legislature met in early February, a lawmaker from the state’s southwest corner announced to his fellow representatives that the Trump administration had thrown out the Bureau of Land Management’s controversial Rock Springs resource management plan, completed just weeks before. 
But word of its death, parroted by some in the media, was premature. U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s “Unleashing American Energy” order, which triggered the erroneous reports, said that the final plan for 3.6 million acres of the Red Desert and checkerboard region would be “reviewed and, as appropriate, revised.” Months later, the federal resource management plan remains in effect.
“It’s still active. It’s not frozen,” BLM-Wyoming spokesman Micky Fisher told WyoFile. “We are now just identifying possible options.”
What path BLM takes to satisfy Burgum’s order is being decided at the agency’s Washington headquarters, Fisher said. Amending the plan through the established National Environmental Policy Act review process is among the options, policy experts have predicted. 
Congress, however, could take away BLM’s ability to decide for itself. Wyoming’s lone U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman has brought such bills. Her staff did not respond to a request Monday seeking comment.

There has also been talk of using the Congressional Review Act to overturn the land-use plan, which was nearly 14 years in the making. 
Yet another possible route for Congress to undo the plan, which caused a political furor during its draft stages, is to address it during the ongoing budget reconciliation process. That remains on the table.
Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, included two provisions in his draft reconciliation bill that address BLM resource management plans in Wyoming. One would not allow the BLM to “implement, administer or enforce” the RMP for its Rock Springs field office. The other includes the same prohibitionary language for BLM acting on its new plan for its Buffalo Field Office — which includes a coal-leasing ban in the Powder River Basin that’s now being litigated. 
A markup of the draft reconciliation bill is scheduled for 8:15 a.m. MST on Tuesday. Ultimately, the provisions could lead to the Rock Springs and Buffalo plans being killed by only a simple majority vote — budget reconciliation isn’t subject to the filibuster, so only 51 votes are needed to get it through the U.S. Senate.
That’s a possibility that has conservation groups in Wyoming on guard. Congress — via budget reconciliation or otherwise — has never successfully thrown out a federal land-use plan, said Julia Stuble, Wyoming director for The Wilderness Society. 
 “We can’t find an example of this kind of congressional overreach … being successful,” Stuble said. “We’ve certainly seen some attempts at this.” 
It’s not a sure thing that the resource management plan provisions will carry forward. Provisions in budget reconciliation must have a direct effect on the federal budget, and it’s unclear if congressional rules would allow for RMP provisions.

If congressional Republicans do carry the provisions forward successfully, it’d set a bad precedent in Stuble’s view. 
“I think anyone who believes that the small government closest to the people is the best form of government should be opposed to this kind of overreach from Congress,” she said. “Because land-use plans, like RMPs, are developed at a local level, with tons of input from elected officials, community members and stakeholders.” 
Not everyone in Wyoming is on that page. Rep. Cody Wylie, a Republican representative from Rock Springs who prematurely announced the RMP’s death during the legislative session, believes that local interests were cut out of the BLM’s process. That decision charted the future of millions of acres of public land surrounding his legislative district.
“The way it was written, it was completely biased — not even conservation, but preservation,” Wylie said. “That’s just not realistic for the state of Wyoming. Our economy has run off of the extraction industries.” 
Efforts to strike more of a balance between conservation and industrial development in the final plan didn’t alleviate his concerns.

Wylie prefers that Congress not throw the plan out entirely, so the BLM doesn’t have to start from scratch. An amendment to the 2024 plan, he said, would be ideal. 
“Then they can [include] all that informational work that’s been done over the last 15 years,” he said. 
But if congressional Republicans successfully throw out the new plan and BLM has to revert to its 1997 RMP, he won’t protest.
“I think we can live with that until we redo the RMP process,” Wylie said.

Janet Mills' office says a meeting in Boston with Canadian leaders could happen in  'the near future,' according to a news release. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)The leaders of six Northeast states extended an invitation to Canadian leaders Monday to discuss the importance of cross-border relationships amid actions from the Trump administration that have threatened them.
While additional details regarding the time and date of the meeting were not available, the leaders proposed to meet in Boston in “the near future,” according to a news release from Maine Gov. Janet Mills’ office.
“Our economies and our cultures have enjoyed strong relationships for generations, which is now strained by the president’s haphazard tariffs and harmful rhetoric targeting our northern neighbors,” Mills said.
She added that she looks forward to telling her Eastern Canada counterparts that Maine values their partnerships and “will work to ensure our historic friendship and deeply intertwined economies endure for generations to come.”
The invite came from Mills, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, Rhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee, and Vermont Gov. Phil Scott — the only Republican in the group. It was sent to the premiers of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Québec.
As President Donald Trump has gone back and forth on imposing tariffs, some as high as 25%, on Maine’s northern neighbor, Mills, along with Maine’s business community, has warned that any new tax would have a significant negative impact on the state.
In radio addresses and other statements, she has also underscored how vital Canada is to the state’s economy, especially as a trade partner. Every year, Maine exports $1.4 billion in goods to Canada and in turn imports more than $5 billion worth of goods.
Mills specifically said that any new tax could increase costs for daily essentials such as gasoline and food. The most heating oil dependent state in the nation, Maine imports more than 80% of its heating fuel and gasoline from Canada, the release said.
Similarly, the agriculture sector said in early April that the tariffs could incite a trade war that would increase costs for consumers and eat away at already thin profit margins.
Mills is also concerned that Trump rhetoric about Canada could harm Maine’s summer tourism season. Last year, Canadian visitors spent nearly half a billion dollars in Maine, but Mills’ office said estimates show that the state could see Canadian tourists drop by about 25%.
“Whether Canadians decide to visit this summer (and we truly hope they do) or at a later time, they will always find a warm welcome in Maine,” said Carolann Ouellette, director of the Maine Office of Tourism.
While it’s not clear whether or how much the tariffs will directly impact electricity, the Maine Office of Public Advocate has raised concern about the potential impact on customers, especially 58,000 ratepayers in Aroostook and Washington counties who live along the border and have little choice but to rely on Canadian energy to keep their lights on.

Brian Kemp announced on Monday that he will not run for the U.S. Senate in 2026, a decision that could have a ripple effect on the re-election campaign for Sen. Jon Ossoff.

Brian Kemp announced on Monday that he will not run for the U.S. Senate in 2026, a decision that could have a ripple effect on the re-election campaign for Sen. Jon Ossoff.
The Georgia governor announced his decision via social media that he would no longer run in the pivotal 2026 election in which he was seen as the early favorite to challenge Ossoff, who along with  U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock won historic 2020 elections for Georgia Democrats.
In a move to intensify its efforts to fundraise and campaign for candidates, the Democratic Party of Georgia elected Charlie Bailey as its chair on Saturday as it reenergizes the party’s base following setbacks following the 2020 victories.
Kemp wrote In a statement posted on X Monday he has decided that running for U.S. Senate is not the right for him.
“I spoke with President Trump and Senate leadership earlier today and expressed my commitment to work alongside them to ensure we have a strong Republican nominee who can win next November, and ultimately be a conservative voice in the US Senate who will put hardworking Georgians first,” Kemp wrote on X.
“I am confident we will be united in that important effort, and I look forward to electing the next generation of leaders up and down the ballot here in the Peach State who will keep our state and nation headed in the right direction in 2026 and beyond,” Kemp said.
Political analysts said Kemp’s decision not to run for the Senate makes sense since being a low ranking member of that chamber would be a step down from being governor.
They suggest that Kemp will reap significant  financial rewards for public speaking on behalf of the Republican Party while also keeping his options open for a 2028 run for the White House.
Ossoff’s U.S. Senate Campaign Manager Ellen Foster released a statement Monday following the Kemp announcement.
  Sen. Jon Ossoff. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“As we’ve said for the past few months, Sen. Ossoff is well-prepared to defeat any challenger,” Foster wrote. “As Republicans scramble in the aftermath, our campaign will continue to build insurmountable momentum needed to win next November.”
Georgia Republican election strategist Brian Robinson said although Kemp was the top tier candidate in the Senate race, other GOP contenders have the opportunity to prove themselves in the primary to become the top candidate.
Robinson said he is not surprised about Kemp’s announcement Monday and dismissed the notion that despite high polling favorability ratings that Kemp was not a “shoe-in“ to defeat Ossoff. The Republican senatorial candidate in 2026 will also have the opportunity to raise enough money and build a campaign platform to defeat Ossoff, Robinson said.
“I think (Kemp) would have been miserable if he had won, ” Robinson said. “I think he had other calculations as well. I think he can go make a lot of money. His network after being (Republican Governors Association chair) this year is going to be absolutely incredible and is worth millions of dollars. He can feather his nest to keep his options open for running in 2028. We don’t know what the environment is going to be in 2026 with the White House occupying party always facing headwinds in midterms, and the political environment is one that we can’t predict.”
Robinson said the Republican crop of candidates will have the opportunity to win over the voters necessary to run a strong campaign against the Democratic incumbent.
Charles Bullock, political science professor at the University of Georgia, said the Republican Senate candidate winner next year needs to be a candidate who can compete against Ossoff in November’s general election.
Bullock agreed with Robinson that Kemp’s decision is likely influenced by Kemp’s ability to generate significant income and the uncertainty of the political climate in 2026.
It is not uncommon for the party in power in the White House to lose ground in the midterm elections, Bullock said.
Republicans and Democratic candidates are expected to use Trump-focused messages to build support for their party’s candidates this year.
Kemp was successful in securing Democratic votes in his 2022 campaign against Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams, Bullock said.
Bullock said the Ossoff campaign is likely turning “hand-flips” after Kemp turned down the Senate bid, referencing the same advantages as Robinson to being governor instead of a low ranking U.S. Senator.
Bullock said that the Ossoff campaign is most likely hopeful that right wing U.S. Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene emerges as top GOP candidate for Senate. Greene will be able to raise large sums of money for her campaign but he said that Greene’s style could be problematic in a statewide race.
A Greene staffer declined to comment on her future political aspirations but said she is honored to have the support of Georgians.
“Governor Kemp has been a great governor for the state of Georgia,” Greene said in a statement. “I wish him and his family well in all their future endeavors.”
Savannah Republican U.S. Rep Buddy Carter is another potential candidate who is wellknown in the region but will have to fight for name recognition in Atlanta, Bullock said.
“The Atlanta area is where the bulk of the votes that result from the primary is going to come from and they’re going to spend money to get known in the Atlanta area,” Bullock said. “The same thing for Rep. Mack  Collins or Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is probably the best known member of Congress but she is the kind of person that will have a harder time than others holding onto the white college-educated voters, which is decisive in Georgia.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Twenty attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island in Providence to stop U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the agency he leads from dismantling key public health programs.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha is one of three co-leaders challenging the Trump administration’s mass layoff of 10,000 HHS employees under its “Make America Healthy Again” initiative. The 101-page complaint claims the mass layoff has left HHS unable to perform its statutory functions of protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of Americans.
The other co-leaders are New York Attorney General Letitia James and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown. They are joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.
After termination notices went out to HHS employees on April 1, the complaint states employees were immediately expelled from their work email, laptops, and offices. Five of HHS’s 10 regional offices were closed, including Boston, Chicago, Dallas, New York City, San Francisco and Seattle.
“There was no one to answer the phone, factories went into shutdown mode, experiments were abandoned, trainings were cancelled, site visits were postponed, application portals were closed, laboratories stopped testing for infectious diseases such as hepatitis, and partnerships were immediately suspended,” the complaint states.
As a result, the Food and Drug Administration missed a vaccine application deadline and canceled a critical test for the bird flu virus. The World Trade Center Health Program had no doctors to certify new illnesses for coverage, a necessary part of caring for the responders and survivors of the 9/11 attacks under the Zadroga Act. Programs aimed at monitoring maternal and newborn health were shuttered. Office closures and layoffs at Head Start and Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program left grantees “abandoned with no one to answer their questions.” The World Trade Center Health Program had no doctors to certify new illnesses for coverage, a necessary part of caring for the responders and survivors of the 9/11 attacks. Programs aimed at monitoring maternal and newborn health were abruptly shuttered.
“Americans across the country are already experiencing the detrimental effects of this attack on HHS including new mothers, workers, 9/11 first responders, and those suffering from mental illness and substance use disorder,” Neronha said in a statement. “Think about that for a minute: American heroes, pregnant women, workers, those in need of mental health treatment; all left to fend for themselves by these reckless cuts. This attack on HHS tells you everything you need to know about the priorities of this Administration; and they don’t include the health of you or your family.”
Rhode Island has already lost over $1.9 million in grants, staff, programs and data, according to Neronha’s office, and stands to lose more in grants, staff, programs, and data. State health programs and initiatives already eliminated or negatively impacted without the support of HHS funding and staff include maternal mortality studies and prevention; treatment for nicotine and alcohol addiction; air quality monitoring.
The 20 attorneys general argue that the sweeping actions at HHS violated hundreds of federal statutes and regulations. They argued that by taking these actions without congressional approval, the administration disregarded the constitutional separation of powers and undermined the laws and budgets enacted by Congress.
The coalition is asking the court to halt the mass firings, reverse the illegal reorganization, and restore the critical health services serving millions of Americans.
The case has been assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan.
Neronha also joined a coalition of 23 attorneys general in filing an April 1 lawsuit in Providence federal court against Kennedy and the Trump administration for abruptly and unlawfully slashing billions of dollars in vital state health funding. District Judge Mary S. McElroy issued a temporary restraining order against the administration on April 5, temporarily reinstating the funding.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The highest-ranking lawmaker in the New Mexico Senate cannot be sued for reassigning a senator’s office and seat in the chamber because they were “legitimate legislative actions,” the state’s high court said Monday.
In 2021, Senate President Pro Tem Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) moved then-Sen. Jacob Candelaria’s (DTS-Albuquerque) seat on the Senate floor and his Senate office location in the Roundhouse.
In a complaint filed in a district court in 2022, Candelaria alleged Stewart’s actions had been “retaliatory” for his public criticism of her vote against terminating the executive director, at the time, of the Legislation Education Study Committee, who was facing allegations of unlawful workplace discrimination.
In a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice David Thomson, the New Mexico Supreme Court said Stewart is entitled to immunity from legal liability because her actions fall under the “speech and debate clause” in the New Mexico Constitution. The justices noted that it was the first time the state’s appeals courts have ever been asked to interpret the clause.
Monday’s opinion offered the legal explanation for the justices’ earlier verbal ruling in the case, which they made in December after hearing arguments from both sides.
“While the decision on this case was delivered last year, it’s good to have closure on this issue with the delivery of a written opinion from the Supreme Court,” Stewart told Source NM in a statement. “Our Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause outlines what constitutes legitimate, protected legislative activities, and the Supreme Court’s affirmation now makes it clear once and for all.”
Second Judicial District Court Judge Daniel Ramczyk in September 2024 concluded that he needed to examine Stewart’s motives for her actions against Candelaria before he could decide whether she was entitled to legislative immunity.
The Supreme Court said Ramczyk’s reasoning was wrong because of a long-established legal principle that courts can’t question lawmakers’ motive or intent.  The justices sent the case back to him, telling him to dismiss it, and he did so on Dec. 16, according to court records.
The justices wrote that Stewart’s motive is irrelevant and moving Candelaria’s office and floor seat “are both legitimate legislative activities” in her role as president of the Senate.
“Private actions, just like those brought by the executive branch, divert legislators’ attention from their work and bring judicial power to bear, imperiling legislative independence,” the justices wrote.
A request for comment from Candelaria was not returned as of publication time.
Candelaria argued that New Mexico’s Constitution only protects lawmakers from liability for officials acts requiring a vote; however, the justices wrote that he misinterpreted part of the speech and debate clause to limit lawmakers’ immunity when it was really providing an additional ground for immunity.
Candelaria also argued that Stewart’s changes to his office and seating arrangements weren’t integral to the Senate’s deliberations because earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic, senators had been allowed to participate and vote in committee meetings and floor sessions remotely.
The justices disagreed, saying the pandemic required the Senate to change its procedures “in unprecedented ways,” and they refused to rule on legislative immunity based on those changes.
Candelaria, first elected in 2013, frequently clashed with Senate leadership and changed his party affiliation in late 2021 from Democrat to independent. He resigned from the Senate in 2022.

(Photo by Kohei Hara/Getty Images)In the state of Utah, we typically talk about WalletHub’s “Best & Worst States for Women’s Equality,” which we have continuously ranked dead last (50th of 50) for 10 years running. But recently I share a more positive ranking (still not the best, but at least better, that is focused on WalletHub’s “Best & Worst States for Women” (34th of 51st, including the District of Columbia).
WalletHub’s Best & Worst States for Work Moms is another state-by-state ranking that just came out in the last week, and Utah ranks 27th of 51 (not terrible). For this ranking, WalletHub categorizes their findings into three main categories — Child Care Rank, Professional Opportunities Rank, and Work-Life Balance Rank — with a total of 17 key metrics that are each weighted differently. WalletHub pulls their data from a variety of sources that include the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Child Care Aware of America, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Council for Community and Economic Research, Institute for Women’s Policy Research, National Partnership for Women & Families, Knee Regulatory Research Center, and WalletHub research.
The top 10 states include Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, District of Columbia, Maine, Minnesota, Vermont, Wisconsin, New Jersey, and New York, while the bottom five include Louisiana, Alabama, Nevada, Mississippi, and New Mexico.
Although not published in their online report, I was able to obtain more detailed data directly from WalletHub. Let me share what I found.
Child care
First, Utah currently ranks 27th for the “Child Care Rank” category. I have included the state rankings for each indicator within this category below (1=best state and 51=worst state).

Day care quality: 27
Child care costs (adjusted for the median women’s salary): 6
Pediatricians per capita: 40
School system quality (based on WalletHub’s “States with the Best & Worst School Systems” ranking): 15
Share of nationally accredited child care centers: 50
Number of child care workers per total number of children: 46

Professional opportunities rank
Secondly, Utah ranks 48th in “Professional Opportunities Rank,” which comes from the sum of the following indicators (1=best state and 51=worst state):

Gender pay gap: 50
Ratio of female executive to male executives: 51
Median women’s salary: 30 ($48,412)
Share of working women living with economic security: 30
Share of families in poverty: 3
Female unemployment rate: 37
Gender-representation gap in different economic sectors: 49
WalletHub “Best States for Working from Home” ranking: 2

Work-life balance rank
Thirdly, Utah ranks 12th in “Work-Life Balance Rank,” which comes from the sum of the following indicators (1=best state and 51=worst state):

Parental-leave policy score: 43
Average length of a woman’s work week: 1
Women’s average commute time: 10

I appreciate that Utah is doing well in some areas, although several of these do not align with data gathered from other sources. Utah does the best in these rankings in the following metrics: child-care costs, school-system quality, share of families in poverty, WalletHub “Best States for Working from Home” ranking, average length of a woman’s work week, and women’s average commute time.
However, the ones I continue to be particularly concerned about include Utah’s pediatricians per capita, share of nationally accredited child care centers, number of child care workers per total number of children, gender pay gap, ratio of female executives to male executives, gender-representation gap in different economic sectors, and parental-leave policy score. There is still much more work to be done in these and other areas.
Of course, these rankings only give us certain pieces of the puzzle in better understanding how women and families are doing in Utah. It can be easy to be dismissive of reports like this that don’t tell the whole story. But with more data and information we can be more strategic in finding ways to ensure that our residents and families can better thrive.
To do this, a key effort linking together all partners and individuals interested in improving Utah is A Bolder Way Forward. We welcome all Utahns into this work. The research is clear: leaders in Utah can help more women and families thrive through increasing access and affordability of child care, improving women’s professional opportunities, and helping parents and nonparents have better work-life balance.
If Utahns truly believe that families come first, then let’s continue our work toward making that true in all settings!",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/child-care-costs-to-employment.png,,,2025-05-05 19:09:39.344817

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)As the commonwealth’s two largest public transportation systems barrel toward fiscal crises and sweeping service cuts, Pennsylvania lawmakers approved legislation Monday to direct nearly $300 million in new funding to transit agencies in the next state budget.
The bill reflects Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s budget proposal to provide the first increase in the state’s contribution to mass transit in over a decade. It would increase the share of state sales tax revenue dedicated to transit by 1.75% to provide an additional $1.5 billion for transit over the next five years. 
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), which operates bus and rail service in the Philadelphia region, and Pittsburgh Rapid Transit (PRT), have both announced that without the state’s help to close budget deficits, they will have no choice but to drastically cut service starting this summer.
During a rally with transit executives Monday at the state Capitol, Lt. Gov. Austin Davis said he recently rode along with his father, a PRT bus driver and saw firsthand that public transit is vital to workers, students, people with disabilities and seniors. 
“We can’t leave these folks standing along the roadside waiting for a bus that never comes because we failed to act here in Harrisburg. That would be bad for the people of Pennsylvania. It would be bad for business here in Pennsylvania,” Davis said, citing a claim by the American Public Transportation Association that every dollar spent on public transportation generates $5 in economic activity.
Shapiro also pushed for more transit funding last session, and though the plan won bipartisan support in the House, it was not considered in the GOP-controlled Senate. Republican leaders in both chambers have steadfastly opposed the increase, saying it is unsustainable and called for alternative funding sources, reforms and privatization. 
In a statement, Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said while he recognizes the importance of transit to the state’s economy, taxpayers should have assurance that the billions the state spends provides safe, reliable and efficient transportation. He also said GOP lawmakers want similar investments in highways and other modes of transportation that serve rural communities. 
Reintroduced this session as House Bill 1364, the legislation passed 16-10 Monday in the House Transportation Committee. It now heads to the full House for a vote. Republican Reps. Shelby Labs and Kathleen Tomlinson, who represent parts of the Philadelphia suburbs with SEPTA service in Bucks County, broke ranks to vote in favor of the bill.

At the rally, Transportation Committee Chairperson Ed Neilson (D-Philadelphia) expressed frustration at the Senate’s inaction last session.
“We showed today … that transportation and transit funding is a bipartisan issue,” Neilson said.
He added that transit is too important and the need is too urgent to wait for other sources of revenue that have been proposed, such as the taxation of so-called skill games and recreational marijuana legalization, both of which Shapiro’s budget includes.
“We can’t gamble for transit. We can’t wait for somebody to fix the gaming machines or somebody to do marijuana … these agencies needed money yesterday, not tomorrow,” Neilson said. 
Facing a $213 million deficit in July, SEPTA is planning to eliminate 50 bus routes, five regional rail lines, one metro line and reduce or modify more than a dozen other services. It would also raise fares 20%. PRT has a $100 million shortfall and plans a 35% service reduction and a 9% fare increase. 
Both agencies say there’s nothing left to cut but service. 
Rep. Kerry Benninghoff (R-Centre), the ranking Republican transportation committee member,  asked during Monday’s committee meeting whether the additional transit funding would be offset by reductions in other spending. 
Committee Executive Director Kyle Wagonseller said the additional money would come from year over year increases in sales tax collection. The 6% tax on most goods and services purchased in Pennsylvania generated about $340 million more in 2024 than in 2023, Wagonseller said. 
Benninghoff told the Capital-Star after the meeting that he wasn’t satisfied with the answer. He noted the transit funding legislation increases the percentage of sales tax dedicated to transit, rather than a set amount, leaving a smaller percentage of the revenue available for other uses..
“Somebody’s ox is getting gored. It’s not extra money sitting around,” Benninghoof said.
In addition to the sales tax reallocation, House and Senate lawmakers have proposed generating additional transit funding by raising the state’s rental car fee from $2 to $6.50, car lease fee from 3% to 5%, and establishing a 6% excise tax on ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.
“These small increases add up to big investments,” said Sen. Lindsay Williams (D-Allegheny), who is also a PRT board member and a sponsor of the “Transit Funding for All” package. “It means that our most vulnerable neighbors can have meaningful, dignified lives and continue to live independently through public transit and access ride services.”

(Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)Gov. Kay Ivey on Monday signed Alabama’s budgets for the 2026 fiscal year.
The Education Trust Fund (ETF) will provide nearly $10 billion in funding for the state’s various education programs and agencies, and is a 6% increase over the previous year. The General Fund budget totals $3.7 billion for the 2026 fiscal year, a 10% increase ($347 million) over the current budget.
Both budgets go into effect on Oct. 1.

Ivey said in a statement that the budgets are an investment in the state’s education.
“The budgets we made official this morning will continue investing in proven programs like the Literacy and Numeracy Acts. It will support our Turnaround Schools initiative to target some of our lowest performing schools. It will continue allowing these successful education reform policies to take shape while taking an active approach to do everything we can to support students, teachers and parents,” Ivey said in a statement.
The ETF budget includes a $99.2 million increase for the Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Plan. There are no pay raises for education employees in the budget. It also includes $9.6 million to support a newly enacted parental leave policy for state and education staff and $15.6 million designated for an employee injury compensation program. It includes significant funding boosts for key programs: AMSTI would increase by 31% ($32.2 million), ARI by 6.4% ($9 million) and transportation by approximately 9.1% ($40 million).
The budget also provides $180 million for the CHOOSE Act, a voucher-like program that provides tax credits for nonpublic education expenses, including private school tuition. The program was initially slated to receive $100 million. Over two-thirds of applicants for the CHOOSE Act come from private schools or are homeschooled.
The General Fund budget includes a $223.8 million (19%) increase over the current year for the Medicaid Agency, totaling $1.18 billion; a $90.1 million (11%) increase for the Alabama Department of Corrections, for a total of $826.7 million; a $4.7 million (3%) increase for the Alabama Department of Human Resources, totaling $148.9 million; and a $4.7 million (2%) increase for the Alabama Department of Mental Health, totally $244 million.
Funding for the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles was reduced from $94.5 million to $90.6 million, a 4.1% decrease, in the Senate due to some lawmakers’ concerns over low parole rates and responsiveness from board members. The amendment also made the board’s funding conditional on the development of parole release guidelines. The board has faced criticism for significantly lower parole rates since 2017.
The state is also increasing its contribution to employee health insurance. For each education employee, the PEEHIP contribution will go up from $800 to $904, and the SEIB contribution for each state employee will increase from $997 to $1,025.

The U.S. Supreme Court denied inmate Stephen Stanko’s appeal of his 2009 conviction for shooting his friend four years prior. Stanko was also sentenced to death in 2006 for killing his girlfriend and raping her then-15-year-old daughter and leaving her for dead. The appeals process continues on that conviction.
  Stephen Stanko, 57, has run out of appeals and can be scheduled for execution. (Provided by the SC Department of Corrections)
But Monday’s decision by the nation’s high court clears the way for the state Supreme Court to issue a death warrant for the 57-year-old, an attorney for the Attorney General’s Office wrote in a letter to state justices.
The court usually issues death warrants on Fridays, giving inmates exactly four weeks before their execution dates under state law. The court will be closed this coming Friday in observance of Confederate Memorial Day, a state holiday. Whether the court might still issue a death notice for Stanko that day is unclear.
Stanko would be the sixth inmate put to death in the state since executions resumed in September 2024, following an unintended 13-year hiatus.
Legislators added firing squad as an option for executions in 2021, and two inmates chose that as their method of execution earlier this year. The other three died by lethal injection, which again became an option with the help of an expanded law keeping most information about executions, including the source of the drugs, secret.
Stanko was tried for crimes in two different counties — Georgetown and Horry — and sentenced to death in both cases.
On April 7, 2005, Stanko strangled his girlfriend, Laura Ling, to death while beating and raping her daughter at their home in Murrell’s Inlet. Stanko slit the daughter’s throat and left her for dead, stealing jewelry and a credit card from her and her mother. He withdrew money from Ling’s bank account at a nearby ATM, then drove to Conway, according to court records.
There, Stanko committed the crime for which he has exhausted his appeals.
The next morning, April 8, 2005, Stanko brought his friend Henry Turner breakfast from McDonald’s. As the 74-year-old shaved in front of his bathroom mirror, Stanko shot him in the back, using a pillow as a silencer for his gun. He then hit Turner in the head and shot him again in the chest, this time fatally, according to court records.
Stanko stole Turner’s truck and fled, driving from Conway to Columbia, then to Augusta, Georgia, the next day. There, he convinced a woman he was a businessman in town for the Masters golf tournament. Stanko spent several days staying in the woman’s apartment and attending church with her.
After Stanko left April 12, the woman recognized Stanko’s picture in the newspaper alongside a headline about Turner’s death. She called the police, who captured Stanko while he was still in Augusta.
He was convicted and sentenced to death in 2006 for killing Ling and raping her daughter, then given another death sentence in 2009 for killing Turner. In both cases, Stanko’s attorneys unsuccessfully claimed he was insane during the time of the killings, according to court records.

Stanko had been out of prison for nine months after serving over eight years for kidnapping and assaulting another woman, according to court records.
He was also under investigation for running several scams in and around Myrtle Beach, including representing himself as a lawyer and investigator. At the time of the crimes, people who had paid him had begun to demand their money back and were threatening to report him to the police, prosecutors wrote in court filings.

House committee,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/cannabis/recreational-marijuana-legalization-proposal-advances-out-of-pa-house-committee/,"The bill passed the committee on Monday afternoon by a 14-12 vote, along party lines.","A glass marijuana pipe rests on the wall outside the Pennsylvania Capitol during a rally in support of legalizing cannabis on Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2024. (Capital-Star photo by Peter Hall)A proposal that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana advanced out of the Pennsylvania House Health Committee along party lines on Monday.
House Bill 1200, sponsored by Rep. Rick Krajewski (D-Philadelphia), would include a number of reforms to marijuana policy, including allowing the purchase of marijuana for recreational use by those 21 years and older, mainly through publicly owned stores overseen by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board.
Krajewski said the proposal creates a “balanced, responsible, and robust framework to legalize and regulate” cannabis use by adults. He crafted the legislation along with Pennsylvania House Health Committee Chairman Dan Frankel (D-Allegheny).
“Right now, Pennsylvanians who use cannabis are either crossing state lines to purchase from other legal markets or buying from the illicit market,” Krajewski said Monday. “The reality is, criminalization of cannabis does not work. It does not deter usage, it does not promote safety, and it is not in the best interest of our commonwealth.”
A co-sponsorship memo for the proposal notes that five of the six states that border Pennsylvania have legalized marijuana. Krajewski said that although the Keystone State is “late to the game in terms of legalizing cannabis, this timing allows us to learn from the mistakes of other frameworks.”
Legalization, he added, will impose regulations on potency, content and labeling.
“We can promote public health, while bringing hundreds of millions of public dollars that can be directed to the communities hit hardest by past criminalization,” he said.
The co-sponsorship memo of the bill notes that the proposal would reinvest “funds into communities disproportionately harmed by the war on drugs.”
Shapiro’s budget proposal estimates that a 20% tax on the wholesale price of recreational marijuana products would generate $15.6 million plus an additional $11.4 million in sales tax revenue for the 2025-26 budget.
Republicans opposed the measure, citing a wide range of issues, starting with the legislative process.
Rep. Charity Grimm Krupa (R-Fayette) complained that House Democrats formally introduced the 173-page bill on Sunday and then scheduled the vote for Monday.
“It’s appalling, it’s offensive, and frankly, it was done because it’s widely known that there is broad opposition to this bill in the manner in which the language is being presented,” she said. “This scheme is a slap in the face of every member of this committee, to the public and to the very concept of representative government.”
Frankel disagreed, contending that the committee held six hearings on the matter last session.
Republicans made an attempt to table the vote, but that failed along partisan lines.
Other concerns expressed by Republicans who voted against the proposal included the impact legalization of recreational marijuana could have on the state’s workforce and public safety, including that cannabis is still considered a Schedule I controlled substance by the federal government.
“There’s nothing healthy or safe about legalizing the recreational use of marijuana,” said Pennsylvania House Health Committee Minority Chair Kathy Rapp (R-Warren).
The bill advanced out of the committee by a 14-12 vote and advanced to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for consideration.
Many Democrats have expressed support for passing marijuana legalization, although they hold a narrow majority in the House and are the minority party in the state Senate.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_9855-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-05 19:09:39.344817

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Passenger rail service between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth could end if Texas lawmakers decline to fund that state’s share, the Oklahoma Transportation Commission was told Monday.
“Texas is having a little bit of trouble working that into their legislative budget, and we’re optimistic that will happen, but we are going to continue to very closely monitor it,” said Tim Gatz, Oklahoma Department of Transportation executive director.
The Heartland Flyer, an Amtrak route between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth, is a jointly funded partnership between Texas and Oklahoma. Oklahoma’s portion for 2025 is $4.5 million, according to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation.
If Texas was unable to fund its portion, the Heartland Flyer would cease operations, as early as June, Gatz said.
“We’ve been through a few other times with similar conditions with Texas, and they’ve always come through,” Gatz said. “So, we’re not necessarily in a panic yet, but we are monitoring closely.”
A spokesman for the Texas Department of Transportation said his agency does not comment on pending legislation.
The Heartland Flyer is extremely important to a growing state and growing metropolitan area like Oklahoma City, Gatz said.
It offers an alternate mode of transportation for people that may choose not to fly or drive or may not have the means to travel to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Gatz said.
If the route is shut down, it will impact ongoing efforts to expand the passenger train route between Fort Worth, Oklahoma City and Newton, Kan., Gatz said.
“I think it changes that dynamic dramatically to the point that if the Flyer didn’t exist south to Dallas, Fort Worth, then it pretty much negates all of the work that’s been done so far on projecting what that route might look like,” Gatz said.
Expanding the line into Kansas would allow travelers to connect with other major passenger train routes. Extending the route into Kansas and connecting it to other locations would require funding through the Federal Railroad Administration, Gatz said.
The Heartland Flyer makes stops in Norman, Purcell, Pauls Valley, Ardmore, Gainesville and Forth Worth. It travels 206 miles between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth.
The service was reestablished in 1999 after ending in 1979, Gatz said.
Ridership has fluctuated over the years, but last year it was 81,918, according to ODOT.
Prices vary depending on travel times, but a round trip ticket from Oklahoma City to Forth Worth on Saturday costs $64.

Kennedy Jr. and the agency he leads from dismantling key public health programs.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha is one of three co-leaders challenging the Trump administration’s mass layoff of 10,000 HHS employees under its “Make America Healthy Again” initiative. The 101-page complaint claims the mass layoff has left HHS unable to perform its statutory functions of protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of Americans.
The other co-leaders are New York Attorney General Letitia James and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown. They are joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.
After termination notices went out to HHS employees on April 1, the complaint states employees were immediately expelled from their work email, laptops, and offices. Five of HHS’s 10 regional offices were closed, including Boston, Chicago, Dallas, New York City, San Francisco and Seattle.
“There was no one to answer the phone, factories went into shutdown mode, experiments were abandoned, trainings were cancelled, site visits were postponed, application portals were closed, laboratories stopped testing for infectious diseases such as hepatitis, and partnerships were immediately suspended,” the complaint states.
As a result, the Food and Drug Administration missed a vaccine application deadline and canceled a critical test for the bird flu virus. The World Trade Center Health Program had no doctors to certify new illnesses for coverage, a necessary part of caring for the responders and survivors of the 9/11 attacks under the Zadroga Act. Programs aimed at monitoring maternal and newborn health were shuttered. Office closures and layoffs at Head Start and Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program left grantees “abandoned with no one to answer their questions.” The World Trade Center Health Program had no doctors to certify new illnesses for coverage, a necessary part of caring for the responders and survivors of the 9/11 attacks. Programs aimed at monitoring maternal and newborn health were abruptly shuttered.
“Americans across the country are already experiencing the detrimental effects of this attack on HHS including new mothers, workers, 9/11 first responders, and those suffering from mental illness and substance use disorder,” Neronha said in a statement. “Think about that for a minute: American heroes, pregnant women, workers, those in need of mental health treatment; all left to fend for themselves by these reckless cuts. This attack on HHS tells you everything you need to know about the priorities of this Administration; and they don’t include the health of you or your family.”
Rhode Island has already lost over $1.9 million in grants, staff, programs and data, according to Neronha’s office, and stands to lose more in grants, staff, programs, and data. State health programs and initiatives already eliminated or negatively impacted without the support of HHS funding and staff include maternal mortality studies and prevention; treatment for nicotine and alcohol addiction; air quality monitoring.
The 20 attorneys general argue that the sweeping actions at HHS violated hundreds of federal statutes and regulations. They argued that by taking these actions without congressional approval, the administration disregarded the constitutional separation of powers and undermined the laws and budgets enacted by Congress.
The coalition is asking the court to halt the mass firings, reverse the illegal reorganization, and restore the critical health services serving millions of Americans.
The case has been assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan.
Neronha also joined a coalition of 23 attorneys general in filing an April 1 lawsuit in Providence federal court against Kennedy and the Trump administration for abruptly and unlawfully slashing billions of dollars in vital state health funding. District Judge Mary S. McElroy issued a temporary restraining order against the administration on April 5, temporarily reinstating the funding.

(Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Rep. Hamilton Grant called a roadside news conference in his district Monday to make a point: Navigating the construction cones to get to the three stores he stood in front of can be difficult.
His demonstration essentially began with reporters figuring out where to enter the parking lot from Hardscrabble Road in northeast Columbia, where a highway widening project that was supposed to be finished in 2019 may finally be reaching its conclusion.
Under Grant’s proposal, dubbed the “Small Business Construction Impact Relief Act,” store owners that can show financial hardship because of roadwork that’s at least three years behind schedule could get state aid to recoup some of their losses. Qualifying small businesses could get their loans forgiven if they meet certain conditions, such as keeping at least 75% of their full-time employees on staff. Otherwise, they’d have to pay back the zero-interest loan within five years.

The bill sets no dollar figures for the loans, either individually or the total. Those details would be decided by the Legislature’s budget process.
It has zero chance of becoming law this year. The Columbia Democrat introduced it last Wednesday, with just four days left in the 2025 legislative session.
But Grant said he wanted to start a discussion to drum up support for next year.
“South Carolina is growing. That’s a good thing,” he told reporters Monday while standing in front of a nail salon, a soul food restaurant, and a Caribbean grocery store. All three have had a hard time staying open amid construction that started in 2017, he said.
“As we build, we must also protect, and that’s what this legislation aims to do,” Grant said, noting that he’s among commuters stuck in traffic on Hardscrabble Road every day he drives to the Statehouse. So, he understands all too well why people would avoid businesses on road construction routes.
He recognizes it will be difficult for a freshman Democrat to get legislation passed in a General Assembly ruled by Republicans. But he believes the crux of his bill — helping small businesses hurt by what he characterized as out-of-control government projects — is something legislators of both parties can support.
“Some of the people that I’ve had conversations with who are small business owners — who happen to be Republicans from across the state — they immediately take an interest in what it is that this bill aims to do, and how they can help,” Grant said. “They understand the ebbs and flows of being in business.”
The bill already has 15 co-sponsors, including freshman Rep. James Teeple of Johns Island as the lone Republican to sign on so far.
“If you have a small business and no one can get to you … I’m open for grants to avoid people shutting down their businesses,” he said, adding that his continued support would depend on the details as the bill progresses through the process — if it gets traction.
Past-schedule construction hasn’t hampered businesses in his district yet, he said. But as growth continues into southern Charleston County, he envisions it becoming problematic.
As for Hardscrabble Road, the widening of roughly eight miles, funded with Richland County taxes and overseen by the state Department of Transportation, was supposed to take two years and cost $56 million. But delays, all related to moving the utility lines, have pushed back the schedule by six years, costing an additional $18 million, according to the state DOT.
All lanes of the Hardscrabble project should be open this summer, said DOT spokeswoman Hannah Robinson.
“We appreciate the public’s patience as we work to complete this project,” she said.
Business owners speaking at Grant’s news conference included James Etheridge, who opened Southern Crave off with his wife in 2022 amid the construction. There are weeks their business is 60% below normal due to the continued roadwork, and they have to toss thousands of dollars’ worth of soul food.
Asked how he’d use a state loan, Etheridge said it would keep his business afloat.
“It’s getting really tough at this point,” he said. “The economy is down. Money’s not circulating the way it once was.”
Frank Knapp, CEO of the state’s Small Business Chamber of Commerce, said the bill has a “good intent” but could be improved.
The reality is that most small businesses can’t survive a three-year delay, he said.
“It doesn’t do the job for most small businesses that are impacted,” Knapp said. “Most of them will have to move or close down.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5605-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-05 19:09:39.344817

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Two bills contained the bulk of education policy that passed through both legislative chambers, negotiated until the final hours of the scheduled regular session on Friday. 
Lawmakers couldn’t agree to lift the secrecy of university presidential searches, lift labor restrictions for minors, or to implement a full ban on cellphones in high schools, although they did find common ground on requiring parental consent for corporal punishment.
HB 1255 and HB 1105 served as the main vehicles for education policy, combining several shorter proposals from throughout the session. 
Florida made headlines as the first state to ban cellphone use during instructional time in 2023. The Legislature extended that policy this session, banning cellphone use for elementary and middle school students from the beginning of the school day to the end. Lawmakers approved a state pilot study in six counties to evaluate a bell-to-bell ban in high schools. 
Graduation-relation
Pending the governor’s signature, students would no longer be allowed to earn certificates of completion. These state certificates are for students who earn the credits to graduate but too low a grade point average or fail required math and reading assessments. Lawmakers applauded junking these certificates through legislation filed by Rep. Susan Valdes for raising the bar for student achievement. 
The certificate of completion is less prestigious than a diploma and can carry little, if any, weight in landing a student a job, lawmakers said. 
Students with autism may have a better chance to secure work if the governor signs the bill, too. 
HB 1105 would create a workforce credential for students with autism to prove to employers they are proficient in certain skills, particularly workplace safety. 
“Persons with autism are on time, they have a great work ethic, and they can perform work requirements proficiently, especially repetitive skills,” Sen. Don Gaetz said in February. “There’s a place for employees with autism in the workforce in productive jobs, but a major stumbling block is safety.”
The program would task the Department of Education to create badges, which would be verified by special education staff, to document a student’s abilities. 
HB 1105, which passed the Senate 26-5 and the House 85-14, would also allow students who participate in two years of marching band to count them toward the one-credit physical education requirement. Existing law allows two full seasons of varsity or junior varsity sports to count toward the physical education requirement.

More K-12 measures
Lawmakers agreed to require parental consent for corporal punishment, a practice that some lawmakers said they were not aware still existed in Florida but, during the 2023-2024 school year, 17 school districts reported 516 instances of corporal punishment, according to Department of Education data. 
Principals are responsible for developing corporal punishment policy. State law does require that more than one adult be present when corporal punishment is being inflicted. 
HB 1255 would allow law enforcement officers to arrest someone for trespassing on a school bus, a measure aiming to protect not just students but bus drivers, too. 
Charter schools
Democrats often pushed back against GOP bills addressing how charter schools function, leading to some of the most heated debates of the legislative session.
In the final packages were provisions lowering the threshold needed to turn a low-performing traditional public school into a “job-engine” charter school — one meant to attract jobs to a community— and another that includes charter schools as recipients of local government infrastructure surtaxes.
Existing law requires more than 50% of teachers and parents both to vote to convert a traditional public school into a job-engine charter school. The Legislature voted, over Democrats’ protests, to eliminate the need teacher approval and rely on parent approval instead.
The legislation renames Hillsborough Community College as Hillsborough College; requires high schoolers to learn about the costs of postsecondary education and how to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, plus how to apply for scholarships, grants, and student loans; and makes charter school teachers eligible for teacher of the year awards, a proposal Gov. Ron DeSantis made. 
HB 1225 would have lifted several state laws protecting minors in the workplace. That bill passed the House but died in the Senate after it received just one committee hearing. 
SB 1692 would have revised the state definition of material that can be considered harmful to minors. Its companion HB 1539 passed the House but, like lifting labor restrictions, made little progress in the Senate.

(Photo by Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The high-profile lawsuit challenging Alabama’s 2022 law banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth under 19 has been dismissed by all parties involved.
Neither the plaintiffs – transgender youth and families challenging the ban – or the Alabama attorney’s office filed an official explanation for the move or a suggestion of a settlement with the court.  In separate statements, the plaintiffs said they would continue to fight for access to the care, while Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall declared it a total victory for the state and a vindication of their position.
“The shutting down of medical care in Alabama has forced our plaintiffs and other Alabama families to make heart wrenching decisions that no family should ever have to make, and they are each making the decisions they need to make that are right for them,” said Scott McCoy, deputy legal director of inclusion and anti-extremism litigation team at the Southern Poverty Law Center, in a joint statement from organizations representing the plaintiffs. “We salute the courage of these plaintiffs and we will continue fighting to ensure families across the country have the freedom to get their transgender children the proven medical care that enables them to thrive.”
Marshall declared the dismissal a decisive victory for the state and claimed in a statement that a “court-ordered discovery” uncovered what he described as “medical, legal, and political scandal that will be studied for decades.”
“We uncovered the truth,” the statement said. “We exposed the scandal. We won. Alabama led the way, and now all families are safer for it.”
Messages were left with the Attorney General’s office seeking clarification. According to the statement, the discovery process in the case revealed that “key medical organizations misled parents, promoted unproven treatments as settled science, and ignored growing international concern over the use of sex-change procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors,” but does not state how.
The statement also alleged that internal communications showed the “standards of care” were legally and politically crafted but does not provide specifics.
Felony
The law, known as the Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, made it a felony for medical providers to prescribe puberty blockers or hormones to transgender minors, carrying a potential prison sentence of up to 10 years. The law did not ban the use of puberty blockers to treat precocious puberty in cisgender children.
It also prohibited gender-affirming surgeries for individuals under 19, though health care providers have repeatedly testified such surgeries are not performed on minors.
The legislation led to immediate legal action after being signed into law by Gov. Kay Ivey in April 2022. Initially, a federal judge blocked the ban on medications, citing interference with parental rights and a lack of evidence demonstrating harm from the treatments. But that decision was overturned in August 2023 by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which stated that there was no fundamental right to gender-affirming care.
U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa, writing for the majority, cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which struck down federal abortion protections and ruled that abortion was not a right “deeply rooted in the nation’s history and tradition.” Lagoa wrote that gender-affirming care had no historic grounding in the law.

,DC,2025-05-05 22:06:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration asks to dismiss suit by 3 GOP states trying to limit abortion pill,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-asks-dismiss-suit-3-gop-states-trying-limit-abortion-pill,,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Justice wrote in a legal filing released Monday that three GOP-led states attempting to overturn federal prescribing guidelines for medication abortion have sought to keep a case going in the wrong place at the wrong time.The filing is significant since it appears to indicate the Trump administration will defend the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s decision nine years ago to broaden access to mifepristone. The Biden administration also sought to keep the newer prescribing guidelines intact.Idaho, Kansas and Missouri want a federal judge to let them intervene in a case that’s already been to the U.S. Supreme Court, so they can argue the FDA erred when it updated prescribing guidelines for mifepristone in 2016.The goal is to get those changes thrown out so use of mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion, reverts to what was in place between 2000 and 2016.That would cap medication abortion at seven weeks gestation instead of the current 10 weeks and patients seeking medication abortions would need to attend three, in-person doctor appointments. Medication abortion would no longer be available via telehealth and it could no longer be legally mailed to patients.The Trump administration wrote in a 15-page brief filed with the U.S. District Court for Northern District of Texas that the three states “cannot keep alive a lawsuit in which the original plaintiffs were held to lack standing, those plaintiffs have now voluntarily dismissed their claims, and the States’ own claims have no connection to this District.”“The States are free to pursue their claims in a District where venue is proper … but the States’ claims before this Court must be dismissed or transferred pursuant to the venue statute’s mandatory command,"" the brief adds.The Department of Justice also wrote that at “a minimum, the States’ challenge to FDA’s 2016 actions is time-barred because the States sought to intervene more than six years after FDA finalized those actions.”Original suit began in 2022The original case challenging the federal government’s 2000 approval and current prescribing guidelines for medication abortion began in November 2022 when anti-abortion groups filed their lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for Northern District of Texas.That case worked its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in June 2024 that the anti-abortion organizations lacked standing to bring the case.But Idaho, Kansas and Missouri state officials sought to intervene in the case before it reached the high court and have tried to keep the challenge to the 2016 prescribing guidelines moving forward.The Department of Justice wrote in its brief that there were several reasons the case shouldn’t continue in the Northern District of Texas.Among those is that the three states “fail to identify any actual or imminent controversy over whether any of their laws are preempted” and that they lack Article III standing since “they failed to exhaust their claims; and their challenge to FDA’s 2016 actions is outside the six-year statute of limitations.”The case is assigned to Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk, who overturned the FDA’s original 2000 approval of mifepristone in April 2023 in the original lawsuit.That ruling never took effect as the original lawsuit worked its way through the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and up to the Supreme Court.",,,,2025-05-05 19:09:39.344817

“This bill strikes a reasonable balance by aligning North Dakota’s interstate speed limit with two of our three neighboring states and increasing fines as a deterrent to speeding,” Armstrong said in a statement. 
On Aug. 1, North Dakota will join neighbors South Dakota and Montana at 80 mph on interstate highways. The top speed limit in Minnesota is 70 mph.

Legislature sends bill to raise North Dakota speed limit to governor

This year’s version of the bill, House Bill 1298, creates a new system of calculating speeding fines on all roads. 
For highways with a speed limit of 65 mph or higher, the fine will be $20 or $5 for every mile per hour over the limit, whichever is greater. 
In slower speed zones, there will be a $20 fine for speeding or $3 for every mile per hour over the limit, whichever is greater. 
For both road categories, going more than 16 mph over the limit adds $20 to the fine. 
Speeding in a construction zone with workers present jumps from an extra $80 fine to $150.
The bill passed Friday as the North Dakota Legislature wrapped up its session.

The lights stayed on overnight after a second night of unrest. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Another round of violence erupted Sunday on the campus of the South Dakota State Penitentiary, the Department of Corrections has confirmed.
The fight between inmates came a little more than a month after two other incidents on the penitentiary campus, one of which injured a female correctional officer. 
Those earlier events occurred shortly before the first meeting of a state work group debating the future of the oldest portions of the 144-year-old prison grounds in Sioux Falls. The female correctional officer was injured in the penitentiary, while the other fight took place between inmates in the maximum security Jameson Annex.
Prison work group peppered with public testimony in first Sioux Falls meeting

The work group toured both the penitentiary and Jameson Annex on April 2.
Michael Winder, spokesman for the department, did not say how many people were involved in Sunday’s violence, which he described via email as “a fight.” There were no “life-threatening injuries,” he wrote, and no correctional officers were injured. 
“It is an ongoing investigation,” Winder wrote. 
Winder did not reply to questions on the location of the violence or how it may have been quelled, but the family member of one inmate told South Dakota Searchlight that the event involved inmates in East Hall.
East Hall was the location of two nights of unrest just over a year ago at the penitentiary, which followed a temporary shutdown of tablet communications. Eleven inmates were charged with crimes for those incidents. 
Most of those inmates, prosecuted by the South Dakota Attorney General’s Office, have since taken plea deals for intentional damage to property. A man charged with aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer and another charged with reckless burning await trial, court records show. One inmate was acquitted of intentional damage to property at trial after raising questions about the security footage upon which the charge was based.
As of last week, no charges had been filed by the Attorney General’s Office for the violence that took place just before the first prison work group meeting in Sioux Falls.
Loved ones behind bars told Nicole Lloyd of Sioux Falls that Sunday’s violence involved more than a dozen people, originated in the chow hall and resulted in the use of pepper spray and a lockdown of inmates across the penitentiary.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado House of Representatives on Monday gave preliminary approval to a bill that would eliminate a second election requirement, unique to the state, for union formation, four months after the legislation was introduced and two days before the end of the lawmaking term.
After months of negotiation between labor and business groups, there was no deal reached among groups on opposing sides of debate around the measure, and the bill is the same as it was in January. That will set up a likely clash with Gov. Jared Polis, who has signaled opposition to the measure.
Senate Bill 25-5 was a priority for progressive Democrats this year. It would alter union law in the state by removing a second election requirement to negotiate union security, the term used when everyone in a workplace is required to pay into the representation a union provides, regardless of membership. In Colorado, a 50% vote is necessary to form a union, as is federal law, but a second election requiring a 75% vote is required to negotiate union security in a contract.

Unions negotiate compensation, benefits and workplace conditions for all workers, not just members.
That second election does not automatically require union security but allows it to be on the negotiating table. And workers could still decline to ratify a contract that includes union security.
“There is nothing in this bill that is requiring anything other than to be allowed to collectively bargain. And that is a decision and a choice that employees can make, and then that is a decision and a choice that everyone in that workplace can bargain over as well,” said bill sponsor Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat.
Bill supporters say the second election creates a massive barrier for strong union formation in the state and leads to Colorado’s low unionization rate.
“Something is happening between that first and second election. We heard stories of what’s happening between those elections. Workers are being dissuaded. Workers are being tantamount to intimidation,” Bacon said. “That second vote has demonstrated that it is a tangible barrier to being able to collectively bargain.”
The bill is also sponsored by Rep. Javier Mabrey, a Denver Democrat. It was sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat, and Sen. Jessie Danielson, a Wheat Ridge Democrat, in the Senate.
“This bill is about empowering Coloradans to stand up for better workplaces and to stand up for higher wages in an economy that is increasingly rigged against them,” Mabrey said, framing the vote in the context of growing wealth inequality and elimination of some workers rights and consumer protection efforts and the federal level.
The bill was previewed last year and introduced on the first day of the legislative session. From the start, Polis expressed wariness of signing a bill that didn’t reflect a compromise between labor and business.










Representing workers who are ready for change, we came to the table in good faith but business walked away from a meaningful compromise that would have made our system fairer and safer for working people.


– Dennis Dougherty, executive director of Colorado AFL-CIO


The Senate passed an unamended version of the bill in February. It languished on the House calendar for about a month after moving through its committees, as sponsors and stakeholders continued to discuss potential compromises.
That deal never came.
“Representing workers who are ready for change, we came to the table in good faith but business walked away from a meaningful compromise that would have made our system fairer and safer for working people,” Dennis Dougherty, the executive director of Colorado AFL-CIO, said in a statement over the weekend.
Loren Furman, the president of the Colorado Chamber of Commerce, rejected that characterization. Business groups including Colorado Concern and the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce were also involved in talks. She said the chamber offered three ideas that labor interests didn’t agree to, and that chamber’s members couldn’t agree to the “creative proposals” that the governor’s office came up with, one of which she said would have bifurcated small and large businesses in the matter.
“At the end of the day, it’s disappointing. I take this process very seriously and we have always tried to find a common ground or consensus on issues down here at the Capitol. This is a policy that’s been in place for 83 years, and yet we still came to the table and offered significant compromises that would’ve helped labor unions be more successful,” she said. “At the end of the day, it was really important to us that all employees have a say over whether or not these fees get withdrawn from their paychecks.”
House sponsors moved forward on the bill despite the absence of a negotiation. The bill needs a final, recorded vote in the House before it heads to the governor to either sign or veto.
Bacon urged Polis, as the “figurehead of the Democratic Party” in the state, to sign the bill. Last year, Polis vetoed two labor-related bills, which drew frustration and sharp criticism from unions and Democrats.
Republicans are uniformly against the bill. They generally agree with the Labor Peace Act, which established the second election, and view the 80-year-old law as a functioning compromise between labor and business.
“This (bill) is about forcing workers to pay union dues against their will, even if they want nothing to do with the union. It’s mandatory, compulsory fees,” said Rep. Chris Richardson, an Elizabeth Republican. “It’s about compelling association and compelling speech, and that’s wrong.”
On Monday, Democratic Rep. Bob Marshall of Highlands Ranch tried to run an amendment to get rid of the second election and allow union security negotiations if at least 60% of workers voted for the union formation. A similar amendment was determined to not fit under the title of the bill during committee, and his amendment on Monday was also ruled out of the scope of the bill’s title.
The legislative session ends Wednesday.

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)North Dakota now has four confirmed measles cases, the Department of Health and Human Services said Monday.
All four cases are in Williams County in northwest North Dakota involving people who were not vaccinated, said Molly Howell, immunization director for the department.
The department announced Friday the first confirmed case, a Williams County child who is believed to have contracted measles from an out-of-state visitor. The three additional cases are people who had contact with the child, Howell said.
The cases are the first reemergence of measles in North Dakota since 2011, Howell said.
A North Dakotan tested positive for measles in 2018, but after additional testing, the department confirmed that person did not have the illness, Howell said.
“Our advice to anyone in North Dakota is to be up to date with your immunizations, especially the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine,” Howell said. “Everyone starting at 12 to 15 months of age should receive their first dose of MMR vaccine and the second dose is recommended at 4 to 6 years of age.”
As of May 1, 935 people have contracted measles across the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those cases, 68% are people age 19 and younger. The federal health organization also said 121 people have been hospitalized and three deaths have resulted from the disease this year.
Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates

Howell said infant vaccination rates in North Dakota are at about 81% and school-aged children have about a 90% rate, but those rates differ depending on location. She added there are no immediate plans to roll out mobile vaccination clinics because the vaccines are readily available at local health care providers.
“It’s more concerning in areas where there are lower vaccination rates, so ideally, we’re hoping parents have a conversation with their trusted health care provider,” she said. 
With measles being a highly contagious illness, Howell said a 95% vaccination rate is recommended to contain the spread of the disease locally.
Howell said North Dakota public health agencies did lose some COVID-19 pandemic-related funding from the federal government in recent weeks, but she doesn’t believe the cuts will affect the state’s ability to respond to the measles cases.
“We’ll continue to ensure that North Dakotans across the state have access to MMR vaccines, and other vaccines,” she said.
Howell said people should not downplay the seriousness of measles, but she did not want people to panic either.
“What we want is for people to be informed of the benefits of vaccination versus the risks of the disease,” she said. “We used to have 5,000 to 6,000 cases per year before the vaccine was available, but people died and were hospitalized. And now we have a way to prevent it and there’s no reason for anyone to have to deal with this terrible disease.”
Howell said the department will continue to update its measles-dedicated website as more information becomes available.

SPRINGFIELD — The General Assembly’s independent forecasting commission has improved revenue projections for the upcoming fiscal year despite growing economic volatility.

That’s good news for state lawmakers who are in the final weeks of crafting the fiscal year 2026 budget set to take effect July 1. But the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability’s upward revision to its revenue forecast remains significantly more conservative than what Gov. JB Pritzker’s office projected when he proposed a budget in February.

COGFA’s latest update now projects $54.5 billion in revenue in FY26 – $266 million more than the commission’s March projection, but still $471 million below the governor’s February projection for baseline revenues.

Pritzker has also proposed changes to raise an additional $492 million in revenue in FY26, although that number is not factored into the baseline revenue comparison.

COGFA is also projecting state revenue will increase by $317 million in the current fiscal year 2025 compared to its March projection. That means the state would finish the fiscal year at the end of June with $53.9 billion of revenue – above the $53.3 billion lawmakers budgeted for and $31 million more than the governor’s office’s February forecast.

The projected revenue growth was driven by strong April income tax receipts. April revenue was up $593 million compared to April 2024 and was driven by 20% growth in income tax receipts, thanks to higher capital gains and interest earnings last year. Corporate income taxes also grew by 6.6% for the month, even though the revenue source remains down 8.2% for the fiscal year.

But there are warning signs in several areas, according to COGFA. The commission lowered expectations for federal receipts for FY25 by 8.5% and 6.3% in FY26 because the state has been using a fund outside the typical General Revenue Fund for Medicaid-related expenses. That means reimbursements from the federal government to the state are not reflected in the state’s General Revenue Fund total.

The commission also warned that the federal government could, at any time, decrease financial aid to states, creating more uncertainty.

“Those capital gains revenue increases are not sustainable so as we look at fiscal year 26, we should not expect that as we go into fiscal year 27, I think it’s going to be an even worse look,” COGFA Co-Chair Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said at a news conference last week.

COGFA Revenue Manager Eric Noggle wrote broader economic uncertainty necessitates a “more cautious approach” projecting next year’s revenue numbers.

“The unknown implications of tariffs create many questions related to the duration of the tariffs, their impact on prices, and if these changes could lead to a recession,” Noggle wrote. “These complicating factors and their potential impact on tax revenues make the revenue estimate for FY 2026 very challenging.”

Recent national economic reports have indicated the U.S. added more jobs than expected in April, but the nation’s gross domestic product declined by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, marking the first quarter of economic regression since 2022. Personal consumption grew by 1.8%, showing consumers overall aren’t yet cutting back, but it was the slowest growth since spring 2022.

“It’s very concerning because Illinois tends to lag the nation in economic growth and economic stability,” Davidsmeyer said.

The decline in GDP was driven by an increase in imports, COGFA Chief Economist Ben Varner wrote, because businesses are likely “front-loading” foreign purchases before tariffs imposed by the Trump administration kick in and make overseas goods more expensive. Imports are subtracted from domestic growth to calculate GDP.

National projections are also blaring more warnings. Wells Fargo modeling projects stagflation from tariffs and an increase in inflation will cause an economic downturn, while Goldman Sachs’ early April projection pegs the likelihood of a recession at 45%.

“The U.S. economy has entered a precarious phase, with early signs of contraction and rising inflation signaling the potential onset of stagflation,” Varner wrote. “While domestic demand and business investment remain relatively strong, they are being overshadowed by external shocks — particularly the surge in imports ahead of tariff implementation. The policy-driven volatility is already weighing on forecasts and investor confidence.”

The governor’s proposed $55.2 billion FY26 budget is based on a December S&P Global forecast that projected stable economic growth and considered some of Trump’s proposed economic policies, including tariffs and tax cut extensions, Pritzker budget office director Alexis Sturm said told a legislative committee in February.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)
A 1,100-bed immigrant detention facility located near the Essex County jail in Newark has started housing migrant detainees despite a legal challenge by Newark officials who sued to prevent the building from opening.


The facility — called Delaney Hall and operated by private prison company Geo Group under a 15-year contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — is the largest migrant jail on the east coast. Newark officials have argued that Geo Group did not secure the city permits needed for it to open.


It’s the first immigrant detention facility to open under the second term of President Donald Trump, who has pledged a mass detention and deportation effort. And it’s the first to open in New Jersey after Gov. Phil Murphy signed a 2021 law banning private and public entities from contracting to detain immigrants. A federal judge struck down the portion of the law that pertains to private companies in 2023, though a panel of federal judges heard the state’s appeal of that ruling last week.


ICE officials said statistics on how many people are detained at Delaney Hall will be available in the coming weeks.
The news was first reported by the New Jersey Globe.


Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat running to become our next governor, said during a press conference Monday morning that the city will go back to court for the “blatant disregard for laws.” The city fire inspector was at Delaney Hall Monday and was not allowed in, according to Baraka.


The mayor said he doesn’t know how many people are jailed inside the facility.


Geo Group spokesman Christopher Ferreira said Delany Hall has a valid certificate of occupancy issued by the city and complies with all health and safety requirements.


“This attempt by the Mayor’s Office to stop the operation of a lawful federal immigration processing center at the Delaney Hall facility in Newark is another unfortunate example of a politicized campaign by sanctuary city and open borders politicians in New Jersey to interfere with the federal government’s efforts to arrest, detain, and deport dangerous criminal illegal aliens in accordance with established federal law,” he said in a statement.
The U.S. Department of Justice in an April legal filing called Newark’s move to prevent the reopening of Delaney Hall an “admitted, aggressive, and legally unjustified” push to interfere with federal immigration enforcement.


Delaney Hall previously held immigrant detainees from 2011 to 2017. There’s another privately run immigrant jail located in Elizabeth.

Steve Daines, a “fellow Bobcat,” presented outgoing Montana State University President Waded Cruzado on Saturday with the Congressional Record of remarks he made regarding her tenure at the Bozeman flagship.
“She has been a tireless leader, pushing MSU to new heights, both academically and in athletics,” Daines said on the floor. “Her passion for the success of her students has transformed not only the MSU campus, but our great state of Montana as well.”
In August 2024, Cruzado announced her retirement in June 2025 after 15 years at the helm of MSU.
The Montana Board of Regents tapped the president of Northern Michigan University and former Montana University System deputy commissioner Brock Tessman as the next MSU president.
In July, Tessman will take the reins of MSU, now the largest campus in Montana.
On April 7, Daines, a Republican from Bozeman, delivered prepared remarks on the Senate floor about the achievements of Cruzado before placing a Bobcats ballcap on his head.
“Go, Cats,” he said.
Daines also shared his personal connections to MSU.
“Dr. Cruzado has served as the beloved President of Montana State University, my alma mater, since 2010,” Daines said in prepared remarks. “In fact, three out of our four children graduated from MSU during her tenure as president.”
He named record-breaking accomplishments, including a 26% enrollment increase to more than 17,000 students, retention growth to 75%, “the highest it’s been in 30 years,” and graduation rates hitting the highest in more than 20 years.
Daines said Cruzado pushed research expenditures up by 162%, “making MSU the leading research institution in the state.”
“The school was recognized by the Carnegie Classification of Institutes of Higher Education and the American Council on Education as one of the most productive research institutions in the U.S.,” Daines said.
In February 2025, MSU announced it was among 187 institutions in the nation to receive an “R1” designation, denoting “very high research output and doctoral education.” It also was recognized as having “very high undergraduate” enrollment, or a high percentage of undergraduate students.
MSU said it was “among only four universities in the country to receive both distinctions.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image002-1024x677.png,,,2025-05-05 18:04:50.875515

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerTwo days before she was killed in November, allegedly at the hands of her son, Montpelier resident Mary Gomes made multiple calls to a local mental health agency about him — but an employee declined to visit her home, a new lawsuit alleges. The allegation was raised in a wrongful termination suit filed last week in Washington County Superior Court by Jordan Houston, a former employee of Washington County Mental Health Services.According to Houston’s lawsuit, she was fired from her role as a crisis clinician/emergency screener in January after raising concerns about another employee of the agency. The complaint accuses that employee of “abusive and harassing behavior” and “lapses of judgement, errors and other work-related problems.”The lawsuit stems from alleged incidents in the days before a double homicide shocked Montpelier late last year. On Nov. 15, Matthew Gomes allegedly murdered his parents, Jerry Gomes, 77, and Mary Gomes, 60 during an apparent mental health crisis. He has pleaded not guilty.According to Houston’s lawsuit, which was first reported by freelance journalist Mike Donoghue, Mary Gomes had called Washington County Mental Health Services multiple times on Nov. 13 — two days before her death — and requested a visit from mental health professionals. But the employee who had taken those calls had declined to visit the Gomeses’ home, saying that when mental health workers had assessed Matthew Gomes in the past, it had upset him, according to the complaint.“I didn’t want to make it worse,” the employee later told Houston, the lawsuit alleges. In an interview, Houston said the mental health agency had a history of working with the Gomes family, and that Mary and Jerry Gomes knew when it was necessary to call for mental health assistance — like they allegedly did before they were killed. “I do think it could have been prevented,” Houston said. “And that’s kind of why I had to fall on the sword here. I couldn’t have lived with myself if I didn’t.” Beth Sightler, the CEO of Washington County Mental Health Services, expressed concern about unspecified “misinformation and mischaracterizations” in an emailed statement.“We thank our current staff for their appropriate and professional response during the week of November 15, 2024, and we are confident in the chronology of events, procedures, and responsive actions during that time,” Sightler said. “We support and defend our staff, we are proud of the difficult work we have done and continue to do, even in the face of inaccurate and harmful claims.”READ MORE

According to the lawsuit, Houston brought concerns about the other employee to supervisors the week after the killing, texting a supervisor that she had previously raised concerns about her coworker and that those concerns “hadn’t changed.”When a supervisor contacted her to set up a meeting, Houston said she asked to have another staffer — “someone on my side” — be present.“Ok I will consult with folks about next steps here Jordan as I am at a loss as to what to do in our relationship moving forward,” the supervisor texted in a reply, according to the suit.Houston was then placed on administrative leave for “unspecified misconduct,” and was ultimately fired in January, the court filing said. The lawsuit, which names Washington County Mental Health Services as a defendant, seeks compensatory and punitive damages and for Houston to be reinstated.

Witnesses reported the Iron Fire around noon Sunday in the Iron Mesa area of the Gila Wilderness. It occurred amid a Red Flag Warning in the area due to dry conditions and wind gusts exceeding 40 mph. 
The fire ignited in a remote area within the 2012 Whitewater Baldy Fire burn scar and is burning in grass, heavy dead and downed fuel and timber, according to an update from the Gila National Forest.
Brace for a bleak water year on top of ‘nightmare’ fire weather season

A spokesperson for the Gila National Forest said Monday afternoon no formal update on the fire was expected until Monday evening, but the conditions are improving. 
“We haven’t seen significant growth today, under cloudy skies, cooler temps, and much lighter winds. We even had some snow over the fire this morning,” spokesperson Maribeth Pecotte wrote via email. 
No homes are under evacuation orders, Gila forest officials said in an update, though those at recreational facilities at Snow Lake are ordered to leave. Also, crews are assessing whether structures in the Willow Creek area need to be protected, Pecotte said. 
Nearly 50 people are responding to the fire, including two helicopters, two engines and two Hotshot teams. Two more teams are on their way, along with four additional engines. High winds Sunday prevented helicopters from collecting water at nearby Snow Lake, according to the Forest Service. 
As of Monday morning, the last update given, the fire was 0% contained. Its cause has not been determined.
The fire occurs in an area where snowpack is far below normal, including some areas in Southwestern New Mexico where it is 0% of the median snowpack that accumulated there between 1991 and 2020. 
‘It’s bad’: How drought, lack of snowpack and federal cuts could spell wildfire disaster in NM

According to the May national wildfire outlook from the National Interagency Fire Center, citing drought and other factors, all of Southwestern New Mexico should expect above-normal fire conditions. The outlook for much of the rest of the state has improved to normal, however, according to the outlook.
In addition to the dangerous conditions, more than 25 people who work in the Gila National Forest were fired earlier this year as part of federal cost-cutting measures. It’s not clear how many of them returned to work due to federal orders or how many are on administrative leave.

Hawkeye Community College was one of five community colleges to receive grant funding, including Des Moines Area Community College, Kirkwood Community College, Iowa Lakes Community College and Western Iowa Tech Community College.
Funding in 2025 for the Iowa Registered Apprenticeship Act provided $2.94 million to 59 programs, according to the release, contributing to 5,133 apprentices. A separate $427,800 was awarded to newly developed registered apprenticeship programs in 19 high-demand career fields.
Iowa continues to see returns on investment from its commitment to supporting registered apprentice programs more than 10 years ago, said Beth Townsend, executive director of Iowa Workforce Development, in the release. Both program and apprenticeship numbers have increased, she said in the release, and in 2024, Iowa became a State Apprenticeship Agency, which allowed for better oversight and expanding reach across the state.
“I applaud the program sponsors receiving grant funds today who are committed to preparing the workers of tomorrow using the Registered Apprenticeship model,” said Gov. Kim Reynolds in the release. “Registered Apprenticeship programs play a critical role in our overall workforce strategy. As we demonstrated in the Teacher-Paraeducator Registered Apprenticeship program, using a tried and true model in a nontraditional field is a win-win for Iowans and employers, and I am pleased to see a number of our schools receive funding under this program.”

Kennedy Jr. and the agency he leads from dismantling key public health programs.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha is one of three co-leaders challenging the Trump administration’s mass layoff of 10,000 HHS employees under its “Make America Healthy Again” initiative. The 101-page complaint claims the mass layoff has left HHS unable to perform its statutory functions of protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of Americans.
The other co-leaders are New York Attorney General Letitia James and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown. They are joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.
After termination notices went out to HHS employees on April 1, the complaint states employees were immediately expelled from their work email, laptops, and offices. Five of HHS’s 10 regional offices were closed, including Boston, Chicago, Dallas, New York City, San Francisco and Seattle. 
“There was no one to answer the phone, factories went into shutdown mode, experiments were abandoned, trainings were cancelled, site visits were postponed, application portals were closed, laboratories stopped testing for infectious diseases such as hepatitis, and partnerships were immediately suspended,” the complaint states.
As a result, the Food and Drug Administration missed a vaccine application deadline and canceled a critical test for the bird flu virus. The World Trade Center Health Program had no doctors to certify new illnesses for coverage, a necessary part of caring for the responders and survivors of the 9/11 attacks under the Zadroga Act. Programs aimed at monitoring maternal and newborn health were shuttered. Office closures and layoffs at Head Start and Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program left grantees “abandoned with no one to answer their questions.” The World Trade Center Health Program had no doctors to certify new illnesses for coverage, a necessary part of caring for the responders and survivors of the 9/11 attacks. Programs aimed at monitoring maternal and newborn health were abruptly shuttered. 
“Americans across the country are already experiencing the detrimental effects of this attack on HHS including new mothers, workers, 9/11 first responders, and those suffering from mental illness and substance use disorder,” Neronha said in a statement. “Think about that for a minute: American heroes, pregnant women, workers, those in need of mental health treatment; all left to fend for themselves by these reckless cuts. This attack on HHS tells you everything you need to know about the priorities of this Administration; and they don’t include the health of you or your family.”
Rhode Island has already lost over $1.9 million in grants, staff, programs and data, according to Neronha’s office, and stands to lose more in grants, staff, programs, and data. State health programs and initiatives already eliminated or negatively impacted without the support of HHS funding and staff include maternal mortality studies and prevention; treatment for nicotine and alcohol addiction; air quality monitoring. 
The 20 attorneys general argue that the sweeping actions at HHS violated hundreds of federal statutes and regulations. They argued that by taking these actions without congressional approval, the administration disregarded the constitutional separation of powers and undermined the laws and budgets enacted by Congress.
The coalition is asking the court to halt the mass firings, reverse the illegal reorganization, and restore the critical health services serving millions of Americans.
The case has been assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan.
Neronha also joined a coalition of 23 attorneys general in filing an April 1 lawsuit in Providence federal court against Kennedy and the Trump administration for abruptly and unlawfully slashing billions of dollars in vital state health funding. District Judge Mary S. McElroy issued a temporary restraining order against the administration on April 5, temporarily reinstating the funding.

SPRINGFIELD — Health care unions continue to rally for legislation to address understaffing they say strains hospitals and threatens both patient safety and staff well-being.

Lawmakers are considering the Hospital Worker Staff and Safety bill, which would establish mandatory nurse-to-patient staffing ratios and increase support for underfunded hospitals.

The proposed legislation, Senate Bill 21 and House Bill 3512, aims to establish minimum staffing ratios in hospitals and fund critical safety-net hospitals across the state. Advocates with health care worker unions have been holding a series of rallies at the Capitol in support of the legislation in recent weeks.

“Our hospitals are staffed unsafely,” Kawana Gant, a certified nursing assistant at UChicago Medicine Ingalls Memorial Hospital in Harvey, said at a recent Statehouse rally. “I have worked short shifts where there are 30 patients and only one CNA on the floor. How can you give quality care? It is not safe.”

Gant, who has worked at Ingalls Hospital for nearly 30 years, says she has watched many of her colleagues quit due to the mental and physical toll the short staffing has had on their bodies.

“This is an opportunity for legislators to hear us, to know that these hospitals are not safe.” Gant said.

But similar versions of the proposed legislation have been introduced at the Statehouse for recent years and have failed to gain traction. Generally backed by unions representing nurses, such as the Service Employees International Union, previous staffing ratio measures have run into opposition from hospital groups that say they’re unworkable.

The proposed legislation filed this year has yet to receive a hearing in a substantive committee, meaning it will be an uphill battle for it to move by the time the legislature adjourns at the end of the month.

Like previous versions, it would mandate that hospitals “employ and schedule sufficient staff to ensure quality patient care and safety.” In addition, hospitals would have to share annual staffing metrics with the Illinois Department of Public Health to help ensure they are at proper staffing levels.

“This bill gives you a real voice,” Rep. Kam Buckner, D-Chicago, said to rallygoers. “It gives you a way to speak up when things are unsafe for you and the people who you care for.”

However, not all lawmakers are convinced that now is the right time to implement staffing ratios.

“You can mandate the staffing ratios, but if those professionals don’t exist, what have you really done?” said Rep. Norine Hammond, R-Macomb. “We’ve been trying for years to get more people into the health care field, especially after COVID, and we’re just not there yet.”

Hammond expressed concern that enforcing strict staffing requirements without enough qualified workers in the pipeline could place unrealistic burdens on hospitals. She warned that such mandates might unintentionally strain facilities already struggling with labor shortages and lead to adverse financial consequences, especially for smaller or rural hospitals.

Hospital trade groups echo those concerns, calling the legislation unworkable, burdensome and an ineffective way to solve a problem that should be addressed by the specific needs of each hospital or care center. The Illinois Health and Hospital Association, the Association of Safety Net Community Hospitals and the Illinois Critical Access Hospital Network issued a statement saying they strongly oppose HB 3512.

They said it was introduced “as a backdoor effort pushed by organized labor to impose unworkable, government-imposed health care staffing ratios in Illinois.”





“This proposal would relegate the essential, complex and nuanced protocols established to safely and efficiently staff a hospital 24/7/365, to a series of burdensome forms and onerous paperwork that hospitals would be required to submit to the (IDPH) to establish minimum staffing standards for every hospital worker, in each hospital unit,” the groups said in the statement.

Still, according to a recent Service Employees International Union survey of Chicago area hospital workers, 70% of respondents reported understaffing, and over 25% reported unsafe or unmanageable workloads. Additionally, in the same survey, 47% of the respondents stated an intent to leave their jobs soon.

To help enforce safety standards, the legislation introduces “assignment despite objection forms” that give hospital workers the opportunity to document and report any assignments that they believe are unsafe. Hospitals are then required to provide this information to IDPH, which would have to publish an annual report on all these staffing metrics. The legislation would also require IDPH to “make recommendations for minimum staffing standards for hospital workers in each hospital unit.”

In addition to protecting staff, advocates said this bill would allocate proper essential resources to underfunded hospitals around the state, including Mount Sinai Hospital on Chicago's West Side, a Level 1 trauma center that helps underserved and violence-impacted communities.

“Mount Sinai saved my son's life,” said Sonya Brown, who traveled from Chicago to Springfield recently to advocate for the safety-net hospital that treated her son after he was shot seven times in 2020.

“He was shot in the head, he was shot in the neck, he was shot in the chest, the abdomen and shoulder, and the arm,” Brown said. “If they wouldn't have gotten to him in time, he would have died.”

Mount Sinai serves as a health care provider for communities on both the South and West sides of Chicago, areas that experience some of Chicago's highest rates of gun violence. If the hospitals are not protected by measures in this legislation, advocates said, the victims in these neighborhoods risk longer travel times to alternative trauma centers.

They said the bills would help allocate essential resources and enforce staffing standards at safety-net hospitals to continue effectively serving vulnerable communities.

“All of our staff is overworked,” said Jessica Mendoza, a nursing assistant at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital in Hines. “A lot of our veterans are coming into the VA to get help with their health, but we do not have the staff to provide it.”

Mendoza, who has worked at the Hines VA Hospital for nearly two years, said that due to the low number of staff, they rarely get a break. She noted that the lack of sufficient staffing makes it difficult to provide the level of care that the veterans need.

The health care workers and advocates gathering in Springfield at the recent rally emphasized that without sufficient staffing and resources, the quality of patient care throughout Illinois hospitals will continue declining, and worker burnout will escalate.

“They expect you to do the job of five or six people but pay you for one.” Sen. Lakesia Collins, D-Chicago, said at the rally. Prior to joining the General Assembly, Collins was a CNA in nursing homes.

As the legislation stagnates at the Capitol, hospital workers and advocates said they plan to keep organizing and sharing their stories. They said they're calling on lawmakers to prioritize frontline health care workers and the patients who depend on them.

Support for the field research was provided by the National Science Foundation) When standing in many places in Yellowstone National Park, the signs of a buried heat source are unmistakable, making one inclined to wonder “how far beneath my feet is there magma?”
The answer is important to fundamental science questions about magma reservoirs as well as for understanding the potential hazards from Yellowstone. And, it’s just a darn interesting question, too!
There is a long history of physical and chemical measurements that provide evidence for magma beneath Yellowstone caldera, with estimates for the depth to the top of the reservoir ranging from about 3 to 9 kilometers (about 2 to 5.5 miles) beneath the surface. Most prior seismic imaging estimated a smooth 3-D structure that is informative regarding the approximate size, shape, and location of magma storage. A limitation is that the resulting edges of the reservoir are blurry. Sharpening the view is important, as better knowledge of the depth and characteristics of the top of the magma reservoir would give additional insights into magma storage and release of magmatic gases.
To obtain that sharper view of the top of the magma reservoir, to determine its depth, and whether it is marked by a gradual or sharp transition, a group of seismologists used a controlled seismic source and hundreds of seismometers to image the subsurface. The “controlled source” was a 53,000-pound truck with a vibrating hydraulic plate that creates seismic signals, like tiny custom earthquakes. During the summer of 2020, the truck created these custom earthquakes on numerous paved roadside turnouts throughout the caldera. The work was done in the middle of night to avoid impacting park visitors, both from the minor ground vibrations and any traffic delays. The seismic signals created by the truck were measured at several dozen permanent Yellowstone Seismic Network stations, as well as about 600 temporarily installed seismometers that were deployed along roads and trails specifically for this seismic experiment. The seismic waves generated by the truck were tuned to bounce off the magma chamber, with the data from that reflection hopefully providing new insights into just where the top of the magma chamber is located and what it looks like.
The results are in, recently published in the journal Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08775-9). The answer? There is a very sharp transition marking the magma chamber top at about 3.8 km (2.4 miles) depth beneath the northeastern part of the caldera near the Yellowstone River.
Beyond locating the top of the magma reservoir and determining that the boundary is less than about 100 meters thick, the seismologists estimated the concentration and type of fluids present at the very top of the reservoir. They found that a two-part mixture of only magma and solid mineral crystals would not fit the strength of the reflected seismic signals, but a three-part mixture with supercritical fluid bubbles, magma, and solid mineral crystals can explain the reflections much better. This result is consistent with geochemical models that indicate bubbles would be coming out of magma stored at depths as shallow as 3.8 km (2.4 mi). At greater depths, and correspondingly greater pressures, the elements that form the bubbles would stay dissolved within the magma. But at the depth measured from the new seismic data, bubbles would emerge from the magma and rise to form a cap layer atop the magma reservoir.
That might sound alarming—bubble accumulation in magma reservoir can be an important step toward creating the conditions suitable for eruption—but it depends on the concentrations of magma and bubbles. Fortunately, the Yellowstone magma system appears to be in a stable configuration. The seismic reflection results suggest about 14% fluid and about 86% solid crystals in the cap layer of the reservoir. Under these conditions, bubbles are expected to rise efficiently toward the surface, which prevents excessive build-up of pressure. And indeed, this fits with gas measurements that find magmatic gases emitted at the surface in many areas of Yellowstone National Park.
Finding evidence for bubbles atop the Yellowstone magma reservoir gives new perspectives that align with the long-term view of a magmatic system that is mostly solid and currently stable. The results also highlight that it may be within reach to measure bubble accumulation beneath volcanoes in general, demonstrating once again that using Yellowstone as a natural laboratory can help better understand volcanoes and their eruptions elsewhere on Earth.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana lawmakers might eliminate requirements that political donations and spending on constitutional amendments, tax millages and other election propositions be made available to the public. The change would result in voters knowing less about who is working to pass or defeat ballot measures they are asked to consider. 

Rep. Mark Wright, R- Covington, chairman of the House Republican Caucus, has sponsored House Bill 596. It would make dozens of changes to Louisiana campaign finance reporting laws, including one to end finance reporting requirements for a “proposition or question to be submitted to the voters.”

Should his bill pass, campaign contributions and political spending in an election that doesn’t involve a candidate would not have to be made public. The change would apply to proposed state constitutional amendments, property tax measures, local government charter changes and gambling legalization initiatives, among other referenda. 

The fundraising and spending for Gov. Jeff Landry’s failed constitutional amendments on taxes, spending and criminal justice would have been kept secret if these law changes had been in place. Political advertising buys for a controversial ballot measure that established the city of St. George in East Baton Rouge Parish also would have been unknown. 
Transparency about campaign spending on property tax hikes and renewals – such as one that failed Saturday for the East Baton Rouge District Attorney’s Office and one that narrowly passed for the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office – also wouldn’t be required anymore. 

Stephen Gelé, a private attorney who handles campaign finance and ethics reports for the governor, helped write the legislation. Onerous campaign finance reporting requirements for ballot measures outweigh the good they provide, he said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

“The minimal benefits of mandating the reporting of spending on ballot measures – considering the difficulty in enforcement and lack of significant risk of corruption from such spending – is outweighed by the cost of the heavy burden imposed on the constitutional right to free speech by such mandates,” Gelé said in a written statement Sunday. 

Individuals and business interests might be less likely to contribute to a particular ballot measure campaign if they know their identity will be disclosed, according to Gelé. Allowing citizens to remain anonymous encourages more participation in the political process, he said. 
The reasons for mandating transparency on political contributions and spending on candidates also don’t necessarily apply to ballot measures, Gelé said, because a ballot measure can’t be corrupted or bribed like a candidate.

Advocates for government transparency are concerned, however. Steven Procopio with the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, said his organization opposes the change and believes it would be a “step back” for the state, which has been trying to ditch its reputation for sleazy politics. 
“I not only think it is a bad idea, I can’t believe the citizens won’t be angry when they find out about it,” Procopio said in an interview Friday. 

Louisiana’s campaign finance reporting laws for ballot measures are already weak and make it nearly impossible to figure out who is funding the campaigns surrounding those propositions. 

For example, the groups opposing and supporting the four constitutional amendments on the March 29 ballot spent more than $1 million combined. Who provided the money for the campaigns wasn’t clear, however, because the requirements for donor disclosure for ballot propositions are easy to skirt. 

The two largest spenders on the March amendments did not reveal who was paying for their amendment campaign efforts.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The Vera Institute of Justice spent at least $400,000 on a campaign to defeat Amendment 3, which would have made it easier to send more minors to adult prisons. Based in New York City, Vera took in more than $260 million over the past two years but is not required, as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit under the federal tax code, to disclose its contributors. 
Likewise, a “social welfare” organization called Protect Louisiana Values that was set up to support Landry spent $300,000 to back Amendment 2, which would have made dozens of tax and budget changes to the Louisiana Constitution. It is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit – sometimes referred to as a “dark money” political organization by critics – and also doesn’t have to reveal its donors. 
Should Wright’s legislation pass, not only would donors for proposition campaigns no longer be disclosed, but the amount of money being spent and the campaign vendors being paid for advertising and other organization efforts also wouldn’t be known. 

Landry is pushing for the proposal right after he spent weeks trying to blame billionaire philanthropist George Soros for the March amendments’ failure. The governor has repeatedly claimed Soros funded the opposition campaign, though Landry hasn’t provided evidence to support the assertion. Public finance records are also too vague to determine whether Soros was involved. 
A Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor, Soros is a major donor to liberal causes and has served as a bogeyman for conservatives for years. He never claimed to be involved in the Louisiana election, though he openly spent millions on a Wisconsin Supreme Court race that took place just a few days later in April. 

“There was a lot of misinformation and straight-up lies about where the money for the Amendment 3 campaign came from,” Sarah Omojola with the Vera Institute said. “So I find it interesting that this [bill] is coming forward now.” 

Republican leaders in the Legislature are attempting to put another proposal to change the state’s tax and budget structure back on the ballot within the next year. In its new iteration, it consists of multiple constitutional amendments.

Should Wright’s legislation pass, the campaign operations surrounding those new constitutional amendments would be largely a secret. 

His bill is expected to come up for an initial vote Wednesday in the Louisiana House and Governmental Affairs Committee.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image00009-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-05 18:04:50.875515

Whil[...],"(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)A federal judge has extended a temporary restraining order barring the Department of Homeland Security from deporting four international students at the University of Iowa while she considers whether to convert that order into a preliminary injunction.
The students are suing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for revoking their status as students. While the students have been pursuing their case under a series of “John Doe” pseudonyms, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger ruled Monday that the students will have to publicly identify themselves or drop out of the case within the next 24 hours.
The students’ identities have already been revealed to Homeland Security, but lawyers for the four had argued their clients shouldn’t be forced to publicly reveal their identities in order to pursue their lawsuit against the government. Ebinger found the students’ generalized fear of harassment didn’t meet “the very high standard” for granting them anonymity, citing past court rulings that say court proceedings “are only truly public when the public knows the identities of the litigants.”
Also on Monday, Ebinger agreed to extend, for 14 days, her temporary restraining order protecting the four international students from being detained or deported by ICE or Homeland Security. She said she plans to rule on whether to grant a preliminary injunction to that effect before the restraining order expires.
According to the lawsuit, each of the plaintiffs was admitted to the United States on an F-1 student visa. The students claim the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has violated their due process rights by terminating their student status without legal justification or explanation.
Named as defendants in the case are Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of which Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is a part. Also named as a defendant is Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons.
In granting the students’ initial request for a temporary restraining order, Ebinger concluded the students had “demonstrated a likelihood of success” as to their legal claims and had also shown they could otherwise be subjected to irreparable harm.
The judge noted there had been no suggestion that any of the recognized, lawful reasons for terminating the plaintiffs’ status as students — such as providing false information to the government, engaging in unauthorized employment, or failing to engage in an approved course of study — appeared to exist or were even argued by Homeland Security as a justification for its actions.
At Monday’s hearing, Ebinger asked Homeland Security’s lawyers whether they opposed the students’ request for an extension of the temporary restraining order.
“I’ve been instructed by my client not to agree to an extension of the temporary restraining order,” Department of Justice attorney Rachel J. Scherle replied.
Since beginning their studies, the lawsuit claims, the plaintiffs have maintained their status as students, are in good academic standing and have not committed any serious criminal offenses. Three of the four are studying chemical engineering, economics or exercise science, while the fourth is working for the State of Iowa as an epidemiologist.
DHS: Students’ status signifies only a ‘red flag’
The lawsuit claims that on April 10, 2025, ICE abruptly canceled, without explanation, the plaintiffs’ status as students within DHS’ Student and Exchange Visitor Information System database.
Four days later, the lawsuit claims, three of the plaintiffs each received identical messages from U.S. embassies, warning them that “remaining in the United States can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation,” and adding that “deportation can take place at a time that does not allow the person being deported to secure possessions or conclude affairs in the United States. Persons being deported may be sent to countries other than their countries of origin.”
The lawsuit claims Homeland Security’s “lack of transparency and procedural safeguards created chaos within educational institutions and upended the lives of lawful F-1 visa holders.”
The lawsuit emphasizes that the plaintiffs are not challenging the revocation of their F-1 student visas but are instead challenging DHS’ termination of their student status to create a “pretext for future adverse immigration actions against them.”
At Monday’s hearing, Ebinger questioned Homeland Security’s position that terminating the plaintiffs’ status as students isn’t a precursor to deportation and merely indicates there is some sort of “red flag” that called for additional investigation by the federal government.
“You keep saying it’s a ‘red flag’ for further investigation,” Ebinger said, and then asked where such a characterization was documented and whether that information was ever communicated to the students or their school.
Lawyers for Homeland Security acknowledged the “red flag” status wasn’t communicated directly to the students, but also noted that the warnings of detention and deportation, while based on DHS’ action, came from the embassies, not from DHS itself.
A group from Iowa City attended Monday’s hearing as a show of a support for the plaintiffs. UI graduate student Miranda Schene said she felt it was important to show that the students have people behind them.
“I just think that this is an incredibly important issue for all of the University of Iowa students,” said Schene, a doctoral student in molecular physiology and biophysics, “because this is one of those cases that’s determining whether or not students who come here internationally actually have the freedom to stay and finish their degrees without fear of arbitrary punishment by the government.”
Marie Krebs said while she supports the plaintiffs’ desire to keep their identities from being made public, having their names out could help garner additional support. “I can’t imagine the trauma that they’re enduring behind this,” she said. “They’ve got to be really scared.”
Oliver Weilein, a member of Iowa City’s city council, also attended the proceedings and said he was concerned that disclosure of the students’ names might make them a target of bigots. Homeland Security’s actions, he said, “does not come out of concern for our community. This doesn’t come out of concern for criminals being in our country. This comes out of racism. This comes out of wanting to make immigrants go back.”
Nicole Yeager of the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students said the case is one of many attacks on public education now taking place. “There are so many students right now who can’t sleep at night,” Yeager said. “The loss of community benefit and good and incredible scholarly work is there, and we’ll never fully know the impact of that.”

Judge: Due process is important
At Monday’s hearing, attorneys for the four international students at UI noted that Homeland Security provided new and relevant testimony last week in a District of Columbia court hearing surrounding the federal government’s efforts to terminate thousands of student records within the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.
In that hearing, Homeland Security’s assistant director for national security, Andre Watson, discussed ICE’s “student criminal alien initiative.” He described how 10 to 20 ICE employees spent several weeks combing through the records of 1.3 million holders of student visas to determine whether any of them might have had some form of interaction with law enforcement, such as a traffic violation that was later dismissed.
An exasperated D.C. District Court Judge Ana C. Reyes asked Watson, “Are you telling me that with all of the cost cutting that we have going on right now — because apparently we’re spending too much money in the federal government doing things like, oh, I don’t know, funding cancer research, can’t afford to do that — that we had, not ‘we,’ but ‘someone,’ had 10 to 20 federal employees spend their time going name by name in a database to see what hits they got for 1.3 million people? Is that what happened? Yes or no.”
“Yes,” Watson replied. He explained that of the 1.3 million student names, less than half of 1%, or roughly 6,400 student names, were passed on to the State Department. The State Department then revoked visas to travel into the United States for 3,000 of those students, and then told Homeland Security to terminate those students’ status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.
After hearing from Watson, Judge Reyes cited what she called the federal government’s “utter lack of concern for human individuals who we have invited into our country and who have communities richer by being students who have contributed to our colleges and who have paid our colleges.” She then went on to explain the concept of “due process” for all those in the courtroom.
“OK, let’s do a quiz today,” she said. “Anyone know where the due process clause from the Fifth Amendment comes from? Anybody? Nobody knows where the due process clause or the Fifth Amendment comes from? Not my clerks? We’re going to have discussions afterwards. It comes from Article — chapter, article, whatever you want to the call it — Article 39 of the Magna Carta. That’s where it first appeared. It appeared as the law of the land. It was amended in the 1300s to be ‘due process,’ but the due process comes from the Magna Carta.
“Anyone want to remind me what century the Magna Carta was in? It was in the 1200s. So when I say, or when the courts say, ‘Due process is important,’ we’re not unhinged. We’re not radicals. We are literally trying to enforce a process embodied in probably the most significant document with respect to peoples’ rights against tyrannical government oppression. That’s what we’re doing here, OK?”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gavel-scales-courtroom-getty-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-05-05 18:04:50.875515

Title X, a federal program that has been providing money for family planning services to states for over 50 years, flows through the nonprofit Converge to 91 clinics in Mississippi, including Five Horizons. But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on March 31 told Converge it was withholding its funding indefinitely. 
The organization’s head said despite complying with the demands of the letter, the funds still haven’t been distributed and she hasn’t been told if or when they will be. The nonprofit had to furlough half of its Title X staff, who will be laid off June 1 if the funding doesn’t come through. 
Seven states, including Mississippi, had Title X funds completely withheld, while another sixteen had their funds partially withheld. An estimated 834,000 people nationwide would be affected if the funds are never disbursed, Guttmacher estimates.  
Clinics around the state are scrambling to notify patients of cost increases for services like birth control, cancer screening and testing for sexually transmitted infections. 
Delta Health Center, which operates 17 safety net clinics covering six counties in the Mississippi Delta, is short $250,000 for family planning services as a result of the funding freeze.
They’re now unable to provide contraception for free as a result of the loss of funds, according to administrator Robin Boyles. 
Boyles said Delta Health Center staff always did everything they could to make sure patients could access whatever medication their provider prescribed – regardless of cost. And as a federally qualified health center, they continue to provide services and see patients on a sliding fee scale. 
But in the past week, a provider called her to ask if the clinic still had the funds to cover the birth control implant Nexplanon or an IUD for a patient. 
Without the Title X dollars to reimburse for the medicine, however, a patient without insurance would have been on the hook $540 for Nexplanon or $371 for a Mirena IUD – two of the most effective forms of contraception. 
Those most harmed by the delayed funding will be young adults who received next to no sexual education growing up in Mississippi, says Maggie White, a nurse practitioner at Five Horizons. The clinic sees a lot of patients from Mississippi State University, which educates about 23,000 students a year.  
Mississippi allows school districts to adopt one of two types of sexual education curricula: abstinence-only or abstinence-plus. Abstinence-only education promotes abstinence until marriage, while abstinence-plus programs encourage abstinence but include some information about contraception. 
“They don’t know anything (about sexual health),” White said. “… They’ll come in for sinus stuff, and then they start asking other questions.”

Title X services include methods for preventing unwanted pregnancy, fertility treatment for helping people get pregnant, testing for STIs and screening for certain kinds of cancer. 
In its letter to Converge, the nonprofit that beat out the state Health Department for the federal Title X grant in Mississippi in 2022, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services alleged that the organization “could be in violation” of the terms of the award and parts of the federal civil rights law. The allegation referenced a 2020 statement the nonprofit made committing to diversity in health care during the wake of the George Floyd protests. 
The group sent HHS all the documents it was required, but has not heard back in over a month, said Jamie Bardwell, co-executive director of Converge. 
“I have to believe that common sense will eventually prevail,” Bardwell said. “We for sure have done nothing wrong.”
The Title X funding freeze will force Five Horizons to increase the cost of a package of STI tests and treatment from $20 to $120. That’s still comparable to or less than most urgent care facilities, but nurses at the clinic say it will be cost-prohibitive for much of their low-income, younger clientele. 
The funding freeze won’t just affect costs – it will also affect accessibility. The only women’s health clinic in Starkville currently has a wait time of two months for a new patient appointment. 
Because they serve a largely college-aged population, the providers at Five Horizons are also privy to another trend: Some of the younger patients who are still on their parents’ insurance choose to forgo reproductive care rather than let their parents know they are sexually active.
“Sometimes the college kids will have insurance, but they don’t want to use their insurance because then their parents will figure out what they’re doing, so that was nice that we had that option to not use their insurance to get what they needed,” White said.

Through Title X funding, Five Horizons was able to keep supplies like the Depo-Provera shot – an injection given once every three months to prevent pregnancy – on hand and administer it for free on site to those who were uninsured or chose not to use their parents’ insurance. 
Now, McKenzie Russell, the nurse caring for most of the clinic’s Title X patients, says she’ll have to send patients to an offsite pharmacy to pick up birth control – an added obstacle that might put contraception out of reach for some. 
Russell, who grew up in Starkville and had her first baby at 16, fears that increased barriers like cost and extra trips will lead to more unintended pregnancies in the community. 
She said the clinic has also seen increased rates of abnormal pap smears, which can be a sign of precancerous changes and warrant further testing. The clinic has been offering uninsured patients free pap smears, though that could change if they don’t find another source of funding to cover those costs.
Mississippi has the highest rate of deaths from cervical cancer and the nation’s worst uptake of the vaccine that protects against this cancer. 
Meanwhile, the influence of social media on young people has meant that much of the work providers do in well visits is combatting misinformation. 
“There was a girl who thought she had syphilis because there was something wrong with her eye,” Russell said. “… They just go down rabbit holes, and we have to bring them back.”
Even if the funding delays don’t result in permanent cuts, the lapse in care could have life-changing consequences for some. 
“A month delay may not sound like a huge deal to some people, but when you’re talking about women’s health care, one month could be a huge deal,” said Bardwell. “You could be missing your prescription for birth control, (and) perhaps it results in an unplanned pregnancy. Perhaps you don’t get screened for an STD, STI. Congenital syphilis is very high in Mississippi. These are things that just have a very negative effect for women and their children.”

In the meantime, Converge is expanding telehealth services, as well as launching pop-up clinics around the state. The first one will be June 7 at the Jackson Medical Mall. 
“Our number one job since April 1 has been fundraising,” Bardwell said. “Every dollar that we’ve been raising has been to make sure we can still provide care to people in this way.”
The National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services. The lawsuit argued the agency’s withholding of funds before determining there was a violation of the grant terms is unlawful.   
But the lawsuit won’t provide any immediate relief for Mississippi and other affected states – and even if Converge gets the money it was due, Bardwell thinks this won’t be the last time she has to fight for funding under the Trump administration.
“So in our minds, getting our money unfrozen would be a huge positive step, but we by no means think that once that happens we’d be in the clear,” she said. “We imagine there will be multiple hurdles for years on this topic.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01101119/3X0A8709.jpg,,,2025-05-05 18:04:50.875515

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State government is paying about 37% more to lease commercial office space for employees today than five years ago — a hike from $16 million to $22 million that the Nebraska state auditor described Monday as “far more than necessary.”
“It is important to note that this ongoing acceleration in the cost of renting government office space has occurred despite the number of state employees remaining relatively unchanged,” State Auditor Mike Foley said in a statement.

Foley, saying that he doubted that the rising costs would abate any time soon, outlined his office’s concerns in a letter Monday to the Legislature’s Legislative Performance Audit Committee. 
He said he was surprised to learn during the review that the state leases 1.5 million square feet in 193 commercially owned buildings in 37 Nebraska counties. 
His team offered recommendations “to avoid throwing taxpayer dollars down the drain in excessive rental payments” — including a possible study on whether the state should consider the purchase or lease-purchase of additional buildings and whether another state office building should be constructed in Lincoln.
“There is a lot of space around town we could pick up at a very good price,” he said. 
 Omaha building in focus

Foley pointed out specific situations, such as an abandoned multimillion dollar office building site in Lincoln that could make a difference. He also questioned the “financial responsibility” of selling a well-known, nearly full state-owned office and parking complex in downtown Omaha.
 

Downtown Omaha fixture could change hands
A state office building with a long history in the developing downtown Omaha business district and riverfront redevelopment area may be changing hands.
Lee Will, director of the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, said in a letter to a legislative committee that his team is pursuing a possible sale of the state-owned office building at 13th and Farnam Streets.
Will noted that the complex is in a “high-interest area for Omaha development.”
The complex has 175,706 square feet of above-grade square footage and an attached five-story parking garage.
It is near the rising $600 million Mutual of Omaha office tower, the recently completed, multimillion-dollar overhaul of the downtown public park system and is along the Omaha streetcar route.
Will stated in the letter that a sale would not happen unless the state found a larger facility to fit other state employees based in the area that could be bought from the proceeds of the existing building.



Attached to Foley’s six-page letter is a three-page response from Lee Will, director of the Department of Administrative Services, which manages state-owned facilities and serves as administrator for property leased by the state. 
Lee addressed his missive to the same Performance Audit Review Committee, chaired by State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams, clarifying or rebutting what the auditing team laid out.
Of the 37% rent increase, Lee said several “significant operational changes” have shifted costs from other places to leased space. Those included the end of a child welfare contract in the Omaha area, which had the state “reabsorb” leased space to support the new staff.
Among other shifts, he said, was the opening of the Lincoln Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center, multiple leases for swing space to accommodate a Capitol HVAC project, and rental shifts from the county to the state for three Department of Motor Vehicle Centers. 
Also, Will said, the Omaha State Office Building, which houses about 450 employees at 13th and Farnam Streets, would not be sold unless a replacement is found to buy and consolidate other area state employees.
 ‘Critical asset’ 

To the auditor’s recommendation on possible construction of another state office building in the Capital City, Lee said that would be “cost prohibitive compared to currently available buildings.” 
In its report, Foley’s team offered background on a state-owned property centered at 17th and K Streets in Lincoln, noting that the state spent more than $2.2 million on architectural work for the proposed construction of a state office building at that site, which in 2019 was estimated to cost about $56 million.
The auditor cited a news story of that era that said the state projected a $35 million savings over 30 years compared to leasing. 
“Even with such significant anticipated savings, DAS did not proceed with the construction of the building, and the land at that location remains vacant and is still owned by the State of Nebraska,” the auditor’s letter said.
Lee, in his counter letter, acknowledged that the intent originally was to construct an office building and parking garage through a public-private partnership. But he said the 2019 estimate was $92 million, including the $56 million construction cost plus interest on a 30-year loan — “not significant cost savings for a building built with no tenants.” 
Meanwhile, he said, the property remains a “critical asset” to the state, as the site of the State Capitol building’s geothermal well field.
Foley, in an interview Monday, appeared to soften the stance on that project. He said the state made the right decision to pass on construction at the uncertain time of COVID-19. Now, he said, he believes it could be more financially smart to buy underused office property to save “precious taxpayer dollars” in the long run.
 As budget gap looms

His comments come as the state struggles with closing a budget gap.
Nebraska auditor details ‘staggering’ impact of corporate tax incentives on state budget options

Just two weeks ago, Foley detailed the “staggering” impact of corporate tax incentives on state budget options. In a 20-page letter to state senators, he wrote that over the next four fiscal years, Nebraska companies stand poised to call in more than $1.5 billion in corporate tax incentives, an expense he said would reduce state general funds.
He also highlighted the state’s “steadily increasing delinquent tax balances,” which could constitute “hundreds of millions of tax dollars owed but not collected” by the Nebraska Department of Revenue.
Regarding his latest red flag to lawmakers, Foley acknowledged that the initial cost of buying office buildings to replace commercial leases would be pricey. But he believes that the “long-term savings to the state should prove well worth the investment.”
Foley said the Auditor’s Office is prohibited from conducting unauthorized performance audits of state agencies, so the letter to the Legislature’s Performance Audit Committee was intended as an alert.
He said that a 2024 occupancy report provided by DAS showed an overall occupancy rate of 97% for seven state office buildings controlled by the department. Other state-owned buildings are occupied by state workers, but are controlled by individual agencies, such as the Department of Transportation. Foley said his study was limited to properties managed by the DAS, and suggested his office could assist in an expanded study if warranted.
According to Foley’s review:

For the past two fiscal years, the state paid $20.3 million and nearly $22 million, respectively, for commercially leased space. Compared to five years earlier, in 2018 and 2019, those costs now are about 37% higher.
Renting space at one of the largest, priciest commercial office buildings used by state workers at 1010 Lincoln Mall costs $33.43 per square foot, compared to $8.33 in a state-owned building at 301 Centennial Mall.

 Parking facilities 

The review also looked at state parking facilities and noted that state employees who work at certain locations in commercially rented space in Lincoln are not charged for parking.

Foley recommended that the legislative committee consider a study to determine if state parking charges are necessary in garages that are fully paid off, and whether rates charged for state employee parking are reasonable.
In response, Will said parking rates for state employees range from $24 in surface lots to $50 a month in garages, compared to $85 in City of Lincoln parking garages.
Will said his department overall works to keep lease rates low, and noted that rent that is collected also helps pay for maintenance workers, building utilities and equipment repairs.
He said the department actively looks for potential ownership opportunities and that several locations currently are under consideration.
As an example, Will said, his department bought real estate for the Nebraska State Patrol last year, saving more than $12 million compared to new construction.
He said he looks forward to working with the auditor on increased government efficiencies.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas House and Senate adjourned sine die Monday morning, marking the end of the nearly four-month 2025 legislative session.
Sine die — a Latin phrase for “without day” — means the Legislature isn’t scheduled to convene again this year unless Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders calls for a special session. The next scheduled session will be the 2026 fiscal session early next year.
The Legislature ended the business portion of the session on April 16 after considering more than 1,600 bills. Sanders signed 1,026 bills into law and vetoed four others.
Lawmakers can override the governor’s vetoes with a simple majority vote in both chambers before sine die adjournment. Both chambers convened briefly Monday but did not vote to override Sanders’ vetoes; leaders in both chambers said there was not enough support for this option.
Arkansas governor vetoes two more bills from 2025 legislative session

House Speaker Brian Evans, R-Cabot, said after adjournment that he spoke with the sponsors of two of vetoed bills, Rep. Aaron Pilkington, R-Knoxville, and Rep. Brandon Achor, R-Maumelle. He said neither indicated they wished to attempt a veto override.
Evans said Achor had been in communication with the constituents involved with House Bill 1961, which would have allowed medical providers to temporarily withhold medical records if they had a reasonable belief patients would misinterpret the records in a way that could endanger their health, safety or mental state. Evans said Achor and his constituents were already working on an interim plan and “believe there will be a good collaborative agreement on that.”
HB 1961 passed the House with 75 votes and the Senate with 18 votes, the minimum needed to advance out of the upper chamber.

Meanwhile, Evans said Pilkington did not feel he had the votes for an override for his bill that would have allowed delivery of marijuana and drive-thru window pickup. House Bill 1889 narrowly passed the House and Senate with 51 votes and 19 votes, respectively.
Prior to adjournment, Evans told his colleagues that legislation passed this year “will shape our state for years to come.” He reiterated both on the House floor and after adjournment that members of his chamber should take pride in the work they did during the session.
“We worked late into the night, we debated, we disagreed, we discussed; the most important thing, we collaborated,” he said. “We thoroughly vetted legislation, we brought diverse perspectives to the table and we made good bills through that debate even better.”
Similarly, Senate President and Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge told senators they should “leave here today proud” of their work during the session and that they “zealously and respectfully advocated” for their constituents.

The House conducted no business in addition to the adjournment, while the Senate confirmed a batch of five gubernatorial appointments to state boards and commissions in a voice vote after no debate. Sen. Matt Stone, R-Camden, was the only audible dissenting vote.
The appointments included Sanders’ deputy chief of staff, Judd Deere, to the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees. Deere was appointed in March and will retain his position in the governor’s office. Deere is replacing Sheffield Nelson and his term on the board expires March 1, 2035.
Additionally, Larry Walther, former state Treasurer and Secretary of Finance and Administration, was confirmed to the Arkansas Public Employees’ Retirement System’s board of trustees. Walther is replacing Candace Franks and his term expires March 9, 2031. 
Finance and Administration officials announced last week that the state’s income tax revenue in April dropped 15.5% compared to a year earlier. Sanders also extended Arkansas’ tax filing deadline in light of recent severe weather across the state.

The state has reduced individual and corporate income tax rates four times in the past three years, most recently in June 2024. Three of those instances have been since Sanders took office in 2023, and she supports phasing out the income tax entirely.
Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said Monday that he hopes the Legislature will cut taxes again in a special session later this year. The fiscal year ends June 30, and state officials should take the year’s revenue into account before convening for a special session, he said.
Hester also said he anticipates no other reasons for a special session, including the ongoing controversy over Sanders’ plans to build a 3,000-bed prison on 815 acres of land the state purchased in Franklin County.
A $750 million appropriation bill to support the prison’s construction died after five failed votes in the Senate in April. State officials, including Republican Sen. Bryan King of Green Forest, and Franklin County residents have fought against the project, citing concerns about transparency, infrastructure and staffing.
Arkansas lawmakers consider other funding methods as they abandon sixth prison appropriation vote

The appropriation would have covered the remainder of the projected $825 million cost of the project. An additional $75 million appropriated in 2022 for prison expansion has already been allocated to the Arkansas Department of Corrections, which can use the funding to move the project forward.
The Legislature also set aside another $330 million for the project in 2023 that hasn’t been appropriated yet.
Hester said the state has “a clear path forward” and “plenty of money” to complete the prison project. The state has already hired a construction management company, Vanir Construction Management Inc., and started seeking proposals from architectural firms and contractors.
“Once we have the architecture and engineering done, hopefully we can get a hard bid, and I think that will bring a comfort level to a lot of members and ultimately get us the vote we’re needing” for the Senate to approve the rest of the funding for the project, Hester said.
 King’s request to Sanders

King, who represents part of Franklin County, sent Sanders’ office a letter Monday asking for the 2022 appropriation funds to be used for their original purpose, which would add 525 beds to the state prison in Calico Rock.
Sanders has pushed for the new penitentiary to alleviate overcrowding in county jails, but King said Monday morning in a news conference that the Calico Rock expansion would be “much faster and much more economical.” He criticized the possibility of building water and sewer lines between the prison and the city of Fort Smith, saying it would be a waste of money.
Arkansas prison board approves contractor search for Franklin County prison

Evans told the Advocate there were existing issues with Calico Rock’s infrastructure that impacted its expansion previously, adding that he was “not aware” of any new developments on that front.
“I feel like if that had been a reasonable option early on in the Sanders administration” then it already would have been acted upon, he said. 
King’s letter also calls for the expansion of “smaller regional facilities” in Benton, Sebastian and Washington counties, which are among the state’s most populous, since they already have “basic infrastructure in place” to house more inmates.
About 20 opponents of the prison joined King at the news conference at the state Capitol, including members of the Chickamauga Nation, an Indigenous tribe with a presence in Franklin County.

King letter to Sanders 
“If you’re going to put a megaprison in a community, it’s certainly going to change their DNA … The fact that the governor went ahead and just tried to railroad the people without doing a basic needs infrastructure [assessment] is wrong,” King said.
Chickamauga burial sites and a “ceremonial stone structure” surround the property designated for the prison, and building the prison would have a negative impact on those sites, said Justin Flanagan, a chief with the tribe.
“We’re here today providing pamphlets with this information to the House and the Senate so that all deniability is removed,” Flanagan told the Advocate. “…With all the evidence we’re providing, there should be no reason not to do a three-phase archaeological study and cultural environmental impact study [of the land].”
King said he is willing to meet with Sanders and discuss ways to reduce prison overcrowding, and he added that addressing the issue “probably doesn’t need to wait” until next year’s fiscal session.

“It has always been about welcoming spring, but always about potent things like workers’ rights. It’s about community solidarity from the community,” said Andrew Bendzick, a mechanic with a Southside artist collective known as Battletrain.

Celebrants came dressed in flowers and animal masks. Many brought their instruments and played in impromptu ensembles. Bikes were locked several deep on every fence and railing. People shouted “happy Mayday.” They sprayed bubbles and threw fistfuls of flower petals.
Mayday helps Minnesotans “remember why we live here, why we love this community, and trying to take it back, take it back to community, and make it safe for everybody,” Bendzick said.
The parade comes at a perilous time, as workers face increasing threats from the Trump administration and an opportunistic corporate sector committed to rolling back labor rights.

The parade and event, which carries on a long European tradition of May Day that welcomes spring and commemorates International Workers’ Day, has no central leadership nor funding. Instead, a decentralized collective of puppet workshops, neighborhood groups, arts organizations and other volunteers create the event.
Liz Zinsli, an artist with Battletrain, said she’s been watching the parade since she was a teenager, and contributing to Battletrain’s massive Mayday projects for 10 years.
“We always need those reminders of beauty and fun, and of what we can really do together on this very grassroots level,” said Zinsli. “And remembering that, I think that’s really important. Remembering how much can really be done in a decentralized way and in a collaborative way is really powerful.”
Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre started the original Mayday celebration in 1974, but “released it” to the community in 2023.

(Erika Bolstad/Stateline)BOISE, Idaho — The day the flag bill came up for a vote in the Idaho Senate this spring, state Sen. Melissa Wintrow had no plans to speak against it. As the top Democratic leader in her chamber, she had already spent the legislative session in constant, vocal opposition to the Republican-dominated legislative agenda.
“I thought: ‘Oh, this stupid flag bill once again,’” Wintrow said. “I’ll just vote ‘no’ quietly because I’ve just really been in people’s grille about things.”
But then the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Ben Toews, began passing out flyers about the legislation, one of two proposed bills to limit which flags can be flown at schools and on state and local government property. The only photos on the handout were of rainbow-striped Pride flags flying in Boise: one on a flagpole in front of City Hall, and then others on light poles along Harrison Boulevard, two blocks from Wintrow’s home.
“When he sat that picture in front of me on that desk, I thought: ‘That’s enough. Just always picking and bullying,’” Wintrow said. “The state’s going to tell us what to do, when they can’t even address the larger problems like affordable housing? That’s what’s on people’s minds. A good working wage, health care. It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.”
In recent weeks, both Idaho and Utah have enacted bans that prohibit Pride flags from being displayed on government property, pitting lawmakers in the Republican-dominated legislatures against the more progressive capitals of Boise and Salt Lake City, where the flags are often flown at city hall.

– Idaho Democratic state Sen. Melissa Wintrow




In Utah, the law allows the state flag, the U.S. flag, U.S. military flags, the POW/MIA flag, local government flags, tribal nation flags, university and school flags and Olympic flags. Idaho’s list is similar, but includes a provision in the school flag law that prohibits flags with political viewpoints, “including but not limited to flags or banners regarding a political party, race, sexual orientation, gender, or a political ideology.”
Lawmakers in Florida, Texas and at least 13 other states are considering similar flag prohibitions, said Logan Casey, director of policy research with the Movement Advancement Project, which studies LGBTQ+ rights. The flag bills go beyond symbolism, Casey said. Rather, they are part of a broad and coordinated legislative attack on LGBTQ+ people that seeks to strip them of rights and erase or make difficult their participation in public life.
“Sometimes those attacks are very material, like denying access to health care or the ability to participate safely in public life and activities,” Casey said. “Sometimes they’re a little more symbolic, like these flag bills.”
‘Get rid of everything’
The rainbow-colored Pride flag was conjured up by artist and drag queen Gilbert Baker in 1978, at the suggestion of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, as a symbol of progress and pride for that year’s San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade. Since then, the rainbow-colored flag and its many design iterations have grown into worldwide emblems of solidarity with LGBTQ+ rights.
Although the laws in Idaho and Utah don’t ban Pride flags specifically, bill sponsors and their supporters made it clear they want to see such flags removed from city halls, schools and state buildings. Idaho state Rep. Ted Hill, a Republican who sponsored the bill limiting which flags can fly at schools, said in an interview that Pride flags are disruptive to classroom learning because discussion about them takes up “an amazing amount of political bandwidth.”
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

“The best way to do it is to get rid of everything,” said Hill, who represents Eagle, a suburb northwest of Boise. “So the only thing you have in the classroom is the American flag, the state flag. And people will say inclusivity and all this. Well, the American flag is as inclusive as it can get.”
Despite the new law, Boise Mayor Lauren McLean, a Democrat, continues to fly a Pride flag in front of City Hall, just below the city’s own and adjacent to poles flying the U.S. and state of Idaho flags. The Pride flag’s presence, within view of the state Capitol, elicited a sternly worded letter from Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican.
Idaho’s law, which went into effect April 3, has no penalty for local governments or officials who fly flags in defiance of the ban, an oversight lawmakers told Labrador they’ll rectify in subsequent legislative sessions. Instead, the law relies on “the good will of elected officials for its enforcement,” Labrador wrote, warning McLean that she should “comply with the law out of a sense of duty to your oath of office.”
He threatened, too, that lawmakers could “deny state tax revenues and other appropriations to the City of Boise or any other governmental entity that does not follow state law.”
McLean countered that the new law is unconstitutional, and that the city will challenge threats to withhold funding. Pride flags have flown in Boise for a decade, she told Labrador, and represent a commitment to “a safe and welcoming city where everyone means just that — everyone.”
“The Constitutional rights of our residents are not subject to — cannot be subject to — the political whims of legislative disapproval,” McLean wrote, “and we will not step back from them simply because the principles our community cherishes make some in state government uncomfortable.”

Boise’s city council is considering a resolution confirming that any flags it flies, including Pride flags, are official city flags — a move the council says will ensure it is complying with state law. In the meantime, the city will “continue to fly the flags on City Hall Plaza that represent our community and speak to our values of caring for people and welcoming all,” McLean said in a statement.
Early on Easter morning, several people climbed a ladder propped up next to the city’s flagpole to cover the Pride flag and a separate flag (honoring organ and tissue donation) with trash bags. They also raised the Appeal to Heaven flag, a Revolutionary War-era flag that has come to represent sympathy to the Christian nationalist movement and to President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. A few hours later, the mayor lowered the flags, which are on a locked halyard, to remove the trash bags and the Appeal to Heaven flag.
It capped a challenging sequence of events in Boise and nearby Meridian, which drew national attention this spring when school officials ordered a middle school teacher to take down a sign with the phrase “Everyone is welcome here” from her classroom. Amid the backlash, people in Boise printed T-shirts and yard signs in support of the teacher and the sign’s message.
The mayor’s response to the flag law and the support for the classroom message aren’t directly connected, but both reflect how many in the community insist on sending a welcoming message at this moment in American history, said Christina Bruce-Bennion, executive director of Boise’s Wassmuth Center for Human Rights, which helped coordinate support for the teacher.
‘It is very targeted’
In Salt Lake City, the flag ban threatens to end a long-standing annual tradition. Typically, the mayor’s office kicks off Pride Month festivities in June with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall, said Chad Call, executive director of the Utah Pride Center, which puts on the state’s annual Pride festivities. Events include a parade through the streets of Salt Lake City with a 200-foot Pride flag — which remains a legal form of First Amendment expression and has taken place most years since 1997.
“We have a city council that wants to celebrate Pride month,” Call said. “They want to celebrate the queer community in the month of June. And then we have a state government that does not want that happening in our capital city. And so it is very targeted.”

One of the flag bill’s sponsors, state Rep. Trevor Lee, said in an interview that his legislation was prompted by constituents who told him they’re “sick and tired of seeing a political agenda being pushed in their face” on government property, particularly with flags featuring transgender representation.
“It makes people feel uncomfortable if it’s something they don’t agree with,” said Lee, who represents a district north of Salt Lake City. “And so we’re trying to keep it very specific and let schools focus on teaching the things that they need to, and let government buildings just fly their city flag for heaven’s sakes, or the state flag or the American flag.”
‘It was the life raft’: Transgender people find a safe haven in Florida’s capital city

One Utah parent, Republican activist Aaron Bullen, said he began objecting to Pride flags several years ago after one of his children, then a fifth grader, was “visibly upset” after school one day. Bullen said his son told him he’d seen what’s known as a Progress Pride flag, a newer iteration of the original rainbow-striped flag. It includes an arrow on the left side composed of pink, blue and white stripes to represent transgender people, as well as brown and black stripes to represent queer people of color. The flag was in the school’s computer lab.
Bullen said he complained to school leaders at the district, south of Salt Lake City, and the flag came down. But Bullen felt as though the flag’s presence undermined what he and his wife teach at home and model to their children as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, particularly how they interpret the church’s stance on transgender people and marriage for same-sex couples.
“It says, basically, ‘we approve of gay marriage’ when that flag is up,” Bullen said. “And that’s something that my religion is explicitly against. And so you have a teacher of my son, a person in authority that they’d like to be able to trust and to follow the instructions of, but they’re saying, ‘your parents who taught you this other thing, they’re wrong. Your religion is wrong.’ That’s what that flag means.”
He added: “It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would. Parents have the fundamental right and responsibility to rear their children. And it’s not a school’s place to oppose the religion of the parents or the teachings of the parents.”

Unlike in Idaho, Utah’s flag ban carries a $500 fine per day for failure to comply with the law. But in Utah, the law took effect without Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’s signature. The governor declined to sign the bill into law, saying the state’s residents are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix.”
Call, of the Utah Pride Center, said that while it’s discouraging for LGBTQ+ people to witness their representation further erased in public spaces, they refuse in Utah to allow the flag law to diminish the spirit of their Pride events, among the largest in the nation.
“Our counterculture here is really, really strong,” Call said. “And I think the thing that probably defines our Utah Pride as being kind of unique is the incredibly strong community that it brings together. There’s tens, hundreds of thousands of people that come out to support it.”

An OCA report released Monday argued lax homeschooling regulations have meant that some Connecticut children aren’t getting a proper education, and the system has been used to cover up abuse.
It follows the highly publicized case of a Waterbury man who was allegedly imprisoned for decades by his now-deceased father and stepmother after being pulled out of public school around the fifth grade. His stepmother, Kimberly Sullivan, faces felony charges for assault, kidnapping and unlawful restraint.
The report says Connecticut is one of only 12 states with “no meaningful regulation of homeschooling.” There aren’t bills under consideration to adjust the regulations, lawmakers said Monday.
On Monday the Education and Children’s Committees also hosted an informational session in defense of homeschooling. Republicans held a press conference and thousands of people gathered at the State Capitol.
In 2023, another child was found locked away and abused after he had been removed from school for homeschooling. In 2017, another Connecticut teenager died after prolonged abuse and neglect, and it was later discovered that his parents had pulled his sister out of school for homeschooling, the report says.

“This can happen at any time when children are withdrawn from public school under the pretense of homeschooling,” acting Child Advocate Christina Ghio said. “They’re not withdrawn because their parent has a plan to homeschool. They’re withdrawn to avoid the scrutiny of the district.”
Over the past three years in Connecticut, about 5,200 children have been withdrawn from public school to be homeschooled, state officials said Monday. This number doesn’t include students who have been homeschooled for their entire lives.
It’s part of a larger conversation in national politics about parental rights. The movement, typically channeled by right-wing groups, aims to give parents more control over what their children learn in school. It’s often been the basis of objections about curriculum that references LGBTQ issues and racial equity. It has also sparked discussion about vaccination requirements in schools.
“We are perfectly capable of enrolling our children and withdrawing our children,” said Diane Connors, an advocate with the Connecticut Homeschool Network.
Children and parents gathered in droves at hearings and in the Legislative Office Building on Monday. Some children wore signs saying “hands off our kids.” One had handmade a sign that read “More regulation negates why we homeschool.” Kids in the hearing room colored and did school work – one read “Charlotte’s Web,” another tapped out math solutions on her calculator.
In the building’s lobby, more than 2,000 people stood outside the hearing room singing the national anthem and chanting “Freedom, freedom.”
Democratic leadership on the committees said Monday that they didn’t want to regulate curriculum or villainize homeschoolers.
“Our goal with this session is not to be reactive to any single incident, but to offer long-term support and understanding and accountability ” said Children’s Committee co-chair Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, during the hearing.
“We are in no way trying to end homeschooling,” said Education Committee co-chair Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield. “We are not discussing making homeschool students enroll in public schools. We are not interested in dictating your curriculum or how you educate your children. We are not trying to force vaccines on your children.”
Meanwhile Republicans called the hearing a blatant attack on Constitutional and parental rights.
“All of us as Senators and Representatives have taken an oath to the Constitution and nowhere in the Constitution — that I’ve read multiple times — does it say that government should or must go after law-abiding parents who are exercising their parental rights as to how best to educate their kids,” Sen. Jeff Gordon, R-Woodstock.
In 2018, the OCA issued a report on the case of Matthew Tirado, a 17-year-old who was diagnosed with autism and an intellectual disability. The Department of Children and Families had a case open for several years regarding educational neglect for Matthew and suspected physical abuse of his sister.
His sister was withdrawn from school for homeschooling, and about three months later, Matthew died after prolonged abuse and neglect.
In 2023, a 10-year-old was found locked away and being abused after having been withdrawn from school for homeschooling. Police went to the house because of a domestic disturbance and found the child had injuries across his body, a broken finger, cauliflower ear and was malnourished. 
The Office of the Child Advocate reviewed a sample size of the cases of about 1,500 children withdrawn for homeschooling. About 31% of those were chronically absent before they were withdrawn.
The office checked half of that list of 1,500 students and found that about 23% lived in families with at least one report of abuse or neglect that was accepted for investigation. About 8% of the children lived in families with four or more accepted reports.
Ghio said there are questions about whether children enrolled in homeschooling are getting a proper education and whether another adult is checking on them to ensure they aren’t being abused. School employees make the most reports to DCF of any other group of mandated reporters. 
Connecticut is the only state in New England identified as not requiring notice that parents are going to pull a child into homeschooling. Massachusetts requires that parents present their homeschooling plan ahead of taking their child out of public school and report annually on the plan. Rhode Island requires regular reports about homeschooling progress to the local school district.
Connecticut law requires that parents enroll their children in public school unless they are receiving “equivalent instruction” elsewhere. There is a list of school subjects in statute that kids should learn. But there isn’t a mechanism to enforce the law and no required way for parents to prove their child is getting an education.
The child advocate’s report recommended that the statute be changed to describe how parents should show that their children are getting equivalent instruction, institute an annual evaluation requirement, and require districts to review their records to see if there is a suspicion of abuse or neglect before approving a family’s application to homeschool. It also recommended that DCF provide guidance and training to its workers on what is required for homeschooling.
“Because we have no standard at all to follow up once a child is withdrawn from school for the purpose of homeschooling, we have no information whatsoever that tells us whether or not those children are receiving education,” Ghio said.
But Republicans and other attendees at Monday’s press conference said the scrutiny is falling on homeschooling rather than where they believe it belongs: on DCF and with the Waterbury Public Schools.
“Shame on you. If you care about these children, get criminals off the street that abuse children, and actually regulate the systematic problem we have in our state government,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
Deborah Stevenson, an attorney at the National Home Education Legal Defense, said homeschooling already has sufficient regulation with the list of school subjects required, and that parents accused of educational neglect should be “innocent until proven guilty.”
Waterbury schools didn’t respond to requests by press time.
DCF Commissioner Jodi Hill-Lily said at the panel that there are limitations to what DCF can do in certain situations without law enforcement involvement. The agency supports homeschooling, but thinks there are “loopholes,” to be closed to make sure children are safe, she said.
Department of Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker said while the state has issued guidance for homeschooling and how to report to the school district that a family is pulling their child out of public school for homeschooling.
Fran Rabinowitz, executive director at the Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents, spoke in favor of more regulation in the law to make sure Connecticut children are properly educated.
“Our policy goals are to ensure that there is a balance between the rights of parents to direct the education of their children and the state’s interest in ensuring that all children are educated, and the child’s right to an education and to be free from abuse or neglect,” Ghio said in an interview.
Sarah Eagan, executive director of the Center for Children’s Advocacy, issued a statement Monday that said the answer to the problem isn’t to “scapegoat,” the child welfare agencies but for local districts to do more to ensure homeschooled children are getting an education.
“Connecticut, as 39 states have already done, will need to strike a balance of those rights to ensure children are educated and safe. To do nothing is untenable,” Eagan said.
Beau Triba, an advocate with the Coalition for Responsible Home Education, told her story to lawmakers about being homeschooled in Connecticut. She said her education was religion-based and didn’t prepare her for adult life and that it was often used to cover up neglect and abuse. When she was 16, she attempted suicide but still didn’t get professional help.
“Stories like mine continue to happen right under your nose,” Triba said.

The rule has drawn opposition from Gov. Kevin Stitt, advocates within Oklahoma’s Latino community and residents who spoke up against requiring schools to check students’ immigration status. If the rule passes, schools would have to report to the state the number of students they enroll who couldn’t verify their U.S. citizenship or legal residency.
State Superintendent Ryan Walters said he suggested the rule to better account for school resources needed to serve immigrant students, like English learner programs. He said his administration would turn over the collected information to federal authorities, if asked, and would support immigration raids in schools.

Sen. Micheal Bergstrom, R-Adair, filed Senate Joint Resolution 22 on Thursday to make several line-item disapprovals of Walters’ proposed administrative rules from the Oklahoma State Department of Education, including a rejection of the entire immigration measure.
Bergstrom leads the Senate Administrative Rules Committee, and his House counterpart, Rep. Gerrid Kendrix, R-Altus, is a co-author of the resolution.
During a committee meeting Monday, Kendrix said he and Bergstrom worked together to draft the language. He said SJR 22 is one of three Senate resolutions that should reach the House committee “in short order, I hope.” 
Each would have to pass a vote by the Senate committee and the full Senate before migrating to the House.

The Senate Administrative Rules Committee is scheduled to meet at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday. Bergstrom could not be reached for comment.
Bergstrom and Kendrix’s resolution also would reject a rule that would require all public school teachers to pass a written version of the U.S. Naturalization Test. Both Republicans and Democrats in the House expressed concerns about the rule potentially driving away qualified teachers.
Walters’ office did not return a request for comment.

Jerry McAfee Tuesday, April 22, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Senate ethics committee on Monday took no action on a complaint against Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis.
A GOP complaint alleged he violated Senate rules when he spearheaded state funds to an organization run by a former legal client.
Republicans filed the complaint against Champion after Reformer reporting found that he advocated for a $3 million grant to violence prevention nonprofit 21 Days of Peace, run by north Minneapolis Rev. Jerry McAfee, but didn’t disclose that McAfee had been his legal client. Champion says he did the work pro bono.
Last month, the Senate Subcommittee on Ethical Conduct found that Champion had no financial conflict of interest when he advocated for an additional $1 million in funding for 21 Days of Peace earlier this year, but didn’t make any findings about his 2023 actions.
The committee, evenly split between Republican and Democratic members, on Monday voted on four related motions, which failed 2-2, on party-line votes.
Because the committee deadlocked on taking action, the complaint will likely die and not be relitigated again.
David Zoll, Champion’s attorney, argued that Champion followed Senate rules, which state that senators only need to disclose a conflict of interest if an action were to benefit them financially. Champion represented McAfee pro bono, so he followed Senate rules even though he didn’t disclose it, Zoll argued.
Champion at the hearing criticized the media, arguing that the GOP senators in their ethics complaint relied on articles that presented a misinterpretation of the Senate ethics rules.
“A reporter can say that any of us have done something — and whether they’re right or wrong — we would find ourselves sitting in this seat, because we don’t have the power of the pen,” Champion said.
Sen. Mary Kunesh, DFL-New Brighton, echoed Champion’s criticism of the media.
“I think it’s really important to recognize the role that media plays in making or breaking an individual, not just here in the Senate, but also bringing in information that perhaps is going to influence the general public one way or another without knowing the full bit of information,” Kunesh said.
Champion has never disputed the facts of the Reformer’s reporting.
In a statement after the hearing, Champion said he was grateful the ethics committee didn’t issue a finding of probable cause and is eager to get back to work.
“Elected officials have a responsibility to act with integrity, and to earn the trust and confidence of the public,” Champion said. “I am proud of my record, and of my work as both a legislator and an attorney, particularly the pro bono legal services I have provided to churches and nonprofits.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250422_0075-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-05 17:03:26.112634

Brattleboro rejected a $25M municipal budget as too high. Now comes a $426,732 aftershock.

“A lot of the people who I’ve talked to would like to have seen a broader reduction in personnel across departments,” selectboard member Isaac Evans-Frantz said at Thursday’s session.Instead, local leaders have retained all currently staffed positions and found savings by not filling several empty posts, including those of assistant town manager and information technology coordinator.In the most unusual action, the selectboard — anticipating fire department overtime could rise to up to $700,000 or more annually because of recurring vacancies and contract requirements — voted to hire three more firefighters in hopes their regular salaries would cost less than paying existing personnel to work extra hours at a higher rate.When local leaders began drafting a 2025-26 budget last fall, they learned that continuing to fund all current services amid rising staff counts and trash disposal costs would spark a 22% tax increase.The selectboard went on to vote this winter to retain all personnel and instead decrease or defer other spending, only to see Town Meeting attendees in March defeat the proposal and its 12.1% tax hike.Revising the budget this spring, officials discovered the rejected plan underestimated such contracted expenses as payroll taxes, retirement contributions and overtime, forcing them to raise the bottom line by $426,732 even before they started cutting.A half-million dollars in reductions later, the selectboard’s new proposal already has sparked public friction.Board chair Elizabeth McLoughlin opened the last budget-revision session by apologizing for earlier cutting off a local teenager voicing opposition to any loss of library hours. But two hours later, McLoughlin shouted and sounded her gavel at resident William Kraham when he wanted to speak about the cost of emergency medical services.Kraham has long advocated for the town’s previous provider, Rescue Inc., which he credits with saving his life after sudden cardiac arrest. But McLoughlin, who voted for a recent fire department takeover of ambulance services, said his comments weren’t germane and threatened to stop the session if he didn’t stop talking.“I will not have this discussion,” McLoughlin told Kraham before noting she had the right as chair to “request law enforcement assistance in removing a disorderly person.”Local leaders will explain the revised budget at an informational session on May 21 and seek approval of it at a special Town Meeting on May 27.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brattleboro officials reduce defeated town budget, yet proposed taxes remain up by double digits.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Brattleboro-Gallery-Walk-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 17:03:26.112634

(Courtesy of SD GF&P)State officials have added two more South Dakota lakes to the fish consumption advisory list after testing found elevated mercury levels in large walleye.
The state announced Monday that Dry Lake #1 in Clark County and Lake Henry in Kingsbury County have been added to the list.
For Dry Lake #1, health officials recommend limiting consumption of walleye over 21 inches in length. At Lake Henry, the advisory applies to walleye over 24 inches. Walleye in South Dakota can grow to more than 30 inches. 
The guidance is based on mercury concentrations detected in fish tissue samples collected through the state’s annual monitoring program.
“Our commitment to public health and safety drives the annual fish sampling program,” said Department of Health Secretary Melissa Magstadt in a news release.
Mercury, a toxic heavy metal, ends up in fish across the United States largely due to atmospheric deposition. Coal-fired power plants release mercury into the air before it settles into lakes and rivers. Bacteria convert it into methylmercury and fish absorb it.
Fish consumption advisories are not enforceable bans but are issued to help people make informed choices to reduce health risks.
“We encourage everyone to check the DOH website for the latest advisories and take necessary precautions when enjoying locally caught fish,” Magstadt said.



Fish consumption advisories
In addition to Dry Lake #1 and Lake Henry, these lakes are on the state’s fish consumption advisory list:

Bitter Lake: Limit consumption of northern pike (over 30″) and any size walleye, particularly for children under age 7 and women who are pregnant, might become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.
Coal Springs Reservoir: Limit consumption of northern pike (over 25″). These tested above recommended limits for mercury.

Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost certified the title and summary language for a referendum that would repeal Senate Bill 1, set to take effect at the end of June. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
S.B. 1 bans diversity efforts, regulates classroom discussion, prohibits faculty strikes, creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
“My certification of the title and summary… should not be construed as an affirmation of the enforceability and constitutionality of the referendum petition,” Attorney General Dave Yost said in a letter certifying the petition.
Members of the Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association are behind efforts to get the referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot. 
With the title and summary language approval, petitioners can now start gathering signatures. About 248,092 signatures are needed — 6% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. The signatures must be from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties. The signatures would likely be due at the end of June. 
Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose would then have to verify the signatures before the measure is referred to the Ohio Ballot Board to determine the language that would appear on the November ballot. 
The last time a referendum passed in Ohio was 2011 when voters overturned an anti-collective bargaining law.
Some of Ohio’s public universities have started making decisions because of S.B. 1. Ohio University announced it will close the Pride Center, the Women’s Center and the Multicultural Center. The University of Toledo is suspending nine undergraduate programs in response to a controversial new higher education law that is set to take effect this summer.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-05 20:40:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Tong joins other state AGs in lawsuit over Trump’s wind moratorium,John Moritz and Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/05/trump-offshore-wind-ct-lawsuit/,The lawsuit challenged a Trump executive action directing federal officials to stop the leasing of new offshore areas for wind projects.,"Attorney General William Tong joined his counterparts in more than a dozen states Monday in filing a lawsuit seeking to block President Donald Trump’s effort to halt the development of wind energy, including projects off the coast of New York and New England.
The lawsuit, which was brought in federal court in Massachusetts, challenged an executive action taken by Trump on his first day in office directing federal officials to stop the leasing of new offshore areas for wind projects, and to cease issuing permits or approvals for turbines either on land or offshore.
Tong was joined in the lawsuit by Democratic attorneys general from New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine — each states that have staked significant resources in harnessing the power of wind blowing off the Atlantic coast.
They’re asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
“This is yet another lawless effort by Donald Trump to enrich the fossil fuel industry and illegally micromanage state business,” Tong, a Democrat, said in a statement Monday. “Connecticut has the right to secure our energy future, and one that makes the most sense for our costs and climate.”
In addition to those states located along the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as well as the Great Lakes, the lawsuit also includes the landlocked states of Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, which objected to the Trump administration’s policies toward on-shore wind.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are “using lawfare to stop the president’s popular energy agenda,” instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
“The American people voted for the president to restore America’s energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats’ radical climate agenda,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
That approach is almost complete reversal of the policies established by President Joe Biden, whose administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects.
At least three of those projects were slated for assembly using the State Pier in New London, which was recently redeveloped into a staging area for offshore wind projects at a cost of more than $300 million.
The first of those projects to be launched from Connecticut, South Fork Wind, went online last year, delivering power to Long Island.
While the Trump’s January memorandum did not immediately impact those projects that had already secured federal approval, his administration has since take more aggressive steps against the industry.
In April, it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
An Interior spokeswoman declined to comment specifically on the lawsuit by the attorneys general Monday but sent a statement saying the department “reaffirms its unwavering commitment to conserving and managing the nation’s natural and cultural resources, upholding tribal trust responsibilities, and overseeing public lands and waters for the benefit of all Americans, while prioritizing fiscal responsibility for the American people.” 
The two remaining projects at the State Pier, Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind, are being developed by the Danish company Ørsted. A spokesman for the company said both projects are “progressing according to schedule.”
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation’s largest source of renewable energy. Much of that power is currently comes from states like Texas and the Great Plains, where the flat, windy landscape churns turbines on land. 
In New England, the best winds are located off the coasts, creating additional challenges and costs for developers.
Last fall, Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration opted not to join its neighbors in Rhode Island and Massachusetts in selecting bids to purchase power from offshore wind projects, citing the potential costs.

Jeremy Olson, R-Arnegard, talks to colleagues in the House chamber on May 1, 2025. Olson resigned his seat on May 5, 2025, after the session adjourned. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Rep. Jeremy Olson resigned his legislative seat Monday, a decision legislative leaders said was connected to a harassment complaint filed against the lawmaker.
Olson, a Republican from Arnegard, wrote in a brief letter that he believes resigning “is in the best interest of the Legislature, my constituents, and my family.” 
House Majority Leader Rep. Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said he was informed that a complaint was filed against Olson on Friday, the last day of the legislative session. Lefor said the complaint was filed with Senate Minority Leader Sen. Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo.
Hogan said the harassment complaint was withdrawn Sunday after the person who filed it learned about Olson’s resignation. She added the withdrawn complaint will not become a public record.
“People who have been in these situations are very hesitant to complain because of the public record issues,” Hogan said. “And that’s why the person pulled the complaint and doesn’t want a full investigation. And it’s not necessary because Jeremy (Olson) is gone.”
At 12:45 a.m. Saturday, as lawmakers were wrapping up the legislative session, a bipartisan panel of lawmakers met in a closed-door executive session to discuss a complaint related to the Legislature’s workplace harassment policy, according to a meeting agenda. The agenda does not say who the complaint is about.
Lefor said he spoke with Olson over the weekend about the complaint filed against him. Lefor said he could not discuss details of the complaint. 
“During that conversation, he determined that it was in the best interest of all for him to resign,” Lefor said. “And I agreed with that.”
North Dakota lawmakers work to update harassment policy

On April 29, Olson resigned as House majority caucus leader, citing the demands of his work schedule.
The resignation followed a conversation a group of lawmakers had with legislative leadership about Olson weeks earlier.
Rep. Lori VanWinkle, R-Minot, said she observed Olson kiss a legislative employee on the cheek at an event in March. After the incident, she said other lawmakers told her about other alleged inappropriate sexual behavior involving Olson. That prompted four lawmakers to bring their concerns directly to Lefor, VanWinkle said in a text message to the North Dakota Monitor.
“The group asked leader Lefor to disallow Jeremy (Olson) from running as a candidate for Legislative Management,” VanWinkle said. “And then asked that he eventually step down from caucus leadership.”
Olson, in an interview Monday with the North Dakota Monitor, said he never saw the complaint that was filed against him.
“In this world right now, you are guilty until proven innocent,” Olson said. “And the faceless keyboard warriors will just jump on that.”
When asked about the allegation that he kissed an employee, Olson said, “I don’t remember anything like that, honestly. But honestly, I’m not going to respond to rumors. I don’t want to go there.”
Olson said he felt targeted by rumors and the complaint in the closing days of the legislative session. He said he decided to resign because “my family didn’t sign up for that sort of stuff.” 
Without citing examples, he said there are political groups working in the state that are trying to “take down” some lawmakers.
Olson, who represents District 26 in northwest North Dakota, has served for two legislative sessions. It will now be up to District 26 Republicans to appoint a replacement to serve the remainder of Olson’s term, which goes through 2028.
North Dakota lawmakers last year worked to update the Legislature’s workplace harassment policy, citing an uptick in complaints to the Ethics Commission.
Hogan said she believes the complaint process worked well in this case.
“There was obviously a serious concern about behavior, and I think particularly for people reporting, you have to assure that they know the process and assuring that you don’t assume one side is innocent or guilty,” Hogan said. “You have to really maintain a balance of protecting both sets of rights.”
In 2021, the North Dakota House expelled Rep. Luke Simons, R-Dickinson, related to harassment allegations. Hogan said the Simons allegations were the first time the legislative workplace harassment policy was used.
Lefor said he thinks the process worked well, but added that leaders may talk about how to improve the process in the future.
“As legislative leaders, we want to make absolutely sure that the assembly is a place where everyone feels safe, feels respected, feels supported. And that’s why we have these procedures in place to address these things and make sure it’s a fair and transparent process,” Lefor said. “That’s what happened here. Those procedures were followed.”

Humphrey Building, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., as seen on Nov. 23, 2023. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Wisconsin has joined 18 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit to block cuts and consolidations at the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that are part of the Trump administration’s objective to dismantle the department.
In Wisconsin, federal actions at HHS have cut off funding to address lead poisoning in Milwaukee schools, monitor and reduce maternal death and discourage young people from using tobacco, Kaul’s office said in announcing the lawsuit.
The lawsuit describes wholesale firings and department closings, many carried out under the auspices of “DOGE” — the Trump administration operation headed by Elon Musk that has gone into numerous government agencies, cutting staff and canceling funding. “DOGE” stands for “Department of Government Efficiency,” but it is not an official federal department.
The office of Gov. Tony Evers said Monday that in Wisconsin, those reductions are halting testing and oversight for bird flu; disrupting Head Start early education and child care programs; ending a program to offset high utility bills; and defunding substance abuse and mental health assistance programs.
“These devastating decisions will jeopardize the health and safety of Wisconsinites and our communities, all so Republicans can help pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires,” Evers said in a statement, adding that they were part of a plan to “undermine the constitutional checks and balances in our system that help ensure no one has the sole power to make decisions like this unchecked.”
Attorney General Josh Kaul said that a “dangerous mix of conspiracy theories and the extreme ideology reflected by DOGE are causing a staggering amount of damage to the extraordinarily important work of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, resulting in increased and unnecessary risk to people’s health and wellbeing.”
The federal actions were carried out under a directive issued March 27, the lawsuit says. It charges that through those actions, “the administration is seeking to dismantle HHS and its agencies, first by firing their staff and then by fully eliminating the funding” to a series of HHS programs.
“The terminations and reorganizations happened quickly, but the consequences are severe, complicated, and potentially irreversible,” the lawsuit states. “Plaintiff States are already suffering consequences of these terminations and reorganizations.”
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Rhode Island. It charges those actions are illegal for blocking spending already appropriated by Congress.
“Congress created HHS and has invested enormous sums into it every year without interruption, and the congressional mandates remain in place today,” the lawsuit charges. “Much of that investment was lost in a day through the massive firings of HHS’s leaders and staff. More will be lost if nothing is done.”
The lawsuit asserts that the March 27 directive violates the U.S. Constitution. It asks the court to declare the directive unlawful, to vacate it, and to block the administration from carrying it out.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-05 20:25:10+00:00,CT Mirror,Budget panel endorses raises for CT troopers,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/05/ct-state-police-union-raises/,"The tentative deal had strong bipartisan support, despite recent calls from Republican leaders to freeze wages for all CT state employees.","The legislature’s Appropriations Committee endorsed a two-year wage agreement with the state police union that would grant a 2.5% general wage hike and a step increase in each of the next two fiscal years.
The tentative deal negotiated by Gov. Ned Lamont, which heads to the General Assembly for final action, cleared the committee with strong bipartisan support, despite recent calls from Republican leaders to freeze wages for all state employees.
The House Republican Caucus proposed a $54.4 billion biennial budget last week that counts on more than $300 million in savings over the next two fiscal years by freezing pay for all workers. 
Raises for about 885 troopers would cost Connecticut $8.2 million over the next budget cycle. But if they are granted a 2.5% annual cost-of-living adjustment and a step, which typically adds another 2 percentage points to the raise, it would be difficult for the state to convince labor arbiters it could not afford effective 4.5% annual increases for other state employees.
Lamont currently is negotiating new contracts with nearly all other state bargaining units, whose current wage agreements expire June 30.
By about 11:30 a.m., representatives on the Appropriations Committee had voted 20-5 to support the raises, while senators on the panel backed them 12-0. Though all committees include senators and representatives, legislators must vote separately — by chamber — on contracts.
Two of the seven Republican representatives who had cast ballots by 11:30 a.m. supported the raises, as did all four GOP senators who’d voted.
Though 10 committee members still hadn’t cast their ballots by mid-afternoon — and leaders had extended the time deadline for several more hours — there weren’t enough outstanding votes among either representatives or senators to change the outcomes.
Legislators from both parties lamented a state police force that’s now about 25% smaller than the 1,200-plus troopers who served Connecticut prior to 2010. And legislators unanimously praised the troopers, whether voting for or against the raises.
“I don’t think it’s as simple as money,” said Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Democratic-controlled Appropriations Committee, who opposed the raises while expressing a desire to beef up the police force. “The benefit package is just not what it needs to be,” she added.
But Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the committee and a supporter of the pay hikes, quipped that — given Nuccio’s backing for better benefits — the state police’s staffing challenges would be solved soon.
“I’m so excited I can’t tell you,” Osten added. “I’m so excited I have her support for that.”
Democratic legislative leaders say most agencies, not just the state police, are understaffed and have never fully recovered from a decade of heavy personnel cuts in the 2010s and a 2022 surge in retirements that more than doubled the normal departure rate.
The state police force also is facing increasing competition from the roughly 95 municipal police departments in Connecticut, which have beefed up salaries to attract quality law enforcement personnel, said Ronnell A. Higgins, the commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, which includes the state police division.
“Those cities and towns have figured out that compensation is a way to attract qualified candidates,” he said.
Andrew Matthews, executive director of the state police union and a former president, said several union concessions packages have weakened retirement benefits for troopers.
Prior to 2011, a trooper was eligible for a hazardous duty pension based on the three highest annual salaries of a minimum 20 years of service.
Now Connecticut requires 25 years of service that offers a hybrid pension/401(k) benefit calculated on average wages over the entire 25-year span.
But Matthews also said workers deserve the raises in the tentative deal and more. 
“It’s a dangerous job,” he said, adding that 26 troopers have died in the line of duty and that post-traumatic stress injuries are “a real thing” many troopers face.
Nuccio and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, both said last week that while they value the role of the state police, Connecticut can’t afford to provide health pay hikes yet again given recent history. Raises for unionized state employees — considering both cost-of-living adjustments and step hikes — have averaged 4.5% over the past four years.
South Windsor Republican removed from Appropriations Committee
Candelora notified the Appropriations Committee on Monday that he was removing Rep. Tom Delnicki, a South Windsor Republican, from the panel. Delnicki could not be reached for comment.
Candelora said the South Windsor lawmaker had requested to be taken off that assignment. The minority leader added that he knew several Republicans planned to vote for the troopers’ raises, even though it contradicted the House GOP budget — and that he hadn’t pressed any supporters of the pay hikes to change their votes.
“When you have a [House] speaker that summarily dismisses your budget as fake, it’s difficult [to ask] Republicans to … stay true to that budget,” Candelora said. 
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, responded last week to House Republicans’ budget proposal by saying, “It’s not the most serious document I’ve ever seen, so we’ll probably have to write this one off.” 
The GOP budget had several elements that run sharply counter to Democrats’ core positions including: 

Cutting medical assistance for undocumented residents;


Assuming big savings by imposing hiring limits and across-the-board cuts to all agencies;


And canceling a popular anti-poverty program to assist Connecticut’s youth.

“I try very hard to take good ideas no matter where they come from, and I certainly appreciate the hard work” that all legislators put into the state budget, Ritter said, adding he remains open to hearing all GOP proposals.
The speaker also said his comment last week “was not meant to be disrespectful. But to find half a billion from mass layoffs and cuts to agencies that, in many cases, are short-staffed seemed like a tough start for our caucus.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4437-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-05 17:03:26.112634

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Lawmakers promised Monday that every employee would be paid on time after mental health officials admitted during a public hearing that they don’t know if there’s enough money in their budget to make payroll.
But lawmakers warned that they were growing impatient with Mental Health Commissioner Allie Friesen’s inability to explain specifics in her budget, and said that she shouldn’t expect any additional aid from the Legislature until she gets a better handle on the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ overall financial situation.
Friesen told lawmakers Monday that she’s not confident in her agency’s budget calculations and asked for help from the Legislature. She was asked to return to the Capitol to testify before lawmakers for the second time in four weeks after her agency abruptly revealed last week it couldn’t afford its more than $6 million payroll. 
But weeks after hearings began in the House, lawmakers said they’re frustrated and angry with the lack of answers from the agency as the deadline for legislators to finalize the upcoming state budget rapidly approaches. 
“I think there’s frustration levels on both sides of this, and they’re getting higher and higher and higher every single day,” said Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, co-chair of the select committee. “I appreciate that the department is saying that they are not confident in their numbers, but the Legislature stands ready to take care of our state employees, but at this time, probably not moving further with any other kind of budget requests until we really understand the financial situation.
The agency is facing several probes following reports of a $43 million deficit and a still unexplained request for a $6.2 million supplemental appropriation to help the department make ends meet through the end of the current fiscal year. 
In previous hearings, Friesen and interim Chief Financial Officer Skip Leonard said they were confident that the deficit was $43 million and only a $6.2 million supplemental appropriation was needed. But neither could explain how those numbers were reached or how $6.2 million would be enough. A revised budget request for the 2026 fiscal year has yet to be delivered to lawmakers. 
Friesen again pointed some of the blame for these financial issues on previous leadership.

“These numbers are changing, not because we’re indecisive or disorganized, but because we are for the first time in a very long time, uncovering the full depth of financial instability that has been hidden under layers of dysfunction,” Friesen said. “Those who are attempting to paint our efforts as incompetence are conveniently ignoring the reality of the situation. What we’re discovering is not just poor accounting, it is abuse, negligence and likely corruption. And let us be honest, these patterns didn’t develop overnight. They were tolerated, protected, and in some cases, fueled for the financial and political benefit of a select few.”
She said there is likely corruption, fraud and unethical behavior that occurred within the agency. Friesen said in the last week she learned that an unnamed member of the agency’s internal finance staff “intentionally withheld” information and has since resigned. 
She also said Leonard’s contract “expires” this week and he no longer serves in the interim CFO role. The agency launched a search for a permanent chief finance officer months after the former CFO resigned and a day after lawmakers questioned Leonard’s qualifications when he couldn’t answer basic budget questions. 
Leonard was not at Monday’s hearing. Instead Friesen brought Mike Rupke, who said he started working in the agency’s “operational excellence division” 35 days ago. 
Rupke said he’s skeptical of “every bucket” of the agency’s finances, but admitted he was still getting himself up-to-speed on the situation at hand and only recently gained full access to the agency’s human resource management system. 
When pressed by lawmakers, mental health officials struggled to pin down the exact personnel costs per pay period, noting they range from $6 million to $6.2 million, depending on contract costs.
Friesen asked for help from the Legislature’s fiscal staff to find consensus on accurate numbers for what the agency needs as a supplemental appropriation and for its budget for the upcoming fiscal year. 
Lawmakers said they need to be able to put together a budget by the Legislature’s deadline. 
  Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, left, and Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, speak with reporters following Monday’s hearing. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)
Rosino joined the committee as co-chair Monday and said it is the Legislature’s responsibility to appropriate dollars to state agencies, but not to figure out agency budgets. 
“I’m a little bit angry about today. I thought we were going to have some resolution, and it doesn’t seem like we do,” Rosino said. “It seems like we’re still up in the air, and that’s why we’re saying the House and the Senate will come together to take care of what we need to but after that, we are going to have to drill down these numbers deeper, and we are running out of time. The clock is ticking.”
He and Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, chair of the committee, said the Legislature will meet its required deadline to pass a budget with the best information available to lawmakers. 
Lawson said the Legislature and mental health department would be in a “very different position” if Friesen and agency staff had been more forthcoming about this uncertainty from the beginning. But he and Rosino said the Legislature will make sure state employees are taken care of.
“Numbers can change, and they can change quickly, and what hangs in the balance is certainty,” Lawson said. “And in this case, when it comes to payroll, it’s our state employees … $23 million, that’s a lot of money, it’s a lot of taxpayer money. So for that to be lobbed about left and right, that is uncertainty for us, it’s uncertainty for the employees there. I’m certainly not happy about it.”

The lawsuit was filed by Swanson’s attorney, Linda Fraas of Manchester, New Hampshire. Last month, after the trustees backed Municipal Manager Eric Duffy’s decision to demote Swanson, Fraas announced that the former chief planned to take legal action.Swanson’s lawsuit relies in part on testimony that Fraas had elicited from Duffy and police department employees during a public hearing in March before the five-member Village Trustees. Swanson sought that hearing to contest his demotion.The lawsuit alleges six violations, including breach of contract, wrongful discharge, infliction of emotional distress and conspiracy, among others.Named as defendants are the five village trustees — Seton McIlroy, Brenda Blakeman, Jeffrey Kahn, Frank Horneck and Lisa Lawlor — as well as Duffy, the firm Duffy had hired to conduct an investigation of Swanson, and both the town and village of Woodstock. (The police department, which falls under village oversight, serves all of Woodstock.)The lawsuit alleges that the trustees “jointly conspired to intentionally and maliciously demote (Swanson) knowing that there was no legal authority to do so” under his contract with the town. It also offers examples of alleged conflicts of interest, favoritism, secret dealings and ethical lapses by some trustees as they sought to push Swanson out of his job.Swanson, who returned to work as a patrol officer on April 24, is requesting a jury trial.None of the named defendants responded to an email seeking comment as of press time on Thursday. Under Vermont law, defendants have 21 days from the date of being served with the complaint to file an answer.“We are confident that justice will prevail and that Joe is grateful for the outpouring of support he has received from the townspeople,” Fraas said in an email to the Valley News on Thursday.Fraas added she is in the process of preparing a Rule 75 petition to appeal the trustees’ decision in Windsor County District Court.The lawsuit lays out in detail the timeline of events and alleged actions of the defendants over the nearly seven months. It begins with a minor road-rage incident involving Swanson’s husband that ultimately led into an investigation of Swanson’s leadership of the police department.During a marathon public hearing in March that lasted 14 ½ hours, several members of the police department voiced their unhappiness with Swanson’s tenure as police chief. Witnesses included the department’s second in command, Sgt. Chris O’Keefe, who now is serving as interim chief.Most of the complaints centered around allegations of poor communication, disorganization and showing up at the police station out of uniform.Following the public hearing in March, the trustees prepared a written report that supported Duffy’s decision to demote Swanson. That report has not been made public.In addition to his career on the police force, Swanson previously served as chair of the Woodstock Town Selectboard. He is the son of Phil Swanson, who for 34 years was the town manager of Woodstock. The town’s police, fire and emergency headquarters was named in his honor.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Demoted Woodstock police chief files $5 million suit.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Joe-Swanson-Eric-Duffy.jpg?fit=749%2C500&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 17:03:26.112634

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado will continue to lease a crucial piece of state-owned infrastructure to the Union Pacific railroad for the next 25 years in exchange for help with its plans to expand passenger rail service to several mountain communities, under an agreement signed Monday.
The deal, signed by Gov. Jared Polis and Union Pacific president Beth Whited at the governor’s residence in Denver, extends the railroad giant’s lease of the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel, which crosses under the Continental Divide between Winter Park and Rollinsville. The state owns the tunnel, which was completed in 1926 and leased to Union Pacific for a term of 99 years. A short-term agreement had previously extended the lease for four months following its expiration in December 2024 while the new terms were finalized.
“Moffat Tunnel represents an important part of Colorado’s history, as well as a bright part of our future,” Polis said in a press release. “With this work, we are showing the country a new model for pursuing passenger rail through collaboration with the railroad.”

Following the 1997 decommissioning of the Tennessee Pass line near Leadville, the Moffat Tunnel route is the only way for trains to travel between Colorado’s Western Slope and the Front Range. In addition to regular freight traffic, the tunnel is used by Amtrak’s long-haul California Zephyr passenger line, which makes several stops in Colorado on its route between Chicago and San Francisco, and the seasonal Winter Park Express, which offers service to the Winter Park ski resort from December to March.
The core of the new lease agreement is a state license for three daily round trips, or up to 506,000 train miles annually, for a new passenger rail service between Denver and mountain communities to the northwest. The mountain route, plans for which have been floated by Colorado transportation officials for the last several years, would complement the state’s separate efforts to reestablish north-south passenger service along the Front Range, still a decade or more away.
The state promised Monday that passenger rail to the mountains will be operational much sooner than that, with daily, year-round service between Denver and Granby beginning by 2026, and “flexibility for the state to expand service in future phases” as far as Steamboat Springs, Craig and Hayden. That expansion will depend on “needed capital improvements completed that are identified in the access agreement,” the state says.
“Today’s agreement will offer residents and visitors throughout Colorado new opportunities and choices to get where they’re going,” said Sally Chafee, chief of staff for the Colorado Department of Transportation. “More passenger rail trips between the Front Range and mountain communities in Winter Park, Granby, and beyond will offer an option in addition to the drive over Berthoud Pass.”
The new lease agreement also includes provisions finalizing Union Pacific’s sale to CDOT of the Burnham Lead Line, railroad track easement near the disused Burnham Yard in central Denver. The acquisition will help facilitate the planned redevelopment of the 60-acre former rail yard site.
“Union Pacific is proud of the hard work and spirit of collaboration that went into this agreement with the State of Colorado,” Withed said. “We came together as true partners and the result is an agreement that benefits the citizens of Colorado and the businesses and people who rely upon Union Pacific to deliver the goods and material vital to today’s economy.”

Christine Todd Whitman looks on. Both are leaders of the Forward Party, a political party launching in New Mexico. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Alaska U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski is one of the few  Republicans standing up to President Trump and expressing fear that key strategic alliances, our democracy, civil liberties and the rule of law are being under-mind. She also was one of the few  Republicans to vote to impeach him.
What makes her different? What allows her to feel  free to make those statements and take that action  that are nearly unheard of right now within the  Republican MAGA party? It is the structure within which she was elected.
Alaska has non-partisan primaries that allow all  voters to vote for all candidates. Primaries are no  longer controlled by the parties. Then the top four  vote getters go to the general election where ranked  choice voting is used.
She can move through the primary without fear of  being “primaried” in a race in which only the party  base, the most MAGA, can vote. Rather, she is incentivized to reach out to all voters, and the  majority of voters want her to be independent and vote her conscience, not tow the party line. This is  what democracy reform at all levels is about: Creating a representative government that works for  all of us all the time.
This is the opposite of what Wyoming has, which is a  closed primary system. Remember how brave Congresswoman Liz Chaney was to buck her party  and vote to impeach President Trump because he incited the Capitol riots through his election  denialism? Well, she lost her Republican primary  election in Wyoming by a huge margin because only Republicans could vote.
But, so what? Why is that important today here in  New Mexico?
The New Mexico Legislature recently passed SB16, which allows independent voters to choose one major  party ballot. This is one small step toward that ideal where all voters can vote for all candidates. I spent 10 years as founder and president of NM Open Elections working on its passage.
It will set up a situation in which partisan candidates have to reach out to independent voters who will not  have the same feelings about party discipline as the party base, and I mean with both the Republicans and the Democrats. It means candidates and  incumbents alike will have to do a better job of  spreading their message and listening to a broader cross section of the voting public. And it means there  is a better chance that incumbents can vote their  conscience, rather than bending to a party line that they may or may not agree with all the time. And the outcome of this freedom will be better policies  representing a broader cross section of voters.
I know that we are years away from being able to  pass the next steps in democracy reform here in New  Mexico, but we have taken the first step by ending our closed primary system. But make no mistake there have to be next steps.
Step one: Educate independents that they can vote in  the 2026 primary and make sure large majorities do.  Let’s prove the pundits wrong and show that  independent voters will come out to vote when given  the chance.
Step two: Support candidates who will prioritize  reaching out to those independent voters and teach  them how to communicate with these non-aligned  voters.
Step three: Plan for the next steps in reform including finally passing an independent redistricting  commission, paying our Legislature, placing term limits on our Legislature to match the term limits we  have on nearly every other office and moving to a truly open primary system in which all voters can vote for all candidates in first round public elections.
To be sure, Democrats supported SB16 in greater numbers than Republicans and I deeply appreciate that. But Democrats oppose nearly every reform in step three above as do Republicans. The other states that have adopted these reforms, and there are many, all have legislative by-pass through ballot initiate where a voter can gather signatures and place an  issue on the ballot. We don’t have that here.
Unfortunately, both major parties play politics with the law to game the system. When President Biden  declined to seek re-election, why did the Democratic  Party refuse to hold a primary or even an open  convention so that many candidates could be heard and vetted?
It’s time for a party to put voters first and that is why I am now working with others to found the New  Mexico Forward Party. We support all the democracy reform issues listed above and will be running  candidates in 2026 for the State House of Representatives against those law makers who voted  against open primaries.

The House-approved annual budget bill reveals policy and political fault lines
The post Weekly Roundup – Budget Bonanza appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","BEACON HILL passed another annual mile marker with House approval of an annual budget bill, and as is often the case, the road there was more interesting for the way it revealed policy and political fault lines than for the nuts and bolts of spending state dollars.Yes, representatives added some $81 million to the bottom line, but they also tilted at times into discussion of immigration enforcement, clean energy mandates, communication between incarcerated individuals and their loved ones, and much more.In most cases, the topics got a few minutes in the spotlight because Republicans pushed for public discussion and standalone recorded votes. And virtually every time, Democrats flexed their power-in-numbers strength and circled the wagons to reject GOP proposals to tack serious policy changes onto the budget.That doesn’t mean they limited amendments only to earmarks. House Democrats slipped a few eye-catching initiatives of their own into the mega-amendments they hashed out in private, including language prohibiting the Department of Mental Health from cutting caseworker levels beyond fiscal 2025 levels.Another provision quietly tucked into the House budget would require employers with 25 or more workers who do not already offer a qualified retirement plan to automatically enroll workers into a state-run retirement savings plan, or else face fines.While Republicans generated commentary and recorded votes on several high-profile topics, they did not present a unified front over the course of the week.Only a subset of the 25-member House GOP caucus expressed support for roll call votes on several tax policy proposals from Rep. Marc Lombardo of Billerica, and the same pattern played out again when first-term Rep. John Gaskey tried to force a roll call during a debate about transgender athletes in high school sports.The kerfuffle over tax amendments prompted Lombardo, who mounted a failed bid to become House GOP leader at the start of the term, to call for House Minority Leader Brad Jones to resign from that post.“This is unbelievable. This is absolutely treasonous from the Republican leader to not want to give roll calls for the taxpayers,” Lombardo said in a video he posted to social media from outside the House chamber. “You’re not hurting me. The amendment went down just the same. What you’ve done is hurt the party, for candidates that want to run, and you’ve hurt the taxpayers who want to understand how their representatives vote. Brad Jones conspired with the Democrats today. I expect more of that this week. He needs to resign.”Jones fired back, saying the lack of unified Republican support for roll calls on Lombardo’s idea was a result of the Billerica rep not showing up to private meetings, according to the Boston Herald.“I’m not going to go waste my time working with people who just want to kick me. It’s kind of human nature. It’s not Republican, not Democrat … it’s just human nature,” Jones said, per the Herald. “He’s obviously still hurting over the fact that he got smoked.”Said Lombardo: “Brad Jones might be the Republican manager but he certainly is not the Republican leader. Leaders take care of their team and do what’s right for the team and lift everybody up. We don’t try to create division in the ranks. And that’s what Brad did earlier this week. Perhaps he’s upset that he’s getting local opposition for him supporting massive earmarks that the Democrats are putting in and actively conspiring with the Democrats against Republican initiatives.”The budget now moves across the hall to the Senate, where the top Democrat this week cautioned the plan the Senate plans to pass this month might shift considerably later in the year if federal funds are pulled back.Senate President Karen Spilka said the budget that makes its way back to Gov. Maura Healey’s desk “may not be the final budget if some of these cuts, or many of them, unfortunately prove true.”Beacon Hill Democrats have spent months talking up the damage of potential federal actions, while not making spending adjustments and expressing hope that the Washington funding faucet will stay in the open position.The governor, often a vocal critic of Trump, finds herself walking a fine line these days, especially as peers like Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan draws criticism and interest from some corners for actively fostering a relationship with the president.“Any governor in any state wants to have a good working relationship with the federal administration, and that continues to be the case,” Healey said. “What is also clear after 100 days is that this federal administration is finding ways to hurt our states left and right.”Before they get to their annual budget rewrite, senators will take up another spending bill putting to use about $1.3 billion in collected-but-not-appropriated revenue from the voter-approved surtax on wealthy households.The draft that emerged this week augurs tricky negotiations between House and Senate Democrats.Both the House and Healey proposed directing most of that money toward transportation and the T in particular, where recent service improvements could be threatened by a budget gap. The Senate, however, suggested a more even education-transportation split and less than half as much one-time MBTA funding as did the other two corners of the Big Three.Senate budget chief Michael Rodrigues said his team wanted to “maintain as close to a 50-50 split as possible between education and transportation,” describing “serious concerns” about special education costs in school districts.The spending dispute is one of the first big pressure points this term for House and Senate Democrats, who four months in still have not agreed to final rules reforms they touted as a way to boost transparency.Other signs of tension are emerging, like when House budget chief Aaron Michlewitz capped off completion of his chamber’s annual budget bill by taking a shot at the Senate.Less than an hour after the engrossment vote, Michlewitz circulated an email listing which representatives attended which Ways and Means Committee hearings in recent months — in the process resurfacing a House-Senate disagreement over in-person attendance requirements.“Per the rules proposals passed by the House, our intention is to regularly publish this committee member attendance information on the legislature’s website,” Michlewitz wrote. “However to this point we have been unable to do so, because the Senate has not allowed Legislative Information Services, our joint IT department, to publicly post House member committee attendance.”Zing! And on the subject of transparency, the Ways and Means Committee that Michlewitz leads is one of the few on Beacon Hill that notify the press when they are voting to move bills out of committee.The state Department of Public Utilities also ruffled feathers this week with a sudden regulatory action further reducing how much gas companies can charge customers for replacing pipes.DPU Chair James Van Nostrand said the change would provide savings for ratepayers at a time of high energy costs, slamming gas companies for “costing the state’s ratepayers billions for over a decade” via “unnecessary” Gas System Enhancement Plan projects.But some figures are less than thrilled. The business-backed Mass Coalition for Sustainable Energy called on regulators to rethink the order “and ignore unrealistic, ideologically driven assumptions that put our safety and economic future at risk.”The post Weekly Roundup – Budget Bonanza appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bigstock-Massachusetts-State-House-Bos-31318976.jpg?fit=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 16:07:28.925115

Sarah Trone Garriott announced Monday she will run as a Democratic candidate for Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District.
Currently, the 3rd District is represented by U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, a Republican who has held the seat since defeating former U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne, a Democrat, in the 2022 election. The Iowa House seat, covering much of the Des Moines metropolitan area and much of of central and southern Iowa, is expected to be one of the most competitive districts in the 2026 general election.
Trone Garriott, currently representing West Des Moines in the Iowa Senate, said in a video announcing her campaign she was well-suited to run for the seat because of her track record winning in competitive state legislative races.
“I’m no stranger to tough fights,” Trone Garriott said. “I’m the only Iowa Democrat who flipped two seats from red to blue, then won a district that went to Trump in 2024. I know how to win, and I know how to deliver for Iowans.”
She was first elected to the Iowa Legislature in 2020, when she defeated Republican Scott Cirksena to represent Iowa State Senate District 22. In 2022, she defeated then-Senate President Jake Chapman to represent Senate District 14 after redistricting, and won a close race against GOP challenger Mark Hanson in 2024.
Trone Garriott, a 46-year-old Lutheran pastor, said she would work in Congress to lower the costs of child care, health care and housing, as well as “restoring the rights and freedoms lost in recent years.” She also criticized Nunn’s time in Congress, saying “Zach Nunn has failed us.”
“As Iowans struggle with higher costs, attacks on our personal freedoms and reckless cuts to our public schools, Zach Nunn is not showing up,” Trone Garriott said. “He’s not listening, and he’s not working for us. Iowans know that I show up for all my constituents, and that I listen and that I speak out.”
Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson with the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans’ campaign arm, criticized Trone Garriott in a statement Monday.
“Out of touch Democrat Sarah Trone Garriott is another activist attempting to radicalize Iowa — pushing a dangerous, extreme agenda that would raise costs, allow men in girls’ sports, and weaken public safety,” Tuttle said. “Iowans want leaders who deliver commonsense results, and that’s exactly why they’ll send Zach Nunn back to Congress.”
While Nunn has not officially announced a reelection campaign, he is expected to run for the seat again in 2026. He ruled out a run for governor last week in an interview on the WHO AM Simon Conway show, saying he is focused on his work in Washington, D.C., on issues like cutting taxes and securing the U.S. southern border.
Nunn won in 2024 against Democrat Lanon Baccam with roughly 52% of the vote. In the previous election, the race was rated as a “tossup” by some political forecasters — Sabato’s Crystal Ball now has the seat, alongside Iowa’s 1st Congressional District currently represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, listed as “tossup” races heading into 2026.
House Democrats’ campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has highlighted Nunn’s seat, as well as Miller-Meeks’ and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson’s, as “Districts in Play” in the upcoming midterm elections, areas where Democrats plan to focus their efforts to flip seats and potentially regain control of the U.S. House.
“Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, and Zach Nunn are running scared, and they should be,” DCCC Chair Suzan DelBene said in an April statement. “From tanking the economy, gutting Medicaid, abandoning our veterans, to making everything more expensive, they’ve broken their promises to Iowans, and it’s going to cost them their seats. The DCCC is already working to recruit authentic and battle-ready candidates in Iowa who reflect these districts and will work to better Iowans’ lives, not line Elon Musk and their DC party bosses’ pockets.”
Trone Garriott is not the only Democrat expected to run in Iowa’s 3rd District. Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst and Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, have also said they are considering running for the seat, though Trone Garriott is the first to officially launch her campaign.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8284-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-05-05 16:07:28.925115

(DOTD video via Franklin Associates)Road construction and repair is arguably the most visible sign of government at work, so it’s no surprise that the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development – with an $19 billion backlog of highway projects – is in the crosshairs of Republican state leaders pushing for a public agency revamp.
A package of legislation promises to deliver that overhaul of DOTD, which employs 4,300 state workers. Its key components are scheduled for debate Tuesday in the state House of Representatives. 
But there are concerns the changes will be radical rather than surgical, bringing to mind a chainsaw-wielding Elon Musk and the federal government cuts his Department of Government Efficiency has made. The Trump administration has since had to rescind many of those dismissals.
The proposals to shakeup DOTD would place more control over highway construction projects directly under the governor’s office, with an emphasis on infrastructure considered critical to economic development. Critics worry that underscoring expediency could come at the cost of safety when designing and building roads and bridges.

Rep. Ryan Bourriaque, R-Abbeville, authored the proposals and rejects suggestions that his bills bear any resemblance to the DOGE-driven purge in Washington. For starters, he said efforts to reconfigure DOTD have been shaped through bipartisan feedback from members of the House Committee on Transportation he chairs. It’s held monthly meetings since January specifically to get input on his proposals, he said. 
“I don’t think a lot of the things we’re talking about surprise a lot of people, you know, because we’ve had these discussions,” Borriaque said last month in an interview.
Long-distance dedication
Borriaque’s House Bill 556 would restrict the DOTD’s use of the state Transportation Trust Fund to actual construction projects. That would end the practice of using the money to pay DOTD employee salaries and benefits that goes back more than 30 years. 
The fund, established in 1990 with a specific dedication to roadwork, gets its proceeds from taxes on gasoline and motor fuels. Beyond having employee pay siphoned from the account, the fund revenue stream struggled to keep up with increases in construction costs.  
Borriaque’s proposed changes mean compensation for DOTD employees, which comes to $438 million next fiscal year, would have to come out of the state general fund. There’s consensus among lawmakers for limiting the trust fund to actual construction, an objective they’ve discussed for years but never figured out how to achieve. 
To accomplish it, it means the governor and lawmakers would have to cover DOTD personnel costs while facing a budget deficit that will exceed $570 million in another two years, according to the most recent legislative fiscal staff forecasts. 
Lawmakers don’t have to tackle this math for another year, as Bourriaque’s measures wouldn’t take effect until July 1, 2026. 
Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, the legislature’s lead author of the state budget, told The Advocate last week money in the general fund that has been put toward DOTD projects in the state construction budget will cover employee overhead at the agency instead.   
Power shifts
Bourriaque originally wanted to give DOTD’s secretary more authority to “eliminate any position within the department,” reinforcing an executive order Gov. Jeff Landry issued last May. Bourriaque has since updated the job reduction provisions to align with state Civil Service rules, acknowledging the legislature cannot unilaterally have classified employees fired. 
Rep. Joy Walters, D-Shreveport, was among the few members of the transportation committee who pushed back on unfettered DOTD employee reductions without any prior assessment of the impacted professionals or their importance to the agency.  
“I do know that change is necessary. Change is good,” Walters said in an April 15 interview. “But I believe also in transparency.”
Gov. Landry might get the insurance laws he wants, but not without ruffling some Republican feathers

Another concern for Walters lies within Bourriaque’s House Bill 640, which creates the Office of Louisiana Highway Construction in the governor’s Division of Administration. The office would have its own executive director and staff, but there are no details yet on the size of the staff or compensation for these new government positions.
Proposed measures within House Bill 528 by Bourriaque would allow the governor to appoint a deputy secretary for the new DOTD Office of Transformation, which was launched in January. It was among the recommendations of a Boston Consulting Group review of department operations and structure, which led to a DOTD “strategic improvement plan.”   
The ultimate goal of the governor might be to do away with DOTD, Walters said, and replace it with the state Office of Highway Construction. The governor has never stated this is his intent, but the creation of a new Division of Administration offshoot for transportation seems to move away from the DOGE philosophy of shrinking government, according to Walters.
“If you ask me, we are giving the governor a lot of rein outside of the scope of what is necessarily needed to run government effectively,” she said. “My strong concern is that we are politicizing that particular position, and then you can be hired and fired really quickly.”
Walters said she’s more amenable to a provision in House Bill 556 that creates an assistant secretary of project delivery within DOTD. Borriaque referred to the role as a “change agent” that would replace the current post of chief engineer. Walters’ research into transportation agencies in other states found that California has a similar position with oversight of thousands of employees directly involved in highway construction.
Expert advice
When Bourriaque’s bills advanced from the transportation committee, there were questions about whether it would reduce the number of engineers at the agency. In an interview, he said amendments on the House floor would likely restore the chief engineer’s duties and carve out a more specific job description for the new project delivery leader.
Peter Robins-Brown with Louisiana Progress, an advocacy group for the poor and working class, asked committee members to keep safety in mind when shaking up the DOTD. He linked improved conditions for pedestrians and cyclists with the ongoing legislative efforts to bring down auto insurance costs.  
“The fear is that in the rush to catch up with that backlog – which is important, right, like we need to catch up with that backlog as quickly as we can – we don’t want to see what is already, apparently not a very good process for creating safer roads. We don’t want to see that get bumped down the priority list,” Robins-Brown said in a subsequent interview. 
Norma Jean Mattei, an engineering faculty member  at the University of New Orleans, is also part of the Louisiana Transportation Research Center, DOTD’s testing and experimentation arm. 
Mattei, who was national president of the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2017, said any reform at the department should take place with preserving institutional knowledge in mind, given the relatively short career spans of politicians. 
“One of the issues with elected officials is they come in and they only have this lens of four to eight years, and they’re gone,” Mattei told the Illuminator. “Then somebody else comes in with another vision. You want to have some type of continuity so that there’s not this knee-jerk reaction … you wipe everything clean every time we’ve got a new person in charge.”

Janet Mills enters the House chamber for the annual joint State of the Judiciary address on Feb. 25, 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills and the leaders of five other northeast states extended an invitation to Canadian leaders Monday to discuss the importance of cross-border relationships amid actions from the Trump administration that have threatened them. 
While additional details regarding the time and date of the meeting were not available, the leaders proposed to meet in Boston in “the near future,” according to a news release from Mills’ office. 
“Our economies and our cultures have enjoyed strong relationships for generations, which is now strained by the president’s haphazard tariffs and harmful rhetoric targeting our northern neighbors,” Mills said. 
She added that she looks forward to telling her Eastern Canada counterparts that Maine values their partnerships and “will work to ensure our historic friendship and deeply intertwined economies endure for generations to come.”
The invite came from Mills, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, Rhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee, and Vermont Gov. Phil Scott — the only Republican in the group. It was sent to the premiers of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Québec.
As President Donald Trump has gone back and forth on imposing tariffs, some as high as 25%, on Maine’s northern neighbor, Mills, along with Maine’s business community, has warned that any new tax would have a significant negative impact on the state. 
In radio addresses and other statements, she has also underscored how vital Canada is to the state’s economy, especially as a trade partner. Every year, Maine exports $1.4 billion in goods to Canada and in turn imports more than $5 billion worth of goods. 
Mills specifically said that any new tax could increase costs for daily essentials such as gasoline and food. The most heating oil dependent state in the nation, Maine imports more than 80% of its heating fuel and gasoline from Canada, the release said.
Similarly, the agriculture sector said in early April that the tariffs could incite a trade war that would increase costs for consumers and eat away at already thin profit margins. 
Mills is also concerned that Trump rhetoric about Canada could harm Maine’s summer tourism season. Last year, Canadian visitors spent nearly half a billion dollars in Maine, but Mills’ office said estimates show that the state could see Canadian tourists drop by about 25%. 
“Whether Canadians decide to visit this summer (and we truly hope they do) or at a later time, they will always find a warm welcome in Maine,” said Carolann Ouellette, director of the Maine Office of Tourism.
While it’s not clear whether or how much the tariffs will directly impact electricity, the Maine Office of Public Advocate has raised concern about the potential impact on customers, especially 58,000 ratepayers in Aroostook and Washington counties who live along the border and have little choice but to rely on Canadian energy to keep their lights on.

And while Michigan made strides last legislative session to expand funding for resources for indigenous violence victims and connecting indigenous stakeholders to lawmakers, leaders in Michigan must holdfast to the commitment to end the crisis of violence, Melissa Pope, chief judge of the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi Tribal Court, chief justice of the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians Tribal Court and member of the Michigan Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention and Treatment Board said in a statement on Friday.
“In addition to the full enactment of the laws addressing this crisis, we must commit the resources necessary for immediate and ongoing searches when Indigenous People go missing until they are found,” Pope said. “We must also commit the resources to provide safety to victims while offering culturally honoring services to heal the trauma of survivors, support the families of the missing, and honor those who have been murdered while supporting the loved ones whose lives will be forever changed. Of crucial importance is the prosecution of those who murder and commit violence against Indigenous People. It is only through these combined efforts that Indigenous People will be safe from violence.”
The majority of indigenous people will experience violence in their life, with the National Institute of Justice reporting that 83% of men and women in the community will experience violence in their lifetime, a rate 52% higher than the general population. And women and girls are almost twice as likely to experience sexual violence than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts.
Michigan is home to 12 federally recognized tribes and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer posted a video on “X” Monday calling violence against indigenous Michiganders unacceptable, and applauding the Michigan Attorney General’s Office for creating a Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Task Force late last year to investigate long-overlooked cases.

“We all need to do more to raise awareness and pursue justice. Since taking office, I’ve been committed to working closely with tribal governments so we can address historic traumas and develop specific policies and protocols to investigate and reduce all incidents of violence against indigenous women and girls,” Whitmer said. “The bottom line is, no one should live in fear, and every victim deserves justice. But let’s keep working together to make it happen.”
In recognizing May 5 as Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons (MMIP) Awareness Day, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) addressed violence against Indigenous Michiganders in a news release as a “crisis” that the department is urgently addressing.
In the interest of raising awareness and honoring the lives that have been lost in Michigan, the state health department is calling attention to the Division of Victim Services (DVS) which provides grant funding to Michigan tribes to address sexual violence, domestic violence and other victim services in a culturally honoring manner.
Elizabeth Hertel, Director of the state health department, in a news release said the state health department is not simply committed to raising awareness, but partnering with tribal communities to best address violence and the impact it has on the entire community.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Facetune_03-05-2024-13-21-13-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-05 16:07:28.925115

Linda Dunbar, a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians and marginalized Communities advocate for New Day Advocacy Centers, said when she was in foster care 50 years ago in St. Paul, Minnesota, her mother was murdered and her killer was never charged.
Rose Barber, a member of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, a Wisconsin Murdered, Missing, Indigenous Women and Relatives (MMIWR) Task Force Member, and president of American Indians Against Abuse, said decades ago, an Alaskan Native friend went missing and his body was never found. Even today, nobody knows what happened to him.
After a round dance performed by the Red Cliff Women’s Hand Drum group, dozens of names were read of tribal members from Minnesota and Wisconsin who are officially listed as murdered or missing, names such as Melissa Beson of Lac du Flambeau, missing since March 17, Gene J. Cloud, Jr. of Black River Falls, Lisa Lynn Ninham of Menominee County and Nevaeh Leigh Kingbird of Bemidji, Minnesota.

And then more names were shouted out, names that had never been officially reported but who family members said had just disappeared and were never heard from again or who died a mysterious death.
The names were honored at the No More MMWIR event, which was held Sunday, May 4, in Bayview Park in Ashland by the shore of Lake Superior.
The event is one of several being held around the nation during the month of May to raise awareness of the MMIWR issue that has plagued tribal communities nationwide. On some tribal reservations, the murder rate for tribal women is ten times the national average. Tribal members face violence, both domestic and outside their families, at a higher rate than the general population. Several factors contribute to the MMIWR phenomenon including the fact that missing people belong to a vulnerable population that has suffered historical trauma and is disproportionately affected by poverty and substance abuse; exploitation associated with itinerant workers in mining and oil camps near reservations; and an inconsistent track record of law enforcement committing resources to solve murders or finding missing person.
Justine Rufus, co-chair of the Wisconsin MMIWR Task Force, rural coordinator of the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault, and a Bad River member, spoke about the need for state funding to address the issue.
Rufus said that since the task force was created five years ago, awareness of the MMIWR issue has grown, but the number of MMIWR cases has also risen.

“We can keep creating awareness and education, which is very important,” she said. “What we really need is actual action to address this crisis. Our relatives are going missing at higher rates now since we created this task force. We are being murdered at higher rates. We are being sex trafficked higher than we’ve ever seen, so it takes real action.”
Rufus said no state has designated dollars for the MMIWR issue in its budget. (Minnesota sends a percentage of license plate fees to underwrite its MMIWR Office, part of the Department of Public Safety.)
She noted that Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers’ proposed budget includes $3.5 million to create 11 MMIWR liaison offices with the 11 tribes in the state, working with the Attorney general and the Department of Justice.
“I applaud Gov. Evers for putting this in the budget,” she said. “He’s the first governor in the nation to put any dollars towards this crisis. But now is the time of action. We need to call your legislators to tell them that we demand to continue this work.”
Rufus also called for more funding for law enforcement. “Some of our communities don’t even have law enforcement,” she said. She noted the ongoing search for Melissa Beson in Vilas County has consumed many resources.
Rufus encouraged the crowd to contact legislative Joint Finance Committee members to urge them to approve funding for MMIWR issues.
Rene Ann Goodrich, a Bad River tribal member and MMIWR advocate for the last 10 years, who is a member of the Wisconsin MMIWR Task Force and a board member of the Minnesota MMIWR Office, a member of the Native Lives Matter Coalition and the No More MMIW and Relatives Movement, noted the local effort in the Twin Ports area of Superior and Duluth, Minnesota to raise awareness.
She said MMIWR events feature important Native American elements.
“I wanted to share a little bit about some of the cultural practices that we bring as a people to the contemporary missing and murdered indigenous women and relatives movement that helps to promote the healing for our families and our communities.”
She noted the cultural practice of offering tobacco and prayers to request guidance. And she talked about how the red dress had become the official symbol of the MMIWR movement. For Native Americans, red represents a “connection between the physical and spiritual world.”
“The red dresses began with our sisters doing this work and advocacy for lost loved ones up in Canada, and so we’ve started the work down here about 10 years ago with the red dresses,” she said, “so we’re asking for communities from Minnesota to Wisconsin to please start hanging out those red dresses and hang out red shirts also, because our men, our boys, our two spirits people, they matter, too, and we want to honor them.”
For many tribal people who had dealt with historical trauma, including the legacy of family members being shipped to federal boarding schools, Goodwich said, it is difficult to talk about the MMIWR issue but the red dress or red shirt is a way to raise awareness.
“I understand that it’s a difficult topic, and it’s very difficult for many of us to be able to speak about this movement, this legacy of trauma, this intergenerational trauma that we do carry,” she said. “So the red dresses are a quiet form of advocacy. They speak for themselves. Hang out a red dress on your porch; hang it in your yard. You’re spreading awareness that way. You don’t necessarily need to have all the data or the background, but this is a quiet, honoring form of advocacy that everyone can do.”
Goodwich noted that she and her granddaughter, Alexis, were gathering names family members wanted to honor, including those who have not been officially recognized as missing or murdered.
“As we become more educated and more familiar about this epidemic and how it impacts us, Indigenous people disproportionately across Turtle Island (Earth), leaving us with this legacy, including the boarding school, the legacy from this colonization, how this violence disproportionately impacts our women and our girls …  we’re learning more each year about the broad spectrum of violence that is this movement,” said Goodwich.

Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland) represents a district that includes the Bad River and Red Cliff bands of Lake Superior Chippewa.
“We know that part of what makes this such a major issue that has been so difficult to solve as a country, as a state, is that we’ve just failed to make missing and murdered Indigenous people a priority,” said Stroud.
“My experience tells me that when native people are struggling, too often there’s a tendency for systems of power to have an attitude that it’s not our problem, like it’s a problem of tribes or just the problem of local communities,” she added.
Stroud said the legacy of state violence and the scourges of drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, homicide and human trafficking are connected. 
She called on people living on ceded Native American land to recognize  “the moral responsibility of our government to prioritize missing and murdered Indigenous people.”
“So as the state representative of this area of Bad River and Red Cliff and any other indigenous people who live in the 73rd, I want you to know that I care, that I see you, and I will do what I can to walk this journey with you of finding those who are missing and sitting together in the pain of those who are gone,” she said.

Dunbar noted that the Red Cliff Women’s Hand Drum Group, performing for the event, had formed to support the community, and each woman had made her own hand drum as part of her spiritual quest.
“These women wanted to come today and sing songs for everyone here for healing and for their own healing,” she said.
Those who are left behind after a family member goes missing or is murdered have a need to heal, Dunbar said, and she recounted her own experience.
“People ask me why I am so motivated to work on the MMIWR issue,” she said. “When I was a little girl, my mother was killed in Saint Paul, Minnesota. They never, ever arrested the person who killed her. They took her body and placed it in a grave, and for some 50 years my family has been looking for her grave, and as the Creator would have it, this past fall we were able to find her grave. Most of my brothers have passed on. There are only three of us left out of nine. And so our nieces and our nephews and our grandchildren are going to journey to her grave this spring to do that ceremony to welcome her home.”

Chip Campsen, Majority Leader Shane Massey and Stephen Goldfinch chat in the Senate chamber during the first week of the 2024 session Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024, in Columbia, S.C. (File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — This week will decide the fate of a massive energy package in South Carolina, after the House removed measures meant to safeguard consumers and landowners in the push to meet power needs of the state’s rapidly growing industry and population.
To produce enough energy to keep the lights on in the Palmetto State, utility executives told legislators, they needed guarantees that state regulators would review power-related permits in a timely manner and prevent years-long delays of new pipelines and power plants in the court system.
In exchange, senators told the utility sector it must ensure residential customers weren’t bearing the brunt of industry-driven power needs, particularly those of energy-intensive data centers. They also said utilities must give landowners earlier notice when construction of power plants, power lines and pipelines impact their property and that more effort was needed to help customers conserve energy and lower their power bills.
‘Cutting-edge’ supercomputing facility, a $2.8B investment, planned for Spartanburg County

But last week, state House members quietly pulled those give-and-take protections for power customers and landowners, potentially putting passage at risk with just three days left in the legislative session.
With a vote of 88-13 last Thursday, the House stripped out everything the Senate added related to data centers. Under the House version, center developers don’t have to bear their share of costs for new power plants built to power them or disclose how much water they plan to use. And they can still earn sales tax credits for computer equipment bought for the centers.
Rep. Gil Gatch, R-Summerville, told his colleagues the amendment was the result of a compromise between House and Senate negotiators.
Little else was said beyond Rep. Robert Reese asking what the amendment did about data centers, and Gatch pledging those concerns will be addressed in separate legislation next year. Reese, of rural Hopkins, was among the 13 Democrats who rejected the changes.
Other items struck by the amendment received no mention at all on the floor: Gone are additional notice requirements for landowners impacted by eminent domain, which is the taking of private property for public use. It also scaled back energy efficiency efforts.
Gatch, joined at the podium by other members of the House committee that has shepherded the bill, told the chamber it was the committee’s understanding the negotiated changes would pass in the Senate, allowing a bill two years in the making to head to Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk this week.
But the Senate leaders who authored the provisions removed by the House told the SC Daily Gazette they were not part of negotiations. And they highly doubt the Legislature will revisit anything on data centers next year if the altered bill becomes law.
‘Under the gun’
The amended bill could come up for a vote in the Senate as soon as Tuesday. A final decision must be made by 5 p.m. Thursday — the end of the session, as per state law — or negotiations will carry over until next year. Power company executives have said passage this year is essential to future projects.
At the heart of the bill, sponsored by GOP House Speaker Murrell Smith of Sumter, is permission for Dominion Energy and state-owned utility company Santee Cooper to partner on a possible 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant on the site of a former coal-fired power plant along the Edisto River in Colleton County.
In its original form, the legislation saw significant pushback on its sweeping regulatory changes and rollback of consumer protections passed in the wake of South Carolina’s failed nuclear expansion. Both bodies ultimately left those existing protections alone.
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

The reason the House removed most provisions added by the Senate during its floor debate, according to Rep. Bill Herbkersman, was contract deadlines faced by Dominion and Santee Cooper. The deadlines involve an interstate natural gas pipeline needed to supply the proposed Lowcountry gas plant and other supplies related to the project.
The House felt “under the gun” to pass something, and the new restrictions were “not really part of what we were trying to do,” in the energy bill aimed at speeding up the regulatory process for utilities as they make updates to the state’s power grid, Herberksman said, adding they hadn’t been vetted by the House committee he chairs.
“You wouldn’t half bake a cake,” said the Bluffton Republican.
One change made in the Senate, however, did survive: The House kept a Senate-added section that would make it easier for utilities to raise power bills on an annual basis.
‘Utility wish list’
The changes approved by the House last Thursday renewed criticism of the bill from environmental and consumer groups who say all that’s left is a “utility wish list.”
“What is in this bill to protect customers?” asked Kate Mixson, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “What’s left is just a list of things that make it easier for utilities and far fewer things to keep power companies from overbuilding and passing the cost on to consumers.”
“With these changes, this legislation is basically like an open bar tab for utility company spending that the public will pay for on their electric bills,” added Eddy Moore of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.
Herbkersman called that characterization a “misnomer,” arguing the gas plant at Canadys would allow Santee Cooper to replace parts of its coal-fired fleet with natural gas that emits fewer greenhouse gases. It would also guarantee the state has the energy it needs as it continues to grow.
SC’s state-owned utility enacts higher rates for data centers, large users

Senators who don’t like the so-called compromise — and weren’t involved in closed-door negotiations — include the chamber’s GOP leader.
“The data center language was one of the few things I liked about the bill, and it was not very aggressive,” said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, who authored the data center provisions.
The Edgefield Republican vowed to make his displeasure known when senators take up the bill on the floor.
“South Carolinians are going to pay more for energy generation, and citizens are going to pay more than they should for data centers … which to me is completely unacceptable,” Massey said.
Frank Knapp, president of the SC Small Business Chamber of Commerce, encouraged senators to “stick to their guns” when it comes to the power-gobbling centers.
‘It will not go easy’
While the Senate passed its version overwhelmingly last month, “it will not go easy this time, even if the votes are there,” Massey said.
Everything added on the Senate floor was important to the members who voted for it, said Sen. Tom Davis. For the Beaufort Republican, it was requiring public utility companies to do more to help customers make their homes energy efficient.
As part of these programs, power companies send inspectors to people’s homes to check for gaps in windows, leaking ducts and outdated air conditioning systems that might contribute to higher energy usage. The companies offer rebates and discounts to customers who make home improvements, and in some cases, power companies cover the costs for low-income families.
The savings rate the Senate was asking for is far below levels set across much of the country, Davis said.
Duke Energy is already meeting what the Senate version would require, but Dominion Energy would have to step up its effort.
SC nuclear reboot sees interest from big tech, large utilities

The House, however, left it up to energy regulators to decide on an appropriate savings level. What it approved Thursday also took away penalties.
Under a provision authored by Sen. Shane Martin of Spartanburg County, developers would need to contact all landowners in the path of a pipeline, power line or power plant two months before filing for any state-level permits. The companies also would have to inform landowners about their neighbors who were impacted and whether there were alternative routes considered.
It’s unclear if the measure would have applied to the pipeline feeding Canadys, which crosses state lines, so it’s federally regulated.
“The fact the House would remove this says to me they don’t want these affected landowners to know,” Mixson said. “My question is why. If these projects are really necessary — if they’re not going to be dangerous — then why not notify these communities and landowners.”
Davis said senators must now weigh the House changes against the importance of getting a bill across the finish line. Both he and Massey said taking up these provisions in standalone legislation next year will be hard to do.
“I have very little confidence that that will happen next year,” Massey said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_4985-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 16:07:28.925115

Ron DeSantis signed into law a bill (HB 1205) making it more challenging to place citizen-led constitutional amendments on the ballot, an organization working on just such an effort announced Monday that it’s going to court to block the measure.
Florida Decides Healthcare has been working for more than a year to get its proposed constitutional amendment on expanding Medicaid on the statewide ballot in November 2026. The organizers complain the state has changed the rules in the middle of the process — which is why the organization has so quickly filed its lawsuit.
The plan is to seek a temporary restraining order to stop the law from being enforced.
“This bill is not about improving the ballot initiative process. It attacks the fundamental freedom of Floridians to participate in their own democracy,’ said Mitch Emerson, executive director of Florida Decides Healthcare, in a remote press call on Monday morning. “It’s a calculated and cowardly attempt by politicians in Tallahassee to rewrite the rules, not to serve the people, but to protect their own power. This is not reform, this is repression.”
Republicans led by the governor claim that such legislation is required because of concerns about alleged fraud in the petition-gathering process. For proof, they cited throughout the legislative session a report published by the state’s Office of Election Crimes and Security in January asserting that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting to pass the abortion-rights amendment last year committed crimes related to gathering petitions
“We have seen widespread and rampant fraud in this state and in this process,” said Lee County Republican Jenna Persons-Mulicka, who sponsored the bill in the House. “We have evidence that we cannot take a blind eye to. We must take further action to put integrity back into the initiative process.”
The bill prohibits felons, noncitizens, and non-Florida residents from acting as petition circulators; requires additional personal identifying information for voters signing petition forms and for petition circulators; requires the sponsor to deliver petitions to supervisors of elections in the counties in which the voter resides within 10 days after the voter signs the form; and says that anyone who doesn’t register with the state as a signature-gatherer and possesses more than 25 signed petitions beyond their own and immediate family members faces a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison.
‘Traps’
“These are not tweaks, they are traps,” Emerson said Monday. “These new rules are designed to make it nearly impossible for everyday people to have a voice in the laws that change their lives.”
The lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of Florida on Sunday night. In it, Emerson claims that the new law will force Florida Decides Healthcare “to impose an extended moratorium on its petition circulation activities, severely impacting or eliminating the ability to circulate petitions and gather sufficient support for the placement of its 2026 initiative on the 2026 general election ballot.”
Floridians in recent years have raised the minimum wage, legalized medical marijuana, and restored the rights of felons to vote by going through the constitutional amendment process.
“Floridians have fought for these things that they have advocated for at the Capitol year after year after year, and then to see the immediate response in the Legislature a year after those amendments have passed making it harder and more difficult to access this constitutional right,” said Matletha Bennette, a senior staff attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center. “The implementation of this law affects all Floridians, whether they have signed the petition or not, because it affects the ability to make the changes that they want when they really want to see it.”
In 2024, there were two high-profile proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot in Florida — one to legalize the adult recreational use of cannabis, the other to enshrine abortion rights into the Florida Constitution. Both received more than 55% support, a clear majority but short of the 60% threshold required for passage.
Gov. Ron DeSantis campaigned intensely against both measures and ended up spending taxpayer dollars in that effort. That action could not repeated, however, under a provision of the new law that prohibits anyone in state government from authorizing expenditure of public funds for a political advertisement or any other communication for a citizen-led constitutional amendment campaign.
‘Dark money’
Amendments 3 and 4 were also opposed by the Republican Party of Florida. In a statement on Monday, RPOF Chair Evan Power blasted the announcement that a lawsuit against the new law had been filed.
“It’s no surprise that well-funded, left-wing dark money groups —many backed by anonymous donors and based outside of Florida — are resorting to lawsuits in a desperate attempt to overturn HB 1205,” Power said “These shady organizations masquerade as grassroots activists but are part of a coordinated national effort to mislead voters, bypass the legislative process, and manipulate our state constitution for political gain.
Twenty separate organizations are promoting proposed constitutional amendments for next year, according to the Division of Elections.  They must submit 880,062 valid signatures by Feb. 1, 2026, to qualify.
Florida Decides Healthcare claims to have collected more than 100,000 signatures so far.
Smart & Safe Florida, the group that attempted to get the constitutional amendment legalizing recreational use of cannabis in 2024 and is actively working to get another measure on the ballot in 2026, declined to respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)The Maryland Department of Information Technology (DoIT) named a former U.S. Office of Personnel Management information officer Monday as its next chief information security officer.
The department said James Saunders started in an acting capacity on Monday.
In a statement announcing the appointment, the department said Saunders will lead DoIT’s Office of Security Management, which is responsible for securing the state’s IT systems, infrastructure and private data. Administration officials called Saunders “a highly sought-after candidate,” who brings more than “15 years of cybersecurity leadership experience across the federal government and private sector.”
“I’m a big believer in partnership,” Saunders said in the anouncement. “Whether they are part of my security team or not, I will work hand in hand with those across the State of Maryland to ensure we keep our people and our assets safe, together.”

The department said Saunders served as CISO and deputy chief information officer at OPM, where he helped implement “zero-trust programs and drove a cultural transformation within the agency’s security team to enhance inter-agency collaboration.” He also served as CISO for the U.S. Small Business Administration when it was called on to develop secure systems to distribute nearly $700 billion in funds to businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“As public and private organizations face new threats like agentic AI, strong cybersecurity is more important than ever,” said DoIT Secretary Katie Savage. “James Saunders is an experienced cybersecurity expert who has helped secure some of our nation’s most important systems. We are thrilled he is bringing his expertise and leadership to the State of Maryland.”
Saunders is the latest federal official to shift into high-ranking state job, as the new administration in Washington brings uncertainty about the future of the federal workforce. He follows the appointments of Commerce Secretary Harry Coker Jr., who previously worked as White House cyber security director; Health Secretary Meena Seshamani, the former administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; and former Environmental Protection Agency Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Adam Ortiz, who is now deputy secretary for external relations at the Department of the Environment.
Saunders will serve in an acting capacity until he is formally appointed by the governor and his appointment is approved by the Senate.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-05 19:15:55+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: A refugee family builds new life in CT amid federal immigration turmoil,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/05/refugee-family-ct-immigration/,CT Mirror's Laura Tillman discusses her story about an Afghan refugee family settling in Connecticut amid federal funding cuts and canceled flights.,"It’s a challenging time to be navigating the United States immigration system for resettlement agencies and refugees alike.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Laura Tillman to discuss her article, “A family of Afghan refugees arrived in CT. Here’s what happened,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Laura’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Laura. You tell us the story of the Sayed Rahim Rahim family to illustrate the chaos that legal Afghan refugees trying to settle in Connecticut are now going through. How did you find the family, and what’s unique about their story?
LT: I got a call. I wrote a story about refugee resettlement and the funding cuts that were coming through from the Trump administration in January, and the fallout of that in February. And I’d written about a woman who came from Nigeria years before, she’d been helped by IRIS to resettle. And so kind of the question, naturally, in a way, was, well, what would that whole picture look like now? Now that these funding cuts have come through, these organizations are laying off a lot of their employees and giving up office space. And so the head of IRIS let me know in February that this family had just come from Qatar. They are an Afghan family, but they had been living in a refugee camp in Qatar for a few months, and they had been anxiously awaiting the day of their flight to come to the U.S. They had their passports issued. They had special immigrant visas. And so, really, they were just waiting for the flight. And then one of the things that happened in January was the Trump administration canceled flights for about 1,600 Afghans in that situation, and so, just merely the way of getting from point A to point B was the only obstacle.
WSHU: They were actually living in a hotel room for almost a year, right?
LT: Before going to Qatar to the refugee camp, they had been living in a hotel in Kabul for about a year. In general, their lives had just become extremely restricted since the U.S. left Afghanistan in 2021. Sayed Rahim Rahim, along with his brothers and brother-in-law, had all worked with the U.S. armed forces, in his case, as an automotive mechanic. His brothers had worked as translators. And this implies, you know, putting yourself in a huge amount of danger for retribution from the Taliban. And when the U.S. left Afghanistan in 2021 and the Taliban took over the country, like almost instantaneously, their lives became very restricted. Sayed decided to take his son, who was then seven, out of school. And so yeah, they had been living, waiting, waiting, waiting to be able to come to the U.S. for a very long time in very difficult circumstances. So then their flight was canceled, and fortunately, his brother-in-law was able to use his savings to purchase plane tickets for this family. We’re talking about seven plane tickets from Qatar to the U.S.
WSHU: Under normal circumstances, aren’t those plane tickets paid for once you’ve been cleared?
LT: Normally, yes.
WSHU: So now the burden fell on them to find the funds to pay for their own passage to the U.S.
LT: Yes. And very quickly, because their passports were going to expire. They had been issued these short-term passports that were going to expire. So they had this pretty tight time frame to find the money, buy new tickets and get here.
WSHU: So, when they get here, what happened?
LT: So normally, when a family in this situation would have gotten here a few months ago, IRIS would have been ready for them. And in the case of this family, you know, IRIS had been planning to resettle them before funding was cut and all these staff members were let go. But then, you know, they found out that their flight had been canceled. Everything was kind of up in the air. But under normal circumstances, they would have had an apartment ready for them. Really just a sense of things being a baseline for starting a new life, an apartment, clothes, a fridge full of food. An IRIS resettlement worker to help enroll the kids in school quickly, to be at the family medical appointments, figure out what the parents needed to do if the father was trying to get a job, different leads on that; all of these different things down to, you know, the organization kind of prided themselves on even having a home cooked meal of Afghan dishes ready for them the night that they would arrive in their new home. And really, the sense for a lot of people that this is like, like a very happy moment to come, you know, it’s a difficult moment to leave your home, but at the same time, a lot of people who are coming, they’re escaping traumatic situations. They’re really waiting for this day to come and start this new life.
WSHU: How was their experience different?
LT: Yeah, so their experience was quite a bit different. Instead of the International Organization for Migration figuring things out with them at the airport and helping get them to Connecticut, Sayed Rahim Rahim’s brother-in-law met them at the airport. He brought them to his own home, which was already a pretty full house with his wife and three kids. They welcomed this family of two parents and five young children, and the mother is also pregnant. She is due later this month. So they didn’t know where they were going to live. They didn’t know if they were going to get any help from the resettlement agency or not. They kind of had to figure out a lot of stuff, thankfully, with the help of their family members. They do have quite a number of family members who are here, who did you know lend a hand, and Iris has done many things for this family that they’re able to do, but it’s just not the level of constant contact and just readiness that they would have had before.
WSHU: It’s been a couple of months now since they arrived. How has it been for them? Have they been able to get a place? How do they pay for their upkeep?
LT: They did get their own place to live last month, and that was a real relief. IRIS helped them get that with the deposit and the first few months of rent. IRIS is also helping them get a car, a used car that’s been donated. They’ve borrowed some money from the Afghan community in New Haven, there are some Afghan folks who have organized together to help out other Afghan families in situations where they might need to borrow money, for funeral arrangements or for something like this. In this case, they borrowed some money to be able to furnish one room in their apartment.
WSHU: The children have been able to register in school as well.
LT: Just last week, the oldest two kids started school. The youngest kids aren’t school age yet. One of them, I think, might be able to start pre-K next year, but the other two are in school, and that was a really happy moment that I got to see last week, which was the son being able to go to school for the first time, essentially, in four years.
WSHU: What about benefits?
LT: They have signed up for HUSKY, and, you know, things like HUSKY and SNAP, as well as food stamps, are a couple of the items that are at risk right now with some of the federal cuts. So I think that’s kind of a question mark moving forward for them. IRIS isn’t able to provide as much help as they would need to supplement the help that the federal government can provide. However, how much help the federal government will provide to families in this situation as time goes on is still unclear. Fortunately, I think one stroke of good luck for this family is that the father is a mechanic, and you know, unlike his brothers, who were translators, there isn’t as much work available in that field. I think that he has some good job opportunities as a mechanic. It’s a skill you don’t need to speak fluent English to be able to do. Some of the volunteers who work with IRIS have been trying to find him a job as a mechanic. So hopefully, you know, he will be able to start working soon.
WSHU: So bottom line, it seems that it’s more the refugee community providing much of the help. And as far as IRIS is concerned, how have they been able to deal with the cuts to federal funding? Have private ones made up the difference? Is it even possible for that to happen?
LT: I think private donations have made a meaningful impact, but it’s not really possible to make up for the loss of funding. For example, IRIS made the painful decision to give up its primary offices in New Haven. I think it is now sharing some space and resources with other nonprofits in New Haven. I think one of the things that has been impressive is that in the first story that I wrote about these federal cuts, I got to meet some of the people from religious groups and other groups who have become volunteers for IRIS over the years and are fairly organized. You know, there’s this group that’s been helping, Rahim Rahim and his family, who are primarily volunteers from a group of churches and a synagogue in Madison and Guilford, and they’re the ones who found this car for him. You know, one of their volunteers drove the kids to their first day of school and helped to provide, you know, some help when they were registering the kids for school, and just to make sure everything went smoothly. My understanding is that there’s a lot of manpower, of volunteers, and that’s, you know, as significant as the financial contributions, it isn’t the same, though, as the IRIS resettlement workers who speak fluent Pasto, who really have this skill set, and when they work with volunteers, it’s terrific, but they also have to train those people they often don’t speak the language of the people that they’re helping. So it is more challenging, but I think that helps a lot of these families to, you know, make it through.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0307_SR_RahmanFamily_007-edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 16:07:28.925115

(Photo courtesy of Jefferson County)With the help of over $600,000 in state money, the sole access road to Olympic National Park’s popular Hoh Rain Forest will reopen this week after a monthslong closure.
Access on the Upper Hoh Road will be restored midday Thursday, announced Gov. Bob Ferguson. The road was washed out by the bomb cyclone that hit the region last year and has been closed since December.
The rainforest’s reopening comes just as the tourism season heats up. 
Usually, the Federal Highway Administration’s Emergency Relief Program would fund repairs to the road. But then-Gov. Jay Inslee didn’t include Jefferson County, where the road is located, in his emergency declaration to unlock aid for the November bomb cyclone. This made accessing federal money difficult.
State and local officials said they didn’t have the money for repairs.
So in March, Ferguson unveiled a plan to spend $623,000 in state reserves to help fix the road, which serves as the gateway to the rainforest that saw nearly 460,000 visitors last year.
“It’s the kind of thing where, if you’re just a Washingtonian, you read an article and think ‘for god’s sake, can’t someone just figure out this bureaucracy and get the road fixed,’” Ferguson said at the time. “Because it’s a lot of money, but it’s not that much money.”
The reserve money, set aside for the governor to help businesses in need, comes from unclaimed lottery winnings. Ferguson also added Jefferson County to Inslee’s emergency declaration, so if federal funding eventually comes through, that money can reimburse the state.
Private donors contributed another $27,000 to augment the state dollars. 
Heavy rains elevated the Hoh River, eroding part of the county-maintained road, causing the park to announce the closure Dec. 23. The road is located southeast of Forks, in a remote part of the Olympic Peninsula.
At the time of the closure, the county warned the road was “in imminent danger of failure.” No full-time residents live beyond the washout site.
Jefferson County will celebrate the reopening at noon Thursday, when Ferguson will join local officials for a ribbon-cutting ceremony. 
“This project represents a true partnership in action,” Jefferson County Public Works Director Monte Reinders said in a press release. “We’re grateful for the support of Governor Ferguson, the private donors, and our hardworking local contractors and crews.”

,Kansas Reflector,2025-05-05 19:08:59+00:00,Kansas Reflector,Kansas podcaster seeks GOP gubernatorial nomination to copy Trump crusade at state level,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/05/05/kansas-podcaster-seeks-gop-gubernatorial-nomination-to-copy-trump-crusade-at-state-level/,Republican Bob Billings is first to formally enter the 2026 campaign for governor in Kansas as Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly nears the end of a second term.,"Doug Billings, a conservative podcaster and MAGA champion, stands as the only formal candidate for the Kansas Republican Party's nomination to find a replacement for term-limited Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in 2026. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Billings' podcast)TOPEKA —  Conservative podcaster and MAGA enthusiast Doug Billings is the lone person to formally file as a candidate for the Kansas Republican Party’s nomination for governor in 2026.
Billings, not a household name in Kansas politics, said in an interview Monday that he was a reluctant candidate in a GOP field that could grow substantially as Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Senate President Ty Masterson, state Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, former Gov. Jeff Colyer, former Johnson County Commissioner Charlotte O’Hara and others made decisions to join the ballot or stay on the sideline. No Democrat has officially entered the race.
“The truth is, honest to God, I don’t want to run,” Billings said. “We need a strong conservative governor in that office. We need a politician who’s going to tell the truth.”
Billings, who worked in human resources before starting “The Right Side” podcast five years ago in Olathe, said he would implement at the state level the federal DOGE framework embraced by President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk. He said the state’s economy would flourish by cutting unnecessary spending and by diminishing income and businesses taxes, including the potentially unconstitutional property tax.
“Through the Kansas Department of Government Efficiency, I will root out fraud, waste and bureaucracy across state agencies,” he said.
Targets of his budget ax would include administrative costs in public schools, fraud in poverty and unemployment benefit programs, transportation project cost overruns, ill-advised economic development incentives and operational inefficiency in prisons. He vowed to scan state agencies large and small for waste.
Billings said his Catholic values required that he provide leadership in the movement to curtail abortion rights in Kansas. He would expand the state’s support for anti-abortion pregnancy resource centers and faith-based adoption agencies as well as enact policies reflecting a “shared commitment to the dignity of every human life.” At minimum, he said, the state ought to enact and enforce a law forbidding abortion after detection of a fetal heartbeat.
The Kansas Supreme Court declared a woman’s decision to terminate a pregnancy a fundamental right anchored in the Bill of Rights of the Kansas Constitution. In 2022, voters in Kansas rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have nullified the state Supreme Court’s opinion on abortion. Abortion remains legal in Kansas despite the U.S. Supreme Court decision striking the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
 
God, guns, voting
Billings said he would strive as governor to restore Christian values that inspired the nation’s Founding Fathers and to breath new life into founding documents written by those men. He said school classes would start with a moment of private prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance, which would reinforce “our unity under God.”
“Kansas must return to its roots as a society grounded in faith, morality and reverence for God,” he said. “Not as a theocracy, but as a republic that honors its Christian heritage with pride and conviction.”
He said his administration would be a bulwark against attempts to erode the “God-given” right to bear arms. He would oppose burdensome regulations, excessive fees and bureaucratic red tape that infringed on the ability of law-abiding citizens to possess firearms.
Diversity, equity and inclusion programs or “woke” agendas in K-12 schools would be eliminated to avoid advocacy for “divisive ideologies,” Billings said. The state should invest tax dollars in ways that supported decisions of parents to send their children to public, private or home schools, he said.
In terms of election security, Billings said he would order the Kansas Bureau of Investigation to launch inquiries into past election “irregularities” and decisions that undercut election fraud investigations.
Secretary of State Schwab, who said he would run for the GOP nomination for governor, has repeatedly contended Kansas elections were fair and accurate. However, Billings said “anyone telling you that we don’t have election integrity issues in Kansas is either vastly uninformed or is lying to you.”
“I will work to eliminate electronic voting machines, which are vulnerable to manipulation and erode public confidence,” Billings said. “In their place, I will implement watermarked paper ballots.”
 
Schwab, O’Hara
In January, Schwab was the first Republican to confirm plans to seek the August 2026 nomination for governor. He was elected the state’s top election official in 2018 and won reelection in 2022. He served 14 years in the Kansas House representing an Olathe district. In March, Schwab said he had been diagnosed with cancer in the lung. He said the cancer was detected at an early stage and surgery would be relied on to combat the health threat.
Schwab said his campaign would concentrate on necessity of the state to bring property assessments and taxation under control. He expressed alarm the 2025 Legislature did little to moderate state property tax collections, despite bipartisan promises after the 2024 session to tackle the issue.
“When it came time to lead, both the governor and leadership came up short,” he said.
O’Hara, a former Johnson County Commission member and one-term Kansas House member, said in February that she would campaign for governor because it was time to have a “true, proven conservative” leading the Republican supermajority in the Legislature. She vowed to deal with wasteful state spending and “ludicrous corporate welfare” in the form of business subsidies, ban DEI in government institutions and “get schools back on track.”
“I cannot stand silent and watch small businesses and homeowners be destroyed through high property taxes or watch our children drown in the sewer of wokeism in our schools,” she said.
O’Hara lost a 2024 reelection campaign for county commission to a Democrat after objecting to COVID-19 restrictions and opposing vaccination mandates.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Doug-Billings-governor-1024x530.png,,,2025-05-05 16:07:28.925115

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem touted the option as cost-effective.“If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest,” Noem said in a statement. “This is the safest option for our law enforcement, aliens and is a 70% savings for US taxpayers.”It’s unclear from which part of the DHS budget the funding for the travel assistance is coming, as it would roughly cost $1 billion to reimburse up to $1,000 to meet the goal of removing 1 million people.DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.President Donald Trump gave his support for the move Monday afternoon, according to White House pool reports. ""We're going to get them a beautiful flight back to where they came from,” the president said.Self-deportation would be facilitated by the CBP Home app, which was used by the Biden administration to allow asylum seekers to make appointments with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.The payment would apparently not be made in advance. DHS said that once those who use the app to self deport arrive in their home country, they will receive a travel stipend of $1,000.According to DHS, the Trump administration has deported 152,000 people since taking office in January. The Biden administration last year deported 195,000 people from February to April, according to DHS data.DHS said already one migrant has used the program to book a flight from Chicago to Honduras.“Additional tickets have already been booked for this week and the following week,” the agency said in a statement.The Trump administration has rolled out several programs to facilitate mass self-deportations, such as a registry to require immigrants in the country without legal authorization to register with the federal government.Immigrants who don’t register with the federal government could face steep fines and a potential prison sentence.",,,,2025-05-05 15:08:37.034218

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Legislation to rename the Sakonnet River Bridge after a U.S. Army soldier from Tiverton killed in action in Iraq in 2004 has cleared the Rhode Island General Assembly.
The “Staff Sergeant Christopher Potts Sakonnet River Bridge” would be the new name of the span connecting Tiverton and Portsmouth via Route 24 under the bill that passed the House on April 10 and the Senate version that passed in concurrence on May 1. Both chambers approved the legislation unanimously.
 The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. Dan McKee, who can sign it, veto it, or allow it to become effective without his signature.  
“To rename this major Rhode Island bridge in his honor is a worthy tribute to a true Rhode Island hero who gave his life so that we all may live in a world free of tyranny and persecution,” Rep. Samuel Azzinaro, a Westerly Democrat and chair of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, said in a statement Thursday. 
 “And now, hopefully whenever someone drives over this bridge, they will be compelled to look up who Staff Sergeant Potts was and discover how his legacy will live on in the state that he loved so much,” Azzinaro, a retired National Guardsman and former member of the Army Reserve, added. 
Potts served in the Rhode Island National Guard for over 14 years. He deployed to Iraq in March 2004 and was killed in Taji, Iraq, on Oct. 3, 2004, his 38th birthday. Potts’ fellow servicemembers who testified on the bill during a February committee hearing said that Potts had found a stockpile of weapons with ammo, guns, rockets, mortars, artillery rounds and more, shortly before he and a medic were executed by insurgent groups. 
Bill would rename Sakonnet River Bridge in honor of Tiverton soldier killed in Iraq War

“We think that by him finding this cache — it was the largest cache in Iraq at the time — it put a damper on the insurgents’ operations against us and saved a lot of lives,” Command Sgt. Maj. Raymond Viens, who served alongside Potts, said during the Feb. 6 Special Legislation committee hearing where Azzinaro’s bill was first heard.  
Potts posthumously received the Bronze Star Medal with Combat “V” and the Purple Heart.
Sen. Walter Felag, a Warren Democrat, sponsored the legislation in his chamber. Like Azzinaro, Felag chairs the veterans’ affairs committee in his chamber.
“Renaming the Sakonnet Bridge in his honor will serve as a fitting reminder of what our service members sacrifice in order to protect the ideals and freedoms that we deeply cherish,” Felag said in a statement Thursday. 
The bill underwent one minor revision since being introduced by Azzinaro on the House floor in January. The original version of the bill suggested naming the structure the “Staff Sergeant Christopher Potts Sakonnet Bridge” and the successful legislation simply retains the “River” in the current name.
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday, but the Democratic governor has historically used his veto powers selectively, and usually after the legislative session ends in June. Several bills have become laws in the 2025 legislative session without McKee’s signature.

(Neil Mishler/USFWS)A high number dead waterfowl reported on the Bighorn River south of Hardin in February was due to starvation, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
According to a May 5 press release, FWP staff collected mallard, geese and shorebird carcasses along a stretch of the Bighorn River from Afterbay to about three miles downstream of the Bighorn Fishing Access Site following numerous reports of sick and dead waterfowl in the area.
Staff initially suspected the mortality event was related to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, but extensive testing at the department’s Wildlife Heath Lab in Bozeman showed no positive results for the disease.
Additional testing was done by the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Wildlife Health Center in Wisconsin, where specialists confirmed there was no evidence of infectious diseases. Instead, emaciation and starvation were the only ailments consistently found among the tested birds.
According to the press release, FWP said that mid-winter waterfowl surveys done along the Bighorn River showed a higher than average concentration of birds, “which likely led to more competition for the limited food in the area.”
In addition, extreme cold temperatures and high snowfall in the region during early January likely contributed to limited availability of food.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/8601170566_8596478752_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 15:08:37.034218

He said any fuel that did reach the creek has been contained by the booms in Waukee, and he didn’t observe any diesel in the Urbandale booms.
An unknown amount of the spill reached an inlet tile which outlets to Little Walnut Creek, where residents reported the smell of fuel. 
Theobald said Monday he has observed occasional whiffs of the fuel smell, which he suspects, are coming from the pond near the fuel tank where the majority of the estimated 4,000 gallons spilled was contained.
He said the tile line was cleaned by Waukee officials and no dead fish have been observed in the creek.

Some measles response plans crash to a halt after Trump cuts

Metro Nashville, the combined county and city government in Tennessee, and three other local governments sued on April 24 over reductions in federal public health funding, saying the abrupt $11 billion in cuts nationwide forced Nashville to cancel vaccination clinics needed to combat this year’s measles outbreak. Colorado and a group of other states sued earlier in April, mentioning the impact of cuts on their ability to control measles, flu and other vaccine-preventable illnesses.
Others joining the April 24 lawsuit: Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri; and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. They called the cuts “a massive blow… at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.”
The funding cuts also forced Minneapolis to shut down clinics in March that had been scheduled to run through June, said Luisa Pessoa-Brandão, director of health initiatives for the city’s health department.
Last year the city’s clinics served 501 patients with 1,475 vaccination shots, including against measles, she said. About 30% of children in the city are not fully vaccinated, much too high to ensure unvaccinated children won’t fall victim to measles outbreaks like the current one, she added.
“There’s fear and hesitancy about the vaccine, based on some of the misinformation out there,” Pessoa-Brandão said. “There are other factors — access [to medical care] and the COVID pandemic, which delayed people getting vaccinations. We’re playing catch-up the last few years.”

(Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Although Maine often prides itself on living out its motto to be a leader, especially with environmental policy, state leaders are encouraging lawmakers to pause efforts to hold fossil fuel companies accountable. 
Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Melanie Loyzim acknowledged that Maine will need billions of dollars to address the impacts of climate change, but she said now is not the time to move forward with a proposal for fossil fuel companies to cover those costs, citing the legal battles miring states that have already taken such action. 
Balancing that need and timing, Loyzim told the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee on Monday that the department is neither for nor against two bills seeking to establish a superfund for large fossil fuel companies to pay for infrastructure repairs, resiliency efforts and other costs in the rural and low-income communities disproportionately affected by flooding and other disasters.
“The fossil fuel industry created a mess in Maine and it’s high time they are responsible for cleaning it up,” said Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland), who sponsored one of the bills.
LD 1870 would establish the Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program, which would be funded by payments from fossil fuel businesses responsible for more than one billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions between 1995 and 2024. The legislation stipulates that at least 35% of the funds would need to be used for climate change adaptation projects that benefit low-income households. 
Trump attack on state climate laws likely doomed, but attempts to yank funds may be next

Brenner said her bill, with one Republican cosponsor, is a natural extension of the bipartisan efforts behind LD 1 that was signed into law last month. That symbolic first bill of the session created funding opportunities to make Maine homes more resilient and established a new State Resilience Office to address flooding and other impacts of extreme weather.
That legislation was in response to the series of severe storms that caused an estimated $90 million in damage to public infrastructure across Maine last winter and builds upon $60 million for storm relief that was included in the state’s supplemental budget last year.
“Instead of needing to pass a bill like LD 1 every single legislative session, we can establish a climate superfund to better prepare for and respond to storms,” said Jackson Chadwick, advocacy director for Maine Youth for Climate Justice, testifying in support.
During the public hearing, Rep. Grayson Lookner (D-Portland) introduced LD 1808 that similarly seeks to establish a superfund to hold fossil fuel companies accountable, especially since research has shown that companies including Exxon knew of the harm decades ago and actively sought to suppress those findings. 
Though there is a lot of overlap between the two bills, Lookner said his bill provides a more robust definition around an “environmental justice focus populations” that could better direct superfund dollars to communities hit hardest. 
During the hearing, many of the proponents said they prefer LD 1870, but Lookner and others encouraged the committee to take the best components of each bill when streamlining the proposals.
Maine Lobsters Union Local 207 submitted testimony in support of Lookner’s bill, saying that Maine needs a plan for the future so heritage industries that rely on the waterfront, like lobster fishing, aren’t left with debilitating damage from extreme weather and little means to make the repairs. 
The Maine State Chamber of Commerce opposed the measures, arguing that they pose risks to Maine business by retroactively assigning financial liability to companies that were lawfully engaging in business. It fears such legislation would signal that Maine is an unpredictable place to do business.
Sen. Denise Tepler (D-Sagadahoc), who co-chairs the committee, asked Brenner if the superfund would pay for damages in the five areas of her district that are being impacted by sea level rise. Brenner reminded her that costs to repair roads and other public infrastructure in those areas are currently being paid for by taxpayers. 
Some committee members questioned whether the model would increase prices at the gas pump or on energy bills, but Brenner said she believes existing financial regulatory processes would prevent costs from being pushed on to consumers. 
Legal battles against superfunds in other states
Maine isn’t the first state to explore the idea of a climate superfund, as Vermont and New York have already passed similar legislation. However, those states, as well as Hawaii and Michigan, have subsequently been sued for those policies, including by the U.S. Department of Justice. The Justice Department said the lawsuit is also meant to advance an executive order from President Donald Trump that targets state and local policies involving climate change, environmental justice and carbon emissions reductions.
Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School, told the committee it is unprecedented for the DOJ to bring that type of lawsuit and she is skeptical of the viability of the claims. 
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi argues these policies threaten the country’s energy independence, while the lawsuit claims they are unconstitutional and preempted by the federal Clean Air Act. However, Rothschild said the Clean Air Act addresses future pollution, whereas the superfund looks at pollution retroactively.
Climate superfunds, like the one proposed in Maine, build upon a long-standing principle in environmental law known as “polluter pays.” That is the same principle that requires identifiable polluters to foot the bill to clean up hazardous waste sites.
Cathy Breen, who testified on behalf of the Environmental Priorities Coalition, said the state has adopted other uses of that principle through policies such as the beverage container redemption program, as well as the recently extended producer responsibility program for packaging. LD 1870 is a priority for the coalition of 40 conservation, climate and public health organizations this legislative session. 
Loyzim said it would be helpful for Maine to wait and see how that litigation plays out in other states before creating a superfund of its own. She recommended the state wait until next year to dig into this topic and what it could look like in Maine. This would also allow the state to determine how best to implement the policy, including details like whether it would share data with other states, to better estimate the cost of such a policy.
Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) asked Loyzim how to ensure that the department continues to lay the groundwork for that conversation if the committee chooses to defer it until next year. Loyzim said they will already be tracking those legal challenges but also suggested the committee could convert one of the bills into a directive for the department to work on a report to inform future discussion.

The Punch Sulzberger Prize for Journalism Innovation is given for work that “exemplifies new ways of executing the craft of journalism that will engage audiences and expand the work’s impact and reach.”


CalMatters’ Digital Democracy has been awarded the Punch Sulzberger Prize for Journalism Innovation in the national Poynter Journalism Prizes.
The honor, for “California’s Fentanyl Fight,” is a powerful pairing of the rich Digital Democracy government-transparency database and produced in partnership with Julie Watts of CBS News. Julie’s story focused on advocates for fentanyl legislation who were upset to learn through Digital Democracy that their bills died when legislators declined to vote.
Her broadcast followed a CalMatters’ story, “Power is never having to say ‘no.’ How California Democrats kill bills without voting against them” co-authored by Watts and CalMatters reporter Ryan Sabalow. The story used data from Digital Democracy to look at more than 1 million votes cast by current legislators, and revealed that Democrats voted “no” less than 1% of the time. Instead of directly voting against a bill, Democrats often killed bills by declining to vote.
The first-place award recognized Watts, Sabalow and Foaad Khosmood, an architect of Digital Democracy at CalPoly San Luis Obispo.
Judges cited the team’s work with the “groundbreaking Digital Democracy database” built by CalMatters, which uses artificial intelligence and emerging technologies to further empower watchdog journalism and fill the reporting void left in statehouses across the country. The database collects information on millions of votes and hundreds of hours of hearings, allowing reporters to reveal hidden practices of California’s Democratic supermajority legislature.
“You read these pieces and you feel smarter and better-equipped to execute your rights in a democracy,” one judge said.
Digital Democracy includes every word uttered in public hearings, every dollar given to a politician, every bill introduced, every vote taken and more. The database enables unprecedented insights, such as a review of more than 1 million votes cast by current legislators over the past five years.
The partner investigation with CBS-TV showed the real impacts of people using Digital Democracy to see how government decisions are being made. “I personally am insulted,” said the mother of a young person who died from a fentanyl overdose. “That is what they signed up for, to represent us.”Digital Democracy and Julie Watts also contributed to a half-hour TV special on the fentanyl controversy in December. CalMatters has previously paired with CBS’ Watts, including two videos that won Northern California Emmy awards. CalMatters Reporter Nigel Duara and Watts Emmy was for a segment on how California investigates shootings by law enforcement officers of unarmed civilians, and a collaboration with Watts that featured Julie Cart’s coverage of the devastating effects of endless wildfires on the mental health of California’s firefighters.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/043025-CM-Award-Fentanyl-Fight-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 15:08:37.034218

The seven individuals; Oliver Kozler, Samantha Lewis, Henry MacKeen-Shapiro, Michael Mueller, Asad Siddiqui, Avi Tachna-Fram and Rhiannon Willow, were charged last September with trespassing and resisting and/or obstructing a police officer after an encampment by pro-Palestinian protestors on the university’s Diag on the Ann Arbor campus was broken up by police in May 2024.

All seven previously pleaded not guilty and were in Ann Arbor District Court Monday morning awaiting a decision on a motion for Nessel to recuse herself from the case when they learned of the dismissals.
In announcing the decision to drop the charges, Nessel called the recusal motion a “diversionary tactic,” and that because the case had become “a lightning rod of contention,” it was no longer in the public’s best interest to proceed. 
“These distractions and ongoing delays have created a circus-like atmosphere to these proceedings,” Nessel said. “While I stand by my charging decisions, and believe, based on the evidence, a reasonable jury would find the defendants guilty of the crimes alleged, I no longer believe these cases to be a prudent use of my department’s resources, and, as such, I have decided to dismiss the cases.”
Another factor in Nessel’s decision was a letter the Detroit Free Press reported was sent to the court last week by the Jewish Federation of Greater Ann Arbor, defending Nessel against accusations that she was biased against the Muslim and Arab American communities.
“We have learned that a public statement in support of my office from a local non-profit has been directly communicated to the court,” Nessel said in her statement. “The impropriety of this action has led us to the difficult decision to drop these charges.”
In response to the news, the TAHRIR Coalition, made up of dozens of pro-Palestinian student groups at the University of Michigan, said on social media that the decision “is what happens when we resist and refuse to cower.”

The protests were part of a wave of demonstrations at college campuses across the nation that began in the aftermath of Israeli military strikes in Gaza following the October 7, 2023, surprise attack by Hamas on Israel.
Meanwhile, Nessel’s office continues to carry out an investigation of pro-Palestinian protesters accused of causing approximately $100,000 of damage at up to a dozen locations, including at the homes of University of Michigan President Santa Ono and University of Michigan Regent Jordan Acker. 
A warrant sweep in conjunction with that investigation was carried out last month at locations in Ann Arbor, Canton and Ypsilanti. Charges have yet to be filed in those incidents.
On Sunday, Ono announced he would leave the university later this summer to become the president at the University of Florida.

The Howe neighborhood of Minneapolis Friday, Oct. 11, 2024. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As we near the end of the legislative session, Minnesota legislators and Gov. Tim Walz are deliberating on a two-year budget to address the long-term deficit facing the state — and current proposals are not good news for property taxpayers.
As county commissioners, we understand the difficult decisions facing Walz and lawmakers. Counties put together balanced budgets every year. We have to weigh what is needed to best serve our residents; fulfill state and federal mandates; and limit the burden that property tax increases place on our constituents.  
Those are never easy decisions, but they will become even more challenging if the proposals being considered at the Capitol become law. 
Budget proposals from the House, Senate, and governor address the upcoming deficit in a variety of ways, but too often resort to shifting state costs to homeowners and businesses paying local property taxes. 
These shifts or “cost shares” mean that the state essentially sends a bill to counties to pay for spending related to specific state-mandated services. 
Counties would still be required to deliver the same services, except now local property taxpayers would be responsible for funding a higher percentage of state costs. County governments estimate the total statewide property tax increase because of these budget proposals would be over $200 million by 2029 and grow from there.  
In one rural county, already one of Minnesota’s most economically disadvantaged communities, these cost shifts would increase the property tax levy 9%, and that’s before factoring in any other local considerations. Metro and suburban counties are not exempt from property tax and levy impacts, with some counties seeing total cost shares greater than $20 million. These new shifts would nearly eclipse the total amount of general-purpose aid counties receive from the state.  
These proposals often get discussed at the Capitol without recognizing the very real costs that property tax increases will have on homeowners and businesses across the state.  
We’ve been down this road before: When the state faced deficits in the first decade of this century, the state started many of these cost shifts and reduced aid to counties and cities. As a result, property taxes increased by record high percentages that have not been matched since. 
We don’t want those mistakes to be repeated at the Capitol this year.    
Shifting program costs from the state to counties doesn’t reduce the size or scope of government, it just passes the buck to property taxpayers. 
State legislators are not required to consider the cost of their budget choices on local governments, and that should change. For too long, the state has made choices that just shift state costs to different taxpayers, rather than working toward solutions that balance the budget at the state level. 
Counties understand that the current economy requires difficult decisions at the Capitol, but higher property taxes shouldn’t be a solution to address the pending deficit. 
Homeowners are already facing escalating inflation, energy and general cost of living expenses.  Further relying on property taxpayers to fund government will only add to the pressure of homeownership, particularly among those families and individuals just barely making it.  
Minnesota needs a more balanced, sustainable method of funding government services, one that doesn’t unfairly burden property owners already stretched thin.

It’s the inhaler that keeps a child’s asthma under control, the glasses that help them see the board at school, the vaccines that prevent serious illness. For the families I serve, Medicaid is a lifeline, helping connect them to the basic necessities they need to be able to live, work, and learn.
That’s why I’m concerned that, right now, Republican leaders in Congress are working to push through massive cuts to Medicaid — up to $880 billion or more. North Carolina’s senior U.S. Senator, Republican Thom Tillis, has supported the plans that would slash this vital program, just one year after North Carolina finally expanded it. These cuts would be devastating, especially here in rural communities where fewer employers offer health coverage and hospitals depend heavily on Medicaid reimbursements to keep their doors open.
More than 1.4 million children in North Carolina rely on Medicaid to get the health care they need to grow up healthy and strong. That’s nearly half the kids in our state. Nearly 40% of all Medicaid recipients live outside major cities — in rural areas like mine — where access to care is already limited. When Medicaid is threatened, it’s these children and their families who will feel it first and worst.
If these cuts go through, children will lose access to routine checkups, life-saving prescriptions, and preventive care. They’ll struggle to learn, fall behind in school, or even end up in emergency rooms for conditions that could have been managed early — if they can get care at all.
And it’s not just kids. Medicaid helps low-income parents, seniors, and people with disabilities get the care they need to survive. In rural communities, where jobs often don’t come with benefits, Medicaid fills the gap. If people lose that coverage, they’re not switching to a private plan — they’re going without.
The impact wouldn’t stop at patients who qualify for Medicaid. Rural hospitals, many of which are already operating on razor-thin margins, rely on Medicaid to stay afloat. If this funding disappears, more hospitals will be forced to close. That means longer drives for emergency care, fewer options for prenatal visits or surgeries, and more risk for everyone in the community — not just those on Medicaid.
Senator Tillis must understand what’s at stake. These cuts aren’t about reducing waste or balancing the budget. They’re about shifting costs from billionaires to working families. They’re about handing tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy while kids lose their inhalers, seniors lose access to medications, and rural hospitals shut their doors.
We fought hard for over a decade to expand Medicaid in North Carolina. That fight wasn’t about politics — it was about saving lives. And we succeeded. Now, more than 600,000 North Carolinians finally have access to care. If Senator Tillis supports these cuts, he’ll be taking that away.
We can’t afford to let politicians like Senator Tillis take away our health care. Not when families are working hard to get by, raise their kids, and care for aging parents in a health system that already leaves too many behind.
From blocking Medicaid expansion as Speaker of the NC House in 2013, to trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act throughout his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Senator Tillis has a long history of opposing efforts to expand health care access — but he has another chance to show where he stands. I urge him to stand with his constituents, not with wealthy donors. Protect Medicaid. Protect our rural hospitals. And most importantly, protect our kids.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaid-scaled-2-1536x1024-1-1024x6831745922858-1.jpg,,,2025-05-05 14:08:49.729437

However, fears of a national recession are driving uncertainty about how much the so-called Blue Bus will receive from both local governments and Washington.
The North Central Regional Transit District Board of Directors on Friday approved a preliminary $53 million budget for the upcoming fiscal year, a nearly 7% decrease from the previous year’s budget. The board will meet again in June to formally vote on the budget, which staff will then submit to the state Department of Finance and Administration.
The district projects the number of riders on its 26 fixed routes to increase compared to last year, when more than 565,000 people took the bus, a marked decline from the 2018-2019 fiscal year pre-pandemic numbers of more than 814,000 rides.
In his budget message to the board, Executive Director Anthony Mortillaro wrote that the district suspended some routes or limited them to on-demand service in response to the pandemic’s outset, but most have returned, and the rest will in the coming year as they hire more staff.
The district’s service area encompasses 74 communities across 10,0000 square miles where nearly 290,000 people live. NCRTD employs approximately 100 people, and the budget pays for two additional bus drivers.
At its Friday meeting in Española, Mortillaro told the board that the district’s future projections remain uncertain because of federal actions. Nearly 50% of the district’s income comes from the federal government.
“There’s an increasing concern about the odds of a national recession due to the tariffs and high interest rates, and all that could impact tax revenues as well as future grant levels,” he said.
Most Blue Bus routes run in Santa Fe, Rio Arriba, Taos and Los Alamos counties, with some connecting to eight Northern Pueblos, the Jicarilla Apache Nation and the counties of San Juan, Mora and San Miguel.
While the area is experiencing a “leveling economic recovery based upon reported tax revenues,” Mortilarro wrote, a recession could lower those tax revenues and how much grant money the federal government will provide.
Los Alamos County, the City of Santa Fe and the Rio Metro Regional Transit District, which operates the Rail Runner, contribute more than $7 million to the Blue Bus’s budget, which it uses to fund regional transit in those areas, Mortillaro wrote.
The budget also includes $9.5 million for electrical charging infrastructure in Española and Taos, and three diesel hybrid electric buses. Tariffs can add between 5% and 10% to the price of an electric bus, Mortillaro said.

Few issues on the public policy agenda in 2025 are more urgently important than the health of the environment. Whether it’s global challenges like climate change and the rise in weather disasters or hyperlocal matters like land use planning and access to clean drinking water, elected leaders undoubtedly have their work cut out for them.
Fortunately, thanks to the hard work of experts at the North Carolina Conservation Network, we now have a wonderfully comprehensive and data rich report that details exactly where things stand. The report – entitled simply enough, “North Carolina State of the Environment” – is based on the analysis of data from 114 different source indicators over a period of five years. And recently NC Newsline caught up with the Conservation Network’s Policy Director Grady McCallie and Campaigns Data Manager Luna Homsi, for a special two-part conversation to learn more.
In Part One of our recent extended conversation, we commenced discussing their organization’s new and remarkably comprehensive report on the state of the environment in North Carolina.
In Part Two of our chat, we took a closer look at some of the many specific environmental challenges confronting our state – including some encouraging news on air pollution, the importance of rapidly transitioning to a sustainable energy grid, the huge challenges posed by the spread of so-called forever chemicals, and the report’s inclusion of dozens of specific policy recommendations.

Minneapolis is among the cities forced to cancel vaccinations after cutoffs in federal funding. (Courtesy of City of Minneapolis)The number of measles cases is approaching 1,000 across 29 states, according to newly released federal statistics. Even as the outbreaks grow, more local governments are complaining that their efforts to combat measles with vaccination clinics have been shut down by abrupt federal funding cuts.
As of May 1, a total of 935 confirmed cases had been reported, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They were in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
There have been three confirmed deaths, two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all unvaccinated.

Metro Nashville, the combined county and city government in Tennessee, and three other local governments sued on April 24 over reductions in federal public health funding, saying the abrupt $11 billion in cuts nationwide forced Nashville to cancel vaccination clinics needed to combat this year’s measles outbreak. Colorado and a group of other states sued earlier in April, mentioning the impact of cuts on their ability to control measles, flu and other vaccine-preventable illnesses.

Others joining the April 24 lawsuit: Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri; and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. They called the cuts “a massive blow… at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.”
The funding cuts also forced Minneapolis to shut down clinics in March that had been scheduled to run through June, said Luisa Pessoa-Brandão, director of health initiatives for the city’s health department.
Last year the city’s clinics served 501 patients with 1,475 vaccination shots, including against measles, she said. About 30% of children in the city are not fully vaccinated, much too high to ensure unvaccinated children won’t fall victim to measles outbreaks like the current one, she added.
“There’s fear and hesitancy about the vaccine, based on some of the misinformation out there,” Pessoa-Brandão said. “There are other factors — access [to medical care] and the COVID pandemic, which delayed people getting vaccinations. We’re playing catch-up the last few years.”

Aron Maberry, a Clarksville Republican, sponsored a pair of bills aiming to ""dismantle DEI."" (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Language is fluid; it shifts, contorts, and adjusts as culture progresses. Largely due to social media, the fluidity of language has increased exponentially over the last decade. 
One word that exploded into the public lexicon around 2016 was the term “gaslighting.” The meaning of the word is quite broad and can apply to interpersonal relationships, work dynamics, and, most notably, politics. Ironically, gaslighting is most effective when it uses the fluidity of language to manipulate a message.
When boiled down to its most primal definition, gaslighting is the exploitation of thoughts and emotions by twisting language and truth to fit a desired mindset. To use gaslighting to its fullest potential, one must be well-versed in language, be willing to overlook any nuance, and boil a topic down to the one idea that will elicit the most emotional response in someone else. 
During the last several legislative sessions, Republican lawmakers in Tennessee have conducted a masterclass in how to gaslight Tennesseeans. 
The most recent pieces of egregious legislation by the GOP supermajority are bills designed to strip away diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives related to departmental appointments and hiring practices. As with most recent controversial legislation by the GOP, there was a lawmaker ready and willing to break down the gaslighting process.



				Logic and nuance would tell anyone that 61 years of “equality” doesn’t amount to much when you weigh that amount of time against 300 years of abuse, murder, slavery and marginalization simply based on one’s skin color, sexuality or gender. 			


Rep. Aron Maberry, a first term Clarksville Republican, was the House sponsor for HB0622 and HB0923 – both designed to “dismantle DEI.” 
The first step for any gaslighting expert is to find a word to target. It doesn’t matter what the true definition of that word is as long as that word has attained a certain connotation. In this case, the word Maberry chose was equity — the meat of the DEI sandwich. 
“The big problem in DEI is equity. We all know diversity, we all love including people. Equity is not equality, and it’s not about treating people fairly or ensuring equal opportunity … equity in the context of DEI is essentially that everybody gets the same outcome,” Maberry said.
Maberry paints a bullseye on the word equity and fires. This isn’t a difficult shot for him because the connotation of the word had already been established in corners of right-wing conversations five years ago. Now, the word is blasphemous in the world of most conservatives.  
The true meaning of equity has been lost and replaced by a mutated form of the word, one that is often equated with socialism and promises an equal outcome for everyone, when the actual definition of equity does everything except guarantee an equal outcome for everyone. Equity provides gateways and resources to opportunities that have been historically out of reach for many women and people of color. 
Maberry and Senate sponsor Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican, sought to further explain the reasoning behind their bills by entering into phase two of the gaslighting process: ignore all nuances of a given topic. 
Maberry and Johnson saidthat their bills focus on merit, qualifications, skill and competency in employment decisions, and diversity will “happen naturally through fair hiring practices.” 
Yes, in a world devoid of history and nuance, “fair” hiring practices would occur naturally.

What Johnson and Maberry fail to take into account is that systemic racism is still very much alive today, 61 years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964. DEI initiatives were put in place to catalyze the pursuit of more diverse personnel in business and government by intentionally recruiting people who would typically fall outside a company or department’s purview. DEI is about making sure we all understand that we don’t live in a post-racial society simply because certain hiring practices are illegal. Subconscious and systemic prejudice will always find a way to circumvent the law, even unintentionally.
Logic and nuance would tell anyone that 61 years of “equality” doesn’t amount to much when you weigh that amount of time against 300 years of abuse, murder, slavery and marginalization simply based on one’s skin color, sexuality or gender. Our society is still in the formative stages of course correction from these atrocities, and the systemic rivers of opportunity that have benefited white men for centuries haven’t dried up yet. Removing the dam of DEI initiatives simply allows those rivers to flow faster.
For their final act, Maberry and Johnson needed something to stoke the flames of emotion; something to indisputably turn the tables on inclusive initiatives. If DEI were about making room for all people to have equal access and opportunity, then the last card to play in the gaslighting hand is to flip the script completely. 
Maberry and Johnson initially tread lightly into this final act by disarming their skeptics with the admission that diversity could be beneficial before sealing the entire process with the claim that DEI initiatives weren’t just misguided but were actually a form of discrimination themselves. Nothing angers people of privilege more than believing they are the ones being discriminated against. 
Tennesseans can agree to disagree on issues of policy and legislation, but we should collectively be offended when our supermajority lies to our faces and tells us it’s the truth, as members have with anti-DEI laws designed to penalize minorities.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)A trio of Albuquerque-area Democratic lawmakers opened an in-person office space in a community college campus Saturday, one of several recent office openings that the legislators hope will boost services for constituents and also build momentum for a professional, paid Legislature in the near future. 
Newly hired district legislative aides for Sen. Harold Pope, state Rep. Joy Garratt and state Rep. Charlotte Little will regularly work from a newly leased office space at Central New Mexico Community College’s Westside campus. The office is in the “WSII” building on the north side of campus.
Thanks to a provision in the state budget two years ago, at least 20 House lawmakers have opened individual or shared office spaces since late last year in or near their districts, according to Pamela Armstrong, spokesperson for the office of House Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque). More offices are expected to open soon, she said. The same provision allowed lawmakers to hire paid legislative aides. 
NM legislative recap Feb. 12: It’s still too cold to harvest, but the session is heating up

Garratt, whose District 29 covers from Albuquerque’s West Side to Laguna Pueblo, told Source New Mexico at the Saturday ribbon-cutting that, outside of the obvious benefit of the office being “a good place to work” where constituents can reach their representatives year-round, the new office could demonstrate to the public why a more professional, modern Legislature is needed. 
“Step one is actually having a staff person. Step two is having a space other than Starbucks, Panera Bread and a local coffee shop. Step three, and this is something I’ve worked on for three sessions, is modernization, paid legislators,” she said.
New Mexico’s remains the only unpaid Legislature in the country, though lawmakers receive per diem payments during the session and for interim committee meetings. Lawmakers and good-government advocates say paying lawmakers would elicit better candidates and reduce the influence of lobbyists or other outside interests. 
“I think if people see the effectiveness of being able to easily contact your state legislator, I think there would be greater public support,” Garratt said. “If we do our jobs. They’ll see it’s beneficial. People don’t know their state legislators. I got an angry phone call yesterday saying, ‘Congressman Garratt, what are you going to do about the Trump budget?’”
Lawmakers this year considered a joint resolution, which, if approved by voters, would create a commission that would determine and approve lawmaker salaries. But it never made it out of the Senate. 
An independent review of the legislation noted that a base salary of $50,000, for example, for 112 lawmakers would be cost taxpayers about $5.6 million annually.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9151-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-05 13:21:15.147897

Emily Bush captured the essence of this mission in her keynote: “We all have a part to play in making sure that women’s voices, ideas, and leadership are at the forefront of this movement.  Let’s keep supporting and celebrating women, because when they succeed, we all do.”From personal journeys to professional insights, the panelists shared candid reflections. “It’s like 50% believing in yourself and 50% having it reflected back at you,” said Sas Stewart. “If I can hit that balance… that’s the feeling.” Libby Parent added, “I can only be my authentic self. And I think sometimes growing up in your career, you may get advice to be different than you are. I was never very good at that.”The panelists brought both humor and heart as they shared the realities of leadership in Vermont and beyond. Karen Colberg, CEO of King Arthur Baking Company, offered a moving reflection on the roots of her work ethic: “What I believe really deeply is that there are parts of us that are just deep in our DNA, and they’re who we are… For me, I have this incredible work ethic. It’s from my grandmother—she was an entrepreneur… And that work ethic is deep inside me.”Sascha Mayer, cofounder of Mamava, closed the panel with a powerful reminder of what leadership often looks like behind the scenes: “There’s a million decisions. There’s a million moments. It’s saying yes, and it’s taking on challenges. It’s sharing the idea. It’s being brave every single day with a million different decisions.”Photo Credit: Lawson’s FinestThe event also spotlighted Lawson’s Finest’s Social Impact Program, which partners with Vermont nonprofits—including the Vermont Women’s Fund—to brew purpose-driven collaborations. “The Social Impact Program is a huge part of what it means to be part of Lawson’s Finest.Every year, we brew about 10 or 12 different beers in collaboration with amazing nonprofit organizations across Vermont,” said Carra Cheslin, SIP Manager. She added, “We’re so excited to be partnering with VCF, and to continue to build that relationship into the future. This event is just the beginning.”As the event transitioned into a lively networking hour, attendees continued to connect and reflect. “It’s really important to come together, to be in community as we try to create the future we want to see,” said Stacie Fagan, Vice President of Philanthropy at the Vermont Community Foundation. “That power of connection, shared experience, and mentorship—even in a group setting—was really palpable today.”This gathering served as a powerful reminder that leadership rooted in empathy, authenticity, and collaboration can transform communities from the inside out. Attendees left feeling energized and more connected to a community of women who truly want to lift each other up.Thank you to the entire Lawson’s Finest team for their commitment to Vermont.  As Emily so perfectly captured in her keynote, “Sean and Karen Lawson have pulled on every lever of their business to drive social impact—brand, product, culture, core values and philanthropy.”  Together, we’re not just raising a glass—we’re raising the bar for what’s possible when women lead, communities come together, and purpose drives progress.And it shows.Feeling inspired? Take our Giving Quiz—it’s a quick, fun way to explore charitable options that align with your giving goals and make a lasting impact.Ready to get started?Call us at 802-388-3355 (opt. 5) or email us at philanthropy@vermontcf.org and let’s put your generosity to work creating connections and opportunities in Vermont.The Vermont Community Foundation was established in 1986 as an enduring source of philanthropic support for Vermont communities.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Building a new house in today’s market doesn’t yet mean extra dollars for lumber or manufactured wood products, but Kansas building supply managers warn that tariffs have driven up other construction costs.
While on-again, off-again tariffs on Canadian timber are currently off, Kansans should prepare to pay more for just about everything else in the house, they said.
“You take the hardware and the millwork portion of our business, and we’re getting daily price increases because a lot of that product is imported from China, some from South America,” said Jay Robinson, manager of Wichita’s Mill Creek Lumber and Supply Co. “The import steel business has been affected. It’s up about 15 to 18% over the last 45 days, and we’re getting pretty much daily price updates. Fasteners, nails, screws, products for building connectors, have all seen 20 to 25% price increases.”
Hardware, like doorknobs and door hinges, is up 20 to 25%, he said.
Travis Daniels, general manager at McCray Lumber and Millwork in Topeka, agreed. 
“It’s hardware items. It’s things that are not manufactured domestically or from Canada, because so far, the Canadian government, the American government, keep flexing their muscles, and nothing really has happened yet,” he said.
In fact, Robinson said, lumber right now is at the lowest price it’s been in several years.
“The framing lumber composite is actually back to where it was in 2023,” he said, a price drop that he attributed to Canadian producers and American companies shifting as much product across the border as they could in anticipation of tariffs.
But Daniels said he is concerned that Canada’s recent election, which gave Pierre Poilievre the Liberal Party win, might have an impact on lumber.
“I’m concerned that may be setting us next up on a collision course,” he said. “I think that’s how he got elected, because he said he’ll draw the hard line against the Americans. The thing is, Canadian lumber does have some other places they can export to.”
 
Eyes open
The construction industry will closely watch the tariff situation, said Sean Miller, executive officer of the Kansas Building Industry Association. It’s important that Canadian lumber and concrete from Mexico continue to be exempted from tariffs, he said.
“Canada is the source of upwards of 80% of our lumber, so that’s a huge issue for the homebuilding industry in particular,” he said. “There is a 14.5% tariff on lumber, pretty consistent through the last couple of administrations. That lumber was exempted from any additional tariffs at this time, and that’s really critical for us.”

Miller said possible supply chain disruptions are also a concern.
“We’ve seen so much, starting really with COVID, and it’s never really come back the way we would have liked it,” he said. “That can really impact us.”
As an example, he said electrical transformers can be challenging to source for larger developments, such as 20- or 50-house projects.
“The ability for Evergy or your local electric partner to get the right amount of transformers really got limited during COVID, and it has not come back the way we would have liked to,” he said. “Electric companies have worked really hard to make sure those things are staged and ready.”
Robinson said tariffs have the potential to hurt the cost of projects that are in the works or already started, but most builders won’t be affected because they learned hard lessons during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I would say pretty much 99.9% of all the builders we deal with have language in their contracts for increases due to market conditions,” he said. “A lot of builders took some pretty serious hits back in ’21, ’22, during the COVID run, when lumber prices doubled. They were not protected.”
“Unfortunately, the end user is the one that’s bearing the brunt of all these tariffs,” Robinson added.
 
No quick fix
As the politics of tariffs and interest rates play out, Daniels said there’s no way to quickly bring manufacturing back to the United States. 
“If you’re a believer that the trade imbalance with these other countries has been tremendously unfair, not America’s favorite for years, it’s not going to fix quick,” he said. “It’s going to be interesting times.”
Robinson said he believes American lumber companies could potentially manage the country’s housing starts.
“What we’re seeing right now are curtailments with the prices as soft as they are — the mills are actually cutting production back because they’re over produced,” he said. “I’m going to say that our domestic production on framing and lumber commodity products can sustain about 1.2 to 1.3 million housing starts annually, and that’s pretty close to where we’re at today.”
Robinson said he is less familiar with what it would take for the country to keep up with hardware needs in construction, but he said that part of the industry is “heavily reliant” on imports.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5040083-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-05-05 13:21:15.147897
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-05 16:08:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Several CT bills would limit public access to records through FOIA,Andrew Brown and Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/05/ct-foia-government-records-bills/,Lawmakers have advanced several bills that could limit which records are accessible to the public or alter how public meetings are conducted.,"Connecticut lawmakers are considering a long list of bills that could change which government records are accessible to the public or alter how public meetings are conducted in the state.
Altogether, lawmakers have advanced more than a dozen pieces of legislation that seek to restrict the types of records that people can obtain through the state’s Freedom of Information Act, which was passed in 1975 to provide an avenue for the public to learn how their state and local governments are operating.
Those bills, which passed out of several legislative committees earlier this year, would eliminate access to higher education records, information on Connecticut Lottery winners, the identities of people involved in hate crimes, the location of domestic violence centers, complaints about police and corrections officers, and the home addresses for numerous groups of public employees.
At the same time, there is also legislation awaiting action on the House floor that critics say could enable school superintendents to participate in every executive session for local boards of education — meaning more government business could be discussed behind closed doors and out of earshot of the general public.
Colleen Murphy, the executive director of the Freedom of Information Commission, which oversees disputes regarding the state’s open record law, said the number of bills seeking to roll back portions of the Freedom of Information Act this year is substantial.
“I think that this is a lot, and I think there are a few that are pretty sweeping and that cause us the most concern,” said Murphy, who is also a board member of the National Freedom of Information Coalition. 
House Speaker Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, said the wide array of records that lawmakers are now seeking to block from public disclosure is the result of requests that were made directly to individual legislators.
It’s not clear which lawmakers were responsible for each piece of legislation because they are all committee-sponsored bills. But Ritter said many of the bills stemmed from requests lawmakers received from constituents who argued the release of specific information was damaging or opened them up to harassment or physical harm.
Ritter referenced one of the bills, which would prevent the state from disclosing the addresses of employees at the Connecticut Attorney General’s office, to highlight why such legislation gains traction in the Democratic-dominated legislature.
“So when you have an assistant attorney general who’s been harassed or threatened, and feels like the redaction of his or her address would be helpful, people get sympathetic for that,” Ritter said. “Is that the right public policy? Maybe not, right? But you can understand why people put the legislation in and why you get some support.”
“I don’t think the bills are added because people are trying to undermine FOI,” Ritter added. “They’re trying to help their constituents, or help people who they think have a sympathetic case.” 
Advocates for government transparency and open records, however, argue the bills sponsored this legislative session represent a broader trend in which lawmakers seek to add more exemptions to the state’s Freedom of Information Act, which turned 50 years old this year, and slowly erode the usefulness of that transparency law.
“A lot of this is a slow creep or death by a thousand paper cuts,” said Murphy, who spends each session trying to educate lawmakers on the law. 
To be sure, several bills that made it out of committee this year seek to improve the process by which citizens and journalists can access government records.
One such bill would require the state to study how long it takes each Connecticut agency to process and respond to requests under FOIA. Another would clarify the law to allow people to use their cellphone to copy records, which would cut down on the fees that state and local officials can charge for documents.
But the majority of the FOIA-related legislation this year is focused on limiting, not expanding, access to government information.
The Connecticut Council on Freedom of Information, which is composed of journalists and First Amendment advocates, is one of the few groups, outside of Murphy and the FOIC staff, that regularly voices opposition to lawmakers’ plans to restrict information from public disclosure.
In testimony this year, CCFOI tried to explain the limitations and some of the potential consequences of blocking public access to information. 
They explained how withholding the home addresses for public school teachers and other government employees would not prevent people from obtaining the exact same information from local property records or voter registration information.
They cautioned legislators that banning access to complaints about police and corrections officials until those cases are adjudicated could allow bad officers to jump from one department to another without being held accountable. 
They warned that a bill seeking to protect the location of supportive housing for domestic violence and sexual assault victims could make it impossible for the public to weigh in when local boards and commissions are considering where to locate one of those shelters. 
And a bill that would shield the names of people who win the Connecticut Lottery or sports wagers, they said, could hide potential corruption or flaws in those betting systems.
“There are reasons for the disclosure of the names of winners who are voluntarily participating in a lottery system or fantasy contest offered by a quasi-public agency. Access to public information ensures that winnings are distributed fairly, and guards against wrongdoing in the system. Public information will likely keep abuse from being hidden,” Murphy said.
Despite that testimony, many of the FOIA-related bills sailed through the Judiciary, Government Oversight, General Law and Government Administration and Elections committees with little to no opposition from lawmakers.
The bill that would block access to formal complaints about police officers, for instance, passed out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously.
In other cases, the few lawmakers who spoke out against additional FOIA exemptions were Republicans, who are overwhelmingly in the minority in the General Assembly. 
In those cases, Republican lawmakers often cited the need for transparency about how taxpayer money is spent. That includes the bill that would broadly exempt records related to teaching or research at state colleges and universities.
“The issue we have with this is, this is property that really belongs to the taxpayers of Connecticut, and it includes any of the research the school is doing,” Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott, said of the measure on higher education records. “My feeling is this should not be exempt. People pay the bills — they are paying to fund the schools; they are paying the salaries. This should be information available to the taxpayers.” 
Sen. Rob Sampson, who also frequently opposes changes to the state’s open records law, said he has supported bills in the past to protect information on domestic violence victims, who could be at risk. But he believes the number of bills seeking to restrict access to records in Connecticut has gone too far in recent years.
“I just don’t see any real benefit to expanding the exemptions that already exist,” said Sampson, R-Wolcott. “I just feel like every year we have a number of different, you know, groups that come to the Capitol looking to be included in the list of exemptions.”
Ritter, who is serving in his third term as House Speaker, said there are members of his Democratic caucus who also believe the Freedom of Information Act should not be altered, and he emphasized that the bills sponsored this session will be subject to a debate before they have a chance of passing. 
“You have some caucus members who never want to make any changes,” Ritter said. “There’s some that weigh it, you know, on a case by case basis, and we’ll do the same thing this year.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20230104_Inauguration_Hartford_YK_101.jpg,,,2025-05-05 12:15:29.420054

Every day, I have been inspired beyond words by the vibrancy, brilliance, and dedication of our faculty, staff, students, and alumni,” Ono said in his statement. “I will miss the extraordinary intellectual vitality that fills our classrooms and laboratories, the sublime sounds of our musical and theatrical performances, and the roar of fans cheering on the Wolverines — or singing ‘Mr. Brightside’ together in joyful unity.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Rahul Patel, chair of the University of Florida’s Presidential Search Committee, said members “sought a leader who could match UF’s extraordinary momentum, understand its role as the flagship university of one of the most dynamic states in the country, and inspire our community to reach even greater heights.”
In his announcement to the University of Michigan, Ono highlighted several developments under his leadership, including forging partnerships with OpenAI and Los Alamos National Laboratory to launch a $1.2B artificial intelligence research ecosystem, expanding university’s Go Blue Guarantee to provide free tuition to in-state students from families earning up to $125,000 and beginning efforts to rethink the campus’s physical space with the “Campus Plan 2050.”
However Ono’s two-and-a-half year tenure was not without controversy. In March the University abruptly closed its diversity, equity and inclusion office and ended its strategic plan to promote diversity following executive orders from President Donald Trump ending all DEI “mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities” in the federal government, and forbidding federal contractors from considering “race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin” in employment, procurement and contracting practices.
Ono also presided over the university amid continued protests of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, prompting policy changes from the university on how it handles protests and free speech on campus. Both students and faculty members have accused university leadership of targeting and discriminating against individuals participating in pro-Palestinian protests, while several members of university leadership have had their homes vandalized with messages in support of Palestine.
Ono began his tenure as U of M’s president on Oct. 14, 2022, succeeding former President Mark Schlissel after he was removed by the University’s Board of Regents following investigation into an anonymous complaint that Schlissel “may have been involved in an inappropriate relationship with a University employee” with the board releasing more than 100 pages of email transcripts which appeared to show an improper relationship with a subordinate.

August Wilson

When I was a senior in high school deciding on a college I was adamant that the place I would spend the next four years at would have to have great theaters. And when I moved to Hartford in the fall, my first excursion off campus was to see a production of Fun Home, a coming of age musical about a girl coming to terms with her sexuality, at TheaterWorks Hartford, a non-profit professional theater in downtown Hartford. 
Having the ability to easily go and see local professional theater artists tell poignant stories like Fun Home has been an essential resource and source of inspiration for me while working towards my theater degree the past three years. 


That same year, 2022, TheaterWorks received a $155,000 cultural operating support grant from CT Humanities, the statewide affiliate of The National Endowment of Humanities (NEH). That year, the CT Cultural Fund Operating Grant gave over $16 million in awards to 632 Connecticut organizations including Hartford Stage, The Bushnell and Hartbeat Ensemble. 
However, Trump’s recent executive orders have substantially altered the NEH process. Trump executive orders require NEH Awards to not  be given to organizations that will use the funding for; “the promotion of gender ideology;  promotion of discriminatory equity ideology;  support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) initiatives or activities; or environmental justice initiatives or activities.” CT Humanities has yet to publicly announce how or if these changes affect their awards.

In the 2025 fiscal year, six Connecticut arts organizations were each awarded $10,000  Challenge America grants from the National Endowment of the Arts (NEA).  Challenge America provided support to smaller arts organizations, “that extend the reach of the arts to populations that are underserved.” 
Earlier this year the National Endowment of the Arts (NEA) announced that their Challenge America grant program will be canceled beginning in 2026 so that they could prioritize funding projects that celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. 
Public funding is a necessity for non-profit theater organizations. Ticket sales, individual and private funding alone are rarely enough to fund a full season of productions and run their community engagement programs. The NEH and the NEA have become essential sources of funds for theaters since their conceptions in 1965. 
Giving the opportunity for new voices and stories to emerge through independent theater is, in my opinion, essential for the betterment of society. Seeing and understanding diverse stories allows for a more compassionate and intelligent society.  Arthur Miller once said, “The mission of the theatre, after all, is to change, to raise the consciousness of people to their human possibilities.” A failure to fund arts is a failure to voice independent thoughts and discussions. It is a failure to maintain communities that initiate change. It is a failure to students, who benefit from reading plays in classrooms.
While these small arts organizations are facing funding regulations and cuts it is important that we as citizens continue to see shows, and tell other people to see shows and donate when you can. Hartbeat Ensemble Artistic Director and Visiting Professor of Theater and Dance at Trinity College, Godfrey Simmons implores those who care to, “support Hartford’s Public Theatre… to support all the theaters here in Greater Hartford with your money and your feet. Go! You have the actual power to keep us going so that we can continue to tell stories that help us–you, for we are you–to move forward and find the third, fourth and fifth ways to enfranchise us all.”
This past weekend I went back to TheaterWorks to see the last show of their production of King James, a play that tackles microaggressions and implicit bias in an interracial friendship. I left wondering if we’ll be able to see stories like these in a year.

Minneapolis is among the cities forced to cancel vaccinations after cutoffs in federal funding. (Courtesy of City of Minneapolis)The number of measles cases is approaching 1,000 across 29 states, according to newly released federal statistics. Even as the outbreaks grow, more local governments are complaining that their efforts to combat measles with vaccination clinics have been shut down by abrupt federal funding cuts.
As of May 1, a total of 935 confirmed cases had been reported, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They were in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
There have been three confirmed deaths, two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all unvaccinated.

Metro Nashville, the combined county and city government in Tennessee, and three other local governments sued on April 24 over reductions in federal public health funding, saying the abrupt $11 billion in cuts nationwide forced Nashville to cancel vaccination clinics needed to combat this year’s measles outbreak. Colorado and a group of other states sued earlier in April, mentioning the impact of cuts on their ability to control measles, flu and other vaccine-preventable illnesses.
Others joining the April 24 lawsuit: Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri; and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. They called the cuts “a massive blow… at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.”
The funding cuts also forced Minneapolis to shut down clinics in March that had been scheduled to run through June, said Luisa Pessoa-Brandão, director of health initiatives for the city’s health department.
Last year the city’s clinics served 501 patients with 1,475 vaccination shots, including against measles, she said. About 30% of children in the city are not fully vaccinated, much too high to ensure unvaccinated children won’t fall victim to measles outbreaks like the current one, she added.
“There’s fear and hesitancy about the vaccine, based on some of the misinformation out there,” Pessoa-Brandão said. “There are other factors — access [to medical care] and the COVID pandemic, which delayed people getting vaccinations. We’re playing catch-up the last few years.”

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal in its present form would have huge effects on housing and homelessness in California. 


On Friday President Trump released a budget blueprint for the next fiscal year that would take a chainsaw to social, environmental and education programs. Some of the sharpest cuts are directed at housing programs that are meant to serve the poor, housing insecure and unhoused.
In California, millions are served by these funds and state and local governments depend on them to operate affordable housing, rental assistance, homeless service, planning and legal programs.
In a letter to the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, the president’s budget director, Russel Vought, laid out $163 billion in annual spending cuts coupled with “unprecedented increases” in military and border security spending. The cuts, Vought wrote, are directed at areas of spending that the administration found to be “contrary to the needs of ordinary working Americans and tilted toward funding niche non-governmental organizations and institutions of higher education committed to radical gender and climate ideologies antithetical to the American way of life.”
That includes $33.5 billion in proposed cuts to the Housing and Urban Development department, a 44% reduction from current levels.
Presidential budget requests rarely reflect what Congress ultimately passes into law but are instead often viewed as something between an opening negotiating bid and a political vision board. 
“You’d be looking at millions of people out on the street virtually overnight.”Matt Schwartz, president, California Housing Partnership
Even so, the budget document makes for quite a vision — one that, if realized, would upend decades of federal housing policy and affect millions of lives.
The sheer breadth of the cuts provides an odd kind of solace to some affordable housing advocates. 
“By following through on such a huge level with so many proposals that are going to gut assistance to low-income people across the country, including his own party’s states, he’s putting his own members of Congress in a very difficult place,” said Matt Schwartz, president of the California Housing Partnership, a nonprofit that advocates for more affordable housing. “The level of carnage that would be involved in doing these things is probably going to send some Republican senators running for the exits.”
A handful of powerful GOP senators have, indeed, already pushed back on the president’s proposal, though much of their ire was directed at what they saw as a lack of sufficient military spending. 
The largest single cut in federal housing policy would target the Housing Choice Voucher program. Better known as Section 8, it’s currently administered by the federal government and helps low-income tenants with their rental payments. The White House is proposing shifting responsibility for the administration of that program, which it calls “dysfunctional,” to states, while cutting its funding in half.

Resistance state: Tracking California’s lawsuits against the new Trump administration 

by CalMatters Staff 





It also proposes a two-year limit on how long a single person can receive help. That change is “completely out of touch with what people are facing in the housing market,” said Alex Visotzky, senior California policy fellow at the National Alliance to End Homelessness. With soaring rents outpacing people’s incomes, low-income tenants aren’t going to be able to magically earn enough money to start paying rent in two years, he said.
Additional cuts to four other housing voucher programs are meant to save $27 billion annually.
“You’d be looking at millions of people out on the street virtually overnight,” said Schwartz. “There’s no way states could maintain the same level of assistance.”
The administration proposes to save nearly $5 billion more by eliminating funds for local economic development grants, affordable housing developments and local initiatives to reduce regulatory barriers to new housing. 
That latter program, a Biden-era initiative known as Pathways to Removing Obstacle Housing, was denounced in the administration’s budget write-up as a “woke” program that has pursued “radical racial, gender, and climate goals.” 
The White House pointed specifically to a $6.7 million grant made to Los Angeles County to fund infrastructure planning, public transit-oriented housing and, as described in the county’s funding proposal, rezoning that would reverse the region’s “legacy of past systemic racism.”
Radical reshuffle of homelessness policy
The budget would slash federal homelessness funding by $532 million, while also radically changing the way those funds are distributed. The Continuum of Care program – the main way the federal government distributes funds to fight homelessness – would effectively end. It would be replaced by an Emergency Solutions Grant program.
The continuum program funds long-term solutions to homelessness, including permanent supportive housing, which is housing that comes with case management, counseling and other services for people with disabilities, mental illnesses, addictions or other struggles that mean they require extra help. Emergency Solutions Grants, on the other hand, fund more short-term solutions, such as homeless shelters, or short-term rental assistance for people who don’t need extra services.
That shift in funding would mean thousands of people would lose their supportive housing and end up back on the street, said Visotzky from the National Alliance to End Homelessness. 
“This would be a significant shift away from the solution to homelessness, which is housing, towards shelter,” he said. “This budget is going to take away all the pathways to get out of shelter and into housing.”
Homeless veterans fared better. The budget proposes a $1.1 billion increase “for the President’s commitment to ending veterans’ homelessness.” Those funds would go to Veterans Affairs for rental assistance, case management and support services.
The budget also calls for the elimination of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, an agency tasked with coordinating homeless policy at the federal level, which the administration had already gutted.
End of “fair housing” enforcement as we know it
The White House also proposes zeroing out a grant program that funds nonprofit legal aid organizations that enforce national fair housing laws. According to the explanatory summary of the cuts published by the administration, these organizations advocate “against single family neighborhoods and promote radical equity policies.”
That characterization is strongly disputed by Caroline Peattie, executive director of the Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California. Federally recognized nonprofit fair housing groups processed 74% of all fair housing complaints submitted across the country in 2023, according to data compiled by the National Fair Housing Alliance. The remainder go to federal and state housing regulators.
A recent example: In 2022, Peattie’s organization received a complaint that a Nevada-based appraisal company was systematically undervaluing homes owned by Black and Latino Californians. The nonprofit investigated and submitted a complaint to the state. The California Civil Rights Department reached a settlement with the appraisal company in mid-April.
If all the cuts go into effect as proposed, Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California would lose roughly 75% of its funding, said Peattie. 
“It’s just appalling,” she said. “When the fair housing organizations go away, then what?”
The across-the-board cuts come after months of legal battle between fair housing organizations and the administration. In February the Department of Government Efficiency, helmed by Elon Musk, abruptly terminated a key source of congressionally authorized funding for dozens of private fair housing organizations, including Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California. The groups sued. With that lawsuit pending, the funds, appropriated for fiscal year 2024, “are still in the ether,” said Peattie.
Last month, Congress passed a bill to keep government spending at current levels from the prior year, meaning that fiscal year 2025 spending is in a holding pattern for now.
“But as for fiscal year 2026, all bets are off,” said Peattie.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/020525-Homeless-Encampment-Sweep-Fresno-LV_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 12:15:29.420054

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)BOISE, Idaho — The day the flag bill came up for a vote in the Idaho Senate this spring, state Sen. Melissa Wintrow had no plans to speak against it. As the top Democratic leader in her chamber, she had already spent the legislative session in constant, vocal opposition to the Republican-dominated legislative agenda.
“I thought: ‘Oh, this stupid flag bill once again,’” Wintrow said. “I’ll just vote ‘no’ quietly because I’ve just really been in people’s grille about things.”
But then the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Ben Toews, began passing out flyers about the legislation, one of two proposed bills to limit which flags can be flown at schools and on state and local government property. The only photos on the handout were of rainbow-striped Pride flags flying in Boise: one on a flagpole in front of City Hall, and then others on light poles along Harrison Boulevard, two blocks from Wintrow’s home.
“When he sat that picture in front of me on that desk, I thought: ‘That’s enough. Just always picking and bullying,’” Wintrow said. “The state’s going to tell us what to do, when they can’t even address the larger problems like affordable housing? That’s what’s on people’s minds. A good working wage, health care. It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.”
In recent weeks, both Idaho and Utah have enacted bans that prohibit Pride flags from being displayed on government property, pitting lawmakers in the Republican-dominated legislatures against the more progressive capitals of Boise and Salt Lake City, where the flags are often flown at City Hall.










It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things. 


– State Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Idaho


In Utah, the law allows the state flag, the U.S. flag, U.S. military flags, the POW/MIA flag, local government flags, tribal nation flags, university and school flags and Olympic flags. Idaho’s list is similar, but includes a provision in the school flag law that prohibits flags with political viewpoints, “including but not limited to flags or banners regarding a political party, race, sexual orientation, gender, or a political ideology.”
Lawmakers in Florida, Texas and at least 13 other states are considering similar flag prohibitions, said Logan Casey, director of policy research with the Movement Advancement Project, which studies LGBTQ+ rights. The flag bills go beyond symbolism, Casey said. Rather, they are part of a broad and coordinated legislative attack on LGBTQ+ people that seeks to strip them of rights and erase or make difficult their participation in public life.
“Sometimes those attacks are very material, like denying access to health care or the ability to participate safely in public life and activities,” Casey said. “Sometimes they’re a little more symbolic, like these flag bills.”
‘Get rid of everything’
The rainbow-colored Pride flag was conjured up by artist and drag queen Gilbert Baker in 1978, at the suggestion of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, as a symbol of progress and pride for that year’s San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade. Since then, the rainbow-colored flag and its many design iterations have grown into worldwide emblems of solidarity with LGBTQ+ rights.
Although the laws in Idaho and Utah don’t ban Pride flags specifically, bill sponsors and their supporters made it clear they want to see such flags removed from city halls, schools and state buildings. Idaho state Rep. Ted Hill, a Republican who sponsored the bill limiting which flags can fly at schools, said in an interview that Pride flags are disruptive to classroom learning because discussion about them takes up “an amazing amount of political bandwidth.”
“The best way to do it is to get rid of everything,” said Hill, who represents Eagle, a suburb northwest of Boise. “So the only thing you have in the classroom is the American flag, the state flag. And people will say inclusivity and all this. Well, the American flag is as inclusive as it can get.”
Despite the new law, Boise Mayor Lauren McLean, a Democrat, continues to fly a Pride flag in front of City Hall, just below the city’s own and adjacent to poles flying the U.S. and state of Idaho flags. The Pride flag’s presence, within view of the state Capitol, elicited a sternly worded letter from Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican.

Idaho’s law, which went into effect April 3, has no penalty for local governments or officials who fly flags in defiance of the ban, an oversight lawmakers told Labrador they’ll rectify in subsequent legislative sessions. Instead, the law relies on “the good will of elected officials for its enforcement,” Labrador wrote, warning McLean that she should “comply with the law out of a sense of duty to your oath of office.”
He threatened, too, that lawmakers could “deny state tax revenues and other appropriations to the City of Boise or any other governmental entity that does not follow state law.”
McLean countered that the new law is unconstitutional, and that the city will challenge threats to withhold funding. Pride flags have flown in Boise for a decade, she told Labrador, and represent a commitment to “a safe and welcoming city where everyone means just that — everyone.”
“The Constitutional rights of our residents are not subject to — cannot be subject to — the political whims of legislative disapproval,” McLean wrote, “and we will not step back from them simply because the principles our community cherishes make some in state government uncomfortable.”
Boise’s city council is considering a resolution confirming that any flags it flies, including Pride flags, are official city flags — a move the council says will ensure it is complying with state law. In the meantime, the city will “continue to fly the flags on City Hall Plaza that represent our community and speak to our values of caring for people and welcoming all,” McLean said in a statement.
Early on Easter morning, several people climbed a ladder propped up next to the city’s flagpole to cover the Pride flag and a separate flag (honoring organ and tissue donation) with trash bags. They also raised the Appeal to Heaven flag, a Revolutionary War-era flag that has come to represent sympathy to the Christian nationalist movement and to President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. A few hours later, the mayor lowered the flags, which are on a locked halyard, to remove the trash bags and the Appeal to Heaven flag.
It capped a challenging sequence of events in Boise and nearby Meridian, which drew national attention this spring when school officials ordered a middle school teacher to take down a sign with the phrase “Everyone is welcome here” from her classroom. Amid the backlash, people in Boise printed T-shirts and yard signs in support of the teacher and the sign’s message.
The mayor’s response to the flag law and the support for the classroom message aren’t directly connected, but both reflect how many in the community insist on sending a welcoming message at this moment in American history, said Christina Bruce-Bennion, executive director of Boise’s Wassmuth Center for Human Rights, which helped coordinate support for the teacher.

‘It is very targeted’
In Salt Lake City, the flag ban threatens to end a long-standing annual tradition. Typically, the mayor’s office kicks off Pride Month festivities in June with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall, said Chad Call, executive director of the Utah Pride Center, which puts on the state’s annual Pride festivities. Events include a parade through the streets of Salt Lake City with a 200-foot Pride flag — which remains a legal form of First Amendment expression and has taken place most years since 1997.
“We have a city council that wants to celebrate Pride month,” Call said. “They want to celebrate the queer community in the month of June. And then we have a state government that does not want that happening in our capital city. And so it is very targeted.”

One of the flag bill’s sponsors, state Rep. Trevor Lee, said in an interview that his legislation was prompted by constituents who told him they’re “sick and tired of seeing a political agenda being pushed in their face” on government property, particularly with flags featuring transgender representation.
“It makes people feel uncomfortable if it’s something they don’t agree with,” said Lee, who represents a district north of Salt Lake City. “And so we’re trying to keep it very specific and let schools focus on teaching the things that they need to, and let government buildings just fly their city flag for heaven’s sakes, or the state flag or the American flag.”
One Utah parent, Republican activist Aaron Bullen, said he began objecting to Pride flags several years ago after one of his children, then a fifth grader, was “visibly upset” after school one day. Bullen said his son told him he’d seen what’s known as a Progress Pride flag, a newer iteration of the original rainbow-striped flag. It includes an arrow on the left side composed of pink, blue and white stripes to represent transgender people, as well as brown and black stripes to represent queer people of color. The flag was in the school’s computer lab.
Bullen said he complained to school leaders at the district, south of Salt Lake City, and the flag came down. But Bullen felt as though the flag’s presence undermined what he and his wife teach at home and model to their children as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, particularly how they interpret the church’s stance on transgender people and marriage for same-sex couples.
“It says, basically, ‘we approve of gay marriage’ when that flag is up,” Bullen said. “And that’s something that my religion is explicitly against. And so you have a teacher of my son, a person in authority that they’d like to be able to trust and to follow the instructions of, but they’re saying, ‘your parents who taught you this other thing, they’re wrong. Your religion is wrong.’ That’s what that flag means.”










It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would.


– Aaron Bullen, Utah parent and Republican activist


He added: “It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would. Parents have the fundamental right and responsibility to rear their children. And it’s not a school’s place to oppose the religion of the parents or the teachings of the parents.”
Unlike in Idaho, Utah’s flag ban carries a $500 fine per day for failure to comply with the law. But in Utah, the law took effect without Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’s signature. The governor declined to sign the bill into law, saying the state’s residents are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix.”
Call, of the Utah Pride Center, said that while it’s discouraging for LGBTQ+ people to witness their representation further erased in public spaces, they refuse in Utah to allow the flag law to diminish the spirit of their Pride events, among the largest in the nation.
“Our counterculture here is really, really strong,” Call said. “And I think the thing that probably defines our Utah Pride as being kind of unique is the incredibly strong community that it brings together. There’s tens, hundreds of thousands of people that come out to support it.”

Josh McLaurin, a Sandy Springs Democrat, announced May 5 the start of his lieutenant governor campaign for what’s expected to be a heavily contested race in 2026. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file)State Sen. Josh McLaurin, a Sandy Springs Democrat, announced Monday that he is entering the 2026 race for lieutenant governor.
McLaurin is serving his fourth term in the Georgia Legislature, where he’s become known as an outspoken opponent of  Republican lawmakers who he says rubber stamp President Donald Trump’s policies.
“100 days in, the Trump administration is tanking the economy and ignoring court orders. But the Republicans running the State of Georgia are silent about Trump’s needless tariffs and his violations of Americans’ basic legal rights,” McLaurin said.
McLaurin is scheduled to hold a campaign launch event at 3 p.m. Monday at Rousakis Riverfront Plaza in Savannah. 
Vidalia Republican Sen. Blake Tillery and Conyers Republican Takosha Swan, a board member of the Georgia Department of Veterans Services, have also filed paperwork to fundraise for what’s expected to be a heavily contested lieutenant governor race next year.
Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a Butts County Republican, has not announced whether he will seek a second term in office or seek to replace the term-limited GOP Gov. Brian Kemp.
McLaurin said in a statement announcing his decision that if elected as lieutenant governor, he will continue standing up for “hard working” Georgians.
“It’s time to elect state leaders who understand how crazy this moment in history is and are ready to stand up and do something about it,” McLaurin said. “Georgia is my home and my heart. We’ve got amazing people and culture. We’ve got Waffle House. We could be a national example of how best to live, work, and raise a family.  But our state is run by Republicans who can’t find the spine to tell the truth about Trump’s chaos – or do anything at all to fight back.”
Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat, is the first Democrat to throw his hat in the ring to run for governor, but others could soon join him — former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has said she hopes to make an announcement soon, and former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond is seen as another likely candidate.
State Rep. Ruwa Romman, a Duluth Democrat and ally of McLaurin, quickly endorsed his bid.
“We need people who are willing to fight, do the hard work, and stand up for Georgians because the reality is that a lot of people feel left behind and this is the moment to show them who has actually been fighting for them and who hasn’t.”

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.


Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.
Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

Students from the Charter School of Wilmington have been named National Winners of the 15th annual Samsung Solve for Tomorrow STEM competition, taking home a $100,000 prize package for their groundbreaking healthcare innovation.
The Delaware high schoolers earned top honors after presenting their project live to a panel of judges in Washington, D.C., on April 28.
Their winning solution, the “AKQUA-Gel hydrogel bandage,” tackles the state’s growing physician shortage by enabling remote wound monitoring through advanced technology.
READ: University of Delaware President Dennis Assanis announces resignation
The smart bandage integrates AI-powered features, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and 3D-printed components to track key wound-healing indicators such as moisture, pH, and oxygen levels.
Linked to a mobile app, the device allows both patients and doctors to monitor wounds in real time—potentially cutting down hospital visits and easing strain on overburdened healthcare systems.
Delaware has been hit especially hard by a shortage of medical professionals, with some counties experiencing wait times for primary care that have surged nearly 200%.
The students designed the AKQUA-Gel to be part of the solution, aiming to increase access to care and improve patient outcomes through smart, accessible technology.
Samsung’s Solve for Tomorrow competition challenges students nationwide to use STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) to solve real-world problems.

This team of artisans restored three enormous stained glass windows, panel by panel, for the historic church that was a bastion for the Civil Rights movement in Memphis, Tennessee, in the 1960s. The stained glass windows depicted Civil Rights icons and paid homage to the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Strike, which lasted 64 days from Feb. 12 to April 16, 1968. It is the site where sanitation workers agreed to end the strike when city officials recognized their union and their raised wages.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/ Getty Images)Former Maine Gov. Paul LePage has officially signaled his intent to run for Congress. 
The Republican filed paperwork Sunday with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Maine’s 2nd Congressional District. Last November, Jared Golden, a Democrat who often crosses party lines, was reelected to a fourth term in the district that covers a large swath of the state. 
LePage became governor of Maine in 2011 and served until 2019. The New York Times described him as one of the “most unfiltered politicians” pre-President Donald Trump; however, he prided himself on lowering taxes and cutting regulations while chief executive. 
While the paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission lists a P.O. Box for LePage in Augusta, he became a permanent resident of Florida after leaving office in 2020 and again after losing to current Gov. Janet Mills in the 2022 gubernatorial election. He was said to have benefited from tax breaks reserved for permanent residents for property he owned in the state while living in the Maine governor’s mansion.
In 2018, LePage was sued for refusing to implement voter-approved Medicaid expansion. He has also been called out for racist remarks and left a voicemail laden with obscenities for a state lawmaker who criticized him.
“President Trump needs a fighter who will stand with him and increase the Republican majority in the U.S. House,” said Maine GOP Chairman Jim Deyermond, in a Facebook post Monday morning.
Asked about LePage’s candidacy, Golden responded, “I thought Paul was doing his best work in retirement.”
Golden is said to be considering a run for governor. Asked about his plan, a spokesperson for the representative said he’s “busy fighting the GOP’s health care cuts and working through his committees to secure jobs for Bath Iron Works and protect Maine’s fishing communities.”
“The next election is the furthest thing from his mind.”

“I have to ask you about the way we spend our money,” asked a constituent who declined to give his name. “My voice is against using our money to fund what many people would consider a genocide.”
Last month, Warnock and fellow Georgia Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff were part of an overwhelming majority of senators who voted to reject a bid to block $8.8 billion in arms sales to Israel sponsored by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders said the proposal represented an effort to force Israel to take steps to protect civilians from bombing and to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.
In November, Warnock and Ossoff joined 16 other senators in supporting a failed resolution to block some weapon sales.
Warnock told the constituent he had been working to support peace and humanitarian aid.

“I believe in the humanity of all God’s children, and that you have to center the concerns of the most marginalized,” he said. “And that’s why I was one of the first in the Senate to call for a ceasefire. In addition to that, I pressed the Biden administration, I pushed the Netanyahu administration around the ways in which humanitarian aid was not even getting into Gaza.I voted to get $10 billion in humanitarian aid to Gaza.

During the answer, several women stood up in the crowd and began shouting things like “it’s our money” and “you’re a liar.”
For a few awkward minutes, the women berated Warnock while staff members tried to continue with the programming and members of the crowd shouted for the demonstrators to sit down.
Warnock told the protesters he would answer their questions but refused to shout over them.

“We have to decide, as somebody who is an activist myself and who comes from the activist community, you can come and express yourself, it’s a very passionate issue, or we can have a conversation, but we can’t do both of those things,” he said. “We can do one or the other.”
“As incredibly important as this issue is, and it’s a matter of life and death, there are other issues here, and these folks deserve to be heard as well,” he added.
The women left after about six minutes. Several minutes after that, a man began shouting at Warnock over his vote while another audience member who had been called on by the moderator tried to ask a question about high health insurance costs.

Other than the demonstrators, Warnock faced a mostly friendly crowd who largely expressed concerns over actions of the Trump administration, including levying increased tariffs, cutting federal jobs and dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The senator, who is up for re-election in 2028, pledged to oppose the administration and directed constituents with specific issues to follow up with his staff.
For decades, support of Israel was a bipartisan issue, but the matter has become especially fraught for Democrats since Israel’s latest military campaign which began in October 2023 after the militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel.
According to the United Nations, as of April 22, more than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, including more than 8,000 women and 15,000 children. In addition, the UN finds nearly the entire population faces high levels of food insecurity as Israel has ordered a halt to all aid into Gaza, including food and medicine.

Jawahir Sharwany, one of the demonstrators who shouted at Warnock, said the demonstrations will continue until the policy changes.
“We’re not going to stop protesting and talking about it until they stop sending shipments from all these billions of dollars of weapons bills,” she said. “Warnock is signing onto the deaths of Palestinian children.”
Angry constituents have become a town hall hallmark for U.S. legislators from both parties this year.
In February, Republican Congressman Rich McCormick faced a tough crowd at a town hall in Roswell over government cuts and layoffs. In April, multiple protesters were zapped with Tasers at an Acworth meeting with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ossoff got an earful  from fired federal workers who said he needed to do more to push back against the administration.

Final Reading: A major House elections bill is hitting some roadblocks 

by Shaun Robinson 
March 21, 2025, 6:38 pmMarch 21, 2025, 6:38 pm 



Technically, the National Conference of State Legislatures lists Vermont as having an open primary system. Voters do not declare a party preference when registering to vote. Primary election voters can choose which party’s ballot to vote. The challenge in the Vermont system is there is nothing to prevent a member of party A from running as a candidate in party B’s primary.    A recent report from by the American Political Science Association notes:  “By providing candidates with a label, parties can serve as a valuable cue and shortcut for voters. Much like people associate brands with a specific type of product, voters link parties to policy menus and develop positive or negative feelings towards them. In a country where voters cast ballots for myriad offices—not just state and federal executives and legislators but a panoply of local officials—party labels are not just a convenience that makes voting easier but a virtual necessity to sort out candidates on lengthy ballots. Besides providing valuable cues to voters, parties also help organize political ideas more coherently and ideologically in a way that most voters lack the time or interest to do.”One of the fundamentals of our election system are political parties, where each party is unique and different from all the other political parties. It is clear that the APSA task force of political scientists believes that party labels help voters to avoid being confused when making judgements about candidates. When voters are faced with a confusion candidate, a candidate from one party who runs in another party’s primary, are there any winners?Because Vermont lacks any laws that prevent candidates from one party running in another party’s primary, voters are relying on each individual candidate to stay in their lane. It is clear over the last 10 years more candidates are not staying in their lane. The actual number of candidates is low but persistent — while once the exclusive territory of candidates from one party now all boundaries have disappeared.Our lack of a well-thought-out election system may be making it much more challenging for voters to make a judgment as to which candidate best aligns with their views. It might be time to enact new laws that prevent a candidate from running in a party primary for which they are not a member.  Or we could bin the existing system and move to a multi-party primary system, where Vermont would hold a single primary election where every candidate for an office, regardless of party, is listed on a single ballot and the top candidates move on to the general election.  The challenge for the Legislature is one of politics. Legislators, and political parties , requently have their own best interest at heart. Making changes to the existing primary election system has proven elusive. Often, in situations like this, where it is difficult to develop a legislative consensus, it is the thoughts of citizens shared with their legislators that can make the difference between improving the primary election system or no change.    Let’s improve the system and help every Vermonter get the best out of their vote.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Russell Frank: Let’s rethink our primary system.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 11:05:00.350000

Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers were picketing at manufacturing locations in East Hartford and Middletown, after about 77% of nearly 2,100 union members voted to approve their first strike since 2001, union officials said. Their contract expired late Sunday.
“Pratt and Whitney is a powerhouse in military and commercial aerospace products because our membership makes it so,” David Sullivan, the union’s eastern territory vice president, said in a statement. “This offer does not address the membership concerns, and the membership made their decision — we will continue to fight for a fair contract.”
The company, a subsidiary of Arlington, Virginia-based RTX Corp., called its latest wage and retirement proposal competitive, and said its workforce is among the most highly compensated in the region and industry.
“Our message to union leaders throughout this thoughtful process has been simple: higher pay, better retirement savings, more days off and more flexibility,” the company said in a statement. “We have no immediate plans to resume negotiations at this time and we have contingency plans in place to maintain operations and to meet our customer commitments.”
The company said its latest contract proposal included an immediate 4% wage increase, followed by a 3.5% increase in 2026 and a 3% increase in 2027. It also included a $5,000 contract ratification bonus and enhanced pension and 401k plan benefits.

Every day, teachers are nurturing and supporting our precious students in classrooms across New Hampshire. Teachers dedicate their careers and their lives to providing young Granite Staters with the tools they need to build bright futures and live out their dreams.
May 5-9 marks Teacher Appreciation Week nationwide — an important moment to ensure the teachers in our lives know how much they mean to us and our communities. It’s important to show — and tell — our gratitude.
I am so grateful for every New Hampshire teacher. To those who taught me how to teach, to my colleagues in the classroom who supported me and guided me throughout my career, to the dedicated professionals who I trust to teach my three sons — thank you! You inspire me every day, and you inspire the next generation to be their best selves.
This year, I hope you’ll join me to show your appreciation and show up for teachers. We can drop off a gift card and we can drop by a school board meeting. We can tell teachers how much we care about their work. And we can tell our policy makers to protect our neighborhood public schools.
At the state and federal level, anti-public education politicians are trying to turn public funding into blank checks for private schools. They want to give more handouts and tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires while breaking our public schools and taking resources away from teachers and students.
We can’t afford to let them turn funding for public school students and teachers into private school vouchers. We can’t afford to let them slash programs like Medicaid and children’s health insurance that keep students healthy and ready to learn. We can’t afford to let them cut programs that keep our kids safe, like the Office of the Child Advocate. These harmful proposals — and more — are all contained in the current state budget draft.
We know what appreciation would look like in action. Teachers would have classrooms that are stocked with supplies they need and full of the joy that students deserve. Teachers would come to work at schools that are safe, welcoming, and well-funded. Teachers would have the careers they deserve that can support their families and support our communities in every corner of this state.
Whether you speak out on your social media accounts or call your lawmakers, when we transform our appreciation into support for teachers we protect and strengthen public schools.
Teachers go above and beyond for their students every day — even in the face of anti-public education politicians’ attacks on their profession and their school. They bring joy and determination to their work to ensure every student — no matter the color of their skin or the ZIP code they live in — has the resources they need to succeed.
We know the overwhelming majority of Granite Staters support the teachers at their community public schools, which are attended by nearly 90% of students and 95% of students with a disability. Now it’s time for us to go above and beyond for teachers and turn our appreciation into actions that will protect our public schools and help teachers get the support and resources they deserve.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Classroom2-1024x688.jpeg,,,2025-05-05 11:05:00.350000

The potential elimination of Head Start would represent a setback to decades of progress in advancing equitable access to high-quality services that support child and family well-being.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Morgan Crossman: Head Start is at risk and there is vital need for proactive funding solutions.","This commentary is by Morgan Crossman, executive director of Building Bright Futures.As Vermont’s Early Childhood State Advisory Council named in the Federal Head Start Act, Building Bright Futures is deeply concerned about reports that the upcoming federal budget proposal may eliminate Head Start and Early Head Start. These programs are essential to meeting the basic needs of Vermont families.BBF is committed to ensuring that all of Vermont’s children and families have access to the fundamental resources they need to thrive. BBF plays a critical role in monitoring how policy decisions — federal, state and local — affect the early childhood system and in holding decision-makers accountable for protecting and strengthening this system.In 2024, Head Start and Early Head Start served 1,249 at-risk children in Vermont, supported by $27.7 million in federal funding. These programs provide early education and much more. They ensure that children receive comprehensive health screenings, nutrition, family support and access to developmental services — critical supports that help lay the foundation for lifelong well-being and academic success.Research consistently shows that participation in Head Start improves long-term outcomes for children, including increased high school graduation rates and improved health. These programs are also a key part of Vermont’s early childhood infrastructure, especially given that access to child care, particularly in rural areas of our state, continues to be a challenge.Vermont’s Head Start programs also employ 450 people, including 260 early educators, home visitors and child development professionals — all of whom are valuable members of the state’s workforce and many of whom are paid above average salaries in their positions.BBF recognizes that the federal budget proposal is not final and is advocating to maintain federal funding for Head Start. Nonetheless, BBF urges Vermont’s leaders —i ncluding the governor, state agencies and legislators — to begin planning now for how Vermont can sustain these critical services should federal funding be reduced or eliminated. Contingency planning and cross-sector collaboration will be essential to mitigate harm to children and families.The potential elimination of Head Start would represent not just a loss of services, but a setback to decades of progress in advancing equitable access to high-quality services that support child and family well-being. The Building Bright Futures State Advisory Council remains committed to ensuring that all Vermont children — especially those most vulnerable — have access to the resources and opportunities they need to reach their full potential.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Morgan Crossman: Head Start is at risk and there is vital need for proactive funding solutions.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 11:05:00.350000

In 2005, Missouri adopted some of the strictest eligibility standards in the nation, reduced benefits, and increased patients’ copayments for the joint federal-state program due to state budget shortfalls totaling about $2.4 billion over several prior years. More than 100,000 Missourians lost coverage as a result, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that the changes led to increases in credit card borrowing and debt in third-party collections.
A woman told NPR that year that her $6.70-an-hour McDonald’s job put her over the new income limits and rendered her ineligible, even though she was supporting three children on about $300 a week. A woman receiving $865 a month in disability payments worried at a town hall meeting about not being able to raise her orphaned granddaughter as the state asked her to pay $167 a month to keep her health coverage.
Now, Missouri could lose an estimated $2 billion a year in federal funding as congressional Republicans look to cut at least $880 billion over a decade from a pool of funding that includes Medicaid programs nationwide. Medicaid and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Program together insure roughly 79 million people — about 1 in 5 Americans.
“We’re looking at a much more significant impact with the loss of federal funds even than what 2005 was,” said Amy Blouin, president of the progressive Missouri Budget Project think tank. “We’re not going to be able to protect kids. We’re not going to be able to protect people with disabilities from some sort of impact.”
At today’s spending levels, a cut of $880 billion to Medicaid could lead to states’ losing federal funding ranging from $78 million a year in Wyoming to $13 billion a year in California, according to an analysis from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. State lawmakers nationwide would then be left to address the shortfalls, likely through some combination of slashing benefits or eligibility, raising taxes, or finding a different large budget item to cut, such as education spending.
Republican lawmakers are floating various proposals to cut Medicaid, including one to reduce the money the federal government sends to states to help cover adults who gained access to the program under the Affordable Care Act’s provision known as Medicaid expansion. The 2010 health care law allowed states to expand Medicaid eligibility to cover more adults with low incomes. The federal government is picking up 90% of the tab for that group. About 20 million people nationwide are now covered through that expansion.
Missouri expanded Medicaid in 2021. That has meant that a single working-age adult in Missouri can now earn up to $21,597 a year and qualify for coverage, whereas before, nondisabled adults without children couldn’t get Medicaid coverage. That portion of the program now covers over 329,000 Missourians, more than a quarter of the state’s Medicaid recipients.
For every percentage point that the federal portion of the funding for that group decreases, Missouri’s Medicaid director estimated, the state could lose $30 million to $35 million a year.
But the equation is even more complicated given that Missouri expanded access via a constitutional amendment. Voters approved the expansion in 2020 after the state’s Republican leadership resisted doing so for a decade. That means changes to Medicaid expansion in Missouri would require voters to amend the state constitution again. The same is true in South Dakota and Oklahoma.
So even if Congress attempted to narrowly target cuts to the nation’s Medicaid expansion population, Washington University in St. Louis health economist Timothy McBride said, Missouri’s expansion program would likely stay in place.
“Then you would just have to find the money elsewhere, which would be brutal in Missouri,” McBride said.










I’m not ready to think that Congress is going to willingly put us on the path of making every state go cut their benefits for the most vulnerable.


– Elias Tsapelas, director of fiscal policy at the conservative Show-Me Institute


In Crestwood, a suburb of St. Louis, Sandra Smith worries her daughter’s in-home nursing care would be on the chopping block. Nearly all in-home services are an optional part of Medicaid that states are not required to include in their programs. But the services have been critical for Sandra and her 24-year-old daughter, Sarah.
Sarah Smith has been disabled for most of her life due to seizures from a rare genetic disorder called Dravet syndrome. She has been covered by Medicaid in various ways since she was 3.
She needs intensive, 24-hour care, and Medicaid pays for a nurse to come to their home 13 hours a day. Her mother serves as the overnight caregiver and covers when the nurses are sick — work Sandra Smith is not allowed to be compensated for and that doesn’t count toward the 63-year-old’s Social Security.
Having nursing help allows Sandra Smith to work as an independent podcast producer and gives her a break from being the go-to-person for providing care 24 hours a day, day after day, year after year.
“I really and truly don’t know what I would do if we lost the Medicaid home care. I have no plan whatsoever,” Sandra Smith said. “It is not sustainable for anyone to do infinite, 24-hour care without dire physical health, mental health, and financial consequences, especially as we parents get into our elder years.”
Elias Tsapelas, director of fiscal policy at the conservative Show-Me Institute, said potential changes to Medicaid programs depend on the extent of any budget cuts that Congress ultimately passes and how much time states have to respond.
A large cut implemented immediately, for example, would require state legislators to look for parts of the budget they have the discretion to cut quickly. But if states have time to absorb funding changes, he said, they would have more flexibility.
“I’m not ready to think that Congress is going to willingly put us on the path of making every state go cut their benefits for the most vulnerable,” Tsapelas said.
Missouri’s congressional delegation split along party lines over the recent budget resolution calling for deep spending cuts, with the Republicans who control six of the eight House seats and both Senate seats all voting for it.
But 76% of the public, including 55% of Republicans, say they oppose major federal funding cuts to Medicaid, according to a national KFF poll conducted April 8-15.
And Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican, has said that he does not support cutting Medicaid and posted on the social platform X that he was told by President Donald Trump that the House and Senate would not cut Medicaid benefits and that Trump won’t sign any benefit cuts.
“I hope congressional leadership will get the message,” Hawley posted. He declined to comment for this article.
U.S. House Republicans are aiming to pass a budget by Memorial Day, after many state legislatures, including Missouri’s, will have adjourned for the year.
Meanwhile, Missouri lawmakers are poised to pass a tax cut that is estimated to reduce state revenue by about $240 million in the first year.

For the first time, scientists have mapped groundwater variables nationally to understand which aquifers are most vulnerable to contamination from orphan wells.
Oil and gas wells with no active owner that are no longer producing and have not been plugged are considered orphan wells. These unplugged wells can create pathways for contaminants like hydrocarbons and brine to migrate from the oil and gas formation into groundwater zones. Plugging a well seals off these potential pathways.
USGS scientists Joshua Woda, Karl Haase, Nicholas Gianoutsos, Kalle Jahn and Kristina Gutchess published a geospatial analysis of water-quality threats from orphan wells this month in the journal Science of the Total Environment. They found that factors including large concentrations of orphaned wells and the advanced age of wells make aquifers in Appalachia, the Gulf Coast and California susceptible to contamination.
Using a USGS dataset of 117,672 documented orphan wells nationwide, the researchers found that 54 percent of the wells are within aquifers that supply 94 percent of groundwater used nationally.
“No matter where you live across the nation, you can go look at what’s happening in your backyard, how your aquifers compare to other aquifers and what the threats are,” said Gianoutsos.
 Orphan wells pockmark major U.S. aquifers

The researchers mapped the locations of orphaned wells over principal and secondary aquifers using Geographic Information Systems datasets. They then analyzed the aquifers based on factors that could contribute to vulnerability to groundwater contamination, such as the average age of the orphan wells.
Older wells were subject to less regulation and are more prone to failure. The authors found that Pennsylvanian aquifers, which span several Appalachian states including Pennsylvania, present the “maximum confluence” of risk factors. The first oil wells in the country were drilled in Pennsylvania. Orphan wells can be over 100 years old and located near coal seams and residential water wells.
The Gulf Coast aquifers, including the Coastal Lowlands aquifer system, which stretches from Texas to the Florida Panhandle, were found to be susceptible in part because wells are located in areas like wetlands and open water that are more prone to contamination.
The analysis also considered the rates of pumping from each aquifer. That led them to the California Coastal aquifers and the Central Valley, where a high density of old orphan wells overlaps with highly urbanized areas and intensive groundwater use for agriculture.
The researchers found that the Ada-Vamoosa aquifer, in central Oklahoma, has the highest concentration of orphan wells per square mile of any principal aquifer in the country.
The authors note the paper is not an analysis of the amount of groundwater contamination from orphan wells or the number of leaking orphan wells. But they suggest that policymakers and researchers could use it as a basis to target aquifers for additional investigation.
“This could be a good starting point if someone wanted to do a local investigation,” said Woda.
Gianoutsos noted that the active list of orphan wells is changing as research into orphan wells and well plugging advances. He said some 40,000 orphan wells have been added to the national list since their dataset was created. Another approximately 10,000 orphan wells have been plugged in that time.
“The threats are still there,” he said. “Just as we discover more wells, we discover additional threats.”
The research was part of the U.S. Department of the Interior Orphaned Wells Program Office through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
 Parts of Pennsylvania look like ‘Swiss cheese’ from drilling 

Orphan wells have been linked to groundwater contamination in states including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas. A 2011 Ground Water Protection Council study found that orphan wells caused 41 groundwater contamination incidents in Ohio between 1983 and 2007. The study found orphan wells and sites caused 30 groundwater contamination incidents in Texas between 1993 and 2008.
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has reported several recent cases of orphan wells contaminating groundwater. An orphan well in Vowinckel in Clarion County contaminated a family’s drinking water before it was plugged last year, according to the DEP. Another orphan well in Shinglehouse, in Potter County, was plugged by DEP in 2024 with emergency funds after a homeowner reported contamination of their water well.
John Stolz, a professor of environmental microbiology at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, has researched how fluids from oil and gas wells can migrate underground with unintended consequences.
Stolz said some of the wells in Pennsylvania are so old they were cased with wood or metal, unlike the cement that has been standard for decades. He said the wooden casings have often deteriorated completely. He said conventional drilling and more recent fracking have left much of Pennsylvania “looking like Swiss cheese.”
“It’s good to see a study that focuses on the water resources,” he said in response to the USGS study. “We are going to have greater periods of drought, and these water resources are going to become far more valuable.”
Stolz is studying a “frack-out” in the town of New Freeport in southwestern Pennsylvania. An unconventional well being fracked communicated with an orphan well over 3,000 feet away, forcing fluids to the surface. Residents of the town resorted to drinking bottled water, according to NBC News.

University of Delaware President Dennis Assanis announced Monday he will step down from his role at the end of June, concluding a nine-year tenure that saw record growth in research, student success, and institutional rankings.
Assanis, who became UD’s 28th president in 2016, said he and his wife, Eleni, are filled with gratitude for their time at the university.
“My wife, Eleni, and I are so grateful to everyone in the University of Delaware community, whom it has been my distinct honor to serve as president,” he said. “Our hearts are filled with gratitude and pride.

Under Assanis’ leadership, UD launched its largest fundraising campaign in history, expanded research expenditures by more than 160%, and introduced wide-reaching initiatives to improve access and affordability for students.
Board of Trustees Chair Terri Kelly praised Assanis for his “bold vision” and “tireless commitment,” calling his presidency “transformative.”
An interim president will be announced soon and is expected to begin July 1, according to Kelly.
Highlights of the Assanis tenure
Assanis led the creation and implementation of the university’s “Forward and Forever” strategic plan, which emphasized student achievement, interdisciplinary research, and global engagement.
During his presidency, UD climbed national rankings, including a 60-place leap in The Wall Street Journal/Pulse 2025 rankings, where it currently sits at No. 26 overall and No. 10 among public universities.
The university also experienced significant enrollment growth.
Applications rose by 50% since 2016, reaching a record 41,000 first-year applications in 2025.
Financial aid nearly doubled, from $94 million to $185 million, and the university’s four-year graduation rate now ranks ninth among public R1 institutions.
Assanis championed initiatives such as the “First State Promise,” which covers tuition and fees for in-state students from families earning under $75,000.
Enrollment of Pell Grant recipients rose more than 34%, while underrepresented minority enrollment increased by over 30%.
In research, UD’s expenditures rose from $176 million to $466 million, bolstered by interdisciplinary growth and the university’s role in hosting the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL). A
ssanis also led efforts to strengthen AI research and support the arts and humanities.
More than 600 faculty members were hired during his presidency—nearly half of UD’s current faculty—expanding academic expertise and diversity across the institution.
The physical transformation of the campus was a cornerstone of Assanis’ leadership.
He spearheaded development at the Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus, now home to over 1.2 million square feet of new facilities and more than 3,000 employees.
Major projects included the Tower at STAR, the Biopharmaceutical Innovation Center, and the forthcoming SABRE Center.
Elsewhere on campus, Assanis oversaw new science and residence halls, renovations of core facilities like Warner and Worrilow Halls, and improved student wellness resources such as the Wellbeing Center and Center for Intercultural Engagement.
He also boosted UD’s athletics profile, overseeing stadium renovations, the new Whitney Athletic Center, and the university’s upcoming move to Conference USA and the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).
During Assanis’ presidency, UD raised more than $1 billion through its Delaware First campaign and an additional $270 million in the past two and a half years.
This included a $71.5 million donation—the largest in university history—from alumni Rob and Kathy Siegfried, which will fund Siegfried Hall and the Siegfried Institute for Leadership and Free Enterprise.
The 4-time MIT-graduate and Newcastle University undergraduate brought a distinguished background to UD, with previous roles as provost at Stony Brook University and faculty positions at the University of Michigan and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
A member of the National Academy of Engineers, he holds five patents and led over $100 million in research grants.
“UD is a remarkable place with a vibrant culture of interdisciplinary inspiration to reimagine what’s possible in higher education,” Assanis said. “I will forever treasure my experience of leading such an extraordinary institution defined by amazing students, talented faculty, dedicated staff and a vast network of loyal alumni and friends who support its mission.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DA_UDARF-President_Assanis_Presentation-050422-026_UDaily_-_Story_social_sharing_800x420.jpg,,,2025-05-05 10:08:29.953265

That extended area includes the Chukchi Borderland. (Photo provided by Caitlin Bailey/Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration)The Trump administration is eying the possibility of oil leasing in Arctic Ocean areas more than 200 miles from shore, an area where U.S. territorial rights are unclear.
Information about the Trump administration’s plans to add a “High Arctic” planning area to the federal offshore oil and gas leasing program, announced two weeks ago, was provided Tuesday in a formal solicitation for public comment. The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, a division of the Department of the Interior, said it will accept public comments for 45 days on its proposal to reorganize the federal offshore leasing program, including the addition of the High Arctic area.
The new area proposed for inclusion in the oil and gas leasing program is part of the ocean territory to which the U.S. government is claiming new rights following a sea-mapping program conducted over several years.
The area is part of what is known as the extended continental shelf, which goes beyond exclusive economic zone borders that typically end at 200 nautical miles from shore.
The U.S. State Department in December 2023 began the process of claiming over 200,000 square miles of Arctic seafloor in the extended continental shelf. That area is more than twice the size of California.
Nations’ territorial rights in extended continental shelf areas beyond the 200-nautical-mile limits are limited to the seafloor and subsea areas, under international maritime law. They do not include any rights in the waters above, such as fishing rights.
Such territorial claims are normally evaluated for validity by a United Nations organization, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. While State Department information expresses an intent to submit the U.S. territorial claims to the commission, the commission’s website shows no pending U.S. applications.
The U.S. has never ratified the treaty under which the commission operates, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. That puts U.S. claims to the Arctic Ocean territory in some doubt; Russia has already objected, arguing that the U.S. is not part of the ocean treaty and therefore not entitled to its benefits.
It is difficult to know whether the U.S. government has a right to sell oil leases in the newly claimed High Arctic territory, an Anchorage environmental attorney said.
“In the international realm, it’s not always clear all the time,” said Teresa Clemmer, litigation director for Trustees for Alaska, an environmental law firm.

	As to why the Department of the Interior would designate an oil and gas leasing area in the High Arctic in murky legal circumstances, Clemmer said, there may be parallels in Russian and Canadian government actions that started exercising regulatory authority in Arctic areas where their territorial rights were not certain.
“That’s a way of getting a foot in the door and establishing that they have this authority,” she said.
Neither the Department of the Interior nor the State Department provided additional information to clarify the status of the territorial rights in the High Arctic or plans for oil development there.
Oil potential and industry interest also unclear
Mark Myers, a geologist and former director of the U.S. Geological Survey, said there is some indication of oil and gas potential in the High Arctic region designated for possible inclusion in the BOEM program.
He pointed to the Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal released in 2008 by the USGS. The study used data collected by crews working on two icebreakers, the U.S. Coast Guard’s Healy and the Canadian Coast Guard’s Louis S. St-Laurent. But that information, too, is preliminary, Myers said.
“It’s possible that some of the southern area would have oil and gas potential based on the CARA study, but a more robust, technical evaluation of the area for oil and gas potential would be something that would be important for the federal government to do,” said Myers, who also served previously as commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources and director of the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas.
The CARA study also indicated the presence of critical minerals beneath the High Arctic seafloor, but any development of those would be outside of the oil leasing program, Myers said.
If BOEM winds up establishing a designated leasing region, it would not guarantee that any lease sales will follow, Myers noted. “It’s a very, very preliminary step,” he said.
To Clemmer, the idea of setting up a High Arctic leasing region is consistent with the Trump administration’s pro-resource-extraction policies and “wanting to open up every possible place to oil and gas development.”
But offshore exploration there might be unappealing to oil companies for reasons beyond legal uncertainty.

	The High Arctic is very remote, harsh and distant from infrastructure support that oil companies might need, Clemmer noted. “I don’t see how the economics would be panning out for them,” she said.
Even the Arctic offshore areas that are within the U.S. exclusive economic zone — the Chukchi Sea and the Beaufort Sea — hold uncertainty for oil companies.
Litigation is underway over whether the Trump administration has the authority to reverse Biden administration and Obama administration decisions putting those areas off-limits to new leasing. A previous attempt in the first Trump administration was blocked in 2019 by the federal court in Anchorage.
Operations in the federal offshore areas in the Arctic have proved to be more expensive and difficult than onshore Arctic operations. The most recent attempt was by Royal Dutch Shell, which abandoned its program in 2015 after spending what it said was over $7 billion but drilling only one well to depth.
There has never been any commercial oil production in any federally managed outer continental shelf area off Alaska’s coastline except for a small portion of the Hilcorp-operated Northstar field, which lies mostly on state territory in the Beaufort Sea but overlaps a bit into federal territory.
Myers said industry interest in returning to federal Arctic offshore areas is yet to be determined.
If it exists, it would likely be focused on sites where oil has been discovered but never produced, he said. He cited the Liberty field in the Beaufort Sea, where development has been eyed since the 1990s but where plans by BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. and Hilcorp have stalled. He also listed the Kuvlum and Hammerhead prospects in the Beaufort Sea, which date back to the 1980s. Both are very far from shore, and neither has been deemed commercially viable.
While the current administration may be favorable on offshore Arctic oil development, that could change in the future, presenting another risk for oil companies considering the idea, Myers said.
“People are always going to wonder about long-term changes in policy as administrations change,” he said.
Elsewhere in the Arctic Ocean, the U.S. and Canada have a longstanding dispute over territorial rights in the Beaufort Sea off the Alaska-Yukon border. That has affected some past U.S. oil lease sales in the Beaufort, in 2003, 2005 and 2007, for example. A few tracts in the disputed zone were offered for leasing in those sales.
Exploration in that disputed territory has not occurred, and the U.S. and Canada last year started new negotiations over the competing Beaufort Sea territorial claims.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Public Broadcasting faces a new funding threat after President Donald Trump signed an executive order recently ending federal support for NPR, PBS and their affiliate stations, including SDPB.
The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to halt all direct and indirect funding to those networks by June 30.
The Trump administration said the action was necessary to ensure that taxpayer dollars no longer support what it calls “blatantly biased and partisan programming.” According to the executive order posted on the White House website, the administration cited segments on “diet culture,” “queer ducks,” and reparations, along with NPR’s alleged refusal to report on Hunter Biden’s laptop, as examples of editorial bias. The order stated the move is part of “restoring trust in government-funded institutions.”
Lawmakers on budget committee reject Noem’s public broadcasting cut

In South Dakota, Friends of SDPB issued an email appeal warning the cuts could affect local journalism, infrastructure and access to national programming. “This would have a significant impact on our airwaves,” the email said. “Locally in South Dakota we use these dollars to pay to produce local programming, our national programming bill, and some infrastructure.”
Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the CPB, responded in a statement distributed by the Friends of SDPB: “CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President’s authority. Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.” Harrison cited 47 U.S.C. § 398(c), which prohibits federal officials from exercising control over public broadcasting.
PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger also responded in a national press release, calling the executive order “blatantly unlawful.” She said PBS would “vigorously defend its independence and mission to serve all Americans, especially those in rural and underserved areas.”
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting receives approximately $525 million annually through congressional appropriations. That funding supports local stations across the country, especially in states like South Dakota, where commercial media is limited. SDPB leaders warn that losing CPB support could reduce production of shows like “South Dakota Focus,” delay infrastructure upgrades and limit emergency broadcasts in rural areas.
Legal scholars and CPB officials say the order will likely face court challenges. According to The New Yorker, CPB has already sued the administration over attempts to remove three of its five board members — a move that would deprive the board of a quorum and halt operations.
Friends of SDPB is urging listeners to contact South Dakota’s congressional delegation — U.S. Sens. John Thune and Mike Rounds, and Rep. Dusty Johnson — to preserve CPB funding.

Cindy Holscher appears at the Statehouse in Topeka as part of the 50501 national day of action on May 1, 2025. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — As the ranking Democrat on a Kansas Senate committee modeled after Elon Musk’s supposed efforts to make federal government more efficient, Sen. Cindy Holscher was “a little bit suspicious” of what GOP leaders in the Legislature really had in mind.
Instead of looking for waste, she said on the Kansas Reflector podcast, Republicans at both the federal and state level have hurt people by eliminating critical services and jobs. In Kansas, the Committee on Government Efficiency, or COGE, took its cues from out-of-state lobbyists who promoted extremist legislation, she said. Much of the committee’s work resulted in adding red tape to public assistance programs.
Meanwhile, everyday Kansans from all corners of the state responded in real time throughout the legislative session with suggestions and comments that showed the ruling party was at odds with the people they serve — but the committee chairwoman, Republican Sen. Renee Erickson, of Wichita, kept those voices hidden until the session was over, in defiance of state open records law.


For Holscher, an Overland Park Democrat, the comments showed how frustrated Kansans are with Republican leadership.
“I do think there’s been an awakening to some degree and respect that what’s happened on the federal level is hitting people in the pocketbook, and so I think people are taking more notice,” Holscher said.
She added: “The thing I think that is very important is that, you know, people need to connect the dots in terms of, then, what’s happening on the state level that’s coming, that’s going to affect them.”
Among her concerns: a looming budget crisis that could imperil public school funding. She appeared in a red “I (heart) public schools” T-shirt at a May 1 rally at the Statehouse, where hundreds of Kansans protested Musk’s work with DOGE.
When Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican, announced the formation of COGE before the session launched in January, he said he wanted to explore ways to make government more efficient. The committee launched an online portal where Kansans were invited to submit their ideas.
Those who navigated the portal were informed that their comments would be subject to open records law and could be made public. Kansas Reflector submitted a formal request for those comments in early February, and the request bounced around for three weeks before landing in Erickson’s inbox.
Erickson initially said it would take two months to comply with the request, ostensibly to allow time to redact comments that revealed personal information. She then agreed to release the emails on April 9 — two weeks after the Legislature had concluded almost all of its work.

But Kansas Reflector independently obtained copies of more than 1,500 of the public comments in advance of their official release. Nearly all of the comments were antithetical to the committee’s work, and some of the comments questioned the committee’s existence.
“What are you doing? Have you not, as an elected representative, practiced efficiency in all the bills you have introduced and votes you have taken? Give me a break. COGE is not necessary bureaucracy,” wrote Christopher Berg, of Kansas City, Kansas.
Kansas Reflector didn’t verify the names provided with submissions.
Max Kautsch, a First Amendment attorney, wrote in a column for Kansas Reflector that Erickson had make a mockery of open records law by delaying the release of public comments.
“The real reason for her delay became clear: The portal was a repository for criticism of the supermajority’s legislative agenda, and it was in the supermajority’s interest to keep that fact from the public for as long as possible,” Kautsch wrote.
Erickson told the Committee to Protect Journalists that allegations she mishandled open records requests were “patently false,” but Holscher said “there’s no doubt” Erickson violated the Kansas Open Records Act by not turning the comments over in a reasonable amount of time. Holscher said she didn’t even get access to the records, which could have informed the committee’s work, until the end of March, in the final days of the session.
“I think they were just trying to run out the clock of session, honestly,” Holscher said. “And really, I think it’s because the suggestions that were received showed that this Legislature is very much out of step with the will of the people.”
The comments included complaints about Republican lawmakers’ attacks on transgender Kansans and reproductive rights, as well as their failure to expand Medicaid or legalize marijuana.
Holscher declined to identify her favorite public comments, as so many were shockingly profane.
“Well, it’s a family podcast,” she said. “I don’t know if I can share some of those. I will say there were some that were very pointed in terms of their feelings about this Legislature and the direction that this committee was going.”
A multitude of people who submitted comments through the portal took aim at Masterson, the Senate president who created the committee.
They questioned Masterson’s lucrative Koch-funded post at Wichita State University, his generous use of hair gel, and blockage of medicinal marijuana bills.
“Get Ty Masterson to quit being a chode and allow legalized marijuana to be grown and sold in Kansas,” wrote an individual who identified themself as Blake F, of Wichita. “It’s like printing money, but that d*** tickler keeps c***blocking a slam dunk.”
Jason Young, of Lawrence, directed his comment to Masterson and other GOP leaders: “Quit swinging from Trump’s nuts and spending all of our hard earned Kansans money on election denying lawsuits and worrying about who f***ing uses what restroom.”
  Numerous comments to the online COGE portal made fun of Senate President Ty Masterson, seen here during the April 10, 2025, veto session. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Other comments submitted through the online portal directly addressed the existence of COGE and the work Musk is doing through the federal counterpart, known as DOGE.
“Seriously, government would be more efficient if it didn’t waste its time and our money on things as obviously stupid as this portal,” wrote Matt Paul, of Wichita.
Noreen Carrocci, also of Wichita, said the Legislature shouldn’t do what Musk and DOGE were doing, which she described as “dismantling the government in a chaotic fashion with NO strategic thinking or planning.”
“If you decide you want to legally audit departments then do so transparently and thoughtfully, and consult the professionals in the respective departments,” she wrote. “What is happening at the federal level is illegal, immoral, and tragic. Let’s not follow that kind of leadership here in Kansas.”
Holscher said the Legislature should pay attention to comments that complained about the legislative process. Several people said committees should provide a three-day window to submit testimony on bills, or complained about the “gut and go” process, in which lawmakers at the end of the session “amend” a bill by inserting the contents of other bills, sometimes including ones that received no hearing.
And she noted that Republicans failed to deliver on their campaign promises to provide property tax relief. Instead, they passed another plan to lower income taxes.
“They have a supermajority,” Holscher said. “They can pass whatever they want. If they really wanted to get property tax relief, they could have.”

The Mezzanine Gallery in Wilmington has unveiled a powerful new exhibition by Delaware artist Shefon N. Taylor, whose mixed-media collages delve into the complex terrain of memory, beauty, and cultural identity.
Titled “The Fragment Holds More Than the Whole,” the solo show runs through May 30 and opened with a public reception on May 2.
Taylor, known for her innovative use of archival material, reimagines traditional concepts of wholeness and restoration through what she calls “archival abstraction.”
Using found imagery from vintage books and magazines, tracing paper, and thread, her work challenges how memory and history are visually and culturally preserved.

“This body of work interrogates the visual archive’s limitations and its entanglement with Black history and beauty,” Taylor said. “By working with fragments—partial, severed, obscured—I aim to honor the spaces where meaning survives outside of traditional notions of wholeness. Fragmentation isn’t failure; it’s a different kind of remembering.”
Inspired by author Toni Morrison’s idea of “rememory”—the act of reconstructing personal and collective memory—Taylor’s collages emphasize the power of the partial and the unseen.
Rather than piecing fragments back into a neat whole, her compositions highlight what remains unresolved, inviting viewers to reflect on what is left out of official narratives.
One of the exhibition’s signature pieces, “A fragment of ‘She touched my shoulder like she knew me’,” embodies Taylor’s poetic approach to materials.
Layers of fragile paper and stitched lines intersect around a single moment, simultaneously intimate and elusive.
Taylor’s work has appeared in national outlets including “Essence,” “Grazia,” and “Harper’s Bazaar,” and she has held fellowships at The Delaware Contemporary and The Winterthur Museum.
The Mezzanine Gallery, located in the Carvel State Office Building at 820 N. French Street, is open to the public Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. It regularly features exhibitions from Delaware’s Individual Artist Fellows.

(Photo by Aramelle Wheeler for KFF Health News)Food bank shortages caused by high demand and cuts to federal aid programs have some residents of a small community that straddles Idaho and Nevada growing their own food to get by.
For those living in Duck Valley, a reservation of about 1,000 people that is home to the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes, there’s just one grocery store where prices are too high for many to afford, said Brandy Bull Chief, local director of a federal food distribution program for tribes. The next-closest grocery stores are more than 100 miles away in Mountain Home, Idaho, and Elko, Nevada. And the local food bank’s troubles are mirrored by many nationwide, squeezed between growing need and shrinking aid.
Reggie Premo, a community outreach specialist at the University of Nevada-Reno Extension, grew up cattle ranching and farming alfalfa in Duck Valley. He runs workshops to teach residents to grow produce. Premo said he has seen increased interest from tribal leaders in the state worried about high costs while living in food deserts.
“We’re just trying to bring back how it used to be in the old days,” Premo said, “when families used to grow gardens.”
Food bank managers across the country say their supplies have been strained by rising demand since the COVID pandemic-era emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits ended two years ago and steepening food prices. Now, they say, demand is compounded by recent cuts in federal funding to food distribution programs that supply staple food items to pantries nationwide.
In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut $500 million from the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which buys food from domestic producers and sends it to pantries nationwide. The program has supplied more than 20% of the distributions by Feeding America, a nonprofit that serves a network of more than 200 food banks and 60,000 meal programs.
The collision between rising demand and falling support is especially problematic for rural communities, where the federal program might cover 50% or more of food supplied to those in need, said Vince Hall, chief government relations officer of Feeding America. Deepening the challenge for local food aid organizations is an additional $500 million the Trump administration slashed from the USDA Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which helped state, tribal, and territorial governments buy fresh food from nearby producers.
“The urgency of this crisis cannot be overstated,” Hall said, adding that the Emergency Food Assistance Program is “rural America’s hunger lifeline.”
Farmers who benefited from the USDA programs that distributed their products to food banks and schools will also be affected. Bill Green is executive director for the Southeast region of Common Market, a nonprofit that connects farmers with organizations in the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast, Texas, and the Great Lakes. Green said his organization won’t be able to fill the gap left by the federal cuts, but he hopes some schools and other institutions will continue buying from those farmers even after the federal support dries up.
“I think that that food access challenge has only been aggravated, and I think we just found the tip of the iceberg on that,” he said.
Food Bank for the Heartland in Omaha, Nebraska, for example, is experiencing four times the demand this year than in 2018, according to Stephanie Sullivan, its assistant director of marketing and communications. The organization expects to provide food to 580,000 households across the 93 counties it serves in Nebraska and western Iowa this fiscal year, the highest number in its history, she said.
“These numbers should be a wake-up call for all of us,” Sullivan said.
The South Plains Food Bank in Texas projects it will distribute approximately 121,000 food boxes this year to people in need across the 19 counties it serves, compared with an average 90,000 annually before the pandemic. CEO Dina Jeffries said the organization now is serving about 25% more people, while shouldering the burden of decreased funding and food products.
In Nevada, the food bank that helps serve communities in the northern part of the state, including the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck Valley Reservation, provides food to an average of 160,000 people per month. That’s a 76% increase over its clientele before the pandemic, and the need continues to rise, said Jocelyn Lantrip, director of marketing and communications for the Food Bank of Northern Nevada.
Lantrip said one of the most troubling things for the food bank is that the USDA commodities shipped for local distribution often are foods that donations don’t usually cover — things like eggs, dairy, and meat.
“That’s really valuable food to our neighbors,” she said. “Protein is very difficult to replace.”
Forty percent of people who sought assistance from food banks during the pandemic did so for the first time, Hall said. “Many of those families have come to see their neighborhood food bank not as a temporary resource for emergency help but an essential component of their monthly budget equation.”
About 47 million people lived in food-insecure households in 2023, the most recent USDA data available.
Bull Chief, who also runs a small food pantry on the Duck Valley Reservation, said workers drive to Elko to pick up food distributed by the Food Bank of Northern Nevada. But sometimes there’s not much to choose from. In March, the food pantry cut down its operation to just two weeks a month. She said sometimes they must weigh whether it’s worth spending money on gas to pick up a small amount of food.
When the food pantry opened in 2020, Bull Chief said, it helped 10 to 20 households a month. That number is 60 or more now, made up of a broad range of community members — teens fresh out of high school and living on their own, elders, and people who don’t have permanent housing or jobs. She said providing even small amounts of food can help households make ends meet between paychecks or SNAP benefit deposits.
“Whatever they need to get to survive for the month,” Bull Chief said.
Pinched food banks, elevated need, and federal cuts mean there’s very little resiliency in the system, Hall said. Additional challenges, like an economic slowdown, policy changes to SNAP or other federal nutrition programs, or natural disasters could render food banks unable to meet needs “because they are stretched to the breaking point right now.”
A proposed budget resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in April would require $1.7 trillion in net funding cuts, and anti-hunger advocates fear SNAP could be a target. More people living in rural parts of the country rely on SNAP than people in urban areas because of higher poverty rates, so they would be disproportionately affected.
An extension of the federal 2018 Farm Bill, which lasts until Sept. 30, included about $450 million for the Emergency Food Assistance Program for this year. But the funding that remains doesn’t offset the cuts, Hall said. He hopes lawmakers pass a new farm bill this year with enough money to do so.
“We don’t have a food shortage,” he said. “We have a shortage of political will.”

Steve Wills is Ameren Missouri’s senior director of regulatory affairs and said the company is pleased the Public Service Commission approved the settlement, calling it “fair and constructive.”
“We understand that it’s never a good time to raise rates … but we’ve made very significant improvements in our system that will enhance the reliability and the resilience of the system,” Wills said.
Ameren estimates the new prices will result in bills going up $14 per month for the average user. The approved rate increase enables Ameren to collect an additional $335 million dollars annually, which is $91 million less per year than the company initially requested.
Utilities are what’s called “regulated” or “natural” monopolies — in exchange for being the sole provider of utility service in a specified area, the companies are subject to state oversight.
Utilities must ask the Missouri Public Service Commission — the state agency that regulates investor-owned utilities — for approval to increase the prices it charges the public. Ameren filed the rate case in June 2024, which started an 11-month regulatory process.
“We spend a lot of time talking about the various issues and understanding each party’s position and try to find a middle ground that reflects a fair return for the investments that we’ve made to serve customers,” Wills said.
Ameren Missouri initially asked state regulators for permission to raise electricity rates by 15.77% — which would have resulted in an estimated average monthly bill increase of about $17.45.
Utility representatives say the additional revenue is necessary to recoup costs of “major system upgrades” and “cleaner” generation investments.
The new rates are scheduled to take effect June 1.
Michael Sykuta is an economist with the MU Financial Research Institute and said utility price hikes are a reflection of the broader economy.
“We’ve all experienced inflationary pressures in the things that we buy in our household budgets,” he said. “Companies across the board, not just utilities, are facing those same inflationary pressures for the equipment they have to buy, for the salaries they pay, for their other operating expenses.”
John Coffman, an attorney for the Consumers Council of Missouri, a consumer advocacy group that was involved in the settlement negotiations, said he thinks the agreement is fair.
“All the parties felt like they got something valuable out of the deal,” he said. “I mean it’s nothing to celebrate that we have these double digit increases, but we are happy about the way it was applied and some of the other guarantees we have going forward.”
According to the organization, the Consumers Council advocated for elements of the deal relating to low-income bill assistance, community solar power and assurance that Ameren is not allowed to charge customers for costs to mitigate pollution from the Rush Island power plant — which the company was ordered to do by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers, Renew Missouri, AARP and other organizations were also involved in the settlement.
Multiple public hearings were held throughout Ameren Missouri’s electric case. Lindsey Phoenix is an attorney living in Jefferson City who testified before the commission in January, sharing her opinion that a price hike was not justified.
Upon hearing of the settlement Thursday, Phoenix said she was disappointed with the results.
“The issue wasn’t how much of an increase they needed. The issue that everyone was there discussing was that they didn’t need one,” she said.
Phoenix, among other members of the public who testified, stressed the economic pressures many people find themselves in and how utility bill increases compound those challenges.
“I am an attorney, and my spouse is a teacher, and we are living paycheck to paycheck,” Phoenix said.
Ameren’s Wills encourages customers who are feeling squeezed to inquire about energy efficiency programs that could lower their costs.
“For those who are really struggling with the rates at a higher level, please reach out to us because we have energy assistance options available,” he said. “We have opportunities for flexible payments arrangements, budget billing and various sources of grants that we can either provide or connect customers with.”
Ameren provides electric service to much of mid-Missouri and has approximately 1.2 million electric customers in the state. The company also provides gas service for some communities, including Columbia and Jefferson City. The utility is in the middle of an ongoing rate case for gas prices.
 Shifting energy industry policies

Missouri utility rate cases are taking place while energy policies on the federal and state level are shifting.
Last month, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed a bill into law that affords utilities a variety of new financial accounting practices. The legislation includes a policy called “construction work in progress” that enables energy companies to earn revenue on power plants as they build them and before they generate any electricity.
Ameren representatives have said the bill is an important tool that could help them build new power plants, including nuclear, to meet increasing electric demand.
“We’re having to retire older facilities and build new facilities,” Wills said. “I think what some of the legislation did was try to streamline Missouri’s processes a little bit around future generation planning.”
On the federal level, President Donald Trump has signed a variety of executive orders since taking office aimed at prioritizing the fossil fuel industry, including one last month that targets increased coal production.
MU’s Sykuta said the most recent executive order could help extend the life of Missouri’s coal power plants. However, Trump’s attempts to rescind energy funds from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act could slow down investment in wind and solar as well as upgrades to the transmission grid — ultimately resulting in price increases for customers.
“Consumers pay higher costs when transmission is more congested,” Sykuta said. “A lot of that infrastructure development has been started or planned with the idea of using the IRA funding — and with the IRA funding going away some of that investment is not going to happen.”
Jenn DeRose is a campaign organizer for the Sierra Club’s “Beyond Coal” campaign that aims to get utilities to close coal plants and transition to renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
The Sierra Club was an “intervenor,” or party to the Ameren electric rate case. DeRose said rural Missourians, low-income individuals, and people of color are most likely to face high energy burdens.
DeRose calls the rate case process “very opaque and difficult to understand.” Her role throughout the case was to encourage members of the public to participate.
“The number one thing that anybody can do is advocate,” she said. “Utilities, public service commissioners, they need to know the impacts of their decisions on regular people. They need to know what this looks like, and they need to know that they are responsible for creating solutions.”
The Ameren rate increase comes at a particularly challenging time, DeRose said, as summer cooling needs result in higher monthly bills and the Trump administration just fired the federal staff that administers the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
“LIHEAP is a critical program that helps people pay their heating and cooling bills, and it is essential to keeping people connected to services, but also, more broadly, it’s essential to keeping people in their homes,” DeRose said. “We know that disconnections lead to evictions.”

Five months after Democratic legislative leaders urged their colleagues to focus on bills that would make California more affordable, lawmakers don’t have much to show for it.
As CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu explains, last week Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas of Salinas unveiled four new select committees — which are essentially working groups tasked with addressing specific policies — to tackle what Rivas said are the “biggest cost drivers for Californians.” The committees will take aim at:

Lowering the cost of child care;
Making food more affordable;
Making housing more affordable;
Reviewing the effectiveness of California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which some argue leads to higher gas prices.

The committees, however, won’t meet until June. In the meantime, Rivas has backed a handful of measures that would speed up housing construction. Senate Democrats also unveiled three bills last week to lower energy costs, increase housing supplies and expand job training.
But some analysts question whether the state can legislate its way out of its most intractable issues — especially while President Donald Trump’s tariffs are increasing prices and have the potential to upend various California industries.

Garry South, longtime Democratic strategist: “(The bills) all sound good on the surface, but I don’t think there’s any predictability that if any of them pass, or all pass, that all of a sudden we are going to be out of the housing crisis in California.”

Speaking of the Legislature: A bill that would make soliciting minors for sex a felony embroiled Democratic lawmakers in controversy last week, after the bill’s author, Assemblymember Maggy Krell, objected to changes that would exclude soliciting older minors who are 16 and 17 years old. Some Democrats and criminal justice reform advocates argue that the provision would punish older teenagers in consenting relationships. 
But Republicans, as well as a few other Democrats including Krell, say those concerns are largely hypothetical, and that prosecutors wouldn’t spend time charging teenagers for having consensual sex. Read more from CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.

Wildfire survivors still waiting on claims

After deadly wildfires tore through Los Angeles County in January, survivors are alleging that State Farm is delaying or denying property insurance claims, and they’re calling for the state’s insurance chief to investigate, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.
Last week California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara sent a letter to the company’s chief executive, asking for a copy of State Farm’s standards for reviewing and processing smoke damage claims. Lara also asked State Farm to commit to covering at least 75% of survivors’ personal property without having claimants submit detailed inventories of their belongings. The company has until Friday to respond to Lara’s letter.
Meanwhile, California homeowners are suing State Farm and other insurers, accusing the companies of conspiring against policyholders after the wildfires. State Farm is also awaiting approval from an administrative law judge for its request for temporary emergency rate increases after receiving the initial green light from Lara in March.
A State Farm spokesperson said the company has received roughly 12,500 claims related to the fires, and have paid over $3.12 billion to customers. It estimates it will pay more than $7 billion in claims from the L.A.-area fires.

University of California looks to Texas for new leader

From CalMatters higher education reporter Mikhail Zinshteyn:
California and Texas are contrasts in the country’s culture and political wars, but are also home to two of the nation’s most prominent public university systems. So it’s no wonder that a vacancy in California is filled by a Texan.On Friday the Board of Regents of the University of California voted to hire the chancellor of the University of Texas system, James B. Milliken, as the next president of the UC. His base salary will be $1,475,000. The current president, Michael V. Drake, said last year he’d step down July, 2025. Milliken takes the job in August.Milliken brings higher-education governance experience in politically liberal and conservative states, having led the large and economically diverse City University of New York, which includes numerous community colleges. That diversity of contexts will likely benefit his tenure as UC’s leader: He must navigate the pressures of a largely progressive California Legislature that seeks access to more low-income students at the UC while also facing the Trump administration’s deep scrutiny of the nation’s universities’ practices and missions, including the UC’s.Milliken sought to address those pressures last Friday, without mentioning the political climate by name.

Milliken, to regents after his appointment: “Talent is not determined by zip code, national origin, race, gender or wealth. But too often, over history, opportunity has been. Education, and particularly public higher education, is the most effective bridge we have found to connect talent and opportunity.”

Ed Lammi
Ed Lammi is a former executive vice president of production for Sony Pictures Television. He retired in 2023 after 36 years at Sony.


Once upon a time, Hollywood wasn’t just a neighborhood. It was the beating heart of film and television production in North America. But over the last two decades, the bright lights of Los Angeles have dimmed. 
It’s not for lack of talent or vision, but because other cities and countries seized an opportunity and offered better tax incentives to lure the industry away. 
This exodus has hit California hard. Over the past few decades, Southern California lost thousands of production jobs. These are middle-class workers: set builders, costume designers, grips, gaffers, editors, caterers, drivers, camera operators and more. These are Californians who pay state income taxes, send their kids to local schools and spend their money at local businesses. 
They represent the backbone of this industry and we let them slip away. California can’t risk losing what we’ve worked for a century to build.
Much has been said about Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposal to increase the California Film & Television Tax Credit Program to $750 million annually — and it is absolutely necessary. But we also need the changes that have been proposed in Assembly Bill 1138 and Senate Bill 630. Namely increasing the credit to 35% of expenses to more competitively align with other states.
Additionally, qualifying half-hour comedies is an important addition. Comedies that were once primarily sitcoms shot on Hollywood sound stages are now more likely to be shot single-camera style, similar to movies and dramas. They can be set up to shoot in locations with favorable tax credits. 
Case in point: when I was still at Sony Pictures TV, we shot “Cobra Kai” in suburban Atlanta — due in large part to Georgia’s production incentives qualifying half-hour comedies. Ironically, the reboot TV series was inspired by the 1984 feature film “The Karate Kid,” which was creatively set in the San Fernando Valley. 
California must go further. Although the issue of including above-the-line cost is somewhat controversial, some version is necessary to compete with states that offer it. A potential solution is to qualify only the scale portion of fees paid to above-the-line talent. This would solve the concern that a few highly paid performers would allow a production to get an outsized amount from the tax credit fund. 
It also aligns much more closely with the primary intent of the fund: to qualify basic, scale-wage workers.
Every show that shoots in California supports hundreds of jobs. It pumps money into local economies from lumber yards to restaurants, from car rentals to dry cleaners. This is why other places created tax credit programs of their own. They recognize that production spending is good economic development policy, generating a return on investment many times the amount of the credit. In Los Angeles, every dollar of film and television tax credit allocated generates $1.07 in state and local tax revenue and raises local wages by $8.60. 
Our crews have weathered a lot in recent years: a pandemic, two major strikes, a steep industry contraction and now the recent L.A. fires. They are eager for consistent, sustainable work.
My wife and I moved to California in 1979 to work in this business. We built a life, a family and a future here. I want that opportunity to remain for the next generation of Californians. No one should have to leave California in pursuit of the Hollywood dream.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/111924_Barry-Keoghan_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 09:06:14.496902

Insurance department investigates State Farm over Los Angeles fire survivors’ smoke damage claims as insurer awaits approval of rate increase.


Rossana Valverde’s Pasadena home of 35 years is still standing after Los Angeles County’s devastating January fires — but more than 100 days later, she and her husband still can’t move back in.
That’s because they’re waiting for their insurer, State Farm, to approve and process their claims. 
“We were lucky our house made it through,” Valverde said. “At first we thought unscathed. But it definitely still smells like smoke. The windowsills have a thick layer of black ash and soot.”
After getting their home tested for toxins, they discovered it contains high levels of arsenic, lead and nickel. The cleaning, repair and replacement costs for their hardwood floors, carpet, appliances and more total upwards of $300,000, per some written estimates she shared with CalMatters as well as her own estimates of costs to replace things like their bed and upholstered furniture.
So far, she and her husband have received about $40,000 from State Farm but are having trouble getting the insurance company’s adjuster to respond promptly to their requests for more.
She said the company’s adjuster — the second one they were assigned — hardly returns emails and phone calls from her or the public adjuster she’s enlisted for help. 
“He pulls this ‘I didn’t receive it’ BS and then when I press him he suddenly finds it,” she said.
She is not alone. There are so many complaints, including a lawsuit, about State Farm delaying or denying claims after the LA-area fires, especially related to smoke damage, that fire survivors, three state lawmakers and others have asked Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to investigate. They pointed out that the company is awaiting approval for its request to raise its rates on an emergency interim basis and urged Lara to rescind his conditional approval. An administrative law judge is expected to decide on the rate hike soon.
The Insurance Department routinely investigates insurance companies’ response to disasters, which can lead to deeper examinations of their conduct and millions of dollars of additional payments. But this time around, State Farm is facing complaints as it happens to be seeking to raise its rates an average 17% for homeowners.
Under growing pressure to investigate, Lara sent a letter to State Farm Chief Executive Dan Krause last week, asking for details about how the company is handling claims. In the letter seen by CalMatters, Lara asked for a copy of the insurer’s standards for reviewing, investigating and processing smoke damage claims. He also asked State Farm to commit to providing at least 75% of contents coverage without requiring an inventory from fire survivors — the company had raised what it pays out in advance contents coverage from 50% to 65%. The commissioner set a May 9 deadline for a written response from the company.

In an interview, Lara told CalMatters that he also spoke with Krause by phone about the letter. He said he asked Krause if State Farm could maintain a visible, physical presence in the area as customers continue to need help with claims and disaster recovery centers close.
“He’s going to look at keeping a presence in Eaton and Palisades,” Lara said.
When asked whether he planned to tie State Farm’s handling of claims to the company’s request to raise its rates, the commissioner said: “I’m going to see what they respond, then move accordingly.”
Lara said he has to consider that State Farm is California’s biggest insurer, and that it has millions of customers in the state. “I want to be clear to the Legislature,” he said. “I’m balancing all the facts.”
State Sen. Sasha Renee Perez, a Democrat representing Padadena who co-wrote the letter asking Lara to investigate State Farm and withhold a rate increase, told CalMatters: “Everybody realizes we’re in a home insurance crisis. (Nobody is) saying there should never be a rate increase.” But she said her constituents have been good customers who “feel like they’ve been left in the cold.”
State Farm spokesperson Sevag Sarkissian did not answer questions about Lara’s letter to Krause or his requests of the company. CalMatters also asked about policyholder complaints. Sarkissian sent the following response by email: “We’re here to help our customers recover and we empathize with those who are rebuilding their lives. We’ve received approximately 12,500 total claims related to the fires and have paid over $3.12 billion to our customers.” 
State Farm has said it expects to pay more than $7 billion in claims from the LA-area blazes.
‘A longstanding fight’ about smoke damage
It’s unclear how many State Farm customers are complaining about the company’s handling of claims, especially about smoke damage coverage. The insurance department would not disclose exactly how many such complaints it has fielded, with spokesperson Michael Soller saying only that the complaints are in line with State Farm’s market share in California, which is about 20%. Soller said the complaints are ongoing and that complaint data is posted annually.
But a group of LA-area fire survivors of the Eaton Fire has a website with at least a couple of hundred detailed — though unverified — complaints, which Perez and other lawmakers cited in their letter to Lara.
That doesn’t surprise attorney Amy Bach, the president of San Francisco-based United Policyholders, a national nonprofit organization that advocates for insurance customers. She co-founded the group in 1991, the same year the Oakland Hills fire exposed insurance-coverage problems for survivors. 
Bach said smoke damage has been part of “a longstanding fight.” Smoke damage’s effects can seem less obvious than fire damage, and appears to be one of the factors in LA-area fire survivors having trouble with their claims.
She said the more she finds out about the effects of smoke damage,  the more she thinks insurers need to better handle related claims. 
Bach and her group now advise policyholders to make sure they get their homes tested by an industrial hygienist before cleaning, adding that if their insurer won’t agree to pay for it at first, they should get it done anyway and try to get compensated afterward.
“You have to figure out what you’re dealing with,” she said. “There’s too much at stake: your family’s health, your property value.”

A  California appeals court ruling in February could affect insurance coverage of soot and ash claims. It held that wildfire debris doesn’t necessarily mean direct physical loss or damage.
Bach was one of several advocates who recently submitted letters in an attempt to depublish — or strike from the record — the decision by the California 2nd District Court of Appeal. She said she doesn’t want insurance companies to be able to point to that court decision as a reason to deny smoke claims.
But last week, the California Supreme Court rejected the depublication requests by Bach and other consumer advocates. They included Consumer Watchdog and Consumer Federation of America, plus an association of public insurance adjusters and a couple of consumer attorneys groups. 
The groups that opposed depublication included American Property Casualty Insurance Association and other insurance groups, as well as the FAIR Plan — the fire insurance provider of last resort in California.
Just like State Farm has been accused of delaying claims and payments related to smoke damage, so has the FAIR Plan. LA fire victims sued the FAIR Plan, State Farm and other insurers over smoke damage claims earlier this month.
The FAIR Plan did not immediately return CalMatters’ requests for answers about its policies on  smoke damage.
In March, Lara issued a bulletin regarding smoke damage claims. It said insurance companies should not take the February court ruling to mean they are off the hook for such claims.
The commissioner told CalMatters last week that he is working with the governor’s office and public health officials on establishing statewide standards for smoke damage remediation — of cleaning up and stopping environmental damage. Those standards could help inform insurance policy requirements, but spokesperson Soller said the insurance department has no further details to share yet.
A spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said the commissioner has requested technical support for the effort.
Other fire survivors speak out
In Altadena, Andrew Wessels is also dealing with delays from State Farm. He and his family are now on their seventh temporary home since the fire because the insurer has not approved their request for long-term housing. 
They have relied on friends, a hotel and three Airbnbs, for which they pay the rent out of pocket.
They started submitting receipts to State Farm in January, he said. As of now, they have received about $25,000 of $40,000 in reimbursements they have requested.
They have gotten their home tested and found high levels of lead and possibly chlorine gas exposure — not good for him, his wife and their two children, ages 20 months and 5.
They have requested 100% of their Coverage B, or $355,650, because Wessels said their personal goods are a total loss. He asked the company for the money up front, without having to continue submitting receipts.

Wessels said he and his family are “blocked from the ability to rebuild.” He joined other Eaton Fire survivors at a press conference last month, where several State Farm policyholders called on the insurance commissioner to reject the company’s request to raise its premiums on an emergency interim basis until it takes care of their claims.
Another survivor, Gail Jamentz, spoke with CalMatters on April 25, sounding discouraged because she said she hadn’t heard from State Farm since February. 
“I submitted my claim status Jan. 11,” she said. “I can’t go to FEMA because I don’t have a claim status.”
Photos the survivors group shared with the media show her home is standing but badly burned, with its roof caved in. She needed State Farm to declare it a total loss. She called the inside of her home “toxic soup.” 
“There’s no roof, it’s been raining, it’s all mush inside,” Jamentz said. 
Thursday, she told the Eaton Fire survivors group on Discord that State Farm had finally agreed to let her claim her home as a total loss.
“I have to give you all credit in helping expedite this process these last few weeks as I really think our press conference helped move things along,” Jamentz wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/042625_EatonFireInsurance_JAJ_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 09:06:14.496902

It’s been five months since California’s legislative leaders deemed affordability an “urgent” issue for the session. So far: committees, bills, but few results


In December, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas assigned his members an “urgent” task: Make California cheaper to live in.
“Californians are deeply anxious. They are anxious about our state’s cost of living,” he told his colleagues in the wake of an election where concerns about the economy were top of mind for voters. “We must chart a new path forward and renew the California dream by focusing on affordability.”
Five months later, the state Legislature has little to show for it.
Just last week, Rivas announced four new “select committees” tasked with pitching ideas to lower the cost of housing, fuel, child care and food, but they won’t meet until June, and Rivas did not specify when he expects legislation from the committees. Some of the lawmakers assigned to chair them say they want to develop “practical” solutions but did not articulate what those would be. 
Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, has also backed a slate of measures, most of which aim to ease restrictions on housing construction, but few have reached the Assembly floor for a vote.
Similarly, Senate Democrats unveiled just three legislative proposals as their “opening salvo” to affordability last week, focusing on reducing energy costs, increasing housing supplies and boosting job training. 
While the Legislature is just starting to zoom in on affordability, prices are rising rapidly as a result of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff policies and groceries could get more expensive.

Economic justice advocates argue that Californians need immediate relief. Anya Svanoe, communications director for the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, said renters are still feeling the pinch. 
“Putting together a committee that comes together months from now that won’t even do anything until the following year does not seem to me that (lawmakers) are treating it with real urgency,” she said.
Democratic leaders told CalMatters good policies take time to develop. They noted that lawmakers had to shift their focus earlier this year to Los Angeles wildfire victims and counter Trump’s policies, and it took time to onboard freshman lawmakers. 
“I have never been one to simply do something to get clicks or make headlines. I want substance and impact,” Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire said in an interview. “My philosophy is: Do it right, not fast.” 
Rivas spokesperson Nick Miller also said the select committees — essentially working groups established to tackle niche policies — will allow lawmakers to gather more public input and drill down on specific issues during the summer recess without feeling swamped by the regular legislative schedule.
Some analysts are skeptical that any proposals could actually make California more affordable, anyway. Garry South, a longtime Democratic strategist, said affordability is a problem “too large for legislative solution,” especially when compounded by Trump’s tariff policies.
“It’s political optics to some degree,” South said. “(The bills) all sound good on the surface, but I don’t think there’s any predictability that if any of them pass, or all pass, that all of a sudden we are going to be out of the housing crisis in California.”
Tackling the ‘biggest cost drivers’
Rivas said that the select committees will tackle the “biggest cost drivers for Californians.” 
The committees will focus on four areas: Lowering the cost of child care for babies to 3 year-olds; making food more affordable and enrolling more people in CalFresh, the state’s food stamp program; exploring financing options for affordable housing; and examining the effectiveness of the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a clean energy incentive program that some argue could raise gas prices. 
Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Suisun City Democrat who chairs the Assembly Transportation Committee and will chair the select committee on fuel, said lawmakers have had a packed calendar.
“How could you even fit these types of conversations at the same time we are actively doing committees?” said Wilson, who sits on six different committees.
Lawmakers don’t need a new committee to develop solutions, because they are already introducing proposals in the current legislative session, said Mike Gatto, a former Los Angeles Democratic assemblymember who chaired the appropriations committee.
“Every single member of the Legislature has a pretty good understanding of what is causing this affordability problem in the state of California,” he said. “This information is out there.”
Select committees have traditionally been used to “give individual lawmakers who care about an issue … greater portfolio and greater exposure,” Gatto said. But he said they’re rarely effective. 
“I don’t think too many veteran Capitol watchers can recall a select committee that produced significant results on an important issue,” he said.
But Miller pointed to last year’s select committee on retail theft last year, which produced laws to clamp down on organized shoplifting and toughen penalties on property thefts.
Proposals largely focused on housing
Optics or not, state Democrats’ affordability agenda appears clearer than a few months ago. 
Led by Rivas, a strong ally of the YIMBY movement, Assembly Democrats are pressing for fewer regulations in exchange for quicker, more abundant new construction they argue would ultimately lower housing costs. 
Lawmakers in early April approved a four-bill package to expedite building by streamlining the approval process for new housing and halting most changes to building standards for six years. One proposal would allow renters to take in people at risk of homelessness as long as their landlords agree.

“These bills will alter the trajectory of the housing crisis,” Rivas said in a statement. 
Later that month, Rivas said he supported nine other “affordability” measures on housing, wage theft and broadband. One of them, introduced by Oakland Democrat Buffy Wicks, a major supporter of easing construction restrictions, would exempt most urban housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act, making it all but impossible for environmentalists to sue to block developments. 
Most of the housing proposals Rivas signed off on represent much more technical changes, though, such as making it easier to build farmworker housing, making agencies approve developments more quickly and standardizing the housing project application process. 
It’s hard to know if any of those measures will lead to more housing construction, much less if they will make housing cheaper, said Bill Fulton, former director of planning and economic development for the city of San Diego and a fellow at the University of California-Berkeley Terner Center for Housing Innovation.
“In spite of the fact that all those bills have passed (in past years), we have not seen overall housing production increase very much or overall housing affordability go down very much,” Fulton said. 
“The Legislature passed lots and lots and lots and lots of laws … without actually doing a careful analysis of what’s working and what’s not, and they continue to pass more laws.” 
Fulton said other factors discouraging building in California include the high cost of labor and building materials and high interest rates, which are not addressed by the current raft of housing bills.
Svanoe, who champions tenant protections, said state lawmakers are streamlining housing  development while doing little to make rent affordable. She supports Assembly Bill 1157, a progressive proposal to lower the cap on rent increases. Faced with pressure from YIMBY-aligned Democrats, the measure is now delayed until next year.
“There’s no room to give (on) any rent increase at this point,” Svanoe said. “It’d be the difference between someone staying in their home and someone becoming homeless.”
The housing measure included in the Senate Democrats’ affordability package is much more skeptical of new construction. While Sen. Aisha Wahab’s Senate Bill 681 would streamline some development, it would also restrict landlords from charging extra fees and crack down on homeowners association fees. 
“We’re reinforcing the state’s housing production goals, but not at the expense of the Californians who are barely hanging on,” Wahab, a Fremont Democrat who chairs the Senate Housing Committee, said in the legislative analysis.
A potential showdown looms between Democrats over housing policy — a clash already underway in the Senate.

Assembly Joint Resolution 10, a non-binding statement of support sponsored by Democratic Sen. Sandra Jauregui of Las Vegas, urges the federal government to prioritize the passage of the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act, colloquially known as the Clark County Lands Bill, which would open 25,000 acres of public land in Southern Nevada to development. 
The federal legislation is sponsored by Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto in the Senate and Democrat Susie Lee and Republican Mark Amodei in the House.
Thursday was the first time state lawmakers held a public hearing for the resolution, which drew criticism from conservation groups and Nevada residents who spoke in opposition of the measure. Despite forgoing a public hearing, the bill passed the Assembly in April with only six members opposing it, all Democrats.
During the Senate Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections hearing Thursday, supporters of the measure told lawmakers the release of public land would spur the construction of affordable housing, but critics argued the measure does not guarantee housing affordability and would only encourage unsustainable urban sprawl and exacerbate water scarcity.
Jauregui said there is a severe housing shortage in Nevada, leading to skyrocketing rents and home prices. Jauregui pointed to a 2022 report from Applied Analysis put together for the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association that found the region could exhaust all available land for development in seven years if current construction trends continue.
“This housing epidemic isn’t just about a housing supply shortage, but also a land shortage,” Jauregui said.
Several housing developers and business interests spoke in support of the resolution Thursday, including the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association, Builders Association of Northern Nevada, Nevada State Apartment Association, and the Greater Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce.
The Nevada Republican Party, City of Henderson, Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority and the Nevada Rural Housing Authority also spoke in support of the resolution. 
Nevada faces a shortage of 80,000 affordable rental homes for extremely low-income residents, according to the Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority.
“This is not about unchecked expansion. It’s about strategic, responsible growth that allows our communities to meet the real needs of families, seniors and essential workers,” said Mindy Elliot, a lobbyist speaking on behalf of the Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority and the Nevada Rural Housing Authority.
Jauregui acknowledged that just opening public land to development would not be enough to address rising housing costs in southern Nevada. She advocated for the resolution in combination with other housing bills she is sponsoring, including Assembly Bill 241, which would encourage more infill development in urban areas.
For nearly an hour, advocates and Nevada residents spoke in opposition to the resolution during public comments. Several took the opportunity to castigate Democrats in the Assembly for failing to hold a public hearing before passing the resolution. The Senate panel also came under criticism for scheduling the Thursday hearing at the last minute.
The resolution’s opponents cited concerns about water scarcity, utility costs, urban sprawl, and the urban heat island effect — a phenomenon that creates higher temperatures in cities due to an abundance of superheating man-made surfaces like roads and pavement.
Some residents expressed concern about the financial burden on taxpayers to fund new infrastructure, services, and roads in low-density suburbs if the resolution passed.
During the hearing, critics of the resolution also pointed out that the Clark County Lands Bill does not specifically set aside any land for affordable housing, meaning there is no guarantee any of the released land will result in lower housing costs. 
Jauregui refuted arguments that the Clark County Lands Bill would not create affordable housing, pointing to Ovation Development Corp’s affordable senior housing project being built on land that had belonged to the federal government before it was released to the City of Las Vegas.
“It took five years for this land to transfer from the [Bureau of Land Management]. This new act will streamline the process that allows for these types of affordable housing developments to happen and to happen faster,” Jauregui said.
Organizations opposed to the resolution included the Great Basin Water Network, Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, Sierra Club, Make the Road Nevada, and the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada.
Conservation groups argued that infill development of existing neighborhoods is a better solution than development on parcels sprawling along the metro area’s edges where federal land would be privatized.  Development would exacerbate water scarcity, increase urban sprawl, and worsen housing inequities. 
Housing, or warehousing?
An analysis by the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada found that around 80,000 acres of vacant or underused land in Southern Nevada’s urban core — more acreage than the entire City of Henderson — could be developed for housing near public transit and existing infrastructure.
Olivia Taniger, the director of the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter, argued the resolution would undermine attempts to promote infill and public transportation development.
“Folks don’t want housing out in Jean. They don’t want resources taken away from their communities in East Las Vegas when folks already struggle to get around on public transportation,” Tangier said.
She argued much of the public land released by the Clark County Lands Bill would likely be sold for warehouses and manufacturing rather than housing. 
Kyle Roerink, the executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, highlighted the cost of urban sprawl on water resources in the state. Roerink pointed to research that the Colorado River’s flow has shrunk by about 20% since 2000, with further declines projected due to climate change.
“Are you willing to tell your constituents that you support inviting another 800,000 people to the region with Lake Mead sitting at 33 percent full? That’s what you need to consider with this legislation,” Roerink said.
A joint study by Clark County and the City of Henderson found that development under the Clark County Lands Bill could increase daily water demand by 49 million gallons, or about 18% of Nevada’s total allocation from the Colorado River.
Democratic Rep. Dina Titus, who represents much of east Las Vegas and Henderson along with the Las Vegas Strip,  spoke out against the Clark County Lands Bill to state legislators last month.
No action was taken on the resolution. The resolution will need to pass in the State Senate by May 23 before being sent to the governor’s desk for final approval. 
Unlike bills, Nevada resolutions don’t require approval from the governor. But Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has repeatedly  advocated the sale of federally managed lands to developers. Last month, Lombardo signed a data sharing agreement with the Bureau of Land Management to help facilitate the privatization of federal land.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4765-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

(Photo by Alex Potemkin/Getty Images)Utah is set to become the first state in the nation to ban fluoride in drinking water, with a new law taking effect later this week, on Wednesday.
That day, the fluoride taps will turn off, if they haven’t already. While Davis and Salt Lake counties, and Brigham City, are the only governments that still add fluoride to drinking water, roughly half of the state’s population lives there.  
Sponsored by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, HB81 prevents counties and municipalities from adding fluoride to drinking water, while adding it to the list of drugs pharmacists can prescribe. 
The reasoning, Gricius said, is that the decision should be left to the individual. 
“I would just say it doesn’t get more local control than my own body,” she said during the legislative session earlier this year.
RFK Jr. ‘proud’ of Utah’s ban on fluoride in drinking water, hopes other states will follow

Gricius’ bill was one of several that aligned with the “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, agenda promoted by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who praised the law earlier this year. 
Now, for health officials like Stacey Bank, executive medical director for the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, the focus is on educating the public and reminding them that fluoride is now readily available at most pharmacies. 
“I’m grateful for the opportunity to have this conversation. We haven’t talked about oral health and fluoride this much in my career as long as I can remember. This is an opportunity to get the message out to the entire state,” she said on Friday. “I know it’s not always easy to get into a doctor or dentist, there are barriers there. Going to your local pharmacist, talking to the person behind the counter, is enough to take care of your teeth.”
There are currently 25 water systems serving about 1.6 million people spread out across Davis and Salt Lake counties, and Brigham City, that add fluoride to the water. Brigham City has been adding fluoride to the water since the 1960s; Davis County started in 1999; and Salt Lake County in 2003. 
Some treatment plants have already stopped adding fluoride to the water, including a handful in Davis County, and Salt Lake County’s City Creek Water Treatment Plant.

If Utahns don’t act, expect tooth decay, officials say
“If I was looking into a crystal ball, we’re going to see a decline in oral health if our community doesn’t take action, and now go to their dentist and talk about what’s best for them and receive their supplements. If that happens, I don’t think we’ll see much of a change,” said Brian Hatch, director of the Davis County Health Department. 
In Salt Lake County, where the water has been fluoridated for almost two decades, health officials say they’re losing an effective public health tool.  
“From a public health standpoint, we know that community water fluoridation is the best way to benefit individuals and the overall community’s oral health,” added Ron Lund, environmental health director for the Salt Lake County Health Department. “It’s the most efficient and effective way to do that for people who cannot afford or may not be able to go to routine dental visits.” 
But while health officials say it’s possible they’ll see an uptick in cavities in regions currently fluoridating their water, others see the bill as an opportunity. Most of rural Utah has already stopped adding the mineral to the public water supply. 
Fluoride is a hot topic now, and with the May 7 deadline approaching, it gives public health experts a chance to educate communities, they say.

“It’s an opportunity for our more rural communities. Other than Brigham City, none of our rural communities have been adding fluoride to the water. So this is bringing more attention to how important fluoride is and giving them access to get it, that they may not have known they needed,” said State Dental Director Stacey Swilling.
But concern remains. Shifting the responsibility to individuals means Utahns will have to be more proactive about getting fluoride, which could be a burden, especially to low-income families that may already struggle with access to transportation or public health information. 
Swilling, who used to practice dentistry in another state, said it was clear which patients have access to fluoridated water. 
“Anectdoally, where I used to practice, I can tell you I saw a huge difference … There’s plenty of research out there that does show the disparities,” she said, pointing to studies conducted in Juneau, Alaska, and Calgary, Alberta, where the removal of fluoride from drinking water resulted in a spike in cavities. 
Most officials agree — Utah is headed into uncharted waters. While there are case studies in other cities, counties, states and countries, Utah is the first U.S. state to pass a sweeping ban, while also trying to make fluoride more accessible over the counter.  
“We don’t know how this is going to turn out,” Bank said. “We know about barriers to care, that’s our job, to look for and eliminate those. At this point, we’re trying to educate the public. It is going to take a more proactive effort, and we are going to have to look at those barriers and let this unfold to see how those barriers are affecting people.” 
Fluoride is a mineral that has been shown to strengthen teeth by replacing minerals that are lost from acid breakdown, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the 1940s, communities around the country have been fluoridating their water. 
A recent report from the National Toxicology Program found that high levels of fluoride in drinking water can be associated with a lower I.Q. in children, but according to the report, those levels are twice as high as the current recommended amount of fluoride. 
“The thing we need to know about those studies is that they were done looking at fluoride levels that were far outside what we are recommending for oral health,” Bank said. “We know what we’re trying to do today is a safe and effective dose of fluoride.” 
Still, that drop in I.Q. is often cited as a reason to stop adding fluoride to water, part of a nationwide movement against the mineral. Perhaps the most prominent critic of fluoride is Kennedy Jr., who applauded Gricius’ bill during a stop in Utah in April. 
“It makes no sense to have fluoride in our water. The evidence against fluoride is overwhelming … we know that it causes I.Q. loss,” Kennedy, a longtime critic of certain public health policies and medical practices, said during his visit “I’m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban (fluoride). I hope many more will come.” 
Gricius’ bill passed mostly along party lines, with a handful of Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. Despite the pushback from dentists and other health professionals, it was signed by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox on March 27.

(Eric Schultz for Alabama Reflector)A recent survey found significant differences in individual counties’ absentee ballot rejection rates.
The survey of 11 counties by the League of Women Voters found that almost 2,200 ballots — about 3.6% of all absentee ballots cast — were rejected in the counties on Election Day last year.
But those rates could vary considerably. In Madison County, the home of Huntsville, only about 1% of ballots were rejected. In Mobile, the number rose to 8%.

“It is a snapshot of what is really going on with the whole state,” said Kathy Jones, president of the League of Women Voters of Alabama. “When I look at the numbers, from purely a data perspective, my conclusion is that the system has some real flaws in the way that it operates.”
The survey excluded most counties in Alabama, so it is difficult to extrapolate the attrition rate to the rest of the state. The election officials from the various counties surveyed did not state why ballots were excluded.
State law outlines the rules over which absentee ballots must be set aside and not counted, but the Alabama’s Secretary of State’s Office gives county boards of registrars wide latitude for setting policies related to absentee ballots, which can lead to disparities between counties in which absentee ballots get counted and which don’t.
Alabama is one of 17 states that does not allow voters to fix errors on their ballots prior to Election Day, according to Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank based in Colorado. That, coupled with the state’s exacting rules pertaining to absentee ballots, can lead to voters getting rejected.
Democrats introduced legislation to allow people to cure ballot affidavits that would allow election officials to be removed from the envelope and placed into the voting machine, but the bill did not move out of committee this year.
In interviews, three ballot managers said  that the decision for whether to reject or accept an absentee ballot envelope is made by a poll worker who observes each of the ballots, but that decision is not discretionary.
“You fill out the form and check boxes, and then you are supposed to sign,” said Jimmy Bell, the absentee election manager for Conecuh County, where the rejection rate was about 3%. “Then you have to put the right district. It was just some stuff that they did not do.”
Poll workers may not verify the identity of the person who signed the affidavit but check whether the person actually signed the affidavit envelope required by Alabama law. For most of the ballots, it is clear if the voter made an error, and they are unable to accept the ballot to be counted as part of the election.


The registrar of voters for each county, however, may have  individual process for dealing with ballots with discrepancies.
“Put the ballot that you don’t have an objection to in this pile, put the ballot that you have an objection to in this other pile,” Bell says to his poll workers. “Then everybody has to rule on it. One person doesn’t rule, the way I do it.”
Other places are slightly different.
“If there is ever any question, they get together and look at it,” said Brian York, the absentee election manager for Talladega County, where the rejection rate was 2.7%. “That is my office, I don’t know about anywhere else. If one of the poll workers has a question, if it looks unusual, they are going to ask another poll worker.”
Messages seeking comment were left with the Mobile County Probate Office.
Voting by absentee ballot in Alabama is difficult. The state requires voters to provide a reason for voting absentee. Voters must then navigate a series of rules and procedures that, should they miss even one, would invalidate their entire ballot.
Alabama also requires voters to finish ballot applications at least seven days before an election, and the ballots themselves must be received at the elections office by noon the day of the election.
That is different from other states, according to Christian Grose, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of Southern California who studies the election process.
“Arizona allows you to mail in your absentee ballot.,” he said. “As long as it is postmarked by the election, officials will count it even if it arrives a few days later.”
Arizona’s acceptance and count rate was 99.6%. The rate for Massachusetts, a state largely dominated by Democrats, was 98.8% in the 2022 midterms.
Researchers say ballot curing is the key difference between those states and Alabama.
Curing a ballot is a two-step process in which voters submit their absentee ballots that are then reviewed by election officials to ensure the person voting is registered to vote and that person who cast the ballot is the same person who received the ballot.
“States like that, Arizona is one, California is one, a number of western states, that allow people to more actively say, ‘Yes, that was my ballot, not fraud,’ allows you to still have election integrity to protect against fraud, but still gives people a chance to confirm that it was, in fact, their signature and it just changed,” Grose said.
This would help with younger voters who traditionally have lower rates of turnout than the rest of the electorate.  A study published by the  MIT election lab in 2021 found that ballot curing cuts rejection rates almost in half.
Several lawmakers introduced several bills aimed at increasing voter turnout and enhancing opportunities for voters to participate in elections within this cycle.
HB 97, sponsored by Rep. Kenyatte Hassell, D-Montgomery, during the current session, would have introduced a system of ballot curing in Alabama. The bill did not advance during the session.
“People have been doing this for the past 10 years in the voting cycle,” said Hassell, who has introduced the legislation in previous sessions. “Their vote never counted because they didn’t know they made those mistakes, of not signing one particular piece of paper, or not checking a box, or something, of whatever it could be to not have their absentee ballot count.”
Currently, when an election official receives an absentee ballot from a voter, the absentee ballot may not be removed from the affidavit envelope if it is defective. Hassell’s legislation would have required the absentee election manager to let a voter cure the ballot affidavit to address the problem.
“I did a lot of campaigns, and we would count absentee ballots,” Hassell said. “We would say, ‘This person voted by absentee, and the person said that he supported the candidate.’ So, we would count the vote. We counted absentee ballots, but then you turn around and you don’t see the results, you don’t see the correct number of absentee ballots cast. You say, ‘Something is not right. There is a problem.’”

Dina Neal said on Friday during the Assembly Judiciary hearing. (Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)A legislative hearing on a bill intended to give homeowners some “wiggle room” and avoid the onerous fines imposed by homeowners’ associations exposed what state Sen. Dina Neal called “classism” on the part of HOA industry representatives and opponents.  
Senate Bill 121 would, among other things, afford cash-strapped new homeowners three years rather than 180 days to landscape their backyards. An HOA could require that owners put down a single layer of rocks after 18 months, to prevent blowing dust. 
“Most people have spent most of their money on the refrigerator, the blinds, the furniture, and they actually don’t have the funds” to spend within six months on landscaping, Neal, a Democrat from North Las Vegas, said while presenting SB 121 to the Assembly Judiciary Committee on Friday. “Home ownership is very important. Achieving the American Dream is very important. But not all people are walking into a home with the same amount of money in their bank account.”
New homebuyers are “fully informed” of their obligations, HOA attorney Adam Clarkson had earlier testified in opposition to the bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in April on its way to passage in the Senate. “When they purchase a home, they know whether or not they can do it. The bright line test is don’t purchase these homes if you don’t want to have to do this.” 
However, finding a home that’s not in a HOA is a challenge in Nevada, where HOAs represent the owners of 623,917 housing units – half of the state’s 1.3 million homes, according to the state. 
“You’re protecting people that bought something they couldn’t afford in the first place, knowing that they couldn’t afford it, while at the same time you’re harming their neighbors,” Clarkson said. “Now they’re not going to be in this beautiful community, because you’ve taken that away from them, because now people don’t have to do the landscaping, and they’re going to have those blights in the neighborhood.”
Mark Leon, president of the Mountain’s Edge Master Association, agreed with Clarkson while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in April.  
“If landscaping your backyard is too much of a burden for you to handle, then buy a house that was already landscaped,” Leon suggested, adding the provision “only has the effect of pandering to homeowners too lazy or too unwilling to follow through on their obligation to the community, and that directly affects the property values of their neighbors who are working hard to build their new home.”
“There were just very interesting comments on the Senate side that I felt were just very classism,” Neal said on Friday during the Assembly Judiciary hearing.  
At the hearing in April, Neal said she “slightly took offense to the idea that you shouldn’t buy the home if you can’t afford to landscape your backyard,” adding she doesn’t “believe that a homeowner should be labeled as lazy” or told to find another home if they don’t like the rules. 
Failing to comply with HOA rules can be costly. The boards wield powers generally reserved for government tribunals. They can assess fines, deny property rights, and even foreclose. 
Neal’s bill is intended to take the sting out of common complaints from homeowners. 
Current regulations permit an HOA to require a resident whose vehicle has a commercial logo or ad to cover it with a magnet. SB 121 would eliminate the requirement for all vehicles, with the exception of those with a “sexual portrayal or depicting an image relating to the sale of a controlled substance.” 
The bill would prohibit an association from assessing late fees sooner than 30 days after an obligation becomes past due, and from reporting any past due obligation to a credit agency. There was no opposition to that provision. 
The legislation would also curtail an HOA from assessing a fine for an oil stain that is entirely on a homeowner’s driveway, however, a homeowner could still be responsible for oil stains on the asphalt in front of their property. 
“My vehicles do not leak but my neighbors’ do,” testified Tanya Bates, an HOA community manager in Washoe County. “I still clean the oil stains on my street to prevent oil from being tracked into my home. It’s a maintenance obligation for homeowners.” 
An amendment offered by the HOA industry would, among other things, reduce the proposed landscaping deadline to 12 months to lay down rocks and 24 months to complete landscaping. 
“I haven’t decided if it is friendly or not,” Neal said when asked if she’d accepted it. “There are provisions I appreciate and there are provisions I do not.”
The committee did not take any action on the measure.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DinaNeal-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.



There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
HIPAA doesn’t help
Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
What states are doing
In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

Eugene Jacques Bullard became the first Black American combat pilot. 
After the near lynching of his father and hearing that Great Britain lacked such racism, the 12-year-old Georgia native stowed away on a ship headed for Scotland. From there, he moved to Liverpool, England, where he handled odd jobs before becoming a boxer, traveling across Europe before he settled in Paris. 
“It seems to me that the French democracy influenced the minds of both White and Black Americans there and helped us all to act like brothers as near as possible,” he said. “It convinced me, too, that God really did create all men equal, and it was easy to live that way.” 
When World War I began, he was too young to fight for his adopted country, so he and other American expatriates joined the French Foreign Legion. Through a series of battles, he was wounded, and doctors believed he would never walk again. 
No longer able to serve in the infantry, an American friend bet him $2,000 that he could not get into aviation. Taking on the challenge, he earned his “wings” and began fighting for the French Aéronautique Militaire. 
He addressed racism with words on his plane, “All Blood Runs Red,” and he nicknamed himself, “The Black Swallow of Death.” 
On his flights, he reportedly took along a Rhesus monkey named “Jimmy.” He tried to join the U.S. Air Service, only to be turned away because he was Black. He became one of France’s most decorated war heroes, earning the French Legion of Honor. 
After the war he bought a Paris nightclub, where Josephine Baker and Louis Armstrong performed and eventually helped French officials ferret out Nazi sympathizers. After World War II ended, he moved to Harlem, but his widespread fame never followed him back to the U.S. 
In 1960, when French President Charles de Gaulle visited, he told government officials that he wanted to see his old friend, Bullard. No one in the government knew where Bullard was, and the FBI finally found him in an unexpected place — working as an elevator operator at the Rockefeller Center in New York City. 
After de Gaulle’s visit, he appeared on “The Today Show,” which was shot in the same building where he worked. 
Upon his death from cancer in 1961, he was buried with honors in the French War Veterans’ section of the Flushing Cemetery in Queens, New York. 
A sculpture of Bullard can be viewed in the Smithsonian National Space and Air Museum in Washington, D.C., a statue of him can be found outside the Museum of Aviation, and an exhibit on him can be seen inside the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, which posthumously gave him the rank of a second lieutenant.

And your desires show who you are.
After four years in the U.S. Senate, we have few doubts about what Tommy Tuberville wants.
A man sent to Washington to represent Alabama spends a lot of time on television talking about President Donald Trump or his enemies. Alabama is a peripheral concern. In some cases, Tuberville takes positions that are demonstrably bad for the people here.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When he’s not ignoring Alabamians, he’s embarrassing them. Tuberville in 2022 made an overtly racist assertion that Black Americans are criminals at a rally in Nevada. He also took a very long time to acknowledge that white nationalists are racists.
And Tuberville appears to despise transgender people. He attacked a Space Camp employee — a private citizen — because that person was transgender. He thinks, falsely, that men somehow got into the women’s boxing events at the 2024 Olympics.
Tuberville blocked military promotions for almost a year because the Biden administration wanted to help enlisted women access health care. He compared Vice President Kamala Harris, a former senator and California attorney general, to a “crazy ex-girlfriend.” When U.S. Sen. Katie Britt — his Republican colleague; an experienced politico and a former leader of Alabama’s largest business group — bombed her State of the Union response last year, Tuberville said she had been “picked as a housewife.”
Also, he forgot that triangles exist.
And all of that is before we get to questions about whether Tuberville actually lives in Alabama; possible conflicts of interest in his stock trading and questions about one of his charities.
This is the guy who’s going to clear the gubernatorial field?
He might. Tuberville appears to be edging into next year’s race for governor. And Republicans seem ready to give way to him. Even the suggestion that Tuberville could run led Agriculture and Industries Commissioner Rick Pate to give up plans to run for the office.
The senator would, of course, be a strong candidate. Tuberville has name recognition and a record that appeals to hard core Republican primary voters.
As a sitting senator, he should raise money easily. Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth, another possible gubernatorial candidate, had $1.3 million in his campaign account  in January compared to Tuberville’s $628,000 in March. But Ainsworth will need to spend all that and more to reach Tuberville’s levels of notoriety.
There’s no doubt the senator could be our next governor.
But why does Tuberville want to be governor?
“If you’re the CEO of a state then you can help more in a certain amount of time,” Tuberville told Alabama Daily News in March.
Oh boy.
The Legislature, not the governor, holds the power in Alabama. The governor can do little more than make suggestions to lawmakers and sign the bills sent to her desk. If she vetoes a bill during the session, the Legislature can override her with a majority vote. She has a more effective pocket veto near the end of a session, but lawmakers can work around it.
If you want to be a successful chief executive in Alabama, you must know the boundaries of the office. Occasionally you get a George Wallace with enough loyalty from voters to bend legislators to his will.
More often, Alabama governors must work outside the Legislature to appear strong. This means doing things that don’t directly involve the Legislature. Like immediate response to natural disasters.  Or recruiting companies to the state.
Bob Riley did both to project decisiveness even as a Democratic-controlled Legislature controlled the purse strings. So does Kay Ivey, who understands where she has leverage and where she doesn’t.
Robert Bentley also used that combination. But he wasted it in pointless confrontations with legislators, overestimating his power and showing the weakness of the office.
Let’s hope a Gov. Tuberville does not end his career the way Bentley did. There will be plenty of ideological overlap between Tuberville and a (likely) Republican-controlled Legislature.
But Tuberville’s habit of running his mouth and alienating people without forethought doesn’t bode well. In the inevitable moments when the governor clashes with lawmakers, the chief executive needs to know what the office can and can’t do. And try to get a good result and escape the fray with as much dignity as possible.
One can’t assume a man who speaks like an uncle’s Facebook post has that subtle touch. If Trump gets his way on the economy and disaster aid, Tuberville will have fewer avenues to show leadership. And if a Gov. Tuberville talks to lawmakers like Sen. Tuberville treats his constituents, he will quickly learn who holds the cards.
But really, he shouldn’t be sitting at the table. Power has revealed Tuberville to be shallow, spiteful and more interested in attention than the state he represents. He treats most Alabamians with contempt and views his job as an annex to a television career.
And if Alabama voters, knowing all that, elevate him to another political office, what does that reveal about us?

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The high-profile lawsuit challenging Alabama’s 2022 law banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth under 19 has been dismissed by all parties involved.
Neither the plaintiffs – transgender youth and families challenging the ban – or the Alabama attorney’s office filed an official explanation for the move or a suggestion of a settlement with the court.  In separate statements, the plaintiffs said they would continue to fight for access to the care, while Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall declared it a total victory for the state and a vindication of their position.
“The shutting down of medical care in Alabama has forced our plaintiffs and other Alabama families to make heart wrenching decisions that no family should ever have to make, and they are each making the decisions they need to make that are right for them,” said Scott McCoy, deputy legal director of inclusion and anti-extremism litigation team at the Southern Poverty Law Center, in a joint statement from organizations representing the plaintiffs. “We salute the courage of these plaintiffs and we will continue fighting to ensure families across the country have the freedom to get their transgender children the proven medical care that enables them to thrive.”

Marshall declared the dismissal a decisive victory for the state and claimed in a statement that a “court-ordered discovery” uncovered what he described as “medical, legal, and political scandal that will be studied for decades.” 
“We uncovered the truth,” the statement said. “We exposed the scandal. We won. Alabama led the way, and now all families are safer for it.”
Messages were left with the Attorney General’s office seeking clarification. According to the statement, the discovery process in the case revealed that “key medical organizations misled parents, promoted unproven treatments as settled science, and ignored growing international concern over the use of sex-change procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors,” but does not state how. 
The statement also alleged that internal communications showed the “standards of care” were legally and politically crafted but does not provide specifics. 
The law, known as the Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, made it a felony for medical providers to prescribe puberty blockers or hormones to transgender minors, carrying a potential prison sentence of up to 10 years. The law did not ban the use of puberty blockers to treat precocious puberty in cisgender children. 
It also prohibited gender-affirming surgeries for individuals under 19, though health care providers have repeatedly testified such surgeries are not performed on minors. 
The legislation led to immediate legal action after being signed into law by Gov. Kay Ivey in April 2022. Initially, a federal judge blocked the ban on medications, citing interference with parental rights and a lack of evidence demonstrating harm from the treatments. But that decision was overturned in August 2023 by a three-judge panel of the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which stated that there was no fundamental right to gender-affirming care. 
U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa, writing for the majority, cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which struck down federal abortion protections and ruled that abortion was not a right “deeply rooted in the nation’s history and tradition.” Lagoa wrote that gender-affirming care had no historic grounding in the law.

(File photo by Bruce DePuyt/Maryland Matters)Tonii Gedin concedes that there were some growing pains when the state began to grapple with the then-emerging COVID-19 pandemic five years ago, including how it spread and how to best combat it.
“We were learning. We were trying things and making the best decisions we could with the information that we had at the time,” said Gedin, the Anne Arundel County Health Officer who served as the deputy health officer during most of the COVID pandemic.
The pandemic sparked debates about the appropriate level of response, and not all actions were successful, most famously the 5,000 COVID-19 test kits from South Korea that were procured to great fanfare early in the crisis by then-Gov. Larry Hogan, only to be found later to be flawed.
But the pandemic, stumbles and all, gave health officials lessons in effective public health communication and outreach that have stuck around five years later, putting the state on better footing for the next public health crisis to hit the state.
“We have more data available to us to understand what’s happening,” said Sean O’Donnell, deputy chief of Public Health Services at the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services. “Going through the pandemic, and the unprecedented challenges associated with that, we definitely had lessons and a roadmap so that we are now better prepared to handle future public health emergencies.”
O’Donnell said that one of the most important lessons from the pandemic is that COVID-19 highlighted how access to health care varies across communities.


COVID-19 by the numbers
April 29, 2020
Total confirmed cases: 20,849
Total confirmed deaths: 985
April 29, 2025
Total detected cases: 1,511,171
Total confirmed deaths: 18,438


“Before COVID, we had seen many of the same disparities across populations — who’s coming out to get a flu vaccine, who’s coming out to access medical resources, doing preventative health,” he said. “We see disparities. We see our residents with less resources access health care less.”
O’Donnell said that in Montgomery County, bridging the gap in health care access during the pandemic meant the health department needed to meet community members “where they’re at” – testing sites and vaccination campaigns were targeted to communities with less access, such as in low-income communities.
“We had data telling us where people were vaccinating and where they weren’t and we could send in resources into geographic communities or into the populations that had lower vaccination rates.
Gedin said that Anne Arundel County saw that same pattern and created an “ambassador” program that recruited community members to help push communications about the pandemic.
Anne Arundel has continued the program to this day due to the success of the ambassadors, particularly for the county’s Korean residents, Spanish-speaking communities and “different populations that are more vulnerable or have more issues with access to health care.”
“We’ve been able to find a number of health topics … outside of COVID that they’re tackling,” she said. “They’re tackling mental health, weather preparedness. They’re looking at things like overdose prevention and making sure that communities have naloxone [a drug to reverse opioid overdoses].”
Meanwhile, the shift to social distancing during the pandemic meant that Maryland’s public health system needed to adapt the technology needed to track the virus and help get messaging out to community members.
Kristy Frashure, deputy director of disease, prevention and management for the Anne Arundel County Health Department, said that surveillance methodology such as wastewater testing for COVID-19 and other viruses were improved over the course of the pandemic.
 


 
The county continues to test wastewater to track transmission of COVID-19 now that testing is less widespread than in the early years – and it uses the technology to track other viruses such as the flu.
“We’re still using that, not just for COVID but for other various infectious diseases,” Frashure said.
She added that the knowledge and acceptance of “telehealth” services have gained popularity since the pandemic.
“We’ve had some of these things before COVID, telehealth and whatnot, but certainly during the height of COVID, that really accelerated the adoptions of … these digital health solutions, which increased access to care for individuals and reduced the risk of infection,” Frashure said.
A 2024 report from the Maryland Health Care Commission said that while “telehealth visits have declined in recent years both nationally and in Maryland, they remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.”
“Embracing these technologies have really proved effective and we’re still using them today,” Frashure said, noting that mental health issues have particularly benefited from increased awareness of telehealth services since the pandemic.
“With the pandemic and quarantine and lockdown and individuals working from home … I think the pandemic really set a light on mental health,” she said. “Certainly post-pandemic we really need to prioritize mental health and the well-being of all the communities.”
O’Donnell noted that there were some costs that came with social distancing protocols and remote life.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“None of this was done lightly, and there was a cost to all of it. Not just the economic costs. I can talk about how successful social distancing is, but it comes at a behavioral health cost. It has an educational costs,” he said. “All of these things have to be balanced. We have to balance the successes we’ve seen in the past with what these costs are.”
The Montgomery and Anne Arundel health officials agreed that a lot of the public health infrastructure built through COVID-19 remains to help battle future severe diseases – assuming federal resources are available for additional support.
“We’ve learned that when we have those resources, we can do amazing things,” O’Donnell said. “I do think we could do it again – public health has the knowledge and the will to do it. But that’s not a standing resource that we all have.”
As for the lessons learned during the pandemic, he said that the experiences of battling the worst of COVID-19’s impact will have a long-lasting impression on those on the frontlines.
“I don’t think we’re going to easily forget those because of the lasting impressions they’ve had on us,” O’Donnell said. “Our health care workers who watched tens of thousands of people die – they’re not going to be forgotten.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Masks-on-Maryland-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

La orden ejecutiva “Solo Inglés” es una clara violación de los mandatos federales del Título VI de la Ley de Derechos Civiles de 1964.  Al no codificar y rectificar sus antigua indiferencia sistémica de hablantes no nativos de inglés, el estado ha renunciado a la oportunidad de brindar información crítica a sus habitantes cuyo idioma nativo no es el inglés, a los usuarios del lenguaje de señas y a aquellos que dependen del lenguaje sencillo para su comprensión.


En el centro de esta cuestión estaba el Proyecto de ley del Senado (SB 955), un proyecto de ley que propuse y que fue presentado en la sesión legislativa de 2025 por el senador MD Rahman. El proyecto de ley buscaba establecer políticas que garantizan que las personas con dominio limitado del inglés pudieran acceder a información y servicios públicos a través de recursos de traducción e interpretación. Fue un paso necesario hacia la creación de una Oficina de Acceso al Idioma, una entidad centralizada que supervisaría y coordinaría los esfuerzos de accesibilidad lingüística en todo el estado. Sin embargo, a pesar de su potencial para atender a más de 400,000 residentes cuyo idioma principal no es el inglés ni el algonquin (el idioma oficial del estado), el proyecto de ley no logró salir del Comité de Administración Gubernamental y Elecciones.

Doris Maldonado Mendez
El fracaso de SB 955 es más que un simple revés legislativo; es una negación de derechos fundamentales. El acceso al idioma no es un privilegio, es una necesidad para una participación equitativa en la vida cívica y cotidiana. Sin él, miles de residentes de Connecticut a lo largo de su vida se quedan sin la capacidad de interactuar con los servicios gubernamentales, los proveedores de atención médica, los sistemas legales y las instituciones educativas de manera significativa.
Esta decisión refleja una tendencia preocupante de privilegio de la información y exclusión lingüística, lo que refuerza las barreras para las personas que no hablan inglés y los usuarios de lengua de señas. Es un significante contraste con los principios de inclusión e igualdad de oportunidades que Connecticut dice defender. La ausencia de una Oficina de Acceso Lingüístico dedicada significa que los residentes seguirán enfrentándose a servicios lingüísticos fragmentados e inconsistentes, marginando aún más a las comunidades que ya luchan por navegar los sistemas burocráticos.
Durante años, defensores, hemos luchado para corregir esta injusticia, trabajando incansablemente para garantizar que Connecticut reconozca los derechos de TODOS sus residentes, independientemente de su origen lingüístico, edad y capacidad. El hecho de no aprobar SB 955 no es sólo un rechazo de un proyecto de ley: es un rechazo de las personas a las que debía servir.
A medida que Connecticut avanza, debe reconsiderar su postura sobre el acceso a información lingüística. El Estado no puede permitirse el lujo de ignorar las voces de quienes han sido sistemáticamente excluidos. La lucha por el acceso equitativo a la información y al idioma está lejos de terminar, y es imperativo que los legisladores revisen este tema con la urgencia y el compromiso que merece.La pregunta sigue siendo: ¿Seguirá Connecticut dándole la espalda a sus comunidades diversas o finalmente tomará medidas para garantizar que el acceso al idioma ya no sea una barrera para los servicios esenciales? La respuesta definirá el compromiso del Estado con los derechos civiles en los próximos años.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-05 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How will car tax changes affect you? Here’s what to know.,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/05/ct-car-tax-changes/,Lawmakers adjusted a law that changed how CT assesses car values after some towns said they’re getting less in car taxes. Here's what to know.,"For years, lawmakers have been working out the details on a plan to change the way Connecticut towns assess the value of motor vehicles for tax purposes. 
A 2022 law requires that Connecticut towns use the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, or MSRP, rather than the National Automobile Dealers Association valuation system to figure out how much vehicles are worth. The law aims to make the way cars are valued more predictable and uniform as they get older.
But now that the change went into effect, some town officials said they’re bringing in less money and are increasing their mill rates to make up for the loss.
Lawmakers had adjusted the law during a special session over the summer and, in response to the towns’ concerns, changed it again with an emergency-certified bill at the start of this legislative session. Still, some lawmakers want to phase out the car tax altogether.
Here’s what you need to know about the changes.
How does this affect my taxes?
It’s likely that most people’s vehicles will be valued lower, which would bring down their taxes. The manufacturer’s suggested retail price also has a set 20-year schedule of depreciation, as opposed to the National Automobile Dealers Association, which fluctuates more.
That means car owners should be able to better predict what their future car tax bills will be, based on how old their vehicle is. 
The new system of valuing cars is less susceptible to market swings. The change aims to prevent big shifts, such as the one many people saw during the pandemic when the price of vehicles — and the cost of the car tax — spiked.
What does this mean for my town?
Towns have reported that the change has meant big drops in their grand lists, or the total value of taxable property in town. The town gets a certain percentage of that value as tax revenue, which it uses to pay for town projects and programs such as the school budget, roads, water systems and libraries.
Some towns have increased their mill rates to make up for the difference, meaning that property taxes could increase in the coming year.
What has the legislature done?
State lawmakers have worked on this issue for years. 
When the 2022 law mandated that towns use the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, or MSRP, the list began with an 80% valuation for vehicles that are up to a year old, meaning that it drops to 80% of its original value in that year.
But legislators said they needed to make “fixes” to the statute before it went into effect in October 2024. They met in June in a special session to make technical changes to the law, including starting the depreciation schedule with an 85% valuation for vehicles that are up to a year old, lessening the impact on municipal budgets.
But after the law went into effect in July, some towns complained that their budgets had taken too much of a loss. In February, lawmakers responded to the concerns by passing an emergency-certified bill that allowed towns to opt to set the depreciation schedule beginning at 90% of the original value, rather than 85%. Several towns have since decided to use the provision and change their schedules.
Most Democrats have been supportive of the changes, saying it will help towns better plan their budgets and lower car taxes for regular people. Some said it didn’t go far enough, and that Connecticut should get rid of its car tax altogether.
Several Republicans opposed the measure and said they worried that towns would lose too much money under the new system.
What is happening with the car tax now?
Connecticut politicians have been talking about what they say are problems with the car tax system for decades. Because each of the state’s 169 towns have different mill rates, residents pay different amounts for the same vehicles based on where they live.
Often, this has meant that people who live in cities, which tend to have higher mill rates, pay more in car taxes than people in wealthier suburbs. Lawmakers and governors have said they want to change that. Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester, has worked for the past couple of sessions on bills that would eliminate the car tax entirely.
He’s now working on a way to phase out the tax, although the details of that plan aren’t yet clear because lawmakers are still negotiating the language, with a goal of passing a plan this session.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0225_SR_ParkedCars_003-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A legislative effort to make it easier and cheaper to build houses and apartments is all but dead for the year. 
A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers and advocates entered the legislative session with an ambitious but carefully-crafted set of bills to remake Minnesota’s zoning and land use rules, opening up construction of more homes and apartments across the state. 
The coalition’s chances of passing meaningful zoning reform likely ended Thursday when four Democrats and two Republicans in a Senate committee voted against an amendment that contained a bare-bones version of the package.
“We really brought what we felt was the bare minimum of what we needed to do to help people — we hear them, we understand that they’re asking for more housing options, that they’re asking for more affordable housing,” said state Sen. Lindsey Port, DFL- Burnsville, who chairs the Senate housing committee. “This was our opportunity to do a small fraction of that.”
Minnesota is facing a housing shortage, and low supply means higher prices for buyers and renters. The “Yes to Homes” coalition says local government regulations are restricting building. Cities often dictate minimum square footage, garage sizes, parking spots and lot sizes, for instance, driving up costs and incentivizing developers to focus on expensive single-family home construction. 
New apartments, even if proposed in an area zoned for multi-family development, often face long permitting processes, contentious public hearings and negotiations with city planners that result in fewer units and higher costs for future residents, developers say.
Last year’s attempt to pass legislation rolling back city control over where housing is built and what it looks like failed after intense opposition from city leaders. 
In the leadup to the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers met with lobbyists for city governments to hash out their differences. The result was a more incremental approach to zoning reform, with four bills targeting different aspects of the interaction between housing developers and municipal governments. 
Despite lengthy negotiations, city governments still weren’t on board with the legislation, and city government leaders and their lobbyists turned out to committee hearings this year to voice their concerns. 
The bills passed their respective housing committees with overwhelming bipartisan support despite city opposition. 
But the bills never made it to their next stop: the state and local government committees. They stalled out as cities lobbied in opposition and the bill authors failed to secure the necessary votes.
As a last-ditch effort to get some significant housing policy passed in the Senate, Port brought an amendment Thursday to a bill in the Senate State and Local Government Committee that contained a few of the key policies.
The language would have allowed cities to require up to one parking spot per residential unit; prohibited cities from requiring the establishment of an HOA as a condition of development; barred cities from imposing aesthetic mandates, like the type of siding or features like columns, decks, balconies or porches; and required cities to establish and follow an administrative review process for housing construction permits in areas zoned to allow that type of development — i.e. not forcing developers into a protracted negotiation process, or requiring city council approval, for developments that follow existing zoning rules.
It did not incorporate some of the more controversial policies endorsed by the coalition, such as ending single-family zoning statewide, or requiring cities to allow apartment buildings along transit corridors and in commercial areas. 
Lawmakers voiced support for city leaders and were reluctant to take power from their constituent cities against their will.
“This shifts power towards developers, not communities,” said Sen. Heather Gustafson, DFL-Vadnais Heights, who voted against the amendment. She also cited the bill’s “one-size-fits-all” approach, and its failure to guarantee the creation of more affordable housing, as reasons for voting no. 
The cities in her district, where the average rent is over $2,000 per month, are already doing good work on housing affordability and should retain control over housing development, Gustafson said.
Port said she and other bill authors will bring similar legislation again next year. 
“I think these bills, in some version, are inevitable,” Port said. “It is really up to the cities and the city lobbying groups to decide how much fight they want to put into this — how much reputational damage, or how much they want to put their reputations on the line fighting this.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250425_0411-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

(Getty Images)Misinformation, myths and politics have contributed to Indiana’s lack of a cohesive, statewide policy on renewable energy. 
Seventy-two of 92 counties have moratoriums or bans on such installations, according to legislative energy head Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso. Several attempts this year to intervene against blockages died, but lawmakers are starting to recognize the need for diversification. 
 “As long as there’s demand for renewables, if we can’t have them here, we’ll buy it from somewhere else – our folks will be paying the transmission costs plus the possibility of more,” said Soliday.
He said organized anti-renewable energy movements travel the state, attending county commissioners’ meetings, adding that they “can be quite unkind, threatening and so forth.”
While debate continues, the price of electricity is rising in Indiana. Once among the lowest in the United States, the state now ranks 28th for cost.
 Locals see things differently

Decatur County resident and farm owner Albert Armand emphasized he’s not against solar, but concerned about preserving valuable farmland.
“My view on these solar installations is that there’s a place for them and the best place is not a corn field,” he said. “We have a lot of ground we could use. We can put solar panels on roofs, over parking lots — if we install these on farm ground we’re going to eliminate a lot of crop acres.”

Larry Heger is another Decatur County resident who helps manage a Facebook group — Decatur County Citizens Stop Industrial Solar & Wind — alongside his wife. He described himself as “against solar taking out good-quality farm ground.”











As an elected Republican in a conservative area that votes 78% Republican, we don’t want the green energy stuff in our county.


– Ripley County Commissioner Mark Horstman



Heger’s group is primarily local landowners who, he said “would live across the road from one of the projects” and are “very concerned about their landscape, how it affects their home value.” 
He claims he’s encountered “like, less than a dozen” people supportive of renewable energy in Decatur County. Heger believes they’re the landowners “who signed the lease.”
While Decatur County has discussed a solar-specific ordinance, it’s currently under a moratorium. County Commissioner Jeremy Pasel, a Republican, declined to be interviewed.
Opposition brings likely end to Indiana utility siting bill, but the issue isn’t going away

Nearby Ripley County approved solar energy regulations last year.  County Commission President Mark Horstman said the three-person body felt their county needed its own standards.
“We had caught wind that some landowners had signed up for commercial solar and some neighbors were opposed. We realized we were set to have the state solar rules in place, because we didn’t have our own,” he said. 

He said the area eyed for solar expansion was in the north part of the county, with a farm and housing development nearby. Horstman is among those who believe such installations lower property values.
“As an elected Republican in a conservative area that votes 78% Republican, we don’t want the green energy stuff in our county,” Horstman continued. “The people that elected me do not want it in our county. On the other side — we don’t have the demographics or topographies for it. We don’t have vast lots of land in our area.”
“So, you’re basically telling somebody – your biggest investment you’re ever going to make, your home, now you’re going to look at solar panels across the street,” he said, citing a belief that the panels lower surrounding property values. “I’m not opposed if they want to put a 1,000 acre solar farm in the middle of 5,000 acres and two people live there, that’s fine, but we don’t have that type of area in Ripley County.”

Ripley County’s ordinance, Horstman believes, gives landowners room to negotiate while still requiring specific setback distances.
“I understand people have rights to do what they want on their land, but you don’t have a right to put confined feeding in a residential area, there’s rules in place,” and renewable energy should be handled similarly, he said. 
He said he personally felt the ordinance should be more stringent but the three commissioners negotiated a compromise. 
 Future of renewables

Indiana Citizens Action Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson thinks these types of ordinances are holding Indiana back.
“We can’t seem to get legislation passed in any way, shape or form to encourage or incentivize clean, renewable energy,” he said. “Economics and technology are certainly not standing in the way. The barriers are political, and the barriers are the will to move away” from non-renewables.
“Of course, the utilities themselves and the fossil fuel industry — they have enormous influence in Congress and statehouses across the country,” he continued.

Olson and other renewable advocates say Indiana needs to diversify its energy portfolio to both reduce prices and eliminate fossil fuels. Several have pointed to White County as a leader. 
The county currently has commercial wind and solar facilities, plus hydroelectric dams. 
Its exploration of commercial wind began in 2007. Leaders reviewed ordinances and added language where needed.
But, “it wasn’t really the county that was pursuing this,” Republican Commission President Mike Smolek said. “It was the local farmers that were pursuing this.”
“The commissioners before me did their due diligence,” continued Smolek. “They went to California, Arizona, Texas” to see how renewable energy worked in those areas and what could be done to enhance road use agreements and other items.” 











My biggest fight these last couple years has been fear and Facebook.


– White County Commissioner Mike Smolek



The county’s first commercial wind facility launched in 2008. The county approved the construction of a large-scale commercial solar facility in September 2024, according to WFLI.
But resistance to commercial solar and battery storage — plus, plenty of myths and misconceptions — has surged in recent years, per Smolek. 
“My biggest fight these last couple years has been fear and Facebook,” he said. 
“You don’t, as a normal, general citizen, get to see these things in operation, don’t understand it — they don’t know what’s going on,” he added. “And then you get people on Facebook that talk about stuff they don’t really know about. Trying to get everybody on the same page, (give them) the knowledge that you know and teach them about it is a big thing.” 
The prospect of small modular nuclear reactors have also prompted anxiety, Smolek said.

“It’s human nature to be afraid,” Smolek said. “All we can do is educate ourselves and figure out what’s best for us. The deciding factor is, we know we need power. Everybody depends on it. Every manufacturer, every household, every business all depends on this same grid.”
That’s among Olson’s top two reasons why he says rural communities should consider renewable installations: Indiana’s currently an energy importer.
“There’s absolutely no reason we don’t want to build more energy in-state and be energy independent. That’s good for everybody – it brings down prices,” and lowers consumers’ electric bills, he continued. 
With renewable energy, Olson said, you get an energy source “that is not reliant on a fuel source and all the additional costs and volatility that come along with purchasing coal, purchasing gas, purchasing oil — in the markets, operation and maintenance on the fossil fuel power plants.”
But number one is the revenue. 
Renewable energy, he said, provides income for schools, roads, parks and more. It brings jobs to the community.
The other main reason: “We are an importer of energy right now,” Olson said.
“There’s absolutely no reason we don’t want to build more energy in-state and be energy independent. That’s good for everybody – it brings down prices,” and lowers consumers’ electric bills, he continued. 
With renewable energy, Olson said, you get an energy source “that is not reliant on a fuel source and all the additional costs and volatility that come along with purchasing coal, purchasing gas, purchasing oil — in the markets, operation and maintenance on the fossil fuel power plants.”
He acknowledged that studies on the impact to property values haven’t been conclusive. But he dismissed concerns about soil and farmland as “completely junk science — if you talk to Farm Bureau, the Purdue (University) agriculture folks.” 
“Nobody … is saying we’re going to be 100% wind or 100% solar,” he continued. 
“When you invest — you want a diverse portfolio. We (similarly) want a combination of all resources to ensure reliability, ensure resiliency to shelter ratepayers from the risk of being reliant on one source alone.”

The House wants to slash sales tax on everything and spend $4.4 billion less than the Senate.
The two chambers are supposed to be negotiating a compromise, but Speaker Daniel Perez says senators aren’t playing nice, dismissing their proposals “unacceptable” and “patronizing.”
Senate President Ben Albritton politely insists he won’t pass massive tax cuts “at the expense of the long-term financial stability of our state.”
Such tax cuts would pretty much insure county and municipal governments — police, firefighters, parks, roads, libraries — would take an enormous hit.
The governor says cutting sales tax will only help those dang tourists — AKA Florida’s No. One industry, especially the dastardly Canadians. (Who’s going to tell him they’re vacationing elsewhere these days?)
He wants to go even bigger (and dumber), abolishing property taxes or at least upping the homestead exemption.
If you rent or you depend on local services, you’re out of luck.
Dissing DeSantis
At the moment, both chambers are either openly flouting or ostentatiously ignoring directives from the governor’s office.
The Senate has refused to confirm a slew of his nominees, including University of West Florida trustees and heads of the Department of Children and Families and the Agency for Healthcare Administration.
In an attempt to stop the washed-up-politician-to-higher-ed-sinecure pipeline, the House has passed a bill to bring university presidential searches back into the sunshine, letting taxpayers know who’s under consideration.
DeSantis is outraged: “They want the universities to be able to pursue a leftist indoctrination agenda,” he says, a statement that suggests he has never met members of the Florida House.
The governor seems trapped in a perpetual temper tantrum, calling Daniel Perez “terrible,” “rotten,” “treacherous,” and “a tool of the Left.”
This “tool of the left” is the same Daniel Perez who’s such a good little MAGA he got the House to pass a bill called “Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy” — also known as the TRUMP Act.
DeSantis had called a special session in January, demanding legislators adopt his bill, giving him near-monarchical power over private businesses and law enforcement, all in the name of fighting the sinister foreigners infiltrating the state to pick tomatoes and put up drywall.
Instead, the Legislature gaveled out, then gaveled in their own special session, thumbing their noses at the governor to whom they once bowed down before.
This is what happens when you 1. Run against Trump; and 2. Become politically irrelevant.
Mutual snark
Perez and DeSantis have been snarking at each other for months, but now their reactionary-Republican-on-reactionary-Republican war has gotten hotter than Tallahassee in August.
Not only has the House defied the governor, its healthcare budget committee has been digging into Hope Florida, a charity founded by Casey DeSantis.
Ms. DeS is generally assumed to be running for governor in 2026.
Hope Florida claimed to be about keeping needy people off that nasty ol’ gubmint assistance, funneling them to church programs and other private aid groups.
“Hope Florida is not a program,” says Casey DeSantis. “Hope Florida is an idea, Hope Florida is a philosophy.”
Problem is, as Rep. Alex Andrade, R-Pensacola says, Hope Florida also looks a lot like “conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud.”
Oh, dear.
Here’s what happened: Centene Corp., a Fortune 500 company and Florida’s biggest Medicaid contractor, overcharged for prescription drugs.
It could happen to anyone! Just ask Sen. Rick Scott.
Centene settled with the state for $67 million.
The DeSantis administration told the Legislature about $57 million of that. But $10 million that should have been divided between the state and the feds somehow got donated to the Hope Florida Foundation.
Hope Florida promptly funneled that $10 million to two political committees, one called “Save Our Society From Drugs” (they mean fun drugs, not Advil) and the other “Secure Florida’s Future.”
SFF is controlled by the Florida Chamber of Commerce, which uses it to make dark money campaign contributions.
Nothing shady there, right?
You call this ‘clean’?
It gets better (or worse if you give a damn about ethics and the rule of law): Within a few weeks these two dodgy outfits directed $8.5 million of their windfall to another one, “Keep Florida Clean” (not making this up), the purpose of which was to defeat Amendment 3.
That was the amendment seeking to legalize marijuana. It narrowly lost in the 2024 elections.
Guess who controlled the Keep Florida Clean PAC?
James Uthmeier, attorney general of the State of Florida and DeSantis’ former chief of staff and presidential campaign manager.
A lot of that money paid for ads against Amendment 3, an action that was probably illegal.
Rep. Andrade accuses Uthmeier of “money laundering and wire fraud.”
Uthmeier dismisses Andrade as a tool of “Big Marijuana.”
He says he wasn’t involved in the Hope donation thing.
Or, not very involved, or even aware of what it was, though he swam in the tightest inner circle of DeSantisWorld, up to his eyeballs in some of the governor’s stupidest ideas, including building a golf course in the fragile habitat of Jonathan Dickinson State Park.
The evidence suggests he was very involved.
Meanwhile, DeSantis is in full hissy-fit mode, accusing legislators of working with Democrats and the “liberal media” to trash his wife’s pet charity and derail her political ambitions.
In one of his weird rants he says, “Some people feel threatened by the First Lady, accusing the Legislature and the press of “doing narrative.”
He goes on: “You know, if you’re looking at 2026 and you’ve got some horse, you don’t want her anywhere near that. You’re very worried because she runs circles around their people.”
 ‘Mistakes were made’
Rep. Andrade slaps back: “I don’t care if she files to run for governor,” adding, “Given how much credit she gets for the Hope Florida Foundation and the Hope Florida program, I’m just kind of shocked at how incompetent she’s been in managing all of it.”
Casey DeSantis had been polling pretty well against declared candidate Byron Donalds, recipient of the presidential endorsement, a congressman who calls Donald Trump “Daddy.”
The Hope debacle could change that.
Hope Florida’s president Joshua Hay allowed as how “mistakes were made” and resigned, as did one of Hope’s attorneys.
Frustrated that people from the Chamber of Commerce and the various dark money committees involved in Hope refused to talk, Andrade has dropped the inquiry — for now.
The House could return to it later.
The Legislature may have backed off investigating Hope, but the “liberal media,” lawyers, political consultants, campaign managers, and maybe even some judges  will not.
More like this will come to light; more evidence of what Andrade calls the DeSantis “culture of neglect, incompetence and entitlement” will emerge, just as the 2026 gubernatorial campaign kicks off.
The Fall of the House of DeSantis is going to be quite the spectacle.

House of Representatives chamber with a football play in the foreground. (Illustration by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CREATIVE/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA— Legislators’ latest effort to overhaul the South Carolina High School League will carry over into 2026, with the bill’s chief sponsor saying she’s cautiously optimistic a solution can be reached in the off-session.
Legislators insist they’re not going to let this push for change fizzle.
The House Education Committee decided last week to postpone debate on a bill that would eliminate the organization that governs student athletics and replace it with a board appointed by legislators.
The independent league, which creates its own rules for participating middle and high schools, has long rankled legislators, who often get calls from upset parents about decisions they have no authority over.
House Education Chairwoman Shannon Erickson said she filed the latest bill in March out of frustration; 28 legislators co-signed. It advanced last month from a subcommittee. But then, to her surprise, a member of the league’s executive committee contacted her.
So, rather than send the bill to the floor in the final days of this year’s session, her committee decided to try to collaborate with the league on a compromise that keeps the organization’s self-governance intact.
“I’m going out on a limb, and I’m not 100% sure it’s the right limb to go out on,” Erickson, R-Beaufort, told her committee Wednesday.
The decision to pause disbanding the league followed the committee’s grilling of Jerome Singleton, the league’s longtime commissioner.
Legislators said they were tired of getting parents’ complaints about the league’s transfer rule, which requires students to sit out for a year before being allowed to play sports at their new school.
Rep. Stephen Frank, R-Greenville, even asked Singleton if he’d consider resigning his position.
“Maybe we don’t want the High School League to go away,” he said. “But the common denominator I’ve heard over and over is Jerome, Jerome, Jerome.”
Singleton said he would not leave his position.
Erickson stepped in minutes later and said issues with the league go beyond Singleton.
“It’s not just one person; it’s a problem with the way it’s organized,” she said.
The High School League has overseen sports in South Carolina’ middle and high schools since 1913. Its more than 400 members include traditional public schools, as well as charter schools and private schools.
Legislators have long threatened to eliminate the High School League.
But criticism intensified in recent years as the league grappled with the rise of sports-focused charter schools plucking students from around the state and the increasing regularity of athletes attempting to switch schools.
Erickson first proposed replacing the High School League in November 2023 after months of studying how to even out competition in high school sports.
Proposal replaces SC High School League with legislators’ own governing board

That came in the aftermath of the league establishing a multiplier for determining which bracket schools would compete in. Traditionally, schools have been grouped according to the size of the student population.
Under the change, all students enrolled at a school from outside normal attendance zones, regardless of whether they played a sport, counted as three students.
That forced athletics-focused charter schools — the reason for the rule — to play bigger schools. But it also moved smaller private schools that are in the league into bigger brackets. Legislators said that perpetuated, rather than fixed, the unfairness.
“Come on guys: Do better. Do better at your jobs. Do better for the kids,” Rep. James Teeple told Singleton and other league representatives at Wednesday’s meeting.
The Johns Island Republican said the league reached out to Erickson out of desperation, not a true desire for change.
“This dumpster fire has been burning for a long time. It’s come to the point where those in leadership have noticed we’re committed to clipping their wings a little bit,” he said. “I question the real motives. I doubt it’s in good faith.”
But Erickson said she continues to hold out hope for collaboration. She said she’s already met with Adam Lanford, the vice president of the league’s executive committee.
“I hope that, No. 1, we can increase communication,” she said.
Rep. Terry Alexander, D-Florence, said no matter what conversations occur over the next seven months, change is necessary.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that it’s going to be reorganized,” said the committee’s second vice-chairman and its longest-serving member. “We may kick the can down the road for a little bit. But there’s no doubt it will not be running like this in the next year or two.”
After the meeting, Singleton told the SC Daily Gazette he doesn’t know why Lanford, principal of Powdersville High School in Anderson County, contacted Erickson, but he’s happy to work with legislators on a solution. (Lanford did not respond to the Gazette’s messages for comment.)
“The ability to have a conversation and dialogue” is a great thing, Singleton said. “Both sides can see what’s there. And then, wherever concerns are, if there’s a medium to fix it, I think we take advantage of that.”
High School League optimism
Scott Earley, director of the South Carolina Athletic Coaches Association, said he agrees work needs to be done but called efforts to banish the league “radical.”
Earley said his travels since becoming the association’s leader in December 2023 have given him insight into how other states govern high school athletics, and South Carolina’s system stands up well in comparison.
“I don’t think the problem is nearly as bad as it’s made out to be,” he told the Gazette.
His association’s board issued a statement in support of maintaining the league, while pledging to work with lawmakers in addressing issues.
“The League has long been a trusted leader in advancing the high ideals of sportsmanship, integrity, physical welfare, and equitable opportunity for student-athletes across every region of our state,” read the statement sent after the committee meeting.
“We need to remember, it is a member-driven body — shaped by the input, collaboration, and votes of schools statewide,” it continued. “We all need to work together in the face of challenges.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/house.chamber.football.illustraiton.001-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

Photo by Getty Images. An innocent look. A wag of a tail. It’s kind of hard to resist the tug on your heart to buy the dog you see in a pet store window. The problem is that buying a pet shop puppy amounts to a direct investment in the cruel puppy mill industry, which treats parent dogs as breeding machines and puppies as mere products.  
Sad to say, public records show that the puppy mill-to-pet store pipeline is thriving in Minnesota. We’ve connected puppy stores in the state to puppy mill facilities cited by the United States Department of Agriculture or a state agency for numerous violations of animal welfare laws. There are likely more Minnesota puppy mills cited for violations and involved in-state sales to pet shops, but there are limits to what we can determine since Minnesota state inspection reports are not made public.  
Even so, the simple fact that pet shops are sourcing dogs from puppy mills with violations remains disturbing, not least because the bar for legal compliance is so incredibly low. USDA-licensed breeders can legally confine breeding dogs to stacked, wire cages only six inches larger than their bodies for their entire lives. They can repeatedly and excessively breed dogs without limits, and they can kill dogs they no longer want. 
In a disturbing appraisal of federal inspection activities, a new internal audit by the USDA’s Inspector General documented major deficiencies in enforcement. The report stated that the pattern of continued noncompliance with Animal Welfare Act requirements by licensed dog breeders “poses a threat to the well-being and safety of their dogs, leaving them vulnerable to neglect, mistreatment and suffering.” 
Here in Minnesota, the puppy mill issue got so bad in Winona County that the County Commission voted to pursue a permanent ban on new breeders.  
Luckily, the solution to the puppy store problem is simple. There is a bill in the Legislature, SF 1943/HF 2627, that would phase out the sale of puppies in pet shops, banning any new stores from selling puppies and holding existing stores accountable for their sourcing of animals.   
This legislation tackles puppy mill cruelty, but breeding conditions are just the first stop when it comes to welfare issues in the dismal puppy mill-to-pet shop pipeline. It gets worse. Weeks-old puppies endure grueling and often filthy transports, and they are so likely to be sick they are often pumped with antibiotics, which has led to antibiotic-resistant infections that have spread to humans. 
Far too often, too, families end up with sick puppies, steep veterinary bills and heartbreak. They can also fall victim to predatory lending schemes when they take out a loan to pay the exorbitant price that puppy stores charge — often paying thousands of dollars and high interest rates. 
In fact, several customers have told the Minnesota Senate their story about buying sick dogs from a local puppy store, with some accounts that end with the death of their cherished pets. 
In-store conditions are troubling too. Humane World for Animals — formally called the Humane Society of the United States — has conducted undercover puppy store investigations across the nation and nearly each time we have uncovered awful in-store conditions, sick puppies and connections to puppy mills. Our most recent investigation, released in January 2025, detailed a heartbreaking scene in a Nevada store: In the store’s back room, a tiny brown-and-white Havanese puppy was vomiting and lethargic — and left entirely alone to suffer. Staff members failed to take the puppy to a veterinarian, and she later died. This is a common story at pet shops around the country — ailing puppies denied veterinary care and even a measure of human kindness. 
The massive animal welfare and consumer protection problems posed by puppy stores have led eight states and nearly 500 localities, including nine in Minnesota, to ban the sale of puppies in pet shops. Our state lawmakers should do the same. 
This is a commonsense policy because no Minnesotan needs a pet shop to find the pet of their choice.  Shelters, rescues and responsible breeders who go to great lengths to care for their dogs and only sell puppies directly to consumers will remain great options for pet acquisition. We are lucky to have a wide network of responsible breeders in the region, including 37 breeders who refuse to sell their puppies to pet stores, and have signed a letter acknowledging that only a puppy mill would do so. 
Further, no pet shop needs to sell puppies to be profitable. According to the American Pet Products Association, Americans spent $147 billion on their pets in 2023, with food, treats and product spending dominating. Pet spending is predicted to have “solid year-over-year growth through 2030.” Similarly,  Morgan Stanley reported the pet industry is “poised to nearly triple to $275 billion by 2030 thanks to a surge in new owners, favorable demographics and increased per-pet spending.” 
Any puppy store owner would be smart to transition away from the sale of puppies and towards a pet products and services model. Many have, including Angel’s Pet World in Hudson, Wisconsin, whose owner stated in her testimony to the Minnesota Senate, “some people ask me how that decision impacted my sales… within 2 years, our customer base grew about 70%.” 
SF1943/HF2627, led by Sens. Scott Dibble, DFL-Minneapolis and Jim Abeler, R-Anoak, and Reps. Matt Norris, Blaine, and Elliott Engen, R-White Bear Township, is a long overdue, bipartisan animal welfare and consumer protection measure that promises to bring genuine improvements in this area of concern. 
This issue is a matter of great public import and goes to the very heart of our duties of mercy and kindness toward animals.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-959093144-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

There are contests for nine Democrat-held legislative seats. Eight involve lawmakers appointed for the just-completed session who are seeking to stay in office. Winners will serve through 2026.
One race is to fill the vacancy created by the death of Democratic state Sen. Bill Ramos in April. The victor in November will serve the remaining three years of the term.
Here’s where things stand as filing gets underway.
Senate
26th District: Sen. Deb Krishnadasan, a Gig Harbor Democrat, wants to keep the seat she was appointed to after the district’s former state senator, Emily Randall, was elected to Congress. The district covers parts of Kitsap and Pierce Counties.
Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier of Gig Harbor is the lone GOP challenger to emerge so far. 
33rd District: Sen. Tina Orwall, D-Des Moines, served in the state House until she was chosen to succeed Sen. Karen Keiser, who retired. Orwall was the only candidate with a campaign committee as of Friday. The district includes Burien, Normandy Park, Des Moines, SeaTac, and much of Kent.
34th District: Sen. Emily Alvarado, D-Seattle, moved from the House to the Senate to replace Joe Nguyen when Gov. Bob Ferguson named him to lead the state Department of Commerce. The district includes West Seattle, Vashon Island, White Center, and part of Burien.
48th District: Sen. Vandana Slatter, D-Bellevue, served in the House until being appointed to succeed Patty Kuderer, following her election as Washington’s insurance commissioner. Rep. Amy Walen, D-Kirkland, who also sought the appointment, is challenging her former seatmate. The district covers communities in Redmond, Bellevue and Kirkland.
5th District: No one had publicly announced their candidacy as of Sunday. Meanwhile, a Democrat will be appointed to serve in the office through the election. That process is expected to get underway this month. The district covers Issaquah, Black Diamond, Covington, and part of Snoqualmie.
House
33rd District: Rep. Edwin Obras, D-SeaTac, was appointed to fill Orwall’s House seat. Kevin Schilling, a Democrat and the mayor of Burien, is gearing up to challenge him. 
34th District: Rep. Brianna Thomas, D-West Seattle, was tapped to succeed Alvarado in the House.
41st District: Rep. Janice Zahn, D-Bellevue, was appointed to replace Tana Senn who resigned to join Ferguson’s administration as secretary of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families. The district includes Mercer Island, Newcastle and part of Bellevue.

But much has changed since then: not least is her official entry into the race for the Democratic nomination for Michigan governor in 2026. 
Michigan Advance Editor Jon King spoke with Benson about the memoir, how her experiences – including writing “the book on secretaries of state” and becoming the youngest woman ever to lead a U.S. law school – led her to become Michigan’s top elections officer, as well as her campaign to become governor.
What follows is a conversation that has been edited for length and clarity. Advance questions are in bold, and Benson’s responses are in regular type.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Until now, the book you’re most associated with is 2010’s “State Secretaries of State,” a literal textbook on administering elections. Your latest is a memoir centered on your time as Michigan’s secretary of state. After more than six years in that role, what would you change in how you approached that first book?
That’s a great question. I think I certainly have found one of the key components of that first book, which was about the importance of being a professional, transparent secretary of state regardless of your party affiliation, regardless of whether you’re appointed or elected. That was really the essence to me of the book, that the person can lead. That still holds true today and a lot of what I experienced has just reinforced how important it is for the chief election officers in states like ours to be secretaries of state first before anything else. Meaning they’re professional, bipartisan, making sure government works for everyone, regardless of how someone votes or who they vote for.
 
  Cover image for Jocelyn Benson’s new book, “The Purposeful Warrior: Standing Up for What’s Right When the Stakes Are High”
In the “Purposeful Warrior” you talk about some of your personal heroes like Viola Liuzzo or Robert F. Kennedy, but you also mention [former Florida Secretary of State] Katherine Harris and [former Ohio Secretary of State] Kenneth Blackwell…
Not as heroes though (laughing). To me there are people who personified the stories of challenges, of turbulence, of things gone wrong. It’s a part of the book talking about finding inspiration as we define who we are and finding power in the stories of others to figure out what we want to do to respond to uncertain moments and build a better world. But the second component of the book is seeing every challenge, every missed opportunity, every bad example of leadership, as an opportunity for growth, or to get better. A big theme of of me bringing up someone like Katherine Harris was her, in my view, misuse of her office. And interference in a presidential election is what spurred me to want to be better and to do better and to be a secretary of state who would instead work to instill faith and security in the elections process. So, we can take positive examples through history or life to embolden us on our path, but negative examples of what not to do can also provide us with an opportunity to do better and to also build resilience, and I try to take something that was broken and fix it and put it back better.
 
There was a passage in your book where you talk about channeling rage into purpose, using the lemons into lemonade metaphor. How important of a philosophy is that for you? 
It is three steps of allowing yourself to be upset and angry, not trying to dismiss it or get past it, but staying in that state for as long as you need to and then finding eventually more of an objective take on a situation that enables you to make lemonade. Respond in such a way that is not just more powerful than otherwise might’ve been had that rage not initiated, but also something that is more effective in furthering your own hopes or vision for the world. We can use these moments that enrage us to inspire us to do more than otherwise might’ve been.
 
You start “The Purposeful Warrior” recounting the night in December 2020 that armed protesters supporting President Trump’s attempts to subvert the election results, showed up at your home in Detroit. You’re there alone with your young son. You describe obviously any parent’s fear and anxiety in that moment, and then finding a way forward.
It was very similar to that three step process we were talking about. As it was happening it was scary. It was terrifying. I didn’t know what was going to happen next. The uncertainty of that moment was really unnerving. The second step was to step back and say “Wait. They’re actually not protesting me. They’re protesting the voice of the people, the will of the people, the results of this election.” As soon as I made that connection, I found the strength to say, “Not on my watch.” 
 
You write about becoming the dean of the Wayne State University Law School, and your experience there, and then later when you became the Michigan secretary of state. Were they similar experiences in the sense of coming into a hidebound institution not necessarily welcome to change? And yet you brought change to both.
When I became secretary of state I had two goals: to increase voter turnout in our state across the board and to reduce wait times in our office. Everything we do is aligned with that and it means also being willing to take things apart and build them back again in a better or different way, which we did with our branch offices to achieve those goals. Similarly, when I became the dean at Wayne State Law School, we were in the bottom tier among law schools. The goal was to get into that top 50 and to build a plan to do that based on metrics and data and best practice. Ultimately it got to 55 in recent years, which was a great success. It starts with clear goals of where we’re headed, and those goals need to be bold and crystal clear. 
 
You came into the secretary of state position with a vision for how things could be done. What’s your vision for being Michigan’s governor? Why do you want to be governor? 
I’m a mom who has an 8-year-old kid, who in 10 years is going to be making decisions about whether or not he wants to stay in Michigan and whether or not we’ve given him, as a state, a good childhood with quality education where he wants to put down his roots. I want him to see Michigan is the best place to build his future, and I want the same for every family in the state, and that means ensuring that government works well. It means investing in public education and ensuring needed funding and support actually reaches the teachers and students who need it. So, whether it’s driving down costs on things like housing and food and childcare, whether it’s investing in our education system to, in my view, make us in the top 10 instead of the bottom 10 of public school systems nationwide, or simply just making government work better and more efficiently, I’ve done all of those things in other realms, and now I’m ready to put that skill set and that track record to work for the people in Michigan

In the book you talk about the lead up to the 2018 election. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan drafted a memo basically seeking to find somebody other than Gretchen Whitmer to run for governor, specifically a male Democrat like U.S. Sen. Gary Peters. Is that something you planned to include in the book before Duggan announced an independent bid for governor?
Yes. I began writing this book in 2021 in the wake of everything we experienced in 2020, really with a goal of telling that story and telling the story of what it was like both to stand up to powerful people like the president of the United States and protect the vote of Michiganders in 2020, and a part of telling that story also involved telling about how the women of Michigan provided support for each other and got to those positions in 2020.

(Getty Images)Every May, Mental Health America leads the state and nation in recognizing Mental Health Awareness Month.  Mental Health Awareness Month has been observed in May throughout the United States since 1949. The month is often observed with media, local events, proclamations, and even film screenings. The purpose is to raise awareness and educate the public about mental wellness and mental illness, to reduce the stigma around the disorder. Individuals oftentimes feel alone with their illness — when in fact, one in four are at lifetime risk.
But we need to do more. This year, we are not just raising awareness — we are turning that awareness into action!
The national theme for 2025 is: “Turn Awareness Into Action.” This is a call to go beyond the conversation and take real steps to improve mental well-being — whether that means checking in on a friend, calling your legislator, or reaching out for help yourself.
In Indiana, this movement is already underway.
Improving Hoosier mental health
Just a few years ago, our state ranked 42nd in the nation for mental health care access and outcomes. Mental Health Advocates, stakeholders, and legislators turned awareness into action in 2023 and made mental health a priority via SEA 1. SB 1 was the work product of the Indiana Behavioral Health Commission and authored by Senator Mike Crider. 
Today, thanks to targeted funding and legislative action, Indiana has climbed to 26th in the national ranking for behavioral health. This improvement has not been by chance, but rather the result of the strategic efforts of the Commission and the Indiana General Assembly. Legislators included a $50 million annual investment in behavioral health in HEA 1001-2023 as well as the building of the behavioral health infrastructure of crisis response, treatment access, and community care in SEA 1. While more is still needed, we have begun to take action.
Behavioral Health Commission wraps up two-year study with $50M ask

One of the most transformative examples is Indiana’s 988 Crisis & Suicide Lifeline. This program ensures that Hoosiers can speak to trained crisis counselors 24/7 — people who live here and understand the unique needs of our state. Mental Health America of Indiana is proud to operate one of these call centers, and we’ve seen call volume grow by 184% in the last year alone.
And behind every statistic is a story. One man called our 988 line literally with a gun to his head. Because of the assistance from the trained crisis counselor who answered, he put the gun down and agreed to safety planning. “You’ve literally saved my life,” he said. 
He was one — of many.  This is the power of action.
Every Hoosier can take action! In May 2025, this Mental Health Month, please take the first step:

Check your own mental health by taking a free, anonymous screening at https://mhascreening.org. It is totally anonymous.
Start conversations with those around you — ask, “How are you, really?”
Join the movement by advocating for continued state support of Indiana’s mental health system, including funding for 988 and Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs). 
Wear green in support of Mental Health Month and join us in being “Seen in Green” this May.
Support Mental Health America of Indiana, which provides direct care and statewide advocacy every day. To be part of MHAI, go to: https://www.mhai.net.

The truth is, every Hoosier has the power to turn awareness into action. Whether it’s through a phone call, a conversation, or a policy change — you can help build a mentally healthier Indiana.
Please join us to keep moving Indiana forward. Turn your own awareness into action.

Diana Gonzales Worthen, a Springdale Democrat and the Legislature's first Latina, explains her opposition to a proposed law that would “prohibit discrimination or preferential treatment” by public entities on the House floor on Thursday, February 6, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)After a nearly three-week recess, Arkansas lawmakers return to the Capitol Monday to officially adjourn the 2025 legislative session, which brand new legislators described as a busy and humbling experience. 
Rep. Brad Hall, a first-term Republican lawmaker and cattle rancher in Rudy, said House Speaker Brian Evans, R-Cabot, mentored and prepared new legislators, but it was “mindblowing” to see how much work was involved once the session got underway. 
“It was really daunting, kind of overwhelming at first … it’s like drinking from a firehose,” Hall said. “The truth is you cannot really be effective as a freshman because you don’t know what you’re doing until it’s almost over.” 
Hall was one of thirteen non-incumbents elected in November to a two-year term in the Arkansas House. Twelve were brand new state legislators while Rep. Tracy Steele, D-North Little Rock, previously served in the Arkansas Legislature from 1999 to 2013.
Steele filled the House District 72 seat left vacant by Sen. Jamie Scott, D-North Little Rock, who was elected to the Senate and was the only new member of the upper chamber. 
Hall and other members of the House’s freshman class agreed there was a big learning curve and said they were shocked by the sheer volume of legislation considered over the course of three months.
Freshman class of Arkansas lawmakers includes educators and ranchers

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed more than 1,000 bills into law and vetoed four others. Lawmakers can vote to override the governor’s vetoes with a simple majority in both chambers before the sine die adjournment of a legislative session. 
Once first-term legislators got a handle on the bill-making process, they learned the importance of relationships both inside and outside of the statehouse. 
“The biggest takeaway was just really the amount of running that you do,” Siloam Springs Republican Rep. Randy Torres said. “You must learn the what, the how and the who simultaneously and very quickly, especially if you want to be effective and run bills and do the full legislative responsibility in your first year.”
Torres said he learns by doing, so he filed his first bill a few days after being sworn into office in January. Presenting to a committee the first time was “brutal” because of tough questions from his colleagues. His proposal had to be amended, but Torres, who works in banking, said he was grateful for the experience because it helped him better understand the process. 
The legislation that Torres said he’s “very honored” and proud to have sponsored and that he feels will be most impactful is Act 147, which will allow a person’s blood type to be placed on their driver’s license or identification card. Every member of the House’s freshman class signed on as cosponsors of Torres’ bill.
After introducing his legislation, Torres said he was contacted by blood banks around the country excited about his proposal because they said it would encourage people to donate blood so they could learn their blood type.
“Then also in the rural areas of our state, blood supply is very limited and so really knowing that you’re not going to have to use your universal O negative all the time will be very helpful,” Torres said. 
Rep. Jessie McGruder, D-Marion, said he was proud to be the lead sponsor of a new law that will require an early voting location in cities that have more than 15,000 residents. The West Memphis teacher and football coach said he filed the legislation in response to a legal battle over early voting in his district last fall.
“It was embarrassing what happened in my district that the election commission couldn’t come to a resolution on the fact that they needed to have an early voting location in West Memphis, which is the biggest municipality in Crittenden County, and we had to go before the [Arkansas] Supreme Court,” McGruder said. “So I wanted to make sure that everybody has the access to early voting within my area.”

Fighting for constituents back home was very important to freshman lawmakers in the House, including Rep. Diana Gonzales Worthen, D-Springdale. The longtime educator represents the state’s first Hispanic-majority district and is the first Latina elected to the Arkansas Legislature. 
“It was a very humbling experience to be the voice of 30,000 people, so they were carried in my heart as I was reading new bills and [considering] how this would impact my community,” she said. 
House District 9 is one of the most diverse districts in the state, so Gonzales Worthen said she was especially proud of her ability to bring awareness to the benefits and consequences of immigrant-related bills.  
“Our diversity, that’s our strength, but a lot of times individuals do not see that as our strength,” she said. 
Although the Republican Party has a supermajority in the Arkansas Legislature, Gonzales Worthen said it was still important to speak against bills she didn’t agree with so people could gain a better understanding of legislation. The Springdale Democrat spoke in opposition to a number of bills, including one that would “prohibit discrimination or public entities.”
Gonzales Worthen said she was disappointed in the passage of Act 116 of 2025, which eliminates required minority recruitment and retention plans and reports from public school districts and higher education institutions. The law also repeals language in state procurement proposals that encouraged minority participation or required bidders to adopt an equal opportunity hiring program designed to increase the percentage of minority employees.

McGruder, a member of the Arkansas Legislative Black Caucus, said he cried and hugged his 10-month-old granddaughter following the law’s passage because he’s “worried about the future when people don’t have adequate representation.”
“It hurts me, because it wasn’t that minorities are not comfortable or adequate or qualified for positions, it’s that the implementation of that [law] will not allow us to even be in the room anymore,” he said. “All we need is to be in the room. Most of the time we’re overqualified for the position we’re applying for, but that bill is going to hurt minorities in the future.”
For Arkansans who are considering a run for the Arkansas Legislature, this year’s freshman class recommended reaching out to retired lawmakers for advice and visiting the Capitol when lawmakers are in session to get a better understanding of the process. They also suggested speaking with family and coworkers who would also be impacted by a decision to seek office.
Additionally, they emphasized the importance of listening to and being available to the constituents they represent and who helped them get elected.
“The lobbyists down there, they’re going to be there whether you get elected or not, so you need to listen to the people that sent you there … just pay attention to what’s going on back home, and if you make them people happy, then you’ll be OK,” Hall said. “You can’t make everybody happy all the time, but you do the best you can.”
Despite the pace of the legislative session, Hall said he’ll be back because he wants “to fight for people that can’t fight for themselves.” Torres, Gonzales Worthen and McGruder said they also intend to seek reelection for the 2026 election cycle. The filing period for candidates for the Arkansas Legislature is Nov. 3-12.

The uncertainty is nothing new for Hailey, who has been in foster care since she was 2 and became pregnant at 15. After being told abortion wasn’t an option, she was determined to be a mom in the hopes of keeping her daughter from repeating the traumatic childhood she experienced.
Hailey was taken from the home of her great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, with whom she’d been living during her pregnancy, just days before going into labor. Postpartum, Hailey was shuffled between foster homes, hospitals and group homes across Missouri and occasionally separated from her daughter for long stretches. Her pleas to live with with Spradley — who is just as eager to take her in — largely went ignored. 
Hailey’s story, which was published by The Independent last week, drew immediate outrage from across the political spectrum and from all sides of the abortion debate, highlighting systemic issues advocates and lawmakers have spent years trying to fix.
A Missouri teen spent her life in foster care. Now she’s fighting the state to keep her baby

“The workers at the Children’s Division probably meant well,” said Richard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, after reading The Independent’s reporting. “But if they had deliberately set out to emotionally torture three generations of a single family — Hailey, her aunt and, most important, her infant — they couldn’t have done a more thorough, efficient job of it than they did and continue to do in this case.”
State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, called Hailey’s case “an amalgamation of all of the horrible things that can happen to kids when they’re in care.” 
“This poor kid has just absolutely had the state fail her over and over and over again,” said Coleman, who has long advocated for improvements to the state’s foster care system as well as increased resources for mothers and their children. “And to then be portrayed as if the child is the problem is really horrifying.”
Hailey’s story is a checklist of the issues lawmakers have been trying to fix for years, Coleman said, from the failure to place Hailey with a family member, failure to get foster benefits to that family member and the confiscation of Hailey’s Social Security benefits, among others. 
The number of children in foster care in Missouri outpaces the national average. There is also scrutiny on how long these children remain in the system. In fiscal year 2024, roughly 44% of Missouri foster children were reunited with their family within a year of entering the system. The federal government wants to see 75% reunification rates.
Hailey receives Social Security benefits because her mother died when she was a child. She is among the more than 1,200 foster kids who had those benefits seized by the state last year. Children’s Division told an advocate helping Hailey that her $400 a month in benefits was being put toward Medicaid expenses and the cost of her transportation to doctor’s appointments.
Last week, lawmakers passed an expansive child welfare bill. Included is a provision, if signed into law by the governor, that would ban the state from seizing Social Security benefits from foster kids. 
Former Republican state Rep. Hannah Kelly filed numerous pieces of legislation over the years seeking improvements to the child welfare system, including a version of the legislation that passed this year. She is calling for a “major overhaul” of Missouri’s Department of Social Services after reading Hailey’s story, blaming the systematic failures on inconsistent leadership.
“These are actual lives on the line, kids’ lives are on the line and we need a system that empowers families, both biological and foster, to do what is right for the children. Then everything else will work itself around that,” said Kelly, who left the House last year due to term limits and is now running for state Senate. 
Hailey’s experience goes to show, Coleman said, that while fixing state law is important, it’s not enough.
“The focus has to be on leadership in the department,” Coleman said. 
In March, the Department of Social Services announced the appointment of Sara Smith as the new director of Children’s Division, which investigates child abuse allegations and overseas the foster care system. Smith in a recent interview with the Kansas City Star emphasized her focus on safety. The prior administration’s public priorities centered on keeping more families together. 
Baylee Watts, a spokeswoman for the Department of Social Services, said in an email Friday said Smith wants to improve Children’s Division’s training and curriculum, as well as put “a heightened emphasis on follow through support in response to Newborn Crisis Assessments, which involve calls concerning the well-being of children under one year of age made by medical professionals.”
 Lack of resources

Wexler, with the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, called the “rampant confusion of poverty with neglect” the largest problem in child welfare. 
Hailey’s story is a prime example of this, he said, and a look at how families attempt to “cobble together a safety net” only to have it torn apart by the state, including by seizing Hailey’s Social Security payments. 
“But that’s not the only tragedy,” Wexler said. “Think of all the time, money and effort devoted to destroying this family. All of it was, in effect, stolen from finding some child in real danger who really did need to be removed from her or his home. And that’s almost always the reason for the tragic deaths that, rightly, make headlines.”
Hailey’s experience as a teen mom in foster care would have been vastly different if she lived in Illinois, said Amy Dworsky, a senior research fellow at Chapin Hall, a youth and families research and policy center in Chicago.
For youth who choose to parent, the state has a Teen Parenting Services Network to help minors in foster care, Dworsky said. Hailey may even have been assigned a doula to help support her through pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum. 
While Missouri has funneled millions of dollars into pregnancy resource centers and Alternatives to Abortion programs, Spradley said Hailey was not informed of how they could have helped their family. The only program she and Hailey said they were told about was a maternity home in the St. Louis area that Hailey initially resisted going to, saying she instead wanted to stay with her great-aunt.
Hailey and Spradley were often left to fend for themselves during Hailey’s pregnancy, Spradley said, forced to reach out to nonprofits to help them secure housing and calling on friends to help prepare and furnish their apartment for a baby. Their cabinets were stocked with items from local food pantries.

Sam Lee, a longtime anti-abortion lobbyist who has assisted with legislation that supports mothers and children, said he hopes Children’s Division can better work with the family to connect to resources.
“While the living situation of the three together might be less than perfect, it’s far better than the constant displacement and separation ordered by state workers,” Lee said. “A caring family — even one living in poverty and with difficulties — is far better than no permanent family at all.”
Kelley Fong, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine, said it was notable how much Hailey did to prepare for her daughter’s arrival. She enrolled in teen parenting classes and lined up transportation to prenatal appointments. Spradley and her friends helped purchase and gather baby gear. 
“It’s hard to imagine what else they could have been doing to convey to the state their commitment to caring for this baby,” Fong said. 
The state seemed determined, Fong said, to “take the baby and put the baby somewhere else, which may or may not be safer for them, instead of trying to address the underlying conditions that they’re concerned about.”
What the state didn’t seem to be paying attention to, she said, is the family member who continues expressing a desire to take Hailey in.
“There’s this person that’s willing and interested and ready to help and support mom and baby however she can, and potentially, the only challenge she’s facing is poverty, as she describes,” Fong said of Spradley. “So it’s really striking that rather than provide her with what she needs to provide a stable home for mom and baby, the response is just to separate everyone. That is extremely traumatic for the new mom, for the baby, for everyone involved.”
Spradley started fighting for Hailey to be with family immediately after Hailey’s mother died in 2011. Hailey was 4 years old at the time and living with a foster family. 
In an email to then-Gov. Jay Nixon’s office, Spradley said she was writing “with concerns about Child Protective Services” and what she saw as their unwillingness to reunite Hailey with family.
“Hailey is all we have left of my niece… and we love her very much,” Spradley wrote in the email more than 13 years ago. 
She received an automated reply.
 ‘…not going to be passed around anymore’

Soon after the Department of Social Services responded to a request for comment to The Independent last month, Hailey and Spradley got good news for the first time in weeks. 
Hailey’s case worker called Spradley to inform her the state would allow Hailey and her daughter to return to Spradley’s care, at least until a court made a more permanent placement decision. While they waited for Hailey to return to Spradley’s home in Cuba, Hailey was authorized by the state to stay temporarily with a longtime friend of Spradley’s in Illinois. 
By Friday morning, the smidge of calm that had settled over the family was again decimated when an email from the state indicated Hailey would be moved into a new foster home that wouldn’t allow her to have her daughter with her. 
The state reversed course by Friday afternoon, and Hailey and her daughter were allowed to return to Spradley’s home. Hailey remains in the custody of Children’s Division, but can live with Spradley for an “indeterminate period” until a judge decides on a permanent placement.
When Hailey heard the news, she burst into a huge smile and started clapping, Spradley said. Earlier that day Hailey said she’d been so nervous she had picked a spot on her skin until it bled.
Now her voice was bright. Hailey said that she felt “great.”
“I know that we’re not going to be passed around anymore,” she told The Independent.
Spradley said despite the good news, their journey and her mission isn’t over. 
“We still want to protect other kids,” Spradley said. “We don’t want to just stop with Hailey. We want other kids who don’t have the support that Hailey has, we want to speak for them, too.” 
Hailey can exhale and focus on being a mother.

Last week, Spradley reached out to Coleman, who has since been working with the family to get answers in a case she described as “a litany of the scale of the human cost when these things are so badly handled.” 
Coleman encourages anyone facing similar struggles to reach out to their state lawmakers. 
 She believes in Hailey’s future as a successful adult because of her determination to advocate for herself and for her daughter “in the face of all this tragedy.”  
“She’s going to be able to have a happy life,” Coleman said. “I’m hopeful for her, but that’s in spite of, not because of, any of the care that she’s received.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8677-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-05 07:00:52.916404

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)An Assembly panel on Monday will consider a spate of bills meant to ease the impact of electricity prices set to surge in June.
Among the bills are measures that would alter how state regulators set profit margins for utilities, create training requirements for those regulators, and require the Board of Public Utilities to study the impact data centers have on electricity prices.
“We’re not going to find a one-fix silver bullet that’s going to solve the entire issue. It’s going to need to be piecemeal,” said Assemblyman Avi Schnall (D-Ocean), a sponsor of one of the bills. We’re going to have to find a little bit here and a little bit there and a little bit over there.”
The hearing comes about a month before electricity prices are set to surge upward by roughly 20% as a result of price-setting auctions held in July and February. The increase could add approximately $25 to an average customer’s monthly bill.
Schnall’s bill would require the Board of Public Utilities to use a stricter standard when setting utilities’ return on equity rates — the rate at which they are allowed to profit on infrastructure and other investments.
At present, most New Jersey utilities’ return on equity rates hovers around 9.6%. Utility providers are not permitted to profit off the sale of electricity itself — they sell it to customers at cost — but they can recoup costs for other investments, including capital costs, that are typically passed directly along to consumers.
The bill would require the BPU to approve the “lowest reasonable” return on equity, rather than the fair and reasonable standard used under existing regulations. It’s not clear how much the change would affect utility bills (parts of the measure would take effect months after being signed into law).
“More money going back to customers is more money going back to customers,” Schnall said.
Other bills in the package would require utilities to return excess profits to ratepayers as a direct credit to future bills or through direct payments to customers who have unpaid bills or are enrolled in utility assistance programs.
The BPU also sets revenue requirements for New Jersey utilities.
Republican officials have blamed Gov. Phil Murphy’s ambitious clean energy goals — and his focus on offshore wind projects that are now stalled under the Trump administration — for growing rates.
Assemblyman Christian Barranco (R-Morris), an electrician by trade, panned most of the bills on the committee’s Monday agenda, warning measures to limit utilities’ profitability would limit their ability to attract the investment needed to upgrade their infrastructure. Barranco’s comments echo concerns utility operators voiced at a legislative hearing on electricity prices in late April.
He noted Jersey Central Power and Light had recently pared down a $930.5 million infrastructure investment plan by nearly 80% in a bid to keep rates down.
“That’s what’s going to be affected, that sort of investment — that sort of keeping up with the reliability of the infrastructure that we’d like to see in a first-world country like ours,” Barranco said.
He praised a separate bill that would appropriate $5 million for the BPU to study the feasibility of small modular nuclear reactors statewide.
One Republican member expressed cautious support for the bill package but warned that, while the bills could help control the cost of electricity in the long run, they would do little to relieve the short-term impact of surging prices.
“I think it’s a package that is not going to help ratepayers anytime soon,” said Assemblyman Alex Sauickie (R-Ocean).
He said Republican proposals to lower or suspend the societal benefits charge — a 3% surcharge on all New Jersey electricity bills — or exempt utility services from the state’s sales tax would deliver more immediate relief.
Democrats have said that PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey, 12 other states, and the District of Columbia, is to blame for the rate spikes because the interconnector has been slow to add some renewable projects to its grid.
Utility prices may become an even more pressing concern for low-income New Jerseyans in the next federal fiscal year. President Donald Trump has proposed zeroing out just over $4 billion in funding for a low-income home energy assistance program.
“The Budget proposes to end this program and to instead support low-income individuals through energy dominance, lower prices, and an America First economic platform,” the Trump administration said in a budget document released Friday.
New Jersey received nearly $133 million in awards under the program, which is meant to provide heating and cooling assistance to households making no more than 60% of the state’s median income. That cutoff was $92,108 for a four-person household in the current federal fiscal year.
New Jersey Department of Community Affairs Commissioner Jacquelyn Suárez told state Senate lawmakers last week that she expected New Jersey to receive federal funds for the program approved for the current federal fiscal year, which runs through Sept. 30, but her department had not been told that the program would not be funded in the following federal fiscal year.

Thomas/Getty Images).There are two weeks remaining in the 2025 legislative session. While there will be a flurry of last-minute maneuvering, lawmakers have had ample time to address some long-standing needs for Missouri and its residents.
How would you evaluate what they have accomplished?
We may have different lists with different priorities, but there are surely some commonalities among them.
Do the current proposed budgets coming from the governor, House and Senate provide adequate funding for public education? A conference committee will convene this week to debate and hash out the final details of the budget.
But when it comes to providing the needed funding for K-12 education, the negotiations between what the governor proposed and that of the House and Senate portend to be tough.
The outcome will determine how much Missouri’s children in public schools stand to be short-changed.
What about adequate funding for child care, which is a major problem in Missouri? The governor and Senate have included money in their proposals. The House has not.
There are also differences in the proposed funding from all three branches for needed funding for repairs and maintenance at the state’s colleges and universities.
The same is true for the state employee pay plan. The governor and Senate are proposing one level of funding and the House another.
In addition to those areas, the conference committee will have to decide whether they are going to keep nearly a half-billion dollars of earmarks, taxpayers dollars to be spent for special projects across the state.
Have you been keeping up with the budget proposals for education and child care?
What about the substantial dollars being proposed for special projects?
Is there a special earmark(s) included to address some pressing need in your city or community?
These are questions that we should be asking the senators and representatives we have sent to Jefferson City to fight for our needs, priorities and interests.
We only have a few days left to make our wishes known.
What about the non-budgetary issues that are so critical to the wellbeing and quality of life of Missourians?
While the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the law requiring paid sick leave for employees, which took effect May 1, there is a bill still in the Senate awaiting passage that would repeal paid sick leave and change minimum wage increase that took effect in January.
Proposition A, which increases the minimum wage and requires paid sick leave, passed by 58% of Missouri voters. Yet, the legislature insists on trying to repeal it.
The abortion issue that we thought was settled with the passage of Amendment 3 by 52% of voters is once again consuming a lot of legislative time and effort. A proposed constitutional amendment passed out of a Senate committee that will once again ban abortions. The amendment can be placed on the ballot in 2026 or sooner if the governor decides to do so.
Missouri lawmakers still seem determined to disregard and thwart the will of the majority of Missourians.
Why?
Who and what are they working for in Jefferson City?
What is their end game?
If lawmakers are consumed with trying to undo the will of the people, how much time are they spending anticipating and trying to find solutions to other major problems that the state and a large number of Missourians face now and long-term?
Missouri has a severe shortage of affordable housing and a homelessness problem. You would think that would be at the top of every legislative session until solutions are found. Instead, a bill making it more difficult for low-income renters to secure housing seems poised to head to the governor’s desk.
Is there any planning taking place about how the state will support farmers and other businesses should catastrophic and costly tariffs be put in place?
What happens if there are detrimental cuts to Medicaid, Social Security and Medicare?
Tens of thousands of Missourians stand to be negatively and severely affected.
Are our state senators and representatives working with our members of Congress trying to mount efforts to minimize the negative and costly effects of tariffs and drastic cuts in other areas on our state and fellow Missourians?
Are there even efforts to communicate how traumatic those impending tariffs and cuts will be?
Lawmakers are left to focus on whatever they desire, or the causes of those who have their ear. Are you among those who have their ear, making your needs and expectations known?
Getting needed policies and laws over the finish line is not a sprint but a marathon.
They require gaining understanding and training on how to apply effective and sustained engagement with your lawmakers. Focusing a couple of weeks or months before an election is simply not sufficient to win the policy race.
The state budget must be finalized by Friday. Everything else must be completed before the legislature adjourns for the year at 6 p.m. on May 16.
There is still time to make your voice heard.
Are you pleased with how they have addressed the needs of your family, your community, your city?

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Ahead of action this week on Congressional legislation that could provide the first hard details on proposed cuts to Medicaid, Wisconsin lawmakers are urging constituents to push back against cutting health care coverage.
“One of the most powerful things we can do right now is to elevate stories and talk about how compelling a need there is for robust investment in the Medicaid program,” Sen. Tammy Baldwin told a group of Medicaid recipients at a roundtable discussion in Madison on Friday.
Republicans in Congress are trying to extend federal tax cuts enacted in 2017, during President Donald Trump’s first term. Unless renewed, the 2017 tax cuts will expire at the end of 2025.
Congressional Republicans want to offset $4.5 trillion that extending the 2017 tax cuts will add to the federal deficit over 10 years. Based on their original blueprint, Medicaid has been in the spotlight as a likely target, and this week GOP leaders in the U.S. House are expected to release their first concrete proposals.
Medicaid covers about 1.3 million Wisconsin residents — roughly one in five people in the state, according to the state Department of Health Services (DHS). Those include nearly 900,000 low-income people who have primary health care and hospital services though BadgerCare Plus.
More than 260,000 people who are elderly, blind, or have other disabilities have coverage through Medicaid, including for long-term care in nursing homes or in their own homes or the community. And another 244,000 Wisconsinites have Medicaid coverage through a variety of other special programs.
Extending the 2017 tax cuts will benefit the richest 1% of the population most, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) found.
“In order to give tax breaks for the rich, what do they want to cut? Medicaid. It’s one of the biggest targets,” Baldwin, a Democrat, told participants in the Madison roundtable. “So from the folks who are most vulnerable, to transfer money to those who are billionaires and millionaires and multi-millionaires — it is criminal in my mind. It’s immoral.”
Baldwin’s event was one of two held Friday to highlight Medicaid’s importance in Wisconsin. In Eau Claire, state Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) convened a discussion that included providers and Medicaid recipients.
Emerson’s discussion was joined via Zoom by Chiquita Brooks-LaSure administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) under former President Joe Biden
“These attacks on the Medicaid program can be devastating if they go through,” Brooks-LaSure told the Wisconsin Examiner in a phone interview. “Not just for the millions of low-income people who need help, not just for the millions of middle-class families who depend on Medicaid — particularly for nursing home care, care in the home to keep you out of the nursing home, and children with special needs, whether it be autism services, whether it be developmental disabilities or physical disabilities.”
The existence of Medicaid helps the overall health care economy in the long run, Brooks-LaSure said.
Under federal law, hospitals must ensure that patients who show up in their emergency rooms are stable before they leave. But if a person’s care isn’t covered, “the entire health care system pays for that.”
Medicaid recipients who met with Baldwin described their anxiety over the prospect of losing coverage.
For Laurel Burns, who was born with no arms, Medicaid has enabled her to have health care for herself and for her two sons, now teens, whom she’s raised as a single mother after their father left.
“Being disabled has been a struggle my whole life. It’s like every twist and turn is up a steep hill,” Burns told Baldwin. Medicaid support, however, has enabled her to have health care at home, including needed assistance with grocery shopping and housekeeping.
She has been able to get a college degree and landed a part-time job working for an insurance agent.
“I would love to work full time, but the job market and being disabled is really difficult to navigate,” Burns said. “With all these cuts and threats to the program, it’s really scary for somebody like me who doesn’t have a large family.”
Megan Hufton, the single mother of two teenage boys who have autism and don’t speak, said that in addition to the support Medicaid has provided her sons as part of the program’s disability services, schools get Medicaid support to help pay for services such as occupational therapy. “I’m very nervous about the future,” Hufton said.
Baldwin’s discussion was held at Common Threads, a Medicaid-funded agency in Madison that provides mental health, rehab and alternative education services.
Liv Lacayo, who works with Common Threads clients and their families, said Medicaid enables them to get routine care so they don’t have to use emergency services as they might have to otherwise.
Without Medicaid, she said, she worries that families would be struggling for support.
Brett Maki, who must use a motorized wheelchair to get around, said Medicaid has made it possible for him to live independently, getting daily help with cooking, cleaning and laundry — “all of the basic necessities that I would need to live my life to the fullest.”
Without that, “I don’t even want to think about what that means,” he said.

(Photo by Phil Ashley/Getty Images)(This image cannot be republished unless you have a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY – Tens of thousands of more Oklahomans would be able to afford housing if the state’s minimum wage were raised to $15 an hour, according to a new report.
Up to 40,000 households would no longer pay 30% or more on rent with the increased minimum wage, according to the report issued by Scioto Analysis, which has offices around the country and provides analysis of issues to public policymakers.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development defines anyone who is spending more than 30% of their income on housing as “housing cost burdened,” which is high, said Rob Moore, principal with Scioto Analysis. 
“If you are spending over 50% of your income on housing, you are considered very housing cost burdened,” Moore said.
If the minimum wage was increased, up to 32,000 Oklahoma households would no longer spend more than half of their income on rent, according to the report.
Lower-income Oklahomans spend a larger proportion of their income on housing, according to the report.
The report was commissioned by This Land Research and Communications, a project of the Oklahoma Donor Alliance. The Donor Alliance is a nonprofit that funds strategic research projects.
The groups are not affiliated with Raise the Wage Oklahoma, which collected enough signatures to get a state question seeking to increase the minimum wage on the June 16, 2026 ballot.
If approved by voters, State Question 832 would gradually increase the $7.25 an hour minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2029. Additional increases would be tied to the cost of living measured by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Consumer Price Index.
The report said increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour would result in as many as 550 fewer Oklahomans experiencing homelessness. Chronic homelessness would drop by 150 people a year, according to the report.
Oklahoma has seen a dramatic increase in homelessness, doubling in the past three years, according to the report.
More than 64% of chronically homeless Oklahomans live in Tulsa or Oklahoma City, according to the report.

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

Despite a more narrow intent in the Idaho Legislature, two child welfare attorneys worry that broad language in Senate Bill 1181 could have far-reaching effects in legal cases for parental rights termination, which some attorneys call the “civil death penalty.”
There are two ways parental rights termination cases can be brought: By the state — often initiated by a state health department, or by a private party, such as one parent wanting to end the rights of another parent. 
The law could make Idaho one of only four states in the U.S. that don’t guarantee a right to counsel in state-initiated parental rights termination cases, according to the National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel.
“We’ve not really seen a state go backwards on this before Idaho,” John Pollock, an attorney and coordinator with the coalition, told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview.
But Idaho lawmakers who sponsored the bill say they believe the bill won’t work that way.
Instead, the lawmakers say the law’s impact will be more narrow: It would just revoke the automatic right to counsel in parental right termination cases brought by private parties, as opposed to the state. 
And they say the new law outlines a process for the court to grant counsel rights to certain parents under what is called a legal indigency test, which is commonly used to appoint public defense attorneys in criminal cases.
Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, cosponsored the bill in the House. He says the bill was widely negotiated and narrowly crafted.
“We were careful to make sure that we said that that counsel can still be provided if constitutionally required. And that’s how several states do it right now,” Manwaring told the Sun in an interview.

 How public defense rights work in parental rights termination cases. And how this new Idaho law changes it.

The law takes effect July 1. 
The new law makes two changes to how public defenders work on parental rights termination cases:

The bill amends an Idaho law around parental rights termination, to specify counsel shall be provided “only if such representation is constitutionally required.” That is in addition to existing language in the law that allows the right to legal counsel in those cases, if requested “and the parent or guardian is financially unable to employ counsel.” 
The bill also amends an Idaho law about broader right to legal counsel that guarantees the right to an attorney in cases brought under Idaho’s Child Protective Act. The new bill adds language “excluding actions brought exclusively under” Idaho’s parental rights termination law, found in Idaho Code Title 16 Chapter 20. 

Those two changes are what worries Mary Shea, an Idaho child welfare attorney and previous Democratic candidate for the Idaho Legislature in Pocatello.
First, there’s no constitutional requirement for counsel in parental rights termination cases, she said. The U.S. Constitution’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies in criminal cases, not civil cases — like parental right termination cases.
In a 1981 ruling, the United States Supreme Court clarified that indigent parents didn’t have a constitutional right to counsel in parental rights termination cases.

In that ruling, the court said it “would not force states to provide counsel for termination of parental rights cases except on a ‘case-by-case basis,’” Shea said. “And nobody really knows what that means. But basically that the court said if the case was sufficiently complex or complicated, that a parent’s parental due process rights would be violated. Only in the most difficult cases where without an attorney, it just is not a fair process, would counsel be required.”
In Idaho, attorneys will now have to go before judges in every parental rights termination case to make the case for right to counsel, Shea said.
The new law’s second change also effectively eliminates the right to a state-appointed public defender in all parental rights cases, she said.
“I personally believe that there should be a right to counsel in every termination of parental rights cases — because the rights at stake are so important,” Shea said.

 Bill meant to require legal indigency test in private parental rights termination cases

Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, the bill’s original cosponsor, said when he was a prosecutor, judges would ask defendants requesting a public defender about their financial circumstances. If they met the criteria, then an attorney was appointed. 
That’s the sort of vetting process he sought to bring in privately initiated parental rights termination cases through his bill.
Asked if he agreed with the concern the bill would revoke all right to counsel in these cases, Lakey said “we can see how it goes, but I don’t think so.”
In 2024, when the state took over the management of the public defense system from Idaho counties, Manwaring said officials didn’t expect they’d be providing legal counsel in private parental termination cases. 
He said there’s always been an indigency test in these cases, but Manwaring didn’t know if it was happening. 
“I think the reason it is is because a lot of times in these cases, the majority of them probably are indigent,” he said. 
In privately initiated termination cases, Manwaring said lawmakers believe counsel shouldn’t be automatically provided. By instead allowing a judge to determine if counsel should be provided, he argued the state can analyze the scope of how many private cases get counsel appointments.
“Because these are taxpayer funds,” Manwaring said. “This is a state agency. We want to be careful that we’re not overstepping the bounds of what the state should be paying for.”

Idaho State Public Defender Office spokesperson Patrick Orr said the office believes its public defenders should not be representing parents in privately brought cases. If a court appoints legal counsel in a privately initiated case, he said “it will be up to others to decide how to find, assign, and pay attorneys to represent clients in private termination cases.”
“Our office, which provides indigent criminal defense representation and representation for parents in Child Protective Act cases where the state seeks to interfere with the parent-child relationship, should not be providing legal representation in disputes between private parties,” Orr told the Sun in an email.
 Parents representing themselves face difficult prospect, attorney says

Parents would have a tough time representing themselves, Shea said.

“If you don’t understand the rules of civil procedure or the rules of evidence, if you don’t know how to get your questions about the other side’s case answered in the discovery process of litigation, and if you don’t know how to argue your case to a judge — it would be very difficult for a parent to go against an attorney on the other side and succeed,” she said. 
But even if lawmakers had fixed the bill to just end the right to counsel in privately brought parental termination cases, Pollock said his legal advocacy group would still have an issue with the bill. 
Several courts have struck down that distinction to only remove the right to counsel only in privately initiated cases, ruling those moves violate equal protection, he said. 
 Bill attempts to clarify public defense roles, amid rocky new system

The bill is an attempt to clarify public defender roles months into Idaho’s troubled switch from county-level public defenders to a state-managed public defense office. 
In October 2024, Idaho officially transferred public defense from Idaho’s 44 counties into the new statewide agency, called the Office of the State Public Defender.
During that transition, some public defenders quit, citing new pay cuts. 
The ACLU of Idaho, which sued the state in 2015 alleging Idaho’s public defense system violated low-income people’s constitutional right to counsel, in January asked the Idaho Supreme Court to intervene in the new public defense system. The organization alleged “countless indigent defendants have appeared in courts” across Idaho without representation from the State Public Defender’s Office, the Sun previously reported.

Manwaring said the bill was meant to be a first step to smooth out kinks in the transition. And he expects more tweaks in the years ahead. 
“We know we’re going to continue to look at this carefully and make adjustments going forward that need to happen, including in this lane of termination of parental rights cases,” Manwaring said. “If we don’t have this right, we’re going to make sure we’re going to continue to review this and make those amendments going forward if we need to.”
In March, lawmakers introduced the bill. Within two weeks, it passed both chambers of the Legislature — one day before this year’s legislative session ended.
In the House’s committee hearing on the bill, Shea testified about her concern that the bill would end all right to counsel in parental termination cases.
Then the House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee slated the bill for amendments. But in the final days of the Legislature, the House passed the bill without amendments. 
Asked why the bill wasn’t amended, Manwaring said lawmakers were able to address concerns among committee members about the bill in the meantime.
Less than two weeks after it passed the House and Senate, Gov. Brad Little signed it into law. The governor’s office could not be immediately reached for comment.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Republican lawmakers are introducing bills to review every statewide administrative rule and impose new limits on the rulemaking process, saying there are too many regulations currently and they put operational obstacles and financial burdens on businesses.
GOP Lawmakers have raised objections to agencies’ administrative rulemaking process — and the power of the executive branch — for many years and have taken action to exert more control over the process and to limit the authority of state agencies and the governor. The REINS Act, signed into law by former Gov. Scott Walker in 2017, for example, required lawmakers’ approval for regulations that might cost more than $10 million over a two-year period.
“A lot of what’s been done in the past has looked at when you’re implementing new rules — what is the process? Who is writing the rules?” Rep. Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee), who introduced the bill that became 2017 Wisconsin Act 57, said at a press conference last week.
“What [the] REINS Act is not able to do is go back and reset it all,” Neylon added. “We’re looking at the stack of rules that have accumulated over the years that are piling up… We need a reset.”
One of four GOP bills would require agencies to make cuts to offset the cost associated with new regulations. 
Under the bill, coauthored by Rep. Nate Gustafson (R-Fox Crossing) and Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin), agencies with a new rule proposal would have to stop work on the process until they’ve figured out how to eliminate the cost of a new regulation, or, alternatively, until a different rule reduces the costs to businesses, local governmental units and individuals over any two-year period.
Gustafson calls it a “net zero” rule process. “So if there’s an existing regulation or rule output that is of equal cost or greater, you’re going to have to cut that rule if you want to implement a new one.”
Another of the four bills — coauthored by Neylon and Sen. Steve Nass — would put an expiration date on every administrative rule seven years after implementation. Currently, administrative rules are in effect indefinitely unless repealed, amended by the agency or suspended by the Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR).
JCRAR is a 10-member committee responsible for reviewing proposed administrative rules to ensure they align with state law. Lawmakers on the committee have the ability to approve, suspend, or request modifications to proposed rules.
Under the new measure, the year before a rule expires an agency would need to send notice to JCRAR about its intention to readopt the rule. If there is no objection by a lawmaker on the committee, then the rule would be considered readopted, but if there is an objection, then the rule would expire unless the agency goes through the rulemaking process again.
Neylon said the point is to create a more modern process and do away with “outdated or duplicative rules, creating unnecessary burdens on businesses.” 
Another bill — coauthored by Sen. Rob Hutton and Reps. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown) and Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) — would limit scope statements, the first step in the rulemaking process, so they could only be used for one proposed rule and would set a six month expiration date when a scope statement can be used for an emergency rule.
Currently, people can challenge the validity of an administrative rule in court. The final bill — coauthored by Rep. Ron Tusler (R-Harrison) and Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) — would award people who challenge a rule attorney fees and costs if a court declares a rule invalid. 
The bill package is based on a report from the right-wing Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (WILL), which also launched a webpage about the effort to cut “red tape” on Wednesday.
WILL states in the report that Wisconsin is the 13th most regulated state in the country and lays out proposals similar to the new GOP bills. WILL said the actions would build off steps taken in other states, including Idaho, Ohio, Nebraska and Oklahoma, to reduce regulations.
Neylon said WILL provided research and worked with lawmakers’ offices on the legislation. But, he added, “these are issues that we’ve all worked on for a lot of years, issues that we care deeply about. This is our initiative… and nobody else’s.”
Economist on the potential flaws 
Economist Michael Rosen told the Examiner that the bills come out of Republicans’ “national playbook,” and that the research from WILL is based on the idea that “any regulation impedes economic growth.”
“It has been a cornerstone of Republican policy since the election of Ronald Reagan to deregulate, get rid of regulation, and [to insist] that getting rid of regulation promotes economic growth,” Rosen said. He calls that theory “nonsense.” 
Rosen points out that some of the most heavily regulated states — including California and New York — are also the most prosperous. He noted that the majority of the states cited in WILL’ s research are those with Republican-dominated government.
“All regulations really are the rules under which the market operates,” Rosen said, adding, “there have to be rules that govern the behavior of the buyers and sellers. That’s what regulation is. It’s very simple, and what they’re arguing is to get rid of them.”
Rosen challenges broad assertions in WILL’s research, including WILL’s finding that a 36% cut to regulations across the board in Wisconsin could grow the economy by 1 percentage point annually.
That analysis fails to take into account “negative externalities,” Rosen says — actions by companies that impose a cost on people who are not directly involved. He pointed to environmental regulations as an example of how these costs are paid by the public. 
“In economic terms, companies that pollute… part of the cost of production should be disposing of the waste that a company produces…. If there aren’t any rules, the cheapest way to dispose of your waste is to release it into the atmosphere or release it into the rivers and streams,” Rosen said. “That’s what we had in this country at the beginning of the 20th century, when we didn’t have any environmental regulations, and rivers, like the Milwaukee River, and streams and lakes were polluted by manufacturers because that was the cheapest way for them to dispose of their waste.”
Rosen said that some might argue that rules meant to protect the environment impede growth because they impose an additional cost on a company, however, he said that rules can ensure they aren’t passing on that cost to the public. 
Since passage in 2017, the REINS Act has posed an obstacle to proposed environmental protection rules in Wisconsin.
Without the regulations, Rosen said, people would have “no assurance” about the products they buy — “whether it’s a can of tuna fish, whether it’s an automobile, whether it’s a ride on an airplane.” 
“Is it impeding economic growth that we have regulations on air travel? No, because if we didn’t have the regulation of the airline industry, we would have far more accidents and many fewer people would want to travel on airplanes,” Rosen said. “These are all regulations that we take for granted,” but assure people they can trust the products and services they purchase, “and we won’t crash and die.” 
A better way to address onerous or outdated rules, Rosen said, is to take them up one at a time, rather than through the sweeping anti-regulatory bill package Wisconsin Republicans are proposing. 
“Are there some regulations that maybe are antiquated? I’m not going to sit here and tell you there might not be,” Rosen said. “But rather than pass sweeping legislation, which is ideologically driven and could have catastrophic consequences, people should raise the particular regulation.”
What’s next for the bills
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said that she is excited for the bills to go through the Assembly Government Operations, Accountability and Transparency (GOAT) committee, which she chairs. The committee was created this session, inspired by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency project, which has sought to remake the federal government by unilaterally firing employees and making deep cuts to federal agencies. 
“Excessive regulations have serious economic consequences. They slow economic growth. They increase costs for businesses and consumers and they stifle innovation, all while the compliance costs put the greatest burden on our small businesses and working families,” Nedweski said. 
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said the bills are another action from the “tired Republican playbook” and compared them to the actions being taken by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. 
“These bills are an attempt at a power grab, akin to what we are seeing from the Trump-Musk administration,” Hesselbein said. “The bills would, among other things, undermine the fundamental democratic principle of separation of powers. They are unnecessary, anti-democratic, and wholly wrong for Wisconsin.”
Republicans in the Senate and Assembly, who hold majorities, could pass the bills without support from Democratic lawmakers, however, they would need Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ sign-off to become law. Neylon conceded that it’s unlikely Evers will support them. 
“Unfortunately Gov. Evers makes a lot of mistakes,” Neylon said. “He’s showing to be a failure as a governor, and I’m not optimistic he’ll make the right decision here, but I think that we’re doing the best we can to try to reform the regulatory process, and we think that it’s time for a reset.” 
Evers’ office hasn’t responded to a request for comment.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Ryan Walters made a series of big gambles that paid off for him in spades.
Somehow over the course of the past few weeks, Oklahoma’s state superintendent bet that he could outplay his constituents, outwit Gov. Kevin Stitt’s three new education board appointees, and outlast the Republican-led Legislature that has long been afraid to stand up to him.
It all culminated last week in Walters getting exactly what he wanted: a set of controversial social studies standards, quietly altered at the last minute, limping their way across the finish line. They took effect by default with no public legislative vote.
If it sounds like a lame ending to the reality TV program “Survivor,” you’d be spot on. Walters walked away with the $1 million prize while his constituents, who wanted to exercise their right to engage in the government process, were effectively eliminated after the first round.
Backdoor maneuvering and unsympathetic shoulder-shrugging by Republicans meant the public couldn’t play their immunity idol to protect themselves from round-upon-round of incompetence. They watched as the majority of their supposed allies — the Republicans they elected — turned their backs on them and didn’t have the spine to protect them.
While it culminated in a big win for Walters, who proved he has the chops to outplay, outwit, outlast us all, this isn’t a game. Public transparency and our children are the biggest losers of this latest debacle. 
Over the course of a month, we all watched from the sidelines as the public feedback was ignored and standards that weren’t properly vetted were ramrodded through the legislative process. It will be six years before they’re due to be redrafted again.
I found myself aggravated by all the legislative shoulder-shrugging.
The Legislature’s inaction sent a clear signal that the majority of Oklahoma lawmakers were OK with the fact that Walters didn’t share the revised version of standards publicly online until weeks after they were voted on by a state governing board.
It signaled that they didn’t care that Walters insisted that what is contained in the standards, which belong to us all, is his decision alone.
It indicated that they ignored revelations that the education governing board members hadn’t read the revised standards before voting on them, and that lawmakers felt it acceptable that Walters only shared the final draft with his oversight board less than a day before the scheduled vote. They didn’t care about accusations from the board that Walters didn’t tell them that he made dozens of secret changes outside public scrutiny. 
And it showed that they were willing to ignore calls from within their own party and their constituents to return them to the board for further review.
So, here’s a gold star for every Republican who managed to set the public transparency bar to a new low.
The fact that Walters felt the need to make changes in secret coupled with the fact that many Republican legislators only felt comfortable discussing them behind closed doors raises concerns.
In a state that is struggling to set its students up for academic success, why are we not having these discussions publicly and requiring votes be taken?
The social studies standards process was a complete mess, and lawmakers should be doing some soul-searching about how to make the adoption of academic standards more transparent moving forward.
Because these should not be drafted or debated in dark, smoke-filled rooms. We should welcome and require public discussion on them. Feedback and debate is what is going to make our society and schools stronger.
It’s a bit of a headscratcher that we don’t have a law requiring that any revisions of academic standards be posted publicly online 72 business hours ahead of a public vote. I also don’t understand why we wouldn’t want any changes to be clearly denoted.
Both things seem like simple solutions to solve many of the transparency issues that plagued this process.
Because public engagement and transparency are a cornerstone of good governing. Anything else breeds suspicion and is bad for democracy.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
 ‘It’s the system that needs fixing’

Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version focused on the science of reading passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar bill into law Monday to outlaw three-cueing.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
Sen. Kemp’s bill requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
 Opposition to ‘science of reading’

Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.
In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Recently, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., made some of his most callous remarks to date about the autistic community. This is particularly offensive because April was Autism Acceptance Month.
Among other things, he claimed that autistic people like me will “never pay taxes,” never hold jobs, never go on dates — comments that boil down to one message: That we are tragedies to be pitied, in desperate need of a “cure.” He also repeated the thoroughly debunked claim that autism is caused by toxins.
Others have already addressed the scientific reality: Study after study has shown there is no evidence to support these assertions. The so-called “experts” backing them are widely discredited.

And many of us will continue to point out the truth supported by decades of research: The rise in autism diagnoses stems from a better understanding of what autism looks like and improved diagnostic standards — just as has occurred with many other conditions as medicine has advanced over the centuries.
But what I want to speak to, as an autistic person, is how this rhetoric affects us.
I am autistic, and I am proud of it. My neurodiversity is not a tragedy — it is an integral part of who I am and the path I’ve taken in life.
I’m a Truman Scholar, an honors graduate of the University of Puerto Rico, where I served in student government, and a graduate of the University of Maine School of Law. Over the past decade, I’ve worked as a policy advocate and lobbyist, led a national disability justice project and directed policy for another major organization. My writing has been published in academic journals and books. Today, I serve as Maryland’s coordinator of State Autism Strategy, a position I’ve proudly held since 2023.
And, to address one of Secretary Kennedy’s claims directly: I pay taxes every year.
In my 36 years, I’ve had the privilege of meeting incredible autistic people across Maryland and the country — people who give their hearts to their communities, build fulfilling careers, and live lives of purpose and pride. Our lives are not tragedies. We don’t need a cure — we need acceptance.
Secretary Kennedy’s comments are harmful. They reinforce stigma, discourage inclusion, and send the wrong message to every parent of a newly diagnosed child. That message isn’t just false—it’s damaging to all of us.
In contrast, here in Maryland, we believe that people with disabilities deserve to thrive in their chosen communities and live full, self-determined lives. That’s why on April 23, we released a statewide strategic plan to address autism-related needs — one grounded in the values of acceptance, inclusion, and independence.
This month, the first bill Gov. Wes Moore signed following this legislation session was the Model Employer Act, improving access to state employment for people with disabilities, including autism.  I am proud to live and work in a state that celebrates all of who I am, including being autistic.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2196597652-1024x675.jpg,,,2025-05-05 07:00:52.916404

The family of a man killed in a shootout with a Thermopolis police officer who busted into his home over a misdemeanor sued in federal court.
The post Wrongful death suit challenges Thermopolis cop for illegally entering home appeared first on WyoFile .","The first police killing in the town of Thermopolis’ history started with an investigation into methamphetamine use by workers at a local McDonald’s.
It ended with a bloody, close-range shootout inside a trailer home after an officer shouldered his way inside without a warrant. The officer, Sgt. Michael Mascorro, suffered a gunshot wound that came harrowingly close to killing him. While bleeding profusely, Mascorro shot and killed McDonald’s employee Buck Laramore.
Though Laramore shot first, wounding Mascorro while the officer’s gun was still in his holster, his mother and widow sued the Thermopolis Police Department in the U.S. District Court of Wyoming this week. They allege Mascorro had no grounds to enter the trailer and that Laramore was defending himself against a police officer who was, in essence, a lawless intruder into his home. 
“This was a completely avoidable incident,” Sweetwater County District Attorney Dan Erramouspe wrote at the time, according to the Thermopolis Independent Record. The prosecutor, who conducted a criminal review of the shooting and is not involved in the civil lawsuit, ruled Mascorro entered Laramore’s home illegally. Town officials later rejected that conclusion. 
In their lawsuit, Laramore’s relatives cite self-defense laws like Wyoming’s controversial “stand your ground” statute and the castle doctrine, both of which generally allow homeowners to protect themselves with deadly force from an intruder. While Erramouspe found Mascorro had entered the home illegally, the prosecutor also found he was justified in shooting back at Laramore. The state’s castle doctrine carries an exception for when the intruder in one’s home is a police officer, and when the shooting started, Mascorro was defending himself, the prosecutor wrote. 
The family’s lawyers disagree. “It was Mascorro’s own reckless and deliberate conduct that unreasonably created his use of force,” they wrote in the complaint. 
Neither lawyers for the plaintiffs nor Thermopolis Police Chief Pat Cornwall responded to messages from WyoFile this week seeking comment on the case. 
Investigation
The violence on April 28, 2023 can be traced back to two days earlier, when a different Thermopolis police officer arrested a different McDonald’s employee who had an outstanding warrant. When the officer helped that employee out of her patrol car at the jail, she found a glass pipe on the car seat, according to a report on the shooting compiled by Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation agents. The employee had smoked meth from the pipe that morning with one of his McDonald’s colleagues, he told the officer. 
Thermopolis police officers decided to contact the area health inspector, Jamie George, for a combined investigation into meth use among the McDonald’s employees. That investigation led Mascorro and a Hot Springs County sheriff’s deputy with a drug dog to the restaurant on April 28 — where Laramore had just started his work shift. 
Mascorro found Laramore suspicious. He saw Laramore leave the men’s room, and soon afterward the drug dog detected meth hidden in containers in the bathroom’s baby changing station, according to the DCI investigation. The officer asked Laramore to take a drug test, which the McDonald’s worker declined to do. When Mascorro asked for his name, Laramore misspelled it by one letter. He also said his birth year was 1988, when it was in fact 1989.

Laramore left the McDonald’s shortly after the exchange and returned home. When Mascorro learned Laramore had given him a misspelled name and the wrong birth year, he called a Hot Springs County prosecutor, according to an interview with the prosecutor conducted by the DCI investigators. 
Kelly Owens, the prosecutor, told Mascorro they could not connect Laramore to the meth in the bathroom. The officer then said he wanted to arrest Laramore for interfering with the investigation by giving false information about himself. Owens suggested Mascorro could just write Laramore a ticket instead, according to the lawsuit. 
But Mascorro wanted to arrest Laramore, he would later tell DCI agents. 
A two-decade veteran of the U.S. Air Force, Mascorro had joined the Thermopolis Police Department eight years prior. At the time of the shooting, he was the agency’s second in command. The DCI agents who investigated Laramore’s death asked Mascorro why he went to Laramore’s home alone. The small police department was shorthanded, Mascorro told the investigators, and he did not have an option for backup. “It’s the nature of this job,” he said, according to the DCI report. 
During his tenure in Thermopolis, Mascorro had received four use-of-force complaints, according to the lawsuit. He was accused of kicking a man and knocking him to the ground while arresting him, and in another instance, of escalating an encounter into a fight at Thermopolis’s signature drinking establishment, the One-Eyed Buffalo. Just six days before the shootout, the Wyoming Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission had cleared Mascorro of any wrongdoing in those incidents. 
The lawsuit claims the department should have corrected aggressive behavior by Mascorro, and that doing so may have prevented the fatal shootout. 
Laramore’s McDonald’s colleagues described him to DCI agents as a “big-hearted” and good worker who sometimes felt down about life. When agents asked one colleague if Laramore was suicidal, she told them he would never kill himself because of his love for his wife. 
According to the DCI report, however, Mascorro learned from his dispatcher on his way to Laramore’s home that the man also had a record of assault charges. Laramore was well armed — DCI agents would recover three pistols when they searched the home after the shooting. Agents also found meth, fentanyl and marijuana.
Mascorro arrived on Laramore’s doorstep several hours after their first encounter at the McDonald’s, according to the DCI investigation. He banged on the door, which Laramore came to but did not exit. A storm door separated the two men as they spoke. Mascorro told Laramore to come outside so he could be arrested for interference. Laramore said he would not do so. 
The situation would go “one of two ways,” Mascorro suggested, according to the lawsuit. Either Laramore would step outside, or Mascorro would “break the door in.”
Laramore closed the door of his home. Mascorro opened the storm door and began to ram the main door with his shoulder. 
Shootout 
The Thermopolis Police Department released selective portions of Mascorro’s body camera footage from the incident, accompanying the footage with narration that gives the law enforcement view of the encounter. Mascorro entered the trailer because he believed Laramore could flee out the back door, the narration suggests. 
In his interview with DCI, Mascorro said he considered Laramore’s closing of the door in his face the equivalent of fleeing arrest, and felt if he left to secure a warrant, Laramore would be gone when he returned.
In the lawsuit, the Laramore family’s attorneys argue Buck Laramore couldn’t have destroyed any evidence in the interference case because he had already given Mascorro the false information. There was no threat to the officer’s safety when the two men talked in the doorway, and Laramore’s refusal to step outside was not a crime, the complaint argued. 
Laramore’s wife, Brandi, was also home. 
When Mascorro broke through the door, he found Laramore standing in a hallway, pointing a Smith & Wesson handgun at him with both hands.

Mascorro’s gun was still in its holster, according to the DCI report. Laramore fired once and put a .45-caliber bullet through Mascorro’s right arm and into his chest, where it broke one of the officer’s ribs and passed through his lung, narrowly missing his spine. 
The shot knocked Mascorro to the ground. 
Laramore advanced toward him, and according to the DCI report, likely fired another shot, though it didn’t strike Mascorro and it’s unclear where the round went. 
Lying on the ground, Mascorro called on Laramore to “stop, stop.” 
According to the lawsuit, Laramore did not fire another shot. 
Mascorro told the DCI agents he did not know why Laramore did not shoot him again, in the head, while he lay on the ground. But Mascorro pulled his pistol and began firing, shooting seven times. 
Brandi Laramore hid in the home’s bathroom. According to the DCI report, she took the family dog into the bathroom with her. But in a frame from the body camera footage, the dog runs across the trailer floor as Mascorro, now standing, aims his gun toward Laramore.

It’s unclear if Mascorro hit Laramore during his first fusillade. Laramore appears to have retreated into another room of the trailer. According to the lawsuit, Laramore then stepped into Mascorro’s line of sight, now unarmed, and the officer fired three times. According to Mascorro’s interview with DCI agents, the officer believed Laramore was tactically peering around the corner and was still trying to shoot and kill him. 
Mascorro hit Laramore with his first shot, he believed, and possibly his second. 
This time it was Laramore who fell to the ground and yelled, “stop, stop,” according to the lawsuit.  
Mascorro, now severely weakened by his injuries, collapsed to the floor. He was able to stagger out of the home before collapsing again in the yard, where arriving officers found him. 
Inside the trailer, Laramore died in his wife’s arms, she told DCI agents. 
Medics airlifted Mascorro to a hospital in Casper, where the officer came in and out of consciousness. When Mascorro returned to Thermopolis, he did so as a hero, welcomed with a parade, according to the Cowboy State Daily. However, after Erramouspe cleared Mascorro of any homicide charges but found he should not have entered Laramore’s home, the Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission again investigated the officer and considered decertifying him. 
Decertifying an officer is the review board’s strongest and rarely used sanction — it would have prevented Mascorro from working in law enforcement anywhere in Wyoming. 
POST, led at the time by former Casper police chief Chris Walsh, chose not to take that step. After a review of Erramouspe’s findings, the DCI report, state law and department policy, town officials in June 2024 decided Mascorro would return to duty. 
“The Town believes Sgt. Mascaro did not violate policy or the law,” Thermopolis Mayor Adam Estenson said in a statement announcing the officer’s return. 
“I look forward to continued conversation on what policing looks like for Thermopolis into the future,” he continued. 
Though the shootout was the town’s first police killing, according to an October 2023 statement from Estenson, a second would soon follow. In September 2024, a different Thermopolis police officer conducting a wellness check would run into a mentally ill man, Jared Gottula, who was swinging a bat wildly in his yard. Gottula advanced on the officer’s patrol vehicle and the officer struck him with it. During the tense encounter that followed, the officer and a Hot Springs County sheriff’s deputy fired more than 20 rounds, killing Gottula.
A review found the officers began shooting after Gottula advanced on the deputy with the bat raised. Both officers were cleared of any wrongdoing, and to date, no lawsuit has been filed.

Arbitrary response times, inconsistent fees and insufficient information on how to file a records request are why lawmakers should overhaul the Wyoming Public Records Act next session, guest columnist Marta Mossburg writes.
The post Time to strengthen the Wyoming Public Records Act appeared first on WyoFile .","When Lander resident Tina Clifford sent a public records request in August to Fremont County seeking more detailed election information than what was already publicly available, she wasn’t sure to whom she should send it, what it would cost or how long it would take. 

Opinion

Ms. Clifford’s grandson and my son are part of the same homeschool group and we started talking about her experience requesting records during one of our weekly school days. That conversation prompted this column, because  the information about public records requests is insufficient on Fremont County’s website. When Ms. Clifford sent her request to County Clerk Julie Freese she didn’t hear back for over three weeks and emailed her again seeking an update. County Attorney Nathan Maxon returned her email and told her that two employees had thus far spent 18 hours on her request. That time would not cost Ms. Clifford, he wrote, but the remaining work would be billed to her at $70 per hour with an estimated cost of $560. He requested that she let him know if she wanted the remaining work done. 
Clifford’s experience is just one of many examples of the arbitrary response times, lack of transparency and sparse instructions on how or where to send a public records request in Wyoming. It’s also why the Public Records Act should be overhauled during next year’s legislative session.
The current Wyoming Public Records Act requires the government to respond promptly showing receipt of the request and to release requested records no later than 30 days after sending the receipt unless good cause exists to extend the time frame. But a court ruling found that government entities may charge a “reasonable fee” for reproducing records — leaving open the possibility that different people could be charged different amounts and that counties within the state could set vastly different fees for the same type of request. 
That’s why Rep. Pepper Ottman, R-Riverton, would like to see consistency across the state with specifics on how to submit requests, what can be released and fees that are consistent across the state. She’d also like the law to clearly state who is responsible for handling requests under the Wyoming Public Records Act. Ottman is hopeful reform will be debated in next year’s shortened budget legislative session. 
Here are some of Mountain States Policy Center’s ideas to strengthen the Public Records Act:

Don’t distinguish between requesters. Bad actors exist everywhere and there should be equal treatment for everyone.
Have a set fee schedule detailed in statute for everyone.
Process large record requests in installments, and cancel requests if the fee is not paid for the first installment.
Allow requestors to narrow or refine requests if the time estimate is too long and/or fees are too large.
Use the federal definition from the National Freedom of Information Coalition research for burdensome requests. The state’s Public Records Ombudsman could then be empowered to hear concerns from a government entity if that definition has been met.
Provide Wyoming’s Public Records Ombudsman with more authority to assist and mediate disputes.

Some requests can’t be fulfilled by statute, including an individual’s income tax forms, school and medical records and government personnel files, among others. And some requests require a large amount of time to complete and may not be able to be finished within a 30-day time frame. But both government employees and those requesting information should have a clear understanding of their obligations, fees, timing and how the process is supposed to work. 
Having easily understood regulations is no guarantee that the government will comply, as evidenced by the thousands of lawsuits against the federal government for not fulfilling FOIA requests. But here in Wyoming, we can do better. Passing an enhanced Public Records Act would build trust in state and local government. In addition, state and local government agencies would do themselves a big favor by proactively posting as much information online as possible. Upfront transparency would mitigate the need for public records requests.
Strengthening the Wyoming Public Records Act should not be a partisan issue. Every resident deserves a government accountable to the people it serves. Legislators should prioritize it in 2026.

(Courtesy of the Nebraska State Patrol)LINCOLN — One state lawmaker’s continued efforts to boost benefits for Nebraska State Patrol troopers, a largely consensus issue, ignited a rare fight among legislative allies.
The fight flared up last week in the Nebraska Legislature after State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln and his ally, State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, struck a deal to add a proposal to increase survivors’ benefits in the case of a trooper’s death from 75% up to 100%. 
In the case of dependent children without a surviving parent, it would bump benefits up to 100% until the child turns 19 years old.

Bostar has said the measure addresses a “fairly cruel reality” when an officer dies and families are hurt again. He pointed to collegiate research out of Iowa and New York that troopers, because of the line of work, can have shorter life spans than spouses in different fields of work.
“It seems wrong to ask folks to do a job that will reduce their longevity while then punishing their family financially,” Bostar told the Nebraska Examiner last week.
‘Piece of that puzzle’
Ballard, who chairs the Legislature’s Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee, called the measure “common sense” and said it was “weird” that public safety officials weren’t fully compensated for their work. 
Ballard said Bostar’s measure is a “piece of that puzzle” to recruitment and retention. The State Trooper Association of Nebraska and multiple retired troopers supported the measure.
Bostar’s Legislative Bill 76, as introduced, would also have raised maximum annual cost-of-living adjustments for Patrol members’ retirement benefits. A narrower version, just related to survivors’ benefits, was amended into Ballard’s Legislative Bill 645, related to school retirement, on April 24 in a 39-0 vote, without issue. At that time, the increased benefits would have taken effect this July 1.

But four days later, Ballard filed an amendment struck with Bostar to kick the benefits bump two years out, moving it out of this already difficult budget cycle.
An actuarial study estimated a $3.3 million annual cost, which Bostar has denied is the true amount and is the largest estimate he’s ever gotten in pushing similar legislation. Even so, the amendment was adopted 41-0, and LB 645 moved on once again.
‘It doesn’t add up’
The flare-up came last Wednesday after Ballard rose on a procedural motion to say that, absent any other legal changes, the provisions of Bostar’s measure could not apply retroactively to existing spouses. He cited his committee legal counsel, the legal counsel of the related retirement state agency and the actuarial report.
“Any surviving spouse currently receiving 75% survivors’ benefits will continue to receive 75% survivors’ benefits,” Ballard said, withdrawing his motion, thus ending debate on LB 645.
Without an immediate chance for anyone to respond, LB 645 passed 45-2.
Bostar confronted Ballard after the vote, saying it was “bull—” that an average loss of four troopers a year could lead to such a high price tag.
“How much you think their pensions are? $10 million?” Bostar told Ballard off the side of the floor near a table where reporters regularly sit. “It doesn’t add up.”

Bostar told his colleague that it was the legal counsel or actuaries “lying to your f— face, and it means you lied on the mic, and I’m going to say that.”
The Retirement Committee legal counsel, Ballard and Bostar moved a few feet away to a side corner off the legislative floor where a reporter could hear the counsel tell Bostar that the state could be “f— sued” if Bostar rebuffed Ballard and said his interpretation was the law was retroactive, possibly muddying the waters on the legislative intent if later challenged in court.
‘A wrong we need to right’
But Bostar got on the microphone 10 minutes later and told his colleagues that he “fundamentally” disagreed with the legal interpretation that Ballard cited.
“Because there is no other way for the math to work on the numbers that were handed down by the actuaries, by NPERS [Nebraska Public Employee Retirement Systems], it must apply retroactively,” Bostar said. “Otherwise, the number wouldn’t be $3 million. There is no other mathematical way for this to make sense.”
“While we’re putting things on the record,” Bostar continued, he said he believes that all surviving spouses should “rightfully” have their benefits increased to 100%
“That is what we paid for. That is what the actuaries clearly calculated,” Bostar said.

The actuaries wrote that their understanding of legislative intent is that the changes would not apply retroactively, to which Bostar said the math still didn’t pan out and that it was “text on a page.” He said if the law wasn’t retroactive, he could have made the change to do so, but that it has always “100%” been his intent and understanding for the change to apply to all families.
An average of four troopers will unfortunately die in a year, Bostar said, but at least one won’t be married, and another might die after their spouse has already passed.
That would require annual retirement benefits for the remaining two troopers to be more than $6 million each year, Bostar said, but they’re just “not that generous.”
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, who has not always seen eye-to-eye with Bostar or Ballard, praised Bostar as debate continued on a different underlying measure. She said she could not express her gratitude “sufficiently” for Bostar’s leadership in helping first responders not only have fair wages but also a “dignified and appropriate retirement.”
Ballard had no immediate comment on the disagreement with Bostar, though both indicated they would continue to work on the measure.
“I’m committed to doing everything that I can to ensure that this gets implemented,” Bostar said. “It’s a wrong that we need to right.”

[…],"A veteran attends a county fair. (Jena Ardell/Getty Images)LINCOLN — For-profit consultants make millions each year charging veterans for help in filing benefits claims. Nebraska is moving to crack down on what some call “predatory claim sharks.”
It is already against federal law for companies not accredited with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to charge veterans fees for help in claiming benefits. But in 2006, a “clear enforcement method” vanished from federal law, State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst told the Nebraska Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee in March.
New York, New Jersey and Maine are among states that recently passed protections against “claim sharks,” who McKeon said use “aggressive tactics and false promises.”
“Our veterans who have sacrificed so much for our nation deserve better than this,” McKeon, a veteran, said at the hearing for his Legislative Bill 693. “We owe them a duty to protect them from being defrauded.”
Broad state support
LB 693 would change state law so that anyone receiving compensation for preparing, advising or consulting someone for earned veterans’ benefits or making referrals for such services would commit a “deceptive trade practice” unless otherwise allowed by state or federal law.
Attorneys, agents or companies properly accredited by the federal VA, for instance, would not be impacted by LB 693, according to the Nebraska chapter of Veterans of Foreign Wars.

A previous version of the bill was introduced in 2024 by former State Sen. Tom Brewer of north-central Nebraska, a decorated veteran and former Government Committee chair.
Brewer’s bill did not move forward. This time, McKeon’s LB 693 has advanced unanimously from the Government Committee but hasn’t yet been scheduled for debate. It is McKeon’s personal 2025 priority bill, increasing the likelihood it could be scheduled.
Attempts to regulate the for-profit industry have stalled in Congress.
Among those supporting the Nebraska legislation are major veterans service offices that offer free services, including:

AMVETS.
The American Legion.
Marine Corps League.
Veterans of Foreign Wars.
Nebraska Veterans Council.
Disabled American Veterans.
Paralyzed Veterans of America.
Military Order of the Purple Heart.
County Veterans Service Officers Association of Nebraska (including those from Lancaster, Dawes and Sioux Counties).

Choice or exploitation?
At the bill’s hearing, Ray Colas of Veterans Benefits Guide and John Blomstrom of Veterans Guardian opposed LB 693. Neither service is accredited with the VA.
Colas said LB 693 could create unintended consequences. He said many veterans are unaware of free services that exist but Veterans Benefits Guide tries to publicize those options.
“They still sign on the dotted line because they know they need help or, for purposes of convenience, prefer to use our services fully,” Colas testified.
Blomstrom, a Marine Corps veteran for Veterans Guardian, said he was concerned LB 693 would limit an “option” that he said should be protected under the First Amendment. He said his organization ensures veterans “have an option” amid the VA’s “very archaic, broken system.”
Colas said his organization could support LB 693 if it more closely mirrored federal law for accreditation. Blomstrom said consumer protections were a better route than accreditation.

Ken Yount, state commander for the Nebraska chapter of Veterans of Foreign Wars, said in a statement to the Nebraska Examiner that organizations like his have met with lobbyists for the out-of-state companies in “good faith.” However, such companies have refused “to be held to the same ethical standards” of VA accreditation or accept a reasonable fee cap, he said.
“They claim to give veterans ‘another choice,’ but what they’re really offering is exploitation,” Yount said. “Veterans deserve better — and Nebraska has the chance to stand up for them.”
‘Our heroes deserve better’
Mike Sheets, on behalf of the Military Order of the Purple Heart in Nebraska and the Great Plains Chapter of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, said his organizations provide services at no charge while still advocating for veterans beyond one-on-one services
Sheets said veterans swear their oath to protect the country, “knowing that we would be protected by lawmakers, ensuring that we are not preyed upon by for-profit companies.”
Spike Jordan, a county veterans service officer in Dawes and Sioux Counties, said veterans “who put life and limb on the line” for the county often exit with physical and mental wounds that will follow them for the rest of their lives.
“We owe our heroes more than the symbolic debt of our gratitude,” Jordan said in a statement.
McKeon, one of three veterans on the Government Committee, said the status quo is unacceptable and that LB 693 is about doing “the right thing.”
“Protecting our veterans must be our top priority that shouldn’t be delayed,” McKeon said last month. “Our heroes deserve better than to be continued to be taken advantage of by the scammers.”

The previous event, which drew nearly 200 Moscow residents, focused on combating Christian nationalism and featured Druzin, host of the “Extremely American” podcast. Druzin’s investigation into Christ Church and its leader Doug Wilson’s growing influence in the community was highlighted in his podcast’s second season, “Onward Christian Soldiers,” which has reached over 1 million downloads.
According to Druzin, Wilson runs the Community of Reformed Evangelical Churches, a nationwide Calvinist church group, along with an education network of 500 classical Christian schools. While Wilson has gained national attention in Christian nationalist circles, his church members have not found success in local political offices.
The upcoming “United in Community” event will include organizational presentations, discussion groups and collaborative planning for community action. It will be from 1-4 p.m. at the 1912 Center in Moscow.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)On April 1 Wisconsin voters decisively voted against unprecedented, massive outside interference in our state Supreme Court election by the nearly $30 million from the richest and second (to Donald Trump) most egotistical person in the world – Elon Musk.  In handing Musk’s endorsed candidate, Brad Schimel, a more than 10 percentage point, 269,000-vote drubbing, Wisconsinites rendered the nation a great service by humiliating Musk here and thereby driving him from the corridors of power and influence in Washington D.C. where he has been  savaging vital U.S. government services and programs that helped the poorest people in our nation and in the world.
Wisconsin also opted to preserve recent democracy reforms in our state by maintaining the current 4-3 progressive majority on the Court.  Fairer and more representative state legislative voting maps and the restoration of the use of secure ballot drop boxes for voters will be preserved and the possibility of new and enhanced political reform is possible in the years immediately ahead either through upholding reforms passed legislatively, through court action, or both.
But what can be done about the obscene amount of political money raised and spent to elect a new Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice in 2025 – as much if not more than $105 million – by far the most amount ever spent in a judicial election in the history of the United States?  Wisconsin faces new state supreme court elections every April for the next four years and a continuation of such frenzied and out of control spending for the foreseeable future seems both unbearable and unsustainable.
Voluntary spending limits for Supreme Court candidates with the incentive of providing them with full public financing if they agree to statutory spending limits is a possibility.  Wisconsin actually had such a law in place for exactly one Supreme Court election in 2011.  The Impartial Justice Act was made possible by passage with overwhelming bipartisan majorities in the Wisconsin Legislature and enactment into law in 2009.  In 2011, both candidates for a seat on the high court agreed to the voluntary spending limits of $400,000 each and received full public financing. That campaign was robust, competitive and the result was close, which is what you would expect in Wisconsin.  And it cost just a tiny fraction of the more than $100 million that was spent in 2025.
Unfortunately, later in 2011, then-Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature defunded the Impartial Justice Act and all other public financing for elections, Four years later, Walker and the GOP completely eviscerated and deformed Wisconsin’s campaign finance laws. They did away with limits on what political parties and outside groups can raise and spend in elections, increased individual campaign contribution limits and, most alarmingly, legalized previously illegal campaign coordination between so-called issue ad spending groups and candidates, which greatly increased opportunities for corruption and undue influence through campaign spending. Disclosure requirements were weakened and, in some instances, dismantled altogether.
In just four short years, Wisconsin was transformed from one of the most transparent, low spending and highly regarded election states in the nation to one of the worst, least regulated special interest-controlled political backwaters in the nation, akin to Texas, Louisiana or Florida.
This current corrupt status quo will remain in place for the upcoming state Supreme Court elections in 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 unless the governor, Legislature and the Wisconsin Supreme Court take action and do the following:

Re-establish an “impartial justice” law for the public financing of state Supreme Court elections modeled after the 2009 law which was in place for only one election before it was repealed. Update and revise it to better fit current times and circumstances including more realistic spending limits and higher public financing grants.
Establish clear recusal rules for judges at all levels in Wisconsin that clearly decree that if a certain campaign contribution is reached or surpassed beyond a certain threshold amount, then the beneficiary of that contribution (or of the expenditure against her/his opponent) must recuse from any case in which the contributor is a party before the court.
Restore sensible limitations on the transfer of and acceptance of campaign funds and make illegal again campaign coordination between outside special interest groups engaged in issue advocacy with all candidates for public office — particularly judges.
Petition the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the disastrous 2010 Citizens United vs F.E.C. decision which ended over 100 years of sensible regulation of unlimited corporate, union and other outside special interest money in federal and by extension state elections, unleashing the torrential flood of campaign cash drowning democracy today.

These are common-sense, achievable reforms that, if enacted into law, would go a long way toward restoring desperately needed public confidence in the fairness, impartiality and trust in Wisconsin’s courts and in particular, our Wisconsin Supreme Court which was regarded as the model for the nation and the best anywhere a quarter century ago. But it will take determined action by all three branches of Wisconsin’s state government working together with the voters to uphold election integrity and curb corruption in a way all of us can embrace.
Ultimately, of course, it’s up to us, the voters, to hold our governmental institutions accountable and ensure that they work for us instead of for their own narrow interests  and those of the donor class. In this critical season of resistance and defiance against tyranny — speak up, make noise and ensure that your voice is heard.  Demand real reform and an end to the corruption of our representative government.

(Justin Sullivan | Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
HIPAA doesn’t help
Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
What states are doing
In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Getty Images)To victims and survivors across North Dakota,
As the news reveals more about Ray Holmberg’s decades-long abuse and exploitation of men and boys, we — the undersigned advocacy and service organizations for survivors of sexual and domestic violence, child abuse, neglect, and human trafficking — want to speak directly to you.
We know this is a difficult time. The graphic details emerging through the news cycle, social media, and local discussions have created a wave of renewed pain and trauma for many. If you are feeling triggered, anxious, angry, heartbroken — or simply numb — you are not alone. These are normal reactions to traumatic events, and you do not need to walk through this alone.
For many survivors, hearing stories about violence and abuse can reopen old wounds or create new ones. It can feel as if your own experience is being dragged back into the light, without your consent. We want you to know: Your reaction is valid. Your experience is valid. Your pain is real. And your story matters.
You are not responsible for what happened to you. You are not defined by the choices of the person who hurt you. What someone did to you does not diminish your worth. You deserve safety, dignity, and love in every relationship you have — always.
If the headlines have felt like too much, it’s okay to step away. Turn off the news, unfollow triggering content, and log off social media if you need to. Taking a break is not avoidance; it is an act of self-preservation. Protecting your mental and emotional health is a powerful and necessary form of self-care.
Speaking of care — know that help is available across our state. There are advocates, counselors, and therapists trained in trauma-informed care who are ready to listen without judgment and support your healing journey. Whether what happened to you occurred last week or decades ago, whether you’ve told your story before or never shared it with anyone — you matter. And we are here for you.
If you’re not ready to reach out to a professional, consider talking with someone you trust. Conversations with supportive people — friends, family, community members—can be a great way to de-stress and work through what you’re feeling. And if someone you speak to isn’t able to offer you the care or understanding you need, it’s OK to set boundaries. You deserve to feel safe and supported in your relationships.
Finally, we want you to know you are not forgotten. Our organizations exist because we believe in a better world for you. We fight every day to end the cycles of violence and exploitation that have caused so much harm. We advocate for justice, for change, and for compassion—not just in times of crisis, but every day. And we will keep showing up, because your life and your healing are worth fighting for.
In solidarity,

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Both chambers of the Colorado Legislature approved a bill that would give incarcerated people the right to see their families and community, ending the current policy under which visitation can be withheld as a form of punishment.
Current Colorado Department of Corrections policy says “inmate social visiting” is a privilege that can be “approved, denied, suspended, or revoked” by the head of a facility. House Bill 25-1013 would still allow the department to “adopt rules to govern the administration of social visitation,” but it cannot restrict visitation beyond “what is necessary for routine facility operations” or safety purposes. In-person visits, phone calls and video visits would become a right that cannot be taken away as punishment for an incarcerated person’s actions.
The Colorado Senate gave final approval to an amended version of the bill Friday in a 22-12 vote along party lines, with Democrats in support of the measure. The House later voted 43-19 to accept the Senate’s amendments, sending the bill to Colorado Gov. Jared Polis’ desk to be signed into law.

“Families are where we find strength, healing, and support. But for too many families, the criminal justice system creates barriers that fracture these bonds,” Senate President James Coleman, who sponsored the bill, said in a statement. “Regular visits, phone calls, and moments of connection empower families to support their loved ones’ journey toward rehabilitation. This bill helps to make our justice system a tool for repair and recovery, not a weapon of division.” 
Coleman sponsored the measure alongside fellow Denver Democrat House Assistant Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon, as well as Rep. Regina English and Sen. Tony Exum, both Colorado Springs Democrats.
Colorado bill would establish right to family visitation for incarcerated people

All visitors and incarcerated people must still comply with department rules related to visitation. People in CDOC custody could file a grievance with the department if they are prevented from visitation under the requirements of the bill. 
Bill sponsors offered an amendment in the Senate on Thursday to make changes negotiated with CDOC, clarifying that the department can limit visitation for people confined in restrictive housing with certain high-level violations. CDOC will be able to limit visitation to comply with court orders related to victim safety and to prevent communication between co-defendants. The amendment also said the department will take “reasonable measures” to increase access to telephone calls and non-contact visits for people in restrictive housing. 
Those in support of the measure have said it will help incarcerated people maintain relationships with loved ones and ensure they have a better chance of stability once they are released. 
“Ensuring that people who are incarcerated have the right to connect with their loved ones makes all Coloradans safer,” Exum said in a statement. “It reduces recidivism, supports rehabilitation, and eases the transition back into our communities after incarceration.”
Democrats control strong majorities in both chambers of the Legislature.
The 2025 legislative session ends on May 7.

(Getty Images)School district budgets are a maze of numbers and jargon that most citizens cannot understand. Even some lawmakers have difficulty concluding if a school district is spending money properly.
Idaho’s largest school district, the West Ada School District, has a budget that can be found online, but it is hundreds of pages long and includes six different funds and 36 different programs. In Montana, the Billings Public School district is the state’s largest. Finding its budget on the district’s website is nearly impossible.
Transparent Idaho now offers public education data

That’s why Mountain States Policy Center is proud to release the nation’s first Public School Transparency Index. This tool — available online, via download or even print on Amazon — will allow citizens, taxpayers, elected officials and more the opportunity to compare and contrast key data from school districts in the state of Idaho.
Other versions featuring data from school districts in Montana, Wyoming and Washington will also be released.
Transparency doesn’t mean much if it’s not understandable. Parents and taxpayers may see this data and conclude their school districts need more resources. Others may see it and believe that not enough is being done to spend money in the classroom. Regardless, the community will have a broader sense of the results being achieved, and what – if any – changes need to be made.
One of Mountain States Policy Center’s key recommendations is for lawmakers to adopt a Public School Transparency Act a law that would require all public school districts, both on the first page of their budget and also on the front page of the district’s main website, report key financial data, including:

Amount of total dollars (all funds – local, state and federal) spent by the district that year;
Amount of total dollars spent per student, per year;
Amount and percentage of total dollars allocated to average classroom;
Average administrator salary and benefits;
Average teacher salary and benefits; and
Ratio of administrators to teachers to students.

Education leaders, including Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield, have told Mountain States Policy Center they support the concept of a Public School Transparency Act.
“It’s a positive for our schools if the communities they serve understand how tax dollars are being spent,” Critchfield said. “Let’s face it, school budgets tend to be complex and this is a step that helps simplify the way they’re communicated publicly.”

We are continuing to report on flex loans. Have you been sued by Advance Financial, Harpeth Financial or another flex loan lender? To share your experience, call or text reporter Adam Friedman at 615-249-8509. 
Rosita Hansen was working an evening shift at a tubing factory in 2023 when a sheriff’s deputy showed up and handed her a court summons. She was being sued for failing to pay off a loan of $2,050. What confused Hansen was she had already paid a couple thousand more than she borrowed. But now the company, Advance Financial, said she owed more. Between what she’d already paid the company and the lawsuit, Advance stood to receive over $12,500 from Hansen, records show.
Hansen, 57, had taken out the loan in 2021 after her mortgage company threatened to foreclose on her modest three-bedroom house outside Morristown, a small city in East Tennessee. Hansen made enough money to support herself, but after taking in her four grandchildren, she struggled to cover the costs of extra food and school supplies, and she stopped paying her mortgage. That’s when she turned to Advance. 
“I was providing for all of them,” Hansen said. “Financially, it was rough.”
Like most borrowers, Hansen could not afford an attorney to handle the suit, but she hoped to work out a payment plan with Advance. When she arrived at the Hamblen County courthouse in Morristown in May 2023, she was directed to a line of half a dozen people waiting to meet with an attorney representing the company. 
Across Tennessee, Advance has sued over 110,000 people since 2015, significantly more than any other payday lender, making it one of the largest plaintiffs of any Tennessee-based company collecting debt. In Hansen’s Appalachian county of 66,000, where nearly half the households make less than $50,000, the company has filed one case per every 32 residents over that time, the Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica found.
Advance began filing thousands of lawsuits soon after Tennessee lawmakers approved the Flex Loan, a product pioneered by Advance in Tennessee. The loan’s $4,000 cap is nine times higher than the limit for most payday loans, and the company charges the equivalent of a 279.5% annual interest rate. Before Flex Loans became legal in 2015, payday lenders could only lend $425, and the borrower could never be required to pay back more than $500. Since then, those protections have been eliminated and thousands of borrowers have been defaulting. 
Flex Loans only stop growing when they’re completely paid off, when a flex lender declares the loan is in default or when it sues the borrower. If the loans do end up in court, the law allows lenders to recoup attorneys fees — which can’t be done with payday loans — a practice that can add up to a third of the loan amount. Court judgments against customers are often thousands of dollars, with some exceeding $10,000, records show. About 40% of all cases end up with a wage garnishment, court records show. 
The consequences of Flex Loans were predicted when the Tennessee legislature legalized them 10 years ago, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wanted to regulate products like Flex Loans when Congress created the agency in 2011. The Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the CFPB are currently being reviewed by the courts. 
Advance has argued that the new product would help consumers by offering them loans that are technically cheaper than a payday loan. It downplayed concerns from consumer advocates that these high-interest loans targeted and trapped low-income borrowers in debt they could never pay off. The company’s leaders made their case just as federal regulators planned to crack down on other Tennessee lenders for making different high-interest loans to people they knew could not pay them back.
After just a few years, evidence started mounting that the loans were exacting a high toll on low-income borrowers while generating huge profits for lenders. Since then, the Flex Loan has buried tens of thousands of Tennesseans such as Hansen in a deep financial hole.
Gabe Kravitz, a consumer finance researcher at The Pew Charitable Trusts, said loans above $1,000 paired with triple-digit interest rates are hard to pay off. 
“It gets very expensive very quickly,” he said.
Only a few other states have approved products similar to the Flex Loan but, unlike Tennessee, when other states saw problems with the loans, they acted to rein them in. 
Virginia allowed banks to make line-of-credit loans but had never seen the need to cap interest rates as banks competed for customers. But soon after Advance showed up, regulators noticed the company filing thousands of lawsuits. The state attorney general’s office investigated the company for deceptive practices in 2020, ultimately labeling the company as “predatory” and helping to pass legislation to shut down Flex Loan-like products in the state. Advance declined to answer a question about the Virginia attorney general’s investigation. California and North Dakota also passed bills capping interest rates on open-ended lines of credit after Advance and other companies began to operate in those states. 
The Lookout and ProPublica sent Advance Financial detailed questions about its operations, including each of the cases cited in the article. 
Cullen Earnest, the senior vice president of public policy at Advance Financial, declined to answer specific questions and said he could not discuss individual cases due to privacy concerns. Earnest said in an email that the company has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. He added that the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions has received just 91 complaints on flexible credit lenders since 2020, representing less than 0.001% of all new flex loan agreements, and that this data reflects the satisfaction of the vast majority of Advance’s customers.
Company records show Hansen made her twice-a-month payments on time, paying over $6,600 in 10 months. The required minimum monthly payments are supposed to act like a safety net, ensuring borrowers pay enough to cover the interest, fees and 3% of the principal. 
But many times after Hansen made a payment, the company allowed her to immediately borrow the principal back, which she often did, extending the time it would take to pay off the loan. After almost a year of payments, she still owed more than $3,000.

Hansen said she knew the loan was costly — every loan statement warns, “This is an expensive form of credit. Only borrow what you can afford to pay back” — but she didn’t realize how hard it would be to keep up with the interest and fees. 
The loan from Advance only made Hansen’s financial situation worse. As the payments became too much to handle, she lost the house. But the Flex Loan continued to grow, almost doubling in size by the time she received a court summons a year later. 
Who Is Advance?
Michael and Tina Hodges started their payday lending business in the 1990s with a few stores in Nashville. 
The company, then called Advance Pay Day, steadily expanded, making payday loans and offering products like bus passes, check cashing and money transfers. In 2009, the Hodges told a local news outlet that they wanted to shed the image of a “simple payday advance company,” so the company took on a new name, Advance Financial. 
By 2010, Advance had generated a modest $15 million in revenue from about two dozen stores, according to statements it made in news reports at the time.
Not long after, the growing business collided with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal regulator Congress created after the banking crisis. The CFPB had started to take aim at high-interest payday lenders, releasing a 2013 report on the dangers of the loans as debt traps. A subsequent agency report found that payday lenders, particularly in Tennessee, relied heavily on offering loans to those who couldn’t afford them. Advance declined to respond to a question about the CFPB report.

























Advance Financial lobbied Tennessee lawmakers to approve bigger loans that accumulate higher fees, saying the new offering would be “a little bit more expensive” but arguing it would be good for consumers. (Stacy Kranitz for ProPublica)
Looking for an alternative product that wouldn’t fall under the CPFB’s looming regulations, Advance turned to Tennessee lawmakers, who have power over statewide interest rates. The company hired Earnest, the former top aide for the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions, which regulates payday lenders. It also opened up a political action committee and began to push lawmakers to allow it to create the Flex Loan. 
In a hearing discussing the Flex Loan legislation before its passage, Earnest told a Tennessee Senate committee the new loan was like a line of credit you could get at a bank, acknowledging it would be “a little bit more expensive.”
But the proposal added significant potential costs. To allow lenders to circumvent the state’s interest rate cap, the legislature simply called the interest something else: a “customary fee.” The law would permit flex lenders to charge 24% interest plus a daily fee until the loan is paid off. The fee is calculated by multiplying the loan amount by 0.7%. Over 365 days the fee adds 255.5% to the cost of the loan. Advance’s own documentation tells borrowers that although the state and Advance call it a fee, the federal government sees it for what it is, an interest rate. 
The bill passed the state Senate without opposition. In the House, only Democratic state Rep. Mike Stewart spoke against the bill, which passed overwhelmingly and was later signed by Republican Gov. Bill Haslam.
Stewart pointed out the new law allowed companies to recoup attorneys fees in court, something payday lenders had not been allowed to do, and a practice he knew as a lawyer would likely increase the number of lawsuits. 
“The legislation was structured to maximize the amount of money they could extract from these debtors,” Stewart, who has since left the legislature, said in an interview. 
After legalization of the Flex Loan, Advance Financial’s business boomed. The company expanded to all corners of Tennessee, growing to 105 locations by the end of the 2010s. 
As a private company, Advance is not required to release financial information. But Advance and the Hodges were vocal about their success, at least at first. The company self-reported to the Nashville Business Journal in 2019 that it made $392 million, quintupling its revenue from the year before it started offering the Flex Loan, and making more than 25 times as much as it had at the start of the decade. Advance’s revenue no longer appeared on any of the business journals’ lists after 2019. 
Those numbers parallel the growth of the flex loan industry in Tennessee. By 2019, all flex lenders across the state had generated about $730 million in operating income, a number that has continued to grow, according to state records. In 2022, the latest available year of data, flex lenders earned $880 million in operating income. 
The company is one of the top campaign donors to Tennessee politicians, having spent roughly $2.5 million since 2014. Advance has also spent over $3 million lobbying state lawmakers over the past decade. 
The Hodges have also made roughly $10 million in political donations to federal candidates since 2014, including over $3 million to support President Donald Trump’s campaigns. In a 2019 recording obtained by The Washington Post, Hodges told a payday lending industry group his political donations granted him better access to Trump. Hodges told the Post he was an enthusiastic supporter of Trump and never used his status to ask the Trump administration for help.
A Trump-appointed CFPB director rescinded most of the payday lending regulations in 2020. 
The new Trump administration has tried to gut the CFPB, but an appeals court on April 28 upheld a lower court ruling preventing the acting CFPB director from firing about 90% of the department’s employees.
Today, Advance’s only product is the Flex Loan.
A Wave of Lawsuits
Before the Flex Loan, court records show that payday lenders like Advance rarely took borrowers to court. The low $500 cap on loan amounts and the prohibition on collecting attorneys fees often made suing people unprofitable. 
The Flex Loan law changed all that, unleashing a wave of lawsuits. 
Across the 59 counties where electronic court records are available — home to over four-fifths of the state’s roughly 7 million people — Advance has brought one lawsuit for every 50 residents since 2015, according to a data analysis by the Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica. 
For Tonya Davis, a single mother who works at a local hospital, Advance waited six years to sue. Tennessee’s debt collection law allows lenders to file a suit within six years and, if the company wins a judgment in court, to pursue the debt for another decade. 
Davis lives in Davidson County, where Advance operates more stores than in any other county in Tennessee. Advance has filed over 22,000 lawsuits in Davidson over the decade since it began offering Flex Loans, its highest county total. Its stores in Nashville, which is located in that county, are generally in neighborhoods where households have lower incomes. 
Davis said Advance contacted her in 2018, claiming she owed money on a Flex Loan taken out the previous year. Davis said she never borrowed the money and was the victim of identity theft, a claim the company told her it would look into after she told Advance in a phone call that the Social Security number on the account wasn’t hers.
The company never reached back out to her, she said, and for years, she heard nothing from Advance, but in 2024, she received a summons declaring it was suing her for almost $4,800.

At the time Davis was caring for her dying mother and missed her court hearing. Because she didn’t appear, Advance won a default judgment against her for the full amount. 
Davis could not afford an attorney, so she filed an appeal on her own, but she never got a chance to challenge the judgment. Soon after the hearing began, attorneys for Advance noted that Davis had filed her appeal one day past the filing deadline and the judge denied her appeal. 
The company’s default judgment means Davis is required to pay Advance $175 a month.
“I’m not a lawyer,” Davis said in an interview. “I’m trying to do the best I can with what I have. I don’t know anything about this, or I would have paid, but they didn’t even give me the opportunity to present my information.”
Challenging Advance in court can be daunting. When Advance goes to court for a Flex Loan, it wins a majority of the time, in part because borrowers often fail to show up and in part because the company has more legal resources. The company has won over $200 million in judgments since the start of 2015. 
Mandy Spears, the deputy director of the Tennessee-based think tank The Sycamore Institute, said in court that lenders have all the advantages because they have lawyers with vast experience in the system. 
“It’s just complicated for the average person versus a more sophisticated business or law firm,” she said. “It’s really a gap in knowledge and expertise.”

Many defendants don’t realize that when they fail to appear in court, the company doesn’t have to provide detailed documents proving what a borrower owes. 
Tessa Shearon, a 27-year-old mother in McMinnville, thought she paid off her loan with Advance Financial in 2020. When the company sued her almost three years later, she missed her court hearing because she was eight months pregnant and on bed rest. A judge ruled her in default and Advance won a judgment for $4,700.
Shearon didn’t keep any documentation after paying off her loan, but she said she reached out to Advance’s lawyer to dispute the lawsuit. The company has not sought to garnish her wages. But she remains in limbo: Under the law, the company can choose to file a wage garnishment any time in the next 10 years to recover the judgment amount. 
“My only worry is them attempting to collect,” Shearon said. “I don’t have anything.”
Marla Williams, a consumer law attorney for the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee, is one of a handful of lawyers who’ve helped defend borrowers against Advance.
In several cases, Williams has been able to block wage garnishments and reduce the customary fee the company charges.
Williams said that in a 2024 case, she was able to lower the payments from an unaffordable several hundred dollars a month to around $50 per month, which her client could afford. Advance fought the reduction, but a judge ruled in her favor. 
In another case, Williams said Advance tried to charge a borrower thousands of dollars in additional fees months after he stopped paying the loan. After a hearing, which most borrowers without lawyers don’t ask for, a judge reduced the fees, calling the added charges “unconscionable and unjust,” court records show.

Williams said the company often uses aggressive tactics in court, something that she’s observed over the past decade. 
“This is their business model,” she said.
Advance declined to discuss its business model or legal strategy.
Sometimes Advance has already made money off the borrower before suing them, as in the case of Hansen. Over 10 months, Hansen paid Advance nearly $2,200 more than she borrowed, records show.
She still owed almost $3,000 when she stopped paying Advance. The company waited around three months before declaring her in default, letting her debt grow before it sued her several months later. With the addition of attorneys fees and court-added interest, the company sued her for $6,000. 
Hansen, who asked to use her maiden name because she’s no longer married, lost her home in 2022, moving into an apartment, which she said costs more than her mortgage had.
Hansen said she plans to pay Advance by the summer. A February bonus check, which the company garnished 25% of, has helped. 
“I understand it’s every person for themselves, and they’re out to make a buck,” Hansen said about Advance. “But you know what, people out there are struggling every single day, and that’s what they take advantage of.”

How We Tracked Advance Financial’s Lawsuits



For this story, the Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica used online portals to find civil cases in Tennessee General Sessions Courts for the 59 counties where electronic court records are available. More than four-fifths of the state’s population lives in these counties. Our analysis included cases filed and uploaded to the online portals from 2009 through 2024. We filtered the data for cases brought by payday lenders in Tennessee, using company names, and found that Advance was filing significantly more suits than any other payday lender, according to court records. 
Advance Financial often uses a related company called Harpeth Financial Services to file lawsuits against borrowers. Not every case listed the type of loan behind the lawsuit, but a pattern emerged: After Advance started offering Flex Loans in 2015, the number of lawsuits it filed significantly increased.
Of the cases in our data that were filed by Advance, over half had a judgment amount awarded, indicating the company won its lawsuit. About three-quarters of the cases filed had information on whether a wage garnishment was or wasn’t filed against a borrower. Our analysis found that among cases where that information was available, 40% included wage garnishment.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tennessee-Flex-Loans-3x2_preview-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 07:00:52.916404

WEST MICHIGAN — Proposed federal budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration could pull the plug on a vital data network for Lake Michigan, impacting everything from boater safety and fishing forecasts to beach monitoring and drinking water intakes. 
The Great Lakes Observing System, which supports the management of over 77 buoys, meteorological towers, and high-frequency radar units specifically on Lake Michigan, faces a potential shutdown of its real-time data collection if proposed cuts of roughly $1.6 billion to NOAA in the fiscal year 2026 Trump Administration budget go through.
This network provides continuous, real-time information on critical conditions such as wind speed, air temperature, wave height, water temperature at various depths, and water-quality parameters. This data, freely accessible to the public on GLOS’ data platform Seagull and other apps, is essential for a wide range of users.
“If the funding cuts zero out costs, we know a number of buoys won’t be going out on the water,” said Shelby Brunner, Science and Observations Manager for GLOS. “We would have to fundraise and see how to support them. There could be a number of downstream effects that we don’t really know.”
 Safety and recreation at risk

The real-time data is crucial for recreational boaters and commercial freighters navigating Lake Michigan, helping them make safe and efficient decisions based on up-to-the-minute conditions.
A seemingly small difference between a 1.5-foot wave and a 4-foot wave can be critical for vessel safety. The information also aids the National Weather Service in refining regional forecasts based on actual, localized conditions.
“It can make a big difference on the safety piece,” Brunner said. “Being able to deliver that data helps marinas and harbors improve the experience for their guests and safety.”
The U.S. Coast Guard also utilizes this information in search and rescue operations.
Recreational activities like fishing and swimming also heavily rely on GLOS data. Charter fishermen use water temperature profiles to strategically locate fish, while the network monitors for harmful algal blooms and E. coli outbreaks that can close beaches and threaten water supplies. GLOS data supports the water treatment plant in Green Bay, Wisconsin,  for example.
Lake Michigan’s high recreational use makes this real-time monitoring particularly important. The lake is among the most popular boating destinations in the Great Lakes.

 Environmental monitoring in jeopardy

The potential loss of GLOS funding would also severely hamper the ability to monitor and respond to environmental emergencies.
The total amount of money at risk for GLOS core operations in fiscal year 2025 is $2.3 million, with an additional $3 million for equipment upgrades also being held back. The proposed federal cuts raise serious concerns about the future of this critical data network and its ability to serve the millions who rely on Lake Michigan.
High-frequency radars located at the Straits of Mackinac, a vital waterway connecting Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, provide detailed information on water movement. This is critical for tracking the potential spread of oil spills, allowing coastal managers to take timely action to protect beaches and water intakes.
“If there is an oil spill, we want to know which way it’s going and tell coastal managers to close beaches and try to mitigate and contain the oil the best we can,” Brunner said. “The high-frequency data may not be available or may not have anyone to maintain it. If anything happens, we don’t get that chance back. You can’t just undo.”
 Impact on research, long-term understanding

The GLOS network in Lake Michigan also supports numerous long-term research projects in partnership with academic institutions.
Buoys deployed by researchers contribute to understanding the lake’s complex ecosystem, including water quality, fish populations, and the impacts of invasive species like zebra mussels, which have dramatically altered the lake’s ecology. Continuous monitoring helps track these changes and maintain crucial baseline data.
The Ann Arbor-based Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, a key data partner of GLOS, also faces potential disruptions due to the proposed cuts. GLERL conducts extensive research on Lake Michigan and operates research vessels essential for data collection. Loss of funding or a change in GLERL’s focus could significantly impact research and monitoring efforts on the lake.
 Broader regional implications

The data collected by GLOS on Lake Michigan is also interconnected with broader monitoring efforts across the Great Lakes region, providing valuable context for understanding nutrient loading and watershed changes that can impact the lake.
The potential shutdown of the network would not only affect Lake Michigan but could also have ripple effects across the entire Great Lakes ecosystem.
“If we experience a loss of funding for GLOS, we anticipate decreased certainty of safety and decision-making data for everyone from the hundreds of thousands of tourists to the businesses who live there, to the maritime economy — fishing and charter fishermen,” Brunner said. “The information we provide benefits everyone and has wide-reaching implications around safety, economy and water quality.”
As the Great Lakes regional association for the Integrated Ocean Observing System, GLOS serves as the central hub for data and information in the region.
Although officially recognized, GLOS heavily depends on a wide network of partners — including municipalities, universities, research groups, and businesses — who manage and deploy their own observing assets, some with GLOS’s financial or procurement support.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NOAA-pic.jpg,,,2025-05-05 06:01:28.634090

(AmeriCorps photo)West Virginia has declined to join states suing the Trump administration to block the cancellation of AmeriCorps programs.
Federal officials abruptly slashed $440 million in funds for the long-standing volunteer service program and put most of its administrative members on leave. 
More than 200 AmeriCorps members have already lost their jobs in West Virginia, and the program’s budget reduction will affect the state’s workforce development, after-school programs, housing construction through Habitat for Humanity and more. 
About two dozen states, including Kentucky and Pennsylvania, said in a lawsuit filed April 29 that President Donald Trump’s cost-cutting efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency illegally gutted AmeriCorps. 
“If the Defendants’ actions are permitted to stand despite their statutory and constitutional defects, then the gutting of AmeriCorps will inflict immediate and irreparable harms on the Plaintiff States, their residents, and the public at large,” reads the lawsuit, which was filed in Maryland federal court.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey and Attorney General J.B. McCuskey didn’t sign on to the suit. A spokesperson for McCuskey’s office didn’t return a request for comment. 
A spokesperson for Morrisey said on Friday that, “The governor believes most matters can be solved through collaboration and communication rather than lawsuits. The governor will continue to fight to protect all West Virginians and will work diligently to help all those impacted.”
While serving as attorney general, Morrisey took on numerous fights against the Biden administration, including lawsuits fighting air quality rules and the former president’s border policy. 
The White House has pointed to improper payments and failed audits as justification for the cuts. “AmeriCorps has failed eight consecutive audits and is entrusted with over $1 billion in taxpayer dollars every year,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told the Washington Post.
AmeriCorps oversees a number of programs that dispatch hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of people to service opportunities around the country. 
“In an attempt to dismantle the agency, the Trump administration and its DOGE demolition team made abrupt and drastic cuts to staff and volunteers and terminated grants,” said Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser in a statement. “We are suing to stop this illegal dismantling of AmeriCorps and preserve the spirit of community service in our state and nation.”
Last year, the program connected nearly 3,000 AmeriCorps members with project opportunities in West Virginia. The lawsuit listed several cities where Americorps volunteers are currently serving, including Charleston, Fairmont, Weston and Wheeling. 
U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, now a high-ranking member of the Senate, told MetroNews that the news was of great concern to her.
“There’s no doubt that the core functions that AmeriCorps is performing in a state like ours are pretty critical to fill gaps where we cannot fill them on our own,” she said. “So, I would say this is new news, and we’re going to help them work through this.”

(Photo by Kirsten Strough/USDA)Since March, Gov. Josh Shapiro and the Trump administration have been sparring over the cancellation of a program that provides millions in funding for Pennsylvania farmers who provide products for local food banks. There have been threats of a lawsuit, letters and public comments by state and federal officials.
“This isn’t some hope of mine that we would fund our farmers and our food banks,” Shapiro said during a press conference on April 21. “We had a three-year contract that the federal government broke in month four.”
The deal, the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA), was established in 2021 under President Joe Biden’s administration in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The latest contract was renewed in the final months of Biden’s term. However, Trump’s administration confirmed in March that the program was ending, impacting farmers and food banks across the nation.
Shapiro described LFPA as a “really successful program” through the Department of Agriculture that supported nearly 190 farms and 13 regional food banks across the state. On March 25, the governor said his administration sent an appeal to get the money they were supposed to be awarded, as well as a letter to the Trump administration. He reiterated that stance late last month and said the state is waiting on a response from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
“I know I’m a former (state) attorney general and a lawyer, but you don’t need a law degree to know the ancient legal doctrine of a deal is a deal,” Shapiro said. “They made a deal with Pennsylvania. They’ve got to honor that deal. And I’m fighting for every dollar that’s owed to Pennsylvania.”
Shapiro’s comments on April 21 were the latest in the back-and-forth between his administration and the federal government as farmers and food banks wait for a resolution.

How have farms and food banks been impacted?
A letter from the Shapiro administration lists all of the farms and products that are made available through the program. Feeding PA, which partners with farmers, released a sheet detailing LFPA’s impact. 
“I want to be able to continue the impact that I’ve already had,” said Amy Brickner, a third-generation dairy farmer in Cumberland County who has participated in the LFPA program, during a press conference on March 25. “And that is from these grant programs for dairy farmers to help me cover the expenses and give back to my community.”
Logan Brace, owner of Brace’s Orchard, is a ninth-generation farmer in Luzerne County. He highlighted the relationship they’ve had with the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg NEPA Regional Food Bank as a result of the program, saying it has been “a tremendous help for our business.” 
“Since LFPA funds have been available, we have worked together the past three seasons and look forward to continuing the relationship in 2025,” Brace wrote. “The food bank places regular orders and purchases some extra skids when we have surplus. These orders help cover the costs for harvesting and storing produce throughout the winter and spring.”
Food banks are also concerned their shelves will take a hit, and hurt people who rely on their services.
Joe Arthur, CEO of the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank, which serves 27 counties and more than 253,000 people each month, was appreciative of the Shapiro administration for bringing the issue to the public.
“For our food bank alone, that cut means losing $1.8 million over 15 months — that’s $120,000 a month and 500,000 meals that won’t reach the children and adults who rely on us,” Arthur said. “It also means fewer resources for our local farmers, who supply the fresh, nutritious food that makes this program so impactful. This isn’t just about meals—it’s about families, communities, and our local economy.”

Rollins: ‘They don’t have their facts right’
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins made a trip to central Pennsylvania on April 14 to tour multiple farms. She promoted the Trump administration’s focus on agriculture and defended the tariffs recently put in place on foreign products as a move to “save America.”
While speaking with reporters, she appeared to take issue with the statement from Shapiro’s administration that the USDA was canceling $13 million over the next three years in funding for that program.
Rollins said she respects Shapiro, but claimed that they “don’t have their facts right, or they’re playing games.”
“They’re trying to make this a political issue,” Rollins said to reporters at Martin’s Family Farm in Myerstown, Lebanon County. “The money is there.”
Rollins claimed that USDA has “released almost $1 billion dollars to food banks” nationally since she became secretary and added there was money sitting in state accounts to support food banks.

Pa. agriculture secretary disagrees: “This is incorrect’
Just a few days after Rollins’ claim, Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding penned a letter to her and the state’s congressional delegation refuting that claim that there are tens of millions in a bank account anywhere.
“To the contrary, Pennsylvania uses its own funds to operate the program, and seeks reimbursement from the USDA after those funds have been spent,” Redding wrote.
Redding said the previous rounds of funding via the LFPA program, prior to the cancelled contract, had totaled nearly $30 million in Pennsylvania and said that the state’s agriculture department has been “proud” to partner with USDA on the initiative. 
Of that $30 million, he noted the state has received reimbursements of $17.8 million for money it has spent under the program thus far, and has already submitted a reimbursement request for an additional $9.1 million, which was approved for payment recently. This means that approximately $2.9 million is the remaining balance from the previous agreement.
The funding represented as much as 15% of the food banks’ purchasing budget, “a significant amount that provides millions of meals to hungry Pennsylvanians,” according to Redding.
“The Commonwealth looked forward to building on the success of these prior rounds of funding, and was grateful when the USDA committed an additional $13 million to Pennsylvania through the LFPA25 allocation,” Redding said, referring to the money that was slated to be allotted to the state under the most recent contract signed in December.
“Through the end of July, we will continue to spend all remaining program dollars under the second round of funding, as required by the terms of our cooperative agreement,” Redding wrote.
Redding said he has still not received a response from the USDA from his initial letter on March 25 and asked that the USDA reconsider its decision to terminate the most recent contract, which would provide $13 million for the program over the next three years.
“Pennsylvania has held up its end of the bargain. LFPA funds have been used by food banks across the Commonwealth to buy food directly from Pennsylvania farmers, in furtherance of the program’s essential goals,” Redding wrote.
The USDA did not respond to a request for comment from the Capital-Star about Redding’s letter. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Food banks hold out hope
As food banks wait to see the outcome in the ongoing saga, they tell the Capital-Star that they are already being impacted by this decision.
The Central Pennsylvania Food Bank said they are “leaning heavily into getting as much help as possible from donors right now.”
“There is no way to make up the gap, but we are working harder than ever to do what we can,” Lisa Rashid, Central Pennsylvania Food Bank Senior Development Manager said. “Our neighbors looking for assistance will also likely get less, as we try to stretch what we have among even more people needing our help during this difficult hunger crisis we are in, with the cost of food rising and people struggling to make tough financial choices.” 
The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank said the LFPA funding and TEFAP CCC bonus helped them source 6.3 million pounds of food annually, which accounts for 13% of the total food they are currently distributing. 
“The reduction in USDA commodities, combined with potential cuts to SNAP, could make it more challenging for the Food Bank to get food to our neighbors who need it most,” said Colleen Young, Director of Government Affairs for the Greater Pittsburgh Food Bank.
Both food banks aren’t giving up hope just yet though and offered a few potential solutions, in addition to reversing the decision to cancel the LFPA program, that would assist them. One would be for the legislature to pass Shapiro’s funding proposal for both the State Food Purchase Program, also known as SFPP, and the Pennsylvania Agricultural Surplus System, referred to as PASS.
SFPP provides cash grants to counties for the purchase and distribution of food to low income individuals and is intended to supplement the efforts of food banks and other similar organizations aiming to reduce hunger.
PASS allows the state’s agriculture industry to donate food products to the non-profit sector who assist Pennsylvanians at risk of hunger. Through this program, the agricultural industry is reimbursed for the costs associated with donating these foods.
The other suggestion from the food banks would be for people to reach out to their elected representative.
“To make sure they understand the severity of food insecurity in our region and the importance of food resource programs,” Young said.

“Life safety will always take precedence,” Schipritt, 46, said. “When we’re down to two or three officers working a night shift, I can’t staff two boats on patrol. Or, we might have to sacrifice staffing a boating ramp during the day watching fishermen.”
It’s mostly thanks to better retirement benefits extended to state public safety workers under the state’s fiscal 2025 budget. The state has also eased degree requirements and increased pay for its environmental police division in recent years.
Recruitment efforts took a dive in 2020 as public perception of law enforcement dimmed. Schipritt struggled to recruit and retain environmental officers while other local police departments offered better retirement packages, and game wardens in other states earned higher salaries.

As of Jan. 1, more than 340 state public safety workers within the state pension system, including with DEM, Rhode Island Capitol Police and campus police officers, can now receive the same benefits as municipal police and firefighters under changes enacted by the Rhode Island General Assembly as part of the state spending plan.
The pension reforms including a lower retirement age and higher retirement allowance, partially reverse the 2012 pension cuts led by then- General Treasurer Gina Raimondo. To account for the estimated $17 million increase in accrued liability, the state is expected to put $3.8 million more per year into the pension system for the next 20 years, Wil Arboleda, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Office of the General Treasurer, said. 
“That number is — however — an estimate, particularly as it relates to out-years and will fluctuate based on factors like salary increases, inflation, and system experience,” Arboleda said in an email.
The state’s pension fund for state employees faced a $2.1 billion unfunded liability as of June 30, 2024, according to a Dec. 19 actuarial report by national consulting firm Gabriel, Roeder, Smith & Company. The fiscal 2025 budget included a $222 million  payment to the state employee pension fund, expected to rise to $243.3 million in fiscal 2026.
The pension costs are a small price to pay, says Michael Woods, chair of the New England chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. Woods advocated for the pension changes for environmental police during the 2024 legislative session, stressing the importance of more competitive benefits to protect state lands and waters.
“This is our first line of defense against wildlife and environmental violators,” Woods said in a recent interview. “They are the ones out in the field, catching people who abuse public resources.”

Big job in a small state
The DEM police provide 24/7 patrols and protections for state waters and parks, enforcing environmental protections, public safety and regulations governing marine activity and commercial and recreational fishing and wildlife. More than 66,000 hunting and fishing licenses and permits are sold in-state each year, according to DEM’s website. And across the 40,000 acres of state-owned land, environmental police are charged with stopping criminal activity such as vandalism, larceny, assault and motor vehicle restrictions.
When a small passenger plane missed its landing, crashing into waters off Quonset Point in North Kingstown in March 2024, DEM police were first on the scene, quickly deploying four of its marine officers based out of nearby Wickford, according to news reports. The DEM officers pulled the man and woman in the plane crash from the water; they were subsequently taken by local police and fire crews to a local hospital. 
It’s hardly the Ranger Rick or Smokey Bear fantasy many imagine when they think of division, said Schipritt.
“We break up domestic fights, criminal activities, everything like actual police,” he said. 
And yet, “It’s not uncommon to hear, ‘Oh, you’re not a real cop, you can’t arrest me.’”










This is our first line of defense against wildlife and environmental violators. They are the ones out in the field, catching people who abuse public resources.


– Michael Woods, chair of the New England chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers


Misunderstanding of the duties of DEM’s law enforcement division plagued recruitment efforts too, with many potential recruits not realizing that the job required a bachelor’s degree in an environmental field.
“A lot of people who wanted to be environmental police didn’t realize what our degree requirements were,” Schipritt said. “They would get a criminal justice degree, then find out they couldn’t apply.”
He added, “the people we were able to hire were fantastic candidates, but the pool was very limited.”
Retirements and resignations worsened the shortage; the division has advertised to fill open officer positions 20 times in the last five years, Schipritt said.
Two years ago, the state agreed to the agency’s request to ease degree requirements for entry-level environmental police officers, accepting a bachelor’s degree in either environmental field or criminal justice. At the same time, reclassifications approved in 2023 boosted starting salary ranges for environmental police officers by up to 20%, from a $61,460 to $70,983 initial offer, to a range of $73,517 to $82,725.
‘Now it makes sense to stay’
Money and retirement benefits weren’t what attracted 26-year-old Lucas Walter to a job with DEM’s law enforcement division. The University of Rhode Island graduate and Army National Guard officer always wanted a career that would let him spend time outdoors. He decided to follow in the footsteps of both his forestry major parents as a state environmental police officer.
But the boost to retirement and salary make Walter more apt to make his career at DEM a permanent one.
“Before, the benefits plan was pretty weak,” Walter said. “Now it makes sense to stay in this job for the long term and do the whole stint with the pension and everything.”
Walter joined the U.S. Army to ensure he had a way to pay for his college education. Walter graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 2023 with a bachelor’s degree in conservation biology, after which he completed his training with the state’s municipal police academy. He’s still a member of the Army National Guard.
Walter is expected to complete his training in the next month, at which time his conditional hiring with state environmental police will become permanent — something both Walter and Schipritt are eagerly anticipating.
Schipritt relishes his job for the balance between fast-paced police work and the tranquility of time in nature.
“The police side is exciting, but when you get sick of that, you take the boat out or the ATV out to go check on the hunters,” said Schipritt.
His favorite work post is Point Judith. The so-called “Calamari Capital” of the East Coast makes the southern Rhode Island landing area a popular spot for commercial fishermen, and for environmental police to check their landings.
Lucas also said working with commercial fishermen is one of his favorite parts of the job so far.
“With the amount of money involved, it’s a big deal, so you can really make a difference if someone is doing something wrong,” he said of policing the fishing industry.

Always “an organized person,” Harrison “knew something was wrong” when, in 2018, she started feeling confused and lost at work. 
Waking at 5 a.m. for work, the Nicholasville woman, 65, said she eventually “made an index card to tell me every step I had to take every morning: brush my teeth, floss…put your makeup on. I had to write it all out, because I would just stand in front of the mirror not knowing what to do.” 
Harrison is one of the more than 80,000 Kentuckians aged 65 and older living with an Alzheimer’s diagnosis as reported in the 2025 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures Report, released by the Alzheimer’s Association last week. 
Her husband, Joe, is one of the 160,000 Kentucky residents that the new report says provide unpaid care for a loved one with Alzheimer’s. 
Alzheimer’s disease, which falls under the umbrella of dementia, is characterized by memory loss and is incurable, though treatments exist. 
One of those treatments underwent clinical trials at the University of Kentucky, Lecanemab (brand name Leqembi). This is an antibody that targets — and in some cases, removes — amyloid plaques from the brain, and has shown some success in slowing cognitive decline. Amyloid plaques are proteins that formin the brain and are believed to be a significant driver of Alzheimer’s. Lecanemab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2023. 
Referring to lecanemab, Mackenzie Wallace, the director of public policy at the Alzheimer’s Association in Kentucky, told the Lantern that this “is an exciting time” for treating the disease. 
In March, Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, announced Kentucky invested $300,000 into space research that will allow the Louisville nonprofit National Stem Cell Foundation to continue researching the way brain cells behave in microgravity in the hopes of finding better treatments — and cures — for Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s. 
The money — which was allocated in the 2024 legislative session’s Senate Bill 1 — is a 10% match for a $3.1 million NASA grant. 
Scientists hope that research can result in a cure. Meanwhile, this is “the first time in more than 20 years that we actually have a treatment now that is effective at slowing the progression of the disease, and it’s also the first treatment that actually addresses the underlying biology of the disease,” Wallace said of lecanemab. 
It’s key to start Lecanemab in the early stages of the disease, making it unsurprising that Tuesday’s report showed most — 79% of Americans surveyed — want to know if they have Alzheimer’s early. 
“I think Americans want to know now that it’s becoming less of a taboo or less of a stigma to talk about brain health, and Americans want to know about it, and they want to talk about it,” Wallace said. 
  Most — 79% of Americans surveyed — want to know if they have Alzheimer’s early. (Facts and Figures Report)
 By the numbers: what does the new report show?  
Shannon White, executive director of the Alzheimer’s Association’s Greater Kentucky and Southern Indiana chapter, called the Tuesday report’s findings “profound.” 
“Now more than ever, we need to work to advance disease research and treatments that can slow the current trajectory and help all Kentucky families affected by Alzheimer’s and other dementia,” White said in a statement. 
The 2025 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures Report shows, among other things, a serious need for more geriatricians and more personal aides to care for the 80,500 senior Kentuckians who live with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. 
There were 48 providers with geriatric certificates in Kentucky in 2021, according to the Facts and Figures report. It estimates Kentucky will need 393 by 2050 to care for all Kentuckians 65 and older and at least 144 geriatricians to care only for those with Alzheimer’s or dementia. 
“To meet the increased need and the demand by 2050 we’re going to need a 200% increase in geriatricians,” Wallace said. “And that’s just … almost unfathomable.” 
The number of diagnoses are expected to increase as the Baby Boomer generation continues to age. It’s also worth noting, Wallace said, that not everyone who has Alzheimer’s has a diagnosis. 
“We know that, still, early detection and diagnosis is a challenge. Even disclosure of diagnosis is still a problem, stigma, denial, etcetera — all of those still impact or affect the ability or desire of people to be able to get a diagnosis. And so the fact that we’re already at 7.2 million people with a diagnosis (nationally) definitely makes you wonder like, wow, how much would that number increase if we kind of thought or were able to measure the people that are at risk, or that have mild cognitive impairment but have not yet been diagnosed?” Wallace said. “I think that’s pretty shocking.”

The report also showed: 

There are 80,500 Kentucky residents aged 65 and older living with Alzheimer’s. 
10% of adults 65 and older live with Alzheimer’s. 
In 2022, 1,509 Kentuckians died from Alzheimer’s. 
In 2024, there were 160,000 Kentucky residents serving as unpaid family caregivers. 
Those Kentuckians provided 307 million hours of unpaid care worth $4.9 billion. 

Among other policies Wallace wants Kentucky to implement, she’d like to see an incentive program for caregivers, similar to the Credit for Caring Act that was introduced in Congress in 2024 that would give eligible caregivers a $5,000 tax credit. 
“The cost of this disease is really just staggering,” Wallace said. When it comes to unpaid caregivers, she said, “these are family members, friends, neighbors, loved ones, that are trying to provide care for individuals, for their loved ones.” 
If those Kentuckians who are receiving unpaid care were to have to live in nursing homes, Wallace said, “that’s at a great cost to the state” and it’s not as good for the patients. 
Meanwhile, Wallace said, unpaid caregivers carry an “all consuming” responsibility. 
“If caregivers are out here providing care to their loved one in the home, what does that mean for their own financial well being? Are they dipping into their own retirement funds and savings? Are they having to leave the workforce entirely to provide more care? Are they having to drop down to part time?” Wallace said. “It’s a huge economic toll on caregivers financially, and then on the other side of the coin, it’s a massive toll on our caregivers for their own well being.” 
‘You can’t see Alzheimer’s.’

It took Reda Harrison two years to “wrap my arms around” her Alzheimer’s diagnosis. She credits her Christian faith with helping her learn to cope with it and, ultimately, share her story with others. 
Harrison, who no longer works, attends a support group in Louisville, founded one in Lexington and volunteers with the Alzheimer’s Association. 
“Everybody’s case is different. It affects you differently. For me, it was more confusion,” Harrison said. “Since I left work, what I’ve noticed is my short term memory is really bad. I can do something and, a minute later, I can’t remember if I did it or not.” 
In addition to attending support groups and volunteering, Harrison fills her time with “anything I can to improve my brain.” She takes piano lessons, studies Spanish on Duolingo, a language learning app, practices yoga, quilts and does beadwork. 
Her service dog, Dolly Parton — named after the musician and philanthropist because of the poodle’s “poofy hair” — helps her cope with the depression that comes with her diagnosis. Dolly Parton, the dog, can also help direct her home if she goes for a walk and gets turned around. 
“She has really been a lifesaver for me,” Harrison said. “The way she helps me, mostly, is emotional. If I’m having a tough day, she just knows. She’s very comforting, because with this disease, you have a tendency to get depressed. And she helps me.” 
Poodle Dolly Parton runs all Harrison’s errands with her as well and loves to be in the car. 
“She’s just my companion,” Harrison said. “She keeps me independent.” 
Harrison, who is taking Leqembi infusions now, isn’t sure what the future holds for her, or how her Alzheimer’s will progress.

“People decline so differently. Some of the ones that I used to have conversations with can’t even talk anymore. But for me, I really haven’t declined that much. I think it’s just my relationship with God, but I don’t know — there’s no science behind that,” she said. “I’m happy. I have learned to embrace my disease and I don’t run from it. You can’t run from it. You can’t hide from it.” 
She wants more people to research Alzheimer’s and educate themselves on it, she said. She believes that’s the key to defeating societal stigma around it. 
“People say, ‘Oh, you don’t look like you have Alzheimer’s. You look normal,’” Harrison said. “They don’t know what Alzheimer is. You can’t see Alzheimer’s until you’re far into it.” 
Since her diagnosis, she’s lost friends who just felt too uncomfortable with the disease to be around her, she said, saying it felt like “leprosy in the Bible times.” That hurts, and she wants to change negative perceptions of the disease. 
“I am still Reda. I am the same person I’ve always been. I’m probably a nicer person now, more caring,” she said. “We still want to be treated for who we are.”

Enrollment in Head Start has dropped from a decade ago, but the waitlist for the early childhood education program remains long, according to the latest Rhode Island KIDS COUNT Factbook released Monday. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Data-crunching policy and advocacy nonprofit Rhode Island KIDS COUNT presents what it does every year in its 31st annual Factbook scheduled for release Monday: scores of charts, graphs and numbers to illuminate how things have changed for the babies, kids and teens of Rhode Island in the past few years.
But as the executive summary for this year’s Factbook notes, things are not the same as last year. The new report highlights what could be at stake for kids within the context of sweeping proposals to cut federal social services and programs, like Medicaid, SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), Head Start, and programs promoting child immunizations and healthy school meals
Nearly 50,000 Rhode Island schoolchildren could no longer be eligible for breakfast and lunch at no cost during the school day. The wait list for Head Start early education programs could grow even longer. And the percentage of children living in poverty who visit a dentist each year, already alarmingly low, could continue to drop.
“We must ensure that families will be able to access the programs that help them thrive,” the executive summary states.
More than 44,951 children in Rhode Island were on SNAP as of October 2024, with a family of three receiving an average monthly food stamp benefit of $766. Of these SNAP households, 70% made under the federal poverty level of $25,820 for a family of three. 
National school meal programs are another source of nourishment for kids. In December 2024, 35,314 Rhode Island kids received free breakfast at school, and 75,933 ate free lunch. 
But the executive summary notes that a Congressional GOP proposal to retool the Community Eligibility Provision would reduce the number of eligible schools in the state, as it would require schools to have a higher percentage of low-income students to qualify. Raising that threshold from 25% to 60%, as the House proposal in February suggested, would reduce the number of students in Rhode Island eligible for free school meals from 98,092 to 49,155.
Advocates are also concerned about federal budget proposals targeting programs like Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which together enrolled 117,890 Rhode Island children through the managed care health insurance program RIte Care at the end of 2024. Finally, there’s the early education program Head Start, which has shuttered five regional offices, generating unease amongst providers. There were 1,438 children enrolled in Head Start in Rhode Island in October 2024, with 493 children still on a waitlist.
In an email Sunday ahead of the report’s release, Paige Parks, the executive director of Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, emphasized diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as also being “under attack from the federal government despite the persistent and unacceptable disparities in child well-being by race, ethnicity, income, disability, language, sexual orientation, gender identity, neighborhood, and zip code.”
“These disparities will continue to persist among children and families if equity and equitable policies and investments are removed and if federally collected data becomes less available,” Parks said. “We must use data as our compass to address disparities and to ensure all children have the opportunities needed to thrive.”
The report adds three new “indicators” this year — family structure, maternal health and mental health — for a total of 67 categories of insight into the state’s youth population. Those indicators are grouped into five major areas of family and community, economic well-being, health, safety and education. 
The report also breaks down data at the community level, with specific stats for indicators as observed in Rhode Island’s 39 communities. 
“Communities and neighborhoods do matter — the actions of community leaders, government leaders, elected officials, businesses, faith organizations, and parents greatly influence children’s chances for success and the challenges they will face,” the Factbook reads.
This year’s report clocks in at 198 pages, and as in past editions, spotlights continuing disparities linked to race, income and geography. 
One example: Rhode Island’s racial demographics are gradually becoming less homogenous, and in 2020, about 47% of Rhode Islanders under 18 were people of color, compared to only 28% of adults. Those figures may not represent the state’s entire population of children of color either; the Factbook notes that the 2020 Census undercounted the demographic even more than it did in 2010.    
But poverty, a perennial concern of the Factbook, continues to disproportionately affect this growing segment of the population. While only 7% of Asian/Pacific Islander and white children lived in poverty between 2019 and 2023, 25% of Hispanic children and 24% of Black children lived in poverty. Among American Indian and Alaska Native children, that figure rose to 29%, and 28% among children who identified as “Some other race.”
“Children in poverty are most at risk of not achieving their full potential,” the introduction states.
Between 2019 and 2023, Rhode Island had a 13% child poverty rate, which equated to 27,224 children living in families with incomes beneath the federal poverty threshold.  
Other data points forming this year’s Factbook:

Homelessness is up again, as it was last year. Public school officials noted 1,966 children as homeless during the 2023-2024 school year. Since the 2021-2022 school year, the number of students identified as homeless has risen by 35%. Additionally, In 2024, 951 children stayed in shelters or hotels funded by the state’s child welfare agency, and 100 children were reported sleeping outdoors for at least one night during January 2025.
In 2023, 78% of children were fully immunized by age two — a slight decline from 82% in 2013, but still above the national average of 67%. Meanwhile, vaccine exemptions are rising: 185 kindergartners and 382 seventh graders received exemptions during the 2024–2025 school year, with over 90% citing religious reasons in both grades.
Only 47% of children with Medicaid visited the dentist for preventive care in 2023, while 65% of children with private insurance did. That same year, 413 children were treated for dental issues in ERs, and 69 were hospitalized with dental problems.
During the 2023–24 school year, schools issued 219 disciplinary actions to kindergarteners, with 182 of them given out-of-school suspensions. Of 9,208 out-of-school-suspensions across all grade levels that year, 54% were for nonviolent offenses. 

New indicators in this year’s Factbook are family structure, maternal health and infant health, which consolidate or replace some previous metrics, including children in single-parent families, grandparents caring for grandchildren, preterm births and low birthweights.
The 2025 Factbook is set to debut Monday morning with a breakfast event at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Warwick. U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and U.S. Reps. Gabe Amo and Seth Magaziner are slated to attend, and Patricia Silva of the futurism-focused nonprofit FutureGood iss scheduled to give the keynote address. Classical High School student Mariah Ajiboye, who is also board co-chair of youth advocacy group Young Voices, is scheduled deliver the youth keynote.

On Wednesday, the Virginia High School League (VHSL) Executive Committee will meet for the first time since voting nearly two months ago to limit competition in girls’ sports to students assigned female at birth, following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. 
Previously, VHSL policy allowed transgender students to compete on teams aligning with their gender identity, though under specific conditions. The expected would formalize changes to the league’s handbook and policy manual.
“It is not too late for the Virginia High School League to find clarity and courage and to return to an inclusive policy that is sound, both ethically and legally,” said Auden Perino, senior counsel for LGBTQI+ equality at the National Women’s Law Center.
Perino said the February decision has caused “emotional harm” to students and their families. While the change impacts only a small number of students, they emphasized that does not make the issue any less important. 
The push for the policy change has largely been driven by concerns around fair competition.
In February, Gov. Glenn Youngkin called the committee’s decision “just common sense” after appearing alongside Trump when he signed the executive order threatening to cut federal funds for those that don’t comply.
“Biological boys should not be competing against girls,” Youngkin wrote on social media.

Victoria Cobb, president of the conservative group Family Foundation, said in a statement that it’s “high time” for the Virginia High School League to do right by girls and protect their safety. 
“Participation in sports develops girls into confident leaders,” Cobb said. “When girls step away from the arena because biological boys steal their titles and scholarships, everyone loses.”
However, Perino also pointed out that the “real threat” to high school sports is the chronic underfunding of women’s athletics and the widespread, often unreported harassment and assault cases affecting athletes — issues the NWLC has been tracking for over 50 years.
“These are the real threats to girls involved in school sports,” Perino said. “Obviously, trans youth are responsible for creating zero of these problems, and in fact, are harmed by all of them, just like cisgender youth.” 
Perino said if Virginians want to address and prevent sex discrimination in women’s school sports, they should focus on these “real and urgent threats where the gender justice movement has correctly maintained its focus, and we see from far right policymakers only a resounding silence on these topics and a truly creepy fixation on the bodies and lives of a few trans girls and women being scapegoated for political gain.”
Other advocates in Virginia are objecting to the changes and hope the committee will reconsider the action taken in February. Some view the vote as a harmful message — one that affects not just transgender athletes but Virginia’s broader reputation, undermining being “fair,” “inclusive,” and providing “opportunity for everyone.”
“Our hope is that maybe there is a world where they would reverse and go back to the original policy, but if anything, we want to send a strong message to them that they’ve made the wrong decision,” said Narissa Rahaman, executive director for Equality Virginia, a LGBTQ rights advocacy group. “This is impacting community members, and it’s going to impact more than just transgender student athletes, who want to play.” 
Rahaman said the committee’s February decision overturned a decade-long policy that was working, noting that the league had initially told the Richmond Times-Dispatch it did not plan to make any changes in January. 
Since the policy’s establishment, Rahaman said, Virginia has allowed 42 transgender athletes to play on sports teams matching their identity over the past 10 years.
During the last legislative session, bills proposing to require K-12 public schools and higher education institutions to label each sports team as either boys, girls, or coed — based on the biological sex of the players — failed in the General Assembly. 
Del. Delores Oates, R-Warren, and Sen. Tammy Mulchi, R-Mecklenburg, who carried the proposals, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
“Protecting fairness and safety in girls’ sports is a commonsense principle supported by the majority of Virginians,” Oates said in a statement to The Mercury. “I commend the Virginia High School League for taking action to ensure female athletes compete on a level playing field. 
This is about preserving the gains made under Title IX — making sure girls have the same opportunities, scholarships, and team experiences that generations fought hard to secure. We stand with parents, coaches, and students who want to preserve those opportunities, and we will continue working to uphold them.”

(Getty images)We knew this was coming. The moment the political tides shifted, the backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) ramped up. 
Executive orders are gutting funding, corporations are quietly scrubbing their DEI commitments from their websites, and entire programs are disappearing overnight. This isn’t just about politics. This is about power — who gets access to opportunity, who gets to build wealth, who gets to lead. This is about dismantling progress, piece by piece, while telling us it was never needed in the first place.
For the next four years, DEI will remain a target. The question is: What are we going to do about it? Because if we’re not intentional, if we’re not strategic, if we don’t move quickly, we risk letting the forces of regression undo everything we’ve fought for.
I’m not here to argue why DEI is important. We’ve had that conversation a thousand times. We’ve cited the research, we’ve made the business case, and frankly, if people still don’t get it, they never wanted to. There’s nothing left to debate. The data is there. The proof has been there. Companies with diverse leadership perform better. Equitable hiring practices create stronger teams. Inclusive workplaces retain top talent. Communities thrive when opportunity is shared. But here we are again, watching corporations retreat at the first sign of pressure, watching funding dry up, watching commitments disappear overnight.
What we need now isn’t another defense of DEI. We need a plan.
First, we have to stop waiting for permission. For too long, DEI work has relied on institutional approval — on budgets that could be cut, on leadership buy-in that could shift with the next election cycle, on policies that could be reversed with the stroke of a pen. And now we’re seeing exactly what happens when that permission is revoked. Organizations that claimed to be committed to equity are quietly stepping back, and those of us who have been doing the real work are being told to “scale down” or “adjust to the new climate.”
If companies won’t fund DEI, we find funders who will. If existing leadership pipelines shrink, we create new ones. If corporations walk away, we build stronger partnerships elsewhere. If we’ve learned anything from history, it’s that movements don’t die just because the people in power decide they should. This work doesn’t end just because someone in an office decides it’s no longer “a priority.” The need doesn’t go away because a company’s PR team stopped talking about it. The systemic issues we’re fighting aren’t paused just because an executive order says they don’t exist. So why should we pause?
Second, we need to stop centering the acronym and start centering the work. Right now, DEI is politically toxic. That’s by design. It has been turned into a villain, a scapegoat, a convenient way to stir up fear and resentment. But equity doesn’t disappear just because the language shifts. If calling it “diverse hiring” gets you defunded, call it “leadership development.” If supplier diversity initiatives become a target, call them “economic growth programs.” If grants supporting Black and Latino entrepreneurs are suddenly under scrutiny, reposition them as investments in business innovation. The name is not the goal — the outcome is.










The systemic issues we’re fighting aren’t paused just because an executive order says they don’t exist. So why should we pause?


This doesn’t mean we stop talking about equity. It means we get strategic about how we keep these initiatives alive. It means leaders stop hiding behind fear and start getting creative. It means instead of retreating, we double down. It means embedding equity so deeply into business operations that it can’t just be removed as a budget line item. If you truly care about equity, you don’t need a DEI department to do the work. You don’t need a dedicated initiative. You need action, built into the way your business, your nonprofit, your institution operates — day in and day out.
Third, the private sector can’t sit this one out. Government funding is drying up. Corporate DEI programs are being slashed. But businesses still hold an immense amount of power in shaping the economic future of marginalized communities. And if businesses step back now, if they allow this moment to pass without resistance, they will have chosen the side of regression. Because make no mistake — this is a choice.
If you’re a business leader, this is the moment to step up. Fund grassroots organizations that have lost federal support. Increase investments in minority-owned businesses. Look at your hiring pipelines and make sure you’re not just talking about inclusion but actively building it into your recruitment and retention. If you made commitments in 2020 and 2021, now is the time to make good on them. Because if your support for equity only existed when it was easy, when it was trending, when it made for good PR, then you were never actually committed in the first place.

Joe Feagin had to swear an oath he was not a communist to land his first university teaching job in 1966.
Feagin, 86, received his bachelor’s degree in Texas during McCarthyism and the viciously oppressive Jim Crow era.
The ’60s were turbulent, Feagin said. Vietnam War and Civil Rights protests were frequent. Demographics were shifting as more Latinos and Asians arrived under liberalized immigration laws.
“Everything was looking up at that point,” Feagin said. “Jim Crow laws were being crushed, Black folks were finally making it into the mainstream white universities where they had been rare or nonexistent.”
But Feagin, who spent nearly 60 years in higher education, believes progress is slipping.
President Donald Trump is publicly threatening to withhold federal funding for schools over anti-war protests and diversity initiatives that took root decades ago. A less-visible battle is being fought in over half of all states, including Virginia, to remove protections for professors, independent curriculum control and university-shared governance.
Educators warn changes are part of a conservative blueprint, and academic freedom is at stake. Conservative leaders say they will foster intellectual diversity, create more career pathways and bolster the marketplace.
 Faculty control wanes in Virginia, nationwide

Faculty have traditionally held power over university curriculums, but that eroded significantly over the years, according to leading Virginia political analyst Bob Holsworth.
Holsworth, also a former Virginia Commonwealth University professor and board of visitors member, said Gov. Glenn Youngkin is exercising a much heavier hand through his board appointees.
Boards create university budgets, hire and fire presidents, appoint faculty and rubber stamp curriculums created by faculty. But, their decisions have become increasingly intrusive and politicized, according to Holsworth.
While the deterioration of independent governance and hiring of tenured faculty has been ongoing for decades, it has been exacerbated by recent politics and the rise of Trump.
Students and faculty at VCU and George Mason University spent years drafting new learning requirements to teach topics such as systemic racism, gender studies and workplace inequity. Some of the content paralleled the wake from 2020 and its summer of protests against police brutality.
The new initiatives — called “racial literacy” at VCU and “Just Societies” at GMU — were set to be implemented in 2024. But Youngkin’s education secretary requested to view the syllabi, and soon after both universities canceled the requirements.
Christian Martinez, Youngkin’s former press secretary, called the course requirements a “thinly veiled attempt to incorporate the progressive left’s groupthink on Virginia’s students.”
“That’s a step beyond what we’ve ever seen,” Holsworth said.
 Launching the blueprint

The blueprint for the board interference was first tested in Florida, according to Amy Reid. She taught at the New College of Florida, one of the Sunshine State’s few public liberal arts schools, until Gov. Ron DeSantis made moves in 2023 to remove the gender studies program she directed.
DeSantis appointed six new members to the college’s board of trustees in 2023, the majority of whom lived outside Florida and were conservative activists, according to Reid.
DeSantis’ appointees voted to end the school’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Office, according to Reid. They also removed university officials and faculty who didn’t fit their vision of the school, including the president, provost, some LGBTQ+ employees and a Chinese adjunct professor seeking asylum from his home country.
Reid now works at PEN America, a free speech organization that pushes back against what it calls educational gag orders.
Officials increasingly use indirect tactics to achieve censorial goals, Reid said. Coordinated attacks have shifted from K-12 to higher education in recent years.
 Spike in bills targeting higher-ed

Over 90 bills to reform higher education at public universities, and some private ones, have been introduced across 26 states in the past three years, according to PEN America data. At least 16 have become law as of March 6.
The highest number of bills were introduced after Trump’s reelection.
Almost half of the legislation focused on eliminating or preventing DEI initiatives that promoted concepts related to race, color, religion, sex, ethnicity or national origin — from curriculum to faculty training. But other legislation challenges traditional higher-ed structure by putting university governance, the decision-making power given to student and faculty bodies, on the chopping block.
Several bills seek to eliminate or weaken tenure status for faculty, which was created to safeguard academic freedom from politics. Others strip universities of independent accreditation standards, which certify the quality of education at colleges.
Some bills break tradition by giving states authority to establish programs and curriculum where American values and ideas, or Western civilization, are predominantly taught.
Even if legislation fails, governors can censor higher education through their appointed board members, Reid said.
Although there is a government push for free speech, students need an education free from their censorship, Reid said. This is precisely why academic freedom, shared governance and institutional autonomy are needed.
 Project 2025, Heritage Foundation take aim at Virginia

Conservative groups such as the Claremont Institute, Manhattan Institute and the Heritage Foundation are coordinating efforts between states, Reid said. Members push initiatives and propose candidates for university boards. The Heritage Foundation created the almost 1,000 page Project 2025 blueprint to reshape the American government.
Trump denied his involvement with Project 2025 while campaigning, but immediately began enacting parts of the plan once in office, including efforts to dismantle the Department of Education.
The Heritage Foundation’s influence has increasingly grown in Virginia. Youngkin, who has deep ties to the foundation, has appointed Project 2025 authors to the boards of visitors at GMU and the University of Virginia.
Virginia universities have complied with Trump and Youngkin’s efforts to cancel racial learning requirements, dissolve DEI programs and instate new campus speech policies that limit protesting. Medical centers at UVA and VCU also stopped providing gender affirming care for people under age 19, per an executive order from Trump.
Trump has threatened to cut federal funding for research and student financial aid for schools that do not comply. Virginia ranks 13th in research and development performance, according to the Virginia Mercury. UVA received $549 million in research awards in 2024, according to their report. VCU received $200.1 million, according to spokesman Brian McNeill.
 Universities are bloated, Heritage Foundation says

The Heritage Foundation aims to wind down federal involvement in higher education, which it says has a monopoly on accreditation standards and student loans, according to its policy analyst Madison Marino Doan. The foundation wants more privatization on those fronts.
Additionally, it believes university administrations are bloated bureaucracies that must be held accountable for increasing tuition and pushing DEI, Marino Doan said. Reform efforts are a result of Americans’ dissatisfaction with costs and the diminishing value of career paths in the humanities.
“Institutions have increasingly prioritized what we would say is ideological activism and oftentimes bureaucratic bloat over academic excellence and student outcomes,” Marino Doan said.
The plan is to remove federal funds and accreditation standards and transfer power to individual states. Those moves would make way for more specific standards per industry, and emphasize alternative postsecondary education options such as trade schools and apprenticeships.
“I will fire the radical left accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs and lunatics,” Trump said while campaigning.
Trump directed the secretary of education to deny accreditation to agencies that use DEI-based standards, in an executive order released April 22. Universities must be accredited by nationally-recognized agencies to be eligible for federal aid.
Higher-ed groups warn the accreditation order could give Trump more power and threaten academic freedom, according to the publication Inside Higher Ed.
 America moving ‘rapidly backwards’

Feagin, who recently retired from Texas A&M University, believes America has been “zigzagging” toward progress since the ‘40s, up until President Barack Obama was elected. Conservative demographics lashed back at Obama’s victory by forming populist factions like the Tea Party, utilizing political redistricting and eventually electing Trump.
Feagin said that with attacks on higher education and the destruction of federal programs with “no apparent purpose,” America is back to where it was in the early ‘60s and moving “rapidly backwards.”
Gutting research is economic suicide in the face of China’s faster development, Feagin said. Cutting diversity will only make universities unpleasant. Efforts to stop the diversification of America will only be temporary victories.
“You can slow it down. You can make it miserable,” Feagin said. “That’s what Trump is doing.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)I received an email about an event happening on May 17, 2025, at Virginia Commonwealth University, marking the 71st anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, which dismantled segregation in schools nationwide, hosted by the Virginians for Reconciliation Project.
What struck me immediately — and not in a good way — was that the panel consisted entirely of white men. It stopped me cold. Everyone on the email thread I was on was outraged too.
  A flyer promoting a May 17 panel event commemorating the 71st anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case that struck down segregation in schools.
That is, until I realized that the panelists were all former governors of Virginia. And in case you didn’t know, Virginia has only ever elected one Black governor, L. Douglas Wilder, in 1989. Every other governor since the 1600s has been a white man.
My initial reaction was to criticize the lack of diversity on the panel, which seemed ironic since they were supposed to be discussing one of the most pivotal moments in American history that diversified classrooms in Virginia and beyond. Why not include former Gov. Wilder, now in his 90s? Or the current Black Speaker of the House? Or the Senate Majority Leader, a Black woman? Or the sitting Lt. Governor, a Black Republican woman? The only Black woman involved is the moderator — a sitting state delegate from Richmond — but she’s not on the panel itself.
Let’s be honest: A panel of all white men cannot reflect the full breadth of Virginia’s past — or its future. But these men did hold the highest office in the commonwealth. They shaped Virginia’s policies, laws, and institutions, for better or worse. And if we are serious about reconciliation, we must be willing to hear from those who held power, even when that power excluded us.
This is not about agreement — it’s about accountability. We can’t change the systems we don’t understand. These governors can offer insights into what shaped Virginia, where it failed and where we must go.
Reconciliation is not passive. It is active, inclusive and uncomfortable. It requires listening — even when what we hear doesn’t reflect our values or experience.
We are in a moment of necessary tension in Virginia and across America, vacillating between reverence and reckoning,  history and hope.
This upcoming panel brings together seven former governors from both parties. Yes, they are all white. Yes, they are all men. The concerns raised about the lack of racial and gender diversity they represent are valid. In a nation still reckoning with the legacies of segregation and systemic exclusion, representation is not just symbolic; it’s substantive. Diversity brings perspective. It brings the lived experience of those long shut out of decision-making rooms.
So why bring these seven men together now?
Because this is not a celebration of the past — it’s a confrontation with it. Some of these governors resisted change. Some enabled it. All of them governed during periods of transformation or stagnation. If they are honest, their reflections can illuminate the forces that shaped us, and the courage or silence that defined their terms.
This is not the end of the conversation. It’s the beginning.
I hope this panel helps Virginians become bridge builders and legacy leaders. Seventy-one years after Brown, we don’t need self-congratulation, we need truth-telling. We need space to ask: What did we get wrong? What must we do differently? Who do we still leave behind?
In November, Virginia will elect a woman as governor — no matter who wins. That’s never happened before. That’s not symbolic. That’s transformational. That’s the arc of history bending,  finally, toward equity.
Her time has come: Virginia will, after four centuries, have a woman governor

The panel is only one piece of a broader program. And to VCU’s credit, the commitment to reconciliation is real. But reconciliation must be rooted in honesty. It must reflect the fullness of who we are and who we aspire to be.
So, if I may offer some unsolicited advice to enhance this program:

Add current Black leaders to the event. That could include the Black female Lt. Governor, the Black Speaker of the House, or former Black statewide officials.
Don’t frame their inclusion as an afterthought. Make it clear they are essential to the vision of this event.
Emphasize that their leadership represents the future of Virginia. Not just diversity for diversity’s sake, but the new center of power, voice, and vision.

To honor Brown, we must amplify those carrying the torch forward, not just those who held it in the past. We must widen the circle, deepen the dialogue, and ensure that reconciliation includes truth, representation and responsibility.
Reconciliation, after all, is not a moment — it is a movement. It calls us to listen across difference, to learn from power and to lift the voices long silenced. We are building a new bridge for Virginia, one strong enough to carry us all.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio wanted to slip a sweeping measure into a spending bill that would gut the Federal Trade Commission. Critics say it’s no coincidence that the FTC is suing mammoth health care conglomerates and tech giants like Amazon.
Jordan is chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee. Last week, it released a version of a bill that included tax cuts, federal spending cuts and more spending at the border.
It also contained provisions that would give Trump sweeping new powers to gut government regulations. It would also transfer funds and personnel currently controlled by the FTC to the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department — without the FTC’s unique enforcement authority going with them. 
The measure was abruptly nixed, but it would have effectively killed antitrust powers Congress created more than a century ago.
The FTC history
Amid abuses to consumers by big corporations, the Federal Trade Commission Act was passed in 1914. Antitrust enforcement by the Department of Justice dates back further, to 1903.
But the Justice Department is overseen by the attorney general, a presidential appointee. Attorneys general traditionally have had a high degree of independence, but Trump is said to be politicizing the Justice Department at a breakneck pace.
The FTC was created in part to be more independent. It’s governed by commissioners from both parties who are appointed to fixed terms that can be renewed.
Earlier this year, Trump tried to fire the two Democratic commissioners, but they say the move was illegal, and they’re fighting it in court. Antitrust advocates said Trump was doing that as a favor to his billionaire supporters such as Elon Musk.
The two Democratic commissioners, Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter, acted to block the Kroger-Albertson’s mega-merger, and they voted to sue Amazon, saying it is “illegally maintaining monopoly power.” 
Under Jordan’s leadership, the Judiciary Committee in 2023 attacked the FTC on behalf of Musk. He’s the world’s richest man, whom Trump is allowing to make deep cuts to federal programs for the elderly, veterans, the poor, and agencies that promote science and health.
“THE WEAPONIZATION OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: AN AGENCY’S OVERREACH TO HARASS ELON MUSK’S TWITTER,” read the all-caps title of the Jordan-led committee’s report. 
A year earlier, the FTC had charged Twitter with using deceptively gathered data from users to target ads at them. If true, it would be added to the fact that an unofficial, Musk-run entity is now collecting much more sensitive government data. It’s raised concerns among several federal judges who said such collections invite abuse and likely violate the law.
“One of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency lieutenants working in the Social Security Administration has been pushing dubious claims about noncitizens voting, apparently using access to data that court records suggest (the so-called Department of Government Efficiency) isn’t supposed to have,” NPR reported earlier this month.
The proposal from Jordan to gut the FTC could have halted major initiatives to regulate giant health conglomerates that own powerful pharmacy middlemen, said Bedoya, one of the commissioners Trump is trying to fire.
Jordan’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment on this story.
PBMs
Each of the three conglomerates — UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna-Express Scripts — is among the 15 largest corporations in the United States. Each owns a top-ten health insurer and each owns a pharmacy middleman known as a pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM. 
Combined, the PBMs control nearly 80% of the insured drug transactions in the United States. They decide which drugs are covered and use that power to extract rebates from drugmakers. They also determine varying reimbursements to pharmacies — including ones owned by their parent companies as well as the pharmacies with which they compete. Critics — including four-fifths of state attorneys general — say they have a conflict of interest under the arrangement, and that they abuse it.
Last October, the FTC sued the conglomerates, saying they used their dominance in multiple parts of the marketplace to illegally jack up the price of insulin — a drug millions of diabetics need to survive.
The lawsuit comes after the agency in 2022 undertook a major investigation of the health conglomerates. In January, it released an interim report accusing the PBMs of using their dominance to instigate wild price hikes and possibly steer business to affiliated pharmacies.
Politico recently reported that Jordan said his move to consolidate the FTC into the Justice Department was meant to “address the cost of over-regulation.”
“Part of our jurisdiction in Judiciary deals with regulatory concerns and so we are looking at … spending and costs associated with certain regulations. That’s why that language is written the way it was,” Politico reported him as saying.
Many businesses facing regulation — and their advocates in government — have long focused only on the costs. But government regulation can also protect health, safety, the environment, economic stability and competition. Some researchers have said regulation can always be smarter, but its benefits far outweigh the costs.
In a social media post last week, Bedoya, the FTC commissioner, said Jordan’s proposed changes to the agency served another agenda. 
“This will gut the FTC,” Bedoya wrote. “FTC is trying to finish a study that already showed how pharmacy middlemen mark up cancer drugs by up to 4,000%. It’s also suing them for allegedly competing to raise insulin prices. If this passes I have no idea what’ll happen to that study and lawsuit.”
Bedoya added, “Take the lawsuit. The draft bill purports to transfer FTC lawyers and lawsuits to DOJ — but it doesn’t transfer the laws that FTC enforces, or authority to enforce those laws. Look (at) page 98 — employees, assets, funding — but no authorities.”
Bedoya also said that when it created the FTC, Congress meant to augment the government’s antitrust powers. Jordan’s changes would remove the government’s ability to police “unfair methods of competition,” Bedoya said, implying that Jordan was trying to slash the government’s power to police wealthy corporations in an era when the political influence of the mega-rich is exploding and the wealth gap is yawning. 
“The purpose behind the FTC’s creation in 1914 was to supplement the existing enforcement mechanism (and enforcement gap created by) the Department of Justice,” Bedoya said on X. “When FTC was created in 1914, it alone was authorized to stop something called ‘unfair methods of competition.’ DOJ did not get this” under Jordan’s proposal.

(Screenshot from DES report)Legislation spurred by failures to properly manage “trash juice” at several of the state’s landfills hangs in uncertainty after a Senate committee vote last week.
The state already requires landfill applicants to create plans for managing leachate, the liquid pollution created when precipitation mixes with waste. House Bill 566, which is backed by bipartisan sponsors and moved easily through the House, would require more details from new landfills and those seeking to expand about the treatment of that liquid pollution and transportation for facilities that treat it off site. 
But the legislation hit a hurdle April 29 in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where members voted, 3-2, to recommend the bill be rereferred to committee, leaving its fate for the session unclear. Backers of the bill expressed surprise at the vote — and wished that concerns about it had been aired more publicly. They pointed to leachate management issues around the state, including some in April around the time the bill was first heard in the Senate.
Before the vote, Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican, said he was “just not quite convinced yet that this is right.” He said he wanted “the opportunity just to look at this and see if we can resolve” what he saw as issues in the bill “before we moved it forward.” He did not specify what those issues were.
“I’m not necessarily opposed to the concept of it,” Pearl said. “Just the workability of it — I’ve had some conversations since our hearing that seem to be very problematic, and I would not want to put something in place that … was going to create problems, unintended consequences.”
Pearl did not respond to a request for comment from the Bulletin asking who those conversations were with and what parts of the bill he found problematic.
Rep. Nicholas Germana, the Keene Democrat leading the bill, said he had gone to “great lengths to reach out to the industry and to (the Department of Environmental Services) to make sure that this was workable.”
“It was surprising,” Germana said of the vote, “and I wish there was more of an opportunity to try to address those concerns, but it’s hard to address them when they’re not raised in a public setting.”
Germana said he hopes he can clear up concerns with senators on the committee to “see if there’s any chance that we might be able to change the outcome in the Senate.” If not, “this fall, when they take up retained bills again, hopefully there’s an opportunity for a discussion about … what the issues are.”
Sen. David Watters, a Dover Democrat, said before the vote that besides a technical change Germana had planned to suggest, “I’m not clear … what the issues are.” 
“This is one where we know … there’s been spills, there’s been problems, there’s been overflows,” Watters said. “And so while I think it’s always good to keep working on things, I think at this point I’d like to vote against rerefer, because I think it might be possible for us to get a bill done.” 
The other Democrat on the committee, Sen. Cindy Rosenwald of Nashua, joined him in opposing the motion. She said leachate management problems seemed to be getting worse because of “more intense rainfall.”
Adam Finkel, a Dalton resident and former federal regulator who has advocated in the Legislature for more protective landfill standards, said he’s starting to see “that fewer and fewer opponents of legislation, at least in the environmental area, are bothering to come to hearings and give their opinions on the record, because they don’t have to.”
“It’s a win-win for them,” he said, “if they can not have to make their arguments in public, where they’re weak and can be refuted, and they get to make them in private, in a setting where they’re more important than anything the public says.”
Harmful chemicals from trash seep into leachate, meaning its mismanagement can pose serious environmental and public health risks. This risk was brought into the spotlight by the recent management problems, including hundreds of leachate-related violations at Casella Waste Systems’ landfill in the northern town of Bethlehem. (The company is now locked in a legal battle with the state over its bid to build another landfill in the nearby town of Dalton.)
Germana said “the day after I introduced that bill to the Senate, they had a problem at Bethlehem” with leachate.
In April, Casella was doing maintenance on its leachate collection system at the Bethlehem landfill, said Jeff Weld, the company’s vice president of communications. 
Michael Wimsatt, DES’ waste management division director, said the department had been notified of this maintenance, which was likely to increase the level of leachate on the liner, since the pump could not be operated during the process. 
On the morning of April 23, operators at Casella’s Bethlehem landfill noticed a leachate pump in one of the pump stations was not working, according to a memo from DES waste management specialist Austin Mills. Weld said the company “immediately investigated and began monitoring the (affected) pump house and manually pumping, pending repair the following day.”
The morning of April 24, an electrician made repairs, “restoring normal operation to the pumping system by 10:30AM,” per the memo. 
A company official, Lindsey Menard, told Mills that the transducer level “read 100+ inches when the operation was restored,” according to the memo. At the time of the phone call with the department that afternoon, Menard said the level was at 14 inches.
Leachate levels are not supposed to exceed 12 inches on the liner of a landfill. But Wimsatt said the 100-plus-inch reading on the transducer wasn’t equivalent to the level of leachate on the liner. If the transducer reading was accurate, the amount on the liner was probably “3 feet less than the 100 inches,” he said. The department was still reviewing the incident, and it was not yet clear what the highest leachate level on the liner had been, he said.
In the department memo, Mills said he reminded the Casella representative that the state “requires the permittee to notify the department as soon as practicable and that we were over 24 hours since they were first aware of an issue.” Menard said “she would remind the operations staff” at the landfill, the memo said.
There had also been exceedances days before this incident, resulting in leachate levels reaching just over 63 inches and 46 inches on the liner system in two pump stations, according to an incident report. Weld said the exceedances were “reported in a timely fashion verbally and in writing,” and said pumps had to be shut off while cleaning was being done.
HB 566 would not affect the Bethlehem landfill, but its handling of leachate has been cited frequently as proponents of the bill have made their case for it. Asked for the company’s stance on the bill, Weld said there was already “significant oversight” for leachate management in the state, and that the “ability to predict the future of leachate technology, availability of disposal sites, transportation options, etc. at the time of permit application for the lifespan of a landfill is not realistic.”
The bill would put the existing requirement for leachate management plans into statute, in addition to setting more detailed standards. It would include language that requires DES, before issuing a permit, to make a positive determination that the permit application includes a detailed leachate management plan. 
The state currently requires landfills to: have at least two locations for leachate disposal; estimate how much leachate they will generate; and describe how leachate will be handled at the landfill before being shipped somewhere else for disposal, according to DES. They must also have procedures in place to bring down leachate levels to a foot or lower within a week of a 100-year storm event. Regulations also include details about on-site leachate management systems.
Eliot Wessler, a Whitefield resident involved in solid waste advocacy, said this bill does “a lot more, in my opinion, than what’s in the existing DES rules.”
“It makes very, very clear that a solid waste permit applicant has to provide detailed information about their leachate plans,” Wessler said in an interview, “and not only in the short run, but in the long run, including what happens, you know, at the point of closure and even in the post-closure period.”
He had been surprised by the vote, he said, telling senators in testimony before the bill hearing that he “fully expected” them to recommend it for passage. 
“How can you be opposed to trying to require … new landfills and expansions of landfills to be more concerned about how they manage leachate,” Wessler said, “and to give DES more opportunities to correct any problems with their leachate management plan before the permits are issued?”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-18-at-11.38.33-AM-1024x767.png,,,2025-05-05 06:01:28.634090

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.












There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company




23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Erika Bolstad/Stateline) BOISE, Idaho — The day the flag bill came up for a vote in the Idaho Senate this spring, state Sen. Melissa Wintrow had no plans to speak against it. As the top Democratic leader in her chamber, she had already spent the legislative session in constant, vocal opposition to the Republican-dominated legislative agenda.
“I thought: ‘Oh, this stupid flag bill once again,’” Wintrow said. “I’ll just vote ‘no’ quietly because I’ve just really been in people’s grille about things.”
But then the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Ben Toews, began passing out flyers about the legislation, one of two proposed bills to limit which flags can be flown at schools and on state and local government property. The only photos on the handout were of rainbow-striped Pride flags flying in Boise: one on a flagpole in front of City Hall, and then others on light poles along Harrison Boulevard, two blocks from Wintrow’s home.
“When he sat that picture in front of me on that desk, I thought: ‘That’s enough. Just always picking and bullying,’” Wintrow said. “The state’s going to tell us what to do, when they can’t even address the larger problems like affordable housing? That’s what’s on people’s minds. A good working wage, health care. It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.”
In recent weeks, both Idaho and Utah have enacted bans that prohibit Pride flags from being displayed on government property, pitting lawmakers in the Republican-dominated legislatures against the more progressive capitals of Boise and Salt Lake City, where the flags are often flown at city hall.











It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.


– Idaho Democratic state Sen. Melissa Wintrow



In Utah, the law allows the state flag, the U.S. flag, U.S. military flags, the POW/MIA flag, local government flags, tribal nation flags, university and school flags and Olympic flags. Idaho’s list is similar, but includes a provision in the school flag law that prohibits flags with political viewpoints, “including but not limited to flags or banners regarding a political party, race, sexual orientation, gender, or a political ideology.”
Lawmakers in Florida, Texas and at least 13 other states are considering similar flag prohibitions, said Logan Casey, director of policy research with the Movement Advancement Project, which studies LGBTQ+ rights. The flag bills go beyond symbolism, Casey said. Rather, they are part of a broad and coordinated legislative attack on LGBTQ+ people that seeks to strip them of rights and erase or make difficult their participation in public life.
“Sometimes those attacks are very material, like denying access to health care or the ability to participate safely in public life and activities,” Casey said. “Sometimes they’re a little more symbolic, like these flag bills.”
‘Get rid of everything’
The rainbow-colored Pride flag was conjured up by artist and drag queen Gilbert Baker in 1978, at the suggestion of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, as a symbol of progress and pride for that year’s San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade. Since then, the rainbow-colored flag and its many design iterations have grown into worldwide emblems of solidarity with LGBTQ+ rights.
Although the laws in Idaho and Utah don’t ban Pride flags specifically, bill sponsors and their supporters made it clear they want to see such flags removed from city halls, schools and state buildings. Idaho state Rep. Ted Hill, a Republican who sponsored the bill limiting which flags can fly at schools, said in an interview that Pride flags are disruptive to classroom learning because discussion about them takes up “an amazing amount of political bandwidth.”
“The best way to do it is to get rid of everything,” said Hill, who represents Eagle, a suburb northwest of Boise. “So the only thing you have in the classroom is the American flag, the state flag. And people will say inclusivity and all this. Well, the American flag is as inclusive as it can get.”
Despite the new law, Boise Mayor Lauren McLean, a Democrat, continues to fly a Pride flag in front of City Hall, just below the city’s own and adjacent to poles flying the U.S. and state of Idaho flags. The Pride flag’s presence, within view of the state Capitol, elicited a sternly worded letter from Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

Idaho’s law, which went into effect April 3, has no penalty for local governments or officials who fly flags in defiance of the ban, an oversight lawmakers told Labrador they’ll rectify in subsequent legislative sessions. Instead, the law relies on “the good will of elected officials for its enforcement,” Labrador wrote, warning McLean that she should “comply with the law out of a sense of duty to your oath of office.”
He threatened, too, that lawmakers could “deny state tax revenues and other appropriations to the City of Boise or any other governmental entity that does not follow state law.”
McLean countered that the new law is unconstitutional, and that the city will challenge threats to withhold funding. Pride flags have flown in Boise for a decade, she told Labrador, and represent a commitment to “a safe and welcoming city where everyone means just that — everyone.”
“The Constitutional rights of our residents are not subject to — cannot be subject to — the political whims of legislative disapproval,” McLean wrote, “and we will not step back from them simply because the principles our community cherishes make some in state government uncomfortable.”
Boise’s city council is considering a resolution confirming that any flags it flies, including Pride flags, are official city flags — a move the council says will ensure it is complying with state law. In the meantime, the city will “continue to fly the flags on City Hall Plaza that represent our community and speak to our values of caring for people and welcoming all,” McLean said in a statement.
Early on Easter morning, several people climbed a ladder propped up next to the city’s flagpole to cover the Pride flag and a separate flag (honoring organ and tissue donation) with trash bags. They also raised the Appeal to Heaven flag, a Revolutionary War-era flag that has come to represent sympathy to the Christian nationalist movement and to President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. A few hours later, the mayor lowered the flags, which are on a locked halyard, to remove the trash bags and the Appeal to Heaven flag.
It capped a challenging sequence of events in Boise and nearby Meridian, which drew national attention this spring when school officials ordered a middle school teacher to take down a sign with the phrase “Everyone is welcome here” from her classroom. Amid the backlash, people in Boise printed T-shirts and yard signs in support of the teacher and the sign’s message.

Similar signs emerged in Boise and surrounding communities this spring after school officials told a middle school teacher to take down a sign in her classroom containing the phrase. (Erika Bolstad/Stateline)
The mayor’s response to the flag law and the support for the classroom message aren’t directly connected, but both reflect how many in the community insist on sending a welcoming message at this moment in American history, said Christina Bruce-Bennion, executive director of Boise’s Wassmuth Center for Human Rights, which helped coordinate support for the teacher.
‘It is very targeted’
In Salt Lake City, the flag ban threatens to end a long-standing annual tradition. Typically, the mayor’s office kicks off Pride Month festivities in June with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall, said Chad Call, executive director of the Utah Pride Center, which puts on the state’s annual Pride festivities. Events include a parade through the streets of Salt Lake City with a 200-foot Pride flag — which remains a legal form of First Amendment expression and has taken place most years since 1997.
“We have a city council that wants to celebrate Pride month,” Call said. “They want to celebrate the queer community in the month of June. And then we have a state government that does not want that happening in our capital city. And so it is very targeted.”
‘It was the life raft’: Transgender people find a safe haven in Florida’s capital city

One of the flag bill’s sponsors, state Rep. Trevor Lee, said in an interview that his legislation was prompted by constituents who told him they’re “sick and tired of seeing a political agenda being pushed in their face” on government property, particularly with flags featuring transgender representation.
“It makes people feel uncomfortable if it’s something they don’t agree with,” said Lee, who represents a district north of Salt Lake City. “And so we’re trying to keep it very specific and let schools focus on teaching the things that they need to, and let government buildings just fly their city flag for heaven’s sakes, or the state flag or the American flag.”
One Utah parent, Republican activist Aaron Bullen, said he began objecting to Pride flags several years ago after one of his children, then a fifth grader, was “visibly upset” after school one day. Bullen said his son told him he’d seen what’s known as a Progress Pride flag, a newer iteration of the original rainbow-striped flag. It includes an arrow on the left side composed of pink, blue and white stripes to represent transgender people, as well as brown and black stripes to represent queer people of color. The flag was in the school’s computer lab.
Bullen said he complained to school leaders at the district, south of Salt Lake City, and the flag came down. But Bullen felt as though the flag’s presence undermined what he and his wife teach at home and model to their children as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, particularly how they interpret the church’s stance on transgender people and marriage for same-sex couples.
“It says, basically, ‘we approve of gay marriage’ when that flag is up,” Bullen said. “And that’s something that my religion is explicitly against. And so you have a teacher of my son, a person in authority that they’d like to be able to trust and to follow the instructions of, but they’re saying, ‘your parents who taught you this other thing, they’re wrong. Your religion is wrong.’ That’s what that flag means.”











It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would.


– Aaron Bullen, a Utah parent and Republican activist



He added: “It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would. Parents have the fundamental right and responsibility to rear their children. And it’s not a school’s place to oppose the religion of the parents or the teachings of the parents.”
Unlike in Idaho, Utah’s flag ban carries a $500 fine per day for failure to comply with the law. But in Utah, the law took effect without Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’s signature. The governor declined to sign the bill into law, saying the state’s residents are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix.”
Call, of the Utah Pride Center, said that while it’s discouraging for LGBTQ+ people to witness their representation further erased in public spaces, they refuse in Utah to allow the flag law to diminish the spirit of their Pride events, among the largest in the nation.
“Our counterculture here is really, really strong,” Call said. “And I think the thing that probably defines our Utah Pride as being kind of unique is the incredibly strong community that it brings together. There’s tens, hundreds of thousands of people that come out to support it.”

Like many seemingly inexplicable practices that just sort of happened over time, designers of our state government could probably never have imagined something like “crossover week” at the North Carolina legislature.
“Crossover” is an artificial semi-annual deadline by which bills must be approved by at least one body – the Senate or the House – in order to remain eligible for passage that year. This year’s deadline is this Thursday May 8.
While the reasoning behind crossover deadline –to  cull hundreds of bills and spur lawmakers to action – probably makes some sense, the practical result is that scores of bills will be approved this week in an absurdly rushed fashion.
Indeed, large numbers of dramatic state law changes will be brought closer to enactment with, quite literally, just a few minutes of discussion and scarce – if any – public input.
The bottom line: The crossover deadline has become obsolete. In a large, diverse and fast growing state of 10 million people, lawmakers ought to be serious and disciplined enough to get their work done without having to cram like college students.

Last week, a committee approved a measure prohibiting ranked choice voting and heard from proponents of a plan to require proof of citizenship for voting.
Both bills are retreads of proposals that didn’t make the cut last session.
Ranked Choice
The measure banning ranked choice voting, Senate Bill 63, has the backing of well-known conservative lobbying outfits like the Heritage Foundation and a few lesser-known ones, too.
Honest Elections Project Action is one of a several a 501(c) organization connected with former Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo. The Opportunity Solutions Project is a Florida thinktank that lobbies state and federal governments on issues like restricting food assistance and loosening child labor laws. When state lawmakers proposed raising the threshold for approving constitutional amendments, OSP was the only group to show up.
Opportunity Solutions Projects’ parent organization got more than $2 million from Leonard Leo’s Concord Fund.
But for all that conservative backing, the measure itself is bipartisan. State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, is co-sponsoring the bill, calling ranked choice a “disaster waiting to happen.”
Supporters believe ranked choice will give voters more options, but that’s precisely the problem for DeMora. He warned about races in Oregon with 50-plus candidates for city council and described a hypothetical four-person race where the top two finishers got 45% and 30% of the vote.
“I’d expect each of us to agree that the first candidate with 45% of the vote won — that’s a clear victory,” DeMora argued. “No one here today would be upset if they won their next election by 15%, but using ranked choice voting, that candidate could very easily lose.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXDenise Riley from the organization Rank the Vote Ohio, pushed back on DeMora’s horror stories. Making an allusion to Baskin Robbins, she argued DeMora and other supporters want to reduce voting to a binary choice — chocolate or vanilla.
“I’m here to tell you that the public really wants and likes more choices and having more say in their government,” she wrote. “You should give them that say. It is your job to represent the people you serve.”
The measure also got pushback from the conservative perspective as well. Marcell Strbich is a retired Air Force veteran and grassroots “election integrity” activist. He regularly testifies in favor more restrictive elections policies, and submitted testimony in opposition of the bill in March along with 60-plus others.
He noted — as several others have — that lawmakers actually can’t ban ranked choice voting. The state supreme court determined more than 70 years ago that local elections are a local matter. The sponsors attempt to sidestep that ruling by withholding state funding if a municipality approves a ranked choice voting system.
“If Ohio’s Republicans and Democrats want to ban RCV, amend the Ohio Constitution,” Strbich argued. “That’s the transparent, democratic way to respect our legal framework. Instead, S.B. 63 takes a shortcut, using state funds to coerce counties and granting the Secretary of State vague, unchecked power. This isn’t reform — it’s a power grab.”
Last week, though, the Senate committee approved the bill as-is. It’s awaiting a floor vote.
Proof of citizenship
The Senate measure, S.B. 153, would require every voter to show proof of citizenship to register to vote. Under current law only citizens may vote, and officials regularly comb through the rolls looking for individuals improperly registered. The only deterrent against registering and voting illegally is the threat of prosecution. That’s worked remarkably well.
Nearly every registration flagged by the secretary of state has turned out to be a false positive. A rigorous review by the attorney general found just six cases of illegal voting. In an electorate of 8.1 million voters that’s .00007%, or less than one ten thousandth of 1%.
The bill, sponsored by state Sens. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, and Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, tosses in a few other conservative wish list items alongside the citizenship provisions. They place new strictures on the petition process, including requiring paid canvassers wear a badge identifying themselves as such, and they eliminate the use of ballot drop boxes.
The only group to show up in support of the idea was the Foundation for Government Accountability Action — the new name for Opportunity Solutions Project. The organization submitted testimony under both names for the ranked choice measure. Rather than sending their own staffers, the organization hired local lobbyists like Harrison Siders.
Siders praised the measure for closing a “loophole” when it comes to potentially illegal registrations — already a felony offense — and the requirement of monthly voter roll audits — a likely violation of federal law prohibiting any systematic removal of a voter within 90 days of a federal election.
He argued the bill “respects the rights of lawful voters while putting in place practical, achievable safeguards that will fortify our election system against fraud.”
Notably, University of Maryland researchers have found more than 21.3 million Americans — more than 9% of voting age citizens — don’t have ready access to the documents required under the bill.
DeMora pressed Siders on the ballot drop boxes and he brought up highly publicized fire-bombings in the Portland, OR area, but acknowledged no ballots in Ohio have been compromised.
“If someone wants to fire-bomb a ballot drop off box, they can fire-bomb a post box,” DeMora continued. “How is this going to protect the integrity of ballots, of absentee ballots and stuff, when if someone wants to bomb something, they’re going to bomb something?”
Siders said a ballot drop box likely has more ballots he argued than a home or public post box and lawmakers should focus on “critical points” in the voting system.

Early voting is already underway. Depending on where you live, you may have city council seats, judges or a school levy. But every ballot across the state will have Issue 2.
It is a constitutional amendment meant to support local infrastructure projects, which many voters have said they want to see started expeditiously, since Ohio roads are no joke.
“You got to keep swerving around all these potholes, the second you take your eye off the road, you’re setting yourself up for danger,” Akron resident Eric Makowski said.
Issue 2, on the ballot on May 6, is meant to fix the problem and make the roads safer.
Every 10 years, voters choose whether or not to renew the state’s ability to issue billions in bonds for the State Capital Improvement Program (SCIP) and the Local Transportation Improvement Program (LTIP).
“We have lots of discussions about what we should spend money on, obviously, but almost all Ohioans agree on roads and bridges and infrastructure,” Huffman added.
This year, Issue 2 is the bond package paying for local infrastructure, roads, bridges and other things.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe amount would be $2.5 billion. This resolution will increase the annual amount for the program from $200 million to $250 million per year. This will be paid for through state general obligation debt.
These grants cover roads, bridges, water supply, wastewater treatment, stormwater collection and solid waste disposal. These bonds must be used for these projects.
Read the full ballot amendment here.
State Sen. Kent Smith (D-Euclid) explained that this money can only be used for general government infrastructure. The money would not be able to be used for other types of projects, like for entertainment.
“The Browns issue has percolated at the same time this issue has come up,” Smith said. “The two issues are not related whatsoever, but there is some confusion because of that.”
To be very clear — this bond issue is unrelated to the Cleveland Browns’ request for $600 million in bonds. This money would not be able to go to them.
Issue 2 has wide bipartisan support, from the Ohio Chamber of Commerce to each trade union. There seems to be no official, active campaign against it, but a couple of lawmakers are against it.
In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, state Rep. Jennifer Gross (R-West Chester) argued that Issue 2 isn’t helpful when Ohioans are already struggling with inflation.
“I encourage you to consider voting no on Issue 2… Did the state deliver income tax reform? Have we delivered property tax reform? Do we need more of your money? Vote accordingly,” she wrote.
Tim, a Cuyahoga County voter, saw and was convinced by Gross’s tweets, saying he didn’t think the state or cities deserved more.
“My taxes just go up every year and I think, ‘You know what, we can allocate some of that money towards the infrastructure we need,'” he said.
Huffman said that Ohioans should have safe roads – ones where you don’t need to swerve to avoid craters.
“Even if you’re not driving a car, you benefit from safety services who use the roads; you benefit from things that are delivered to your house,” the speaker said.
In short — voting yes would renew the public works project. Voting no would stop the program.

A record-high number of people in Franklin County experienced homelessness earlier this year, according to a new report. 
Franklin County’s annual Point-in-Time Count identified 2,556 people experiencing homelessness — a 7.4% increase from 2024. 
Point-in-Time counts are one-night estimates of sheltered and unsheltered people experiencing homelessness that are conducted nationwide in partnership with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Franklin County’s count took place on Jan. 23.

“When you are not building out enough infrastructure and diversity of infrastructure as you’re growing … or if the planning isn’t being caught up to that economic growth, to that population boom — what ends up happening is that housing becomes a commodity,” said Shannon Isom, executive director of the Community Shelter Board.  “With all commodities, when you have a scarcity, it also allows for prices to go up. When prices go up, people are literally being priced out, which is exactly what’s happening right now.” 
Individual sheltered homelessness went up by 14% compared to 2024 while the number of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness decreased by 12%, according to the report. 
A little more than half of people experiencing homelessness were men (57%), 42% were women and 1% were non-binary. 55% were Black, 33% were white and 3% were Hispanic, according to the report. 
There was a 31% increase in unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness, a 14% increase in single adults experiencing homelessness, and a 7% increase in veterans experiencing homelessness, according to the report. 
There was a 21% decrease in people with severe mental illness experiencing homelessness, a 31% decrease in the number of domestic violence survivors experiencing homelessness, and a 2% decrease in the number of people experiencing chronic homelessness, according to the report. 
Franklin County is Ohio’s most populous county with 1,356,303 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the region is projected to experience 16% of overall homelessness by 2028, Isom said. 
Ohioans need to be making at least $20.81 an hour working a full-time job to be able to afford a “modest” two-bedroom apartment, according to a report last year by the National Low Income Housing Coalition and the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio.
Forty percent of people experiencing homelessness are employed, Isom said. 
“There’s just not enough homes, there’s just not enough real estate,” she said. “It’s difficult to live here within this region, again, because of the commodification of housing.”
There were 11,759 people experiencing homelessness in Ohio last year, according to HUD’s annual Homelessness Assessment Report.

(Photo by Jill Nolin/ Georgia Recorder)Shelby Hutton was a biologist studying sexually transmitted diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was planning to expand her gonorrhea research by starting doctoral studies in the fall.
But in early April, Hutton found herself suddenly unemployed and applying for a job at Starbucks.
As a scientist, Hutton said she had not expected to find herself among the legions of federal workers abruptly fired as part of the Trump administration’s plan to shrink the federal government through mass firings.
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to slash 10,000 job in late March, including 2,400 jobs at the CDC.
“Hundreds of good scientists and subject matter experts were among the cuts to federal employees,” Hutton said while standing outside the CDC in Atlanta. “This is the exact opposite of what RFK said would happen. I’ll be the first to say that there is a lot of improvement to be had in terms of government efficiency, but I really can’t picture a functional CDC without laboratorians.”
Hutton said she was in the middle of validating tests her team had developed for the molecular surveillance of gonorrhea that is resistant to antibiotics – work she said she doesn’t know of other labs doing – when she received the email dismissing her and her entire laboratory branch.
They didn’t have time to properly store specimens that Hutton described as “priceless.”
To Hutton, it feels like the deep cuts at the CDC are part of a backlash to the COVID-19 pandemic and lingering anger among some over shutdowns and other safety measures taken to control the spread of the virus.
“It absolutely feels like we’re the scapegoats. It feels like we’re being attacked,” Hutton said. “And I don’t think people realize how important the work that we do is and how much we care about the work we do in public health.”

Tuesday marked Trump’s 100th day in office, but the president has already seen his approval rating suffer in Georgia – a state he won last year after narrowly losing here in 2020.
Trump’s approval rating among Georgia voters is at 43%, according to a poll released Wednesday by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and conducted by the University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs.
Anger over the cuts to the CDC has shown up at town halls, protests, press conferences and rallies outside the center’s Atlanta campus. Navy blue signs saying “Save the CDC” and “Save Public Health” can be seen in Atlanta front yards.
And signs of dissatisfaction with the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to reduce the size of the federal government are also reflected in the AJC’s poll.
A slight majority of the poll’s respondents – 51.5% – said they disapprove of those efforts to reduce the size of the government, many of them saying they strongly disapprove. Only 44% said they approved, with 4.5% unsure. The cuts were not popular with the independent voters polled, with about 55% of them frowning on the efforts.
But 74% of Republican voters surveyed said they enthusiastically back the cuts.
 ‘Everybody knows that you need CDC’

Sarah Boim, a former communication specialist at the CDC, says she is trying to remain hopeful that the wave of legal challenges in response to the cuts to the federal workforce will lead to her and many of her colleagues getting their jobs back.
But Boim is also not waiting around to see if that happens.
She and other CDC workers who lost their jobs have formed a group called Fired But Fighting. What started out as a newsletter to disseminate accurate information to workers trying to figure out their next steps has quickly evolved into a broader effort to push back on the cuts through spirited advocacy.
“We just need people to know how important it is to have public health managed at a federal level,” Boim said. “You cannot privatize public health. You need the money that a government has. You need the money of a country – we’re talking about B with billions – and you also need to be able to coordinate across the states. And you just can’t do that in a private company or an organization.” 
Fired But Fighting made a splash at Sen. Jon Ossoff’s recent town hall in Marietta, where they pressed the senator to do more to push back on the Trump administration.
The Democrat responded by saying the future of the nation’s public health infrastructure ultimately hinges on whether the American people “see and understand that they’re being put at risk” – and vote accordingly.
Republican state leaders have expressed at least tepid support for the cuts, though one said he was uneasy about the pace.
After the first round in February, Gov. Brian Kemp said “government can stand a little right-sizing.” Suwanee Republican U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick said he asked the White House to slow the pace of the firings after being caught in the crosshairs of an angry town hall, telling the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in February that “I think we’re just moving a little too fast.” Congressman Mike Collins, a Jackson Republican, told WABE in February that the fired workers could go find other work in Georgia.
Boim, who was fired in February, said she is trying to find another job, broadening the search to even “health adjacent” roles.
“I have applied to 127 jobs,” she said. “I keep a spreadsheet. I’ve had two canceled interviews, both because they’re worried about federal funding, and a lot of thanks, but no thanks, because the job market is just saturated with people like me.”
She said she hopes the state’s Republican leaders will come around.
“I think they’re scared. If you’re not on Trump’s side, you’re against him, and I think that they’re scared of getting on his bad side,” Boim said. “I’m sorry, but people need to start being brave. I feel like CDC is a bipartisan issue. Everybody knows that you need CDC.”
 ‘Not going quietly’

Jill Daugherty said she knew the CDC’s injury center she worked at was likely poised to lose staffers, but the extent of the cuts left her stunned. The injury center was gutted after last month’s round of cuts, with Daugherty’s traumatic brain injury team wiped out. She thinks the goal is to dismantle the CDC.
“We really didn’t know which teams were going to get cut, so we were just kind of waiting around the whole week before, like, ‘Is it gonna be us? Is it gonna be us?’ And then it was everybody,” Daugherty said.
That’s how Daugherty found herself on the other side of the CDC’s entrance on a recent Tuesday afternoon holding a sign that said, “Firing experts… Ignoring science… CDC deserves better.” She stood on the curb as the passing vehicles – including her former colleagues leaving work for the day – honked their horns at the group of demonstrators.
The Tuesday rallies, organized by retired CDC staffers, have become a ritual since the mass firings started.
“You’re not just standing up for yourselves. You’re standing up for our country and the best that America represents,” U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, told fired CDC workers during a visit to one of the rallies in April.
Even when facing the prospect of unemployment and an uncertain future, many of the fired CDC workers still focus on the loss to the programs they had dedicated their careers to advancing when they talk about the mass firings.
Aryn Backus was a health communication specialist at the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health until Valentine’s Day, when hundreds of workers were swept up in the first round of dismissals. She said she remained hopeful that the firing would be reversed until her entire office was cut in April.
“So, I knew that even if I were to get my termination rescinded, there would be no job to go back to,” said Backus, who is the mother of a 1-year-old.
But even then, when standing at a microphone in front of reporters recently, Backus wanted to talk about the work her office did to curb smoking rates – and all the work left to do.
“The impact of these CDC cuts will be felt in public health for years to come. They’re not going to help make America healthy but will decrease public health programs that help save lives,” said Backus, who is also part of Fired But Fighting.
“That’s why the CDC employees are not going quietly. We are fighting back to not only protect civil service, but to protect public health.”

The actions come as demand skyrockets for drugs similar to those that go by the brand names Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and Mounjaro.
The Ohio Board of Pharmacy notified Slimbolic Weight Loss and Med Spa in Beavercreek that its license to distribute dangerous drugs was summarily suspended. The notice was accompanied by a 29-page document listing scores of alleged violations.
They included naming as the person responsible for the clinic a Maine doctor who had never been there, improper recordkeeping, storing adulterated drugs with those that weren’t, and improperly labeled drugs. Pharmacy board inspectors said workers at the clinic were also compounding drugs without the proper supervision and that they were doing so in a non-sterile environment.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe order said “there is clear and convincing evidence of a danger of immediate and serious harm to others due to Slimbolic’s method used to possess or distribute dangerous drugs, and the method of prescribing dangerous drugs used by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe drugs who holds a terminal distributor license or practices in the employ of or under contract with a terminal distributor.”
A call placed to the clinic was not returned.
The board of pharmacy has been cracking down on weight-loss clinics as the clamor for GLP-1 drugs has risen. They facilitate weight loss by slowing gastric emptying. The resultant weight loss can ease impacts of obesity, including diabetes and heart disease.
But the pharmacy board has reported numerous abuses by Ohio spas and weight-loss clinics over the past year. 
In January, the board suspended licenses to distribute dangerous drugs held by clinics in Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton and Columbus. It accused them of giving patients weight-loss drugs that were labeled “for research use only” and that came from “an unlicensed out-of-state-seller.” 
In March, it suspended the license of Rejuv and Renew Wellness Spa, which has clinics in Maineville and Franklin, both in Warren County between Cincinnati and Dayton. The board said the spa was injecting patients with “counterfeit” Botox that the operator said she’d gotten from a California dentist she wouldn’t identify.
In a related matter, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost recently warned 14 spas “to stop making false or misleading claims about their versions of popular weight-loss drugs.”
“People deserve clear and accurate information about the medications they’re putting in their bodies,” Yost said in a written statement. “We’re reminding businesses that being truthful isn’t just a good business practice — it’s the law.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)In an alternate universe, an unnamed news weekly runs the following, laudatory op-ed from a Kansas politician.
As a humble U.S. senator from Kansas who is definitely not Roger Marshall or Jerry Moran, it fills me with ecstasy to write a column commemorating the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s second, but hopefully not last, administration.
Yes, I understand that more than 40% of Kansans supposedly voted for Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris. I’m assuming that was fraud. The actual residents of our state knew what they were supporting in November 2024: using tariffs to choke off the world’s agriculture markets and plunge the economy into a recession!
Wait, did I get that right? Let me check. I am being told I did.
Rest assured, we here in Congress are 100% behind the president’s agenda, whatever that might be at the moment of this writing. Sure, it’s hitting folks back home. Institutions they depended on — from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to higher education — are being gutted by children supervised by the world’s richest man. Again, though, that’s definitely what Kansans wanted from our president. I support every bit of it, so please don’t criticize me on X, Elon.
Sure, some sticks-in-the-mud claimed that wasn’t what they wanted. They showed up en masse at a town hall to tell me so. Don’t worry, we fixed that problem. My staff declared they aren’t real Kansas. We can’t open the detention centers soon enough!
Real Kansans crave poverty. I mean, think about it. What do you think about when you think of Kansas? The Wizard of Oz. The movie version was filmed during the Great Depression and portrayed Kansas as a sepia-toned hellhole. That’s what folks want for our great state! Child labor, a gutted National Weather Service that can’t warn us about tornadoes, the Dust Bowl. Classic Kansas.

Again, let me check my notes on this. I just want to triple-check I’m getting it right because it sounds like political suicide.
No? This is really what I’m supposed to be suggesting? Hoo boy.
Now, you might wonder about the point of vast economic and societal disruption. I think I speak for everyone in Congress when I say enthusiastically: I don’t know! Neither does anyone in the White House. However, the president has informed us that it’s all going to work out great — as everything he’s ever done has always worked out great — and that doesn’t make me nervous at all.
Are we worried about broken promises? Of course not! This president has always delivered on his promises. Remember the amazing Obamacare replacement plan? Remember infrastructure week? Remember how he ended the Russia-Ukraine war on day one of his second term? Remember how he said that Mexico would pay for a border wall, and Americans would never pay the cost of tariffs?
I rest my case. Promises made, results delivered.
A few in the chattering class have said otherwise. They point out that the U.S. Congress actually has the power to levy or lift tariffs. They point out that the U.S. Congress actually has control of how the government spends money. They point out that the president can be restrained by Congress if we just get off our duffs. But do they realize how boring that sounds?
It’s all going to be fine! Folks need to realize they can go work in the new factories that are sure to dot the landscape in just a few months, or possibly weeks, if the president has suggested that. Because that’s definitely how big business and industry works — the president enacts incomprehensible, quickly reversed policies and reality changes around us. Instantly!
These same communist critics say that as a U.S. senator I should be spending more time sticking up for Kansans rather than licking the boots of a would-be tyrant. But I ask you, have you actually tasted the boots? They’re quite delicious!
Plus, this means I won’t get yelled at online by Elon, who I don’t mind telling you is A LOT. I can refuse to meet with the people who yelled at me in Kansas. Have you tried ditching Elon? Even Trump can’t get rid of him.
Please remember that anyone who says or thinks otherwise has Trump Derangement Syndrome. TDS! They’re the ones who are totally deranged and have no idea what’s going on, not the administration that accidentally texted war plans to a journalist. We’ve all butt-dialed someone who’s not our spouse with secret war plans, right?
All in all, I would say this has been an amazing first 1,000 days. Whoops! I mean 100 days. I’m absolutely not at all nervous about what the president is doing — trashing export markets that farmers depend upon, slashing services that Kansans at home expect, and generally turning our economy into smoldering wreckage. 
If I were you, I’d be worried! But I’ll be fine. My seat is guaranteed! Sometimes I wonder why I even campaign.
In conclusion, Trump has been fantastic! And I’m sure that after the second 100 days his total mastery of our political system will be even clearer. That, or we’ll be in some sort of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome situation.
If not, at least I won’t have debased myself quite as badly as Roger Marshall did. Did you see his Newsweek op-ed? He didn’t mention tariffs once.
I’ll be fine, though.

For the past three years, she has had an assistant from the City Year program.
This is an AmeriCorps program that places qualified full-time volunteers in schools to support teachers and the development of children.
Her City Year volunteer was a kind person who supported children and helped with her workload of teaching math to high school-age children. It wasn’t rare for her to come home telling me she didn’t know what she would do without her City Year volunteer.
She will have to figure that out soon. Earlier this week, she arrived at school to find her City Year volunteer was gone. By the end of the day, an announcement was made to the school: Columbus City School’s 30-year relationship with the City Year program was over. This was a direct result of the federal Department of Government Efficiency’s decision last week to cut 41% of the AmeriCorps program budget.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXAmeriCorps was the beginning of my career. I enrolled as a full-time volunteer a few months after graduating from Denison University and was selected to serve as a community organizer supporting neighborhood associations for the mayor of Omaha, Nebraska. At the same time, my mother, back in the workforce with her three children out of high school, enrolled in AmeriCorps to evaluate literacy instruction programs for young children.
In 2020, my firm Scioto Analysis conducted a cost-benefit analysis of AmeriCorps programs in Ohio. We found that the programs have significant impacts on the trajectory of participants. People who enroll in the program have much higher future earnings and lower chances of criminal justice involvement. The best evidence available tells us cutting AmeriCorps will result in lower wages and higher crime rates for Ohio. We found that the net benefits of the program in Ohio range somewhere from from $1 million to $30 million and that expansions of the program could push net benefits into the nine-figure range.
It seems that the decisions being made at the federal level are blind to one side of the accounting ledger. In the fervor to reduce spending and cut administrative offices at the federal level, DOGE leader Elon Musk and other decision makers are failing to consider the benefits of programs they eliminate. I have no doubt in my mind that there are reasonable cuts that can be made to federal programs. The problem is that the current approach is not reasonable: it is the public finance equivalent of conducting open-heart surgery with a chainsaw.
The sad thing about this from the perspective of the fiscal hawk is that these cuts will have very little effect on the federal debt. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, even a spending cut 1,000 times the size of the AmeriCorps cut last week would only reduce the federal-debt-to-GDP ratio by one percentage point in the next decade. Cutting AmeriCorps is a drop in the bucket in the context of U.S. debt.
The benefits of cutting Americorps funds are hard to divine. Its costs are clear. In the meantime, volunteers will be lost and children from low-income families in a high-poverty school district will have one less resource available to them in their already under-resourced classrooms.

The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.













There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company





23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)Whenever Ed Spencer sees a forecast for northeasterly wind, he and his wife brace themselves. Often, the winds carry the smell of rotting waste from Juniper Ridge Landfill, which sits less than two miles from their home. 
The odor is a reminder of the fight Spencer, other environmental advocates, and members of the Penobscot Nation have found themselves in for the past two decades over the landfill that they say is polluting local waterways and causing other harms to environmental and public health without accountability. 
That’s why Spencer joined more than 50 others for a rally Sunday afternoon in Old Town to not only voice their concerns about expanding the state’s largest landfill, but also to ask the lawmakers who represent them in Augusta to back bills that could address the contamination and injustice they feel local communities have endured. 
  Advocates and members of the Penobscot Nation gathered in Old Town to protest Juniper Ridge expansion. (Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)
Juniper Ridge, which straddles Old Town and Alton, is owned by the state through the Bureau of General Services, which has an operating contract with NEWSME Landfill Operations, a subsidiary of the waste management company Casella. 
For Penobscot Nation member Charlene Francis, it was only fitting that the demonstration, which included a traditional water ceremony along the banks of the Penobscot River, took place under relentless rain. Because water is so sacred to the tribe, Francis said Juniper Ridge is a sore spot for her.
Locals have argued that there has been insufficient treatment of landfill leachate — water that collects chemicals after passing through the waste — which runs into the Penobscot River. They are specifically concerned about per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS or forever chemicals, which are linked to a number of negative health effects like some cancers, high cholesterol, reproductive and fetal development issues, and more. 
The Penobscot Nations’s reservation at Indian Island, which includes portions of the Penobscot River, is located five miles downstream from the landfill.
While Francis said she tries to do her part to address the mounting trash problem by pledging to not buy anything new that isn’t a necessity, others are calling on elected officials to do more.
Just over half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up in Juniper Ridge, which is expected to reach capacity in 2028. The state has signaled its support for expanding the facility despite objections from environmental advocates, the local community and the Penobscot Nation.
Spencer, who is now part of the grassroots movement Don’t Waste ME, which advocates for policies to protect the health of communities at risk of disposal operations, said he was almost “forced” into the fight against Juniper Ridge when he attended a city council meeting in October 2003. Having lived in the area since 1977, at the time he shared his opposition to opening the landfill. 
Almost 20 years later, Spencer said the efforts of his group, the Penobscot Nation and others is “reaching a critical mass,” in part because of what he sees as progress on the legislative front. Spencer attended a public hearing with the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee last week about a slate of bills related to the state’s largest landfill. 
He also pointed to steps the Government Oversight Committee and the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability have taken to investigate concerns with the landfill. 
While Spencer and others at the event support some of the proposals on the table this session, including one that would require legislative approval for contracts to operate Juniper Ridge, there is concern about one related proposal that would allow more bulky solid waste to be imported to the state’s landfills. 
With waste issues piling up, Maine Legislature weighs more oversight of Juniper Ridge

As Spencer sees it, LD 297 would complicate the definition of what constitutes waste generated in Maine, opening the door for more out-of-state waste that would fill the landfill even faster. Proponents argue this is necessary to bring in more bulky waste to stabilize the sludge that is disposed of at the facility. 
Alternately, he’s hoping lawmakers move forward with two proposals from Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot), whose district covers the area. 
One bill, LD 1604, seeks to address forever chemicals from landfill leachate entering groundwater and surface waters. 
A representative from the Department of Environmental Protection said the agency understands people’s desire to address PFAS, but opposed that bill arguing it isn’t the best approach. Since the bill would require “technically complex and challenging rulemaking,” the department said a better alternative would be to wait for the federal Environmental Protection Agency to develop pretreatment guidelines for landfills that discharge leachate. 
Under Tipping’s other bill, LD 1349, two-thirds of the Legislature would need to approve future operating contracts or contract renewals for Juniper Ridge, something currently handled by the executive branch.
If passed, this would be critical to the discussion about expanding and extending the life of the landfill. The environment committee is scheduled to have a work session on the bill Wednesday during which it could vote to recommend the Legislature pass the measure.
The Bureau of General Services has not submitted an application to expand the landfill, but Deputy Commissioner Anya Trundy told the Legislature last week that it intends to.
Trundy said that building out the landfill to its maximum capacity should allow it to operate until 2040, which would also necessitate extending the contract with Casella so that both line up with the 2040 timeline. 
Though the Department of Administrative and Financial Services would normally advocate for contracts to go out to bid, Trundy said doing so could sever the indemnification clause in the existing contract. Rather than giving Casella a “sweetheart deal,” Trundy said continuing the agreement holds them accountable to that clause that would leave them responsible for financial and environmental liability down the road. 
Spencer said that argument “shows how irresponsible the state was in the first place.” He believes involving the Legislature would lead to more responsible decision making in any future contracts for Juniper Ridge. 
Otherwise, he said, “Old Town becomes a sacrifice zone.”

Agriculture is Georgia’s top industry, and broilers are the state’s top farm product.
But the mess that large-scale poultry farming causes can create tensions between residents and corporate owners. And that is playing out in a northeast Georgia community, where a proposed poultry rendering plant has residents up in arms about the potential fouling of the Broad River, a source of water and recreation for Royston and nearby communities.
And if Pilgrim’s Pride decides to bypass Franklin Springs as a site for its processing plant, the company says it’s sure to pop up somewhere else in Georgia’s chicken farm territory.
For now, the Franklin Springs locals are the ones in the crosshairs.
Franklin Springs resident Magan Crump recently received jarring medical advice from her doctor: He advised her to move away from her hometown in case a new wastewater treatment and poultry byproduct processing plant opened in her community.
After the 40-year-old was diagnosed seven months ago with pulmonary hypertension, or high blood pressure within the lungs, her doctor recommended against Crump living close to a planned large wastewater treatment plant or a poultry rendering plant where the odors make it hard to breathe.
Rumors on social media escalated a public uproar in early March regarding the possibility of a poultry processing plant coming to Franklin Springs, a rural community about two hours northeast of downtown Atlanta.
Critics say they’re worried local officials will try to attract another animal rendering plant that would rely on the new treatment plant to discharge millions of gallons of wastewater into the Broad River.
“Franklin Springs has a population of about 1,100 people so there is absolutely no need for a wastewater treatment plant that size and that massive to be in this area,” Crump said. “What we are all concerned about is the industrial waste that goes along with that and how the poultry plant waste would impact the river.”
A Madison County Journal open records request in early April uncovered emails last year between Pilgrim’s Pride officials and Franklin Springs mayor about whether the size of the city’s planned wastewater treatment plant could sustain the company building a poultry rendering plant in Franklin.
A chicken rendering facility re-purposes animal byproducts such as bones. feet, oils and fats into other goods such as animal feed and fertilizers.
A common disposal method for the remaining sludge involves companies getting permission from farm owners to dump the “soil amendments” fertilizer onto their land.
The uproar was intense enough that Pilgrim’s Pride publicly announced last week that it would not build a chicken rendering facility in Franklin Springs and would explore alternative locations in Georgia.
The news about the prospective poultry plant has now placed Franklin County commissioners under pressure from several residents to rescind a wastewater plant agreement with Franklin Springs.
The new wastewater treatment plant is still in the works – and poultry waste could still one day end up at the facility, says Franklin Springs Mayor Lee Moore.
Moore has said that no contract has been signed with Pilgrim and that the city intends to fund the water treatment project primarily through bonds. Moore has also doubled down on his intention to entice another poultry company to a county that is among the top producers for the chicken industry.
Moore said he will continue pursuing new industries to the county.
“No industry is coming at this time, and there is no Pilgrim’s Pride plant of any type coming to Franklin Springs, period,” Moore said.
“Anything that we can do to make our agricultural county greater, I’m all in favor of it. If it’s anything that deals with poultry or cattle, I’m all in favor of that. But you know, once again, if something like that comes, it’s got to be built correctly. They have to be a good industry. They have to be good neighbors, and they will be held accountable by the city of Franklin Springs”
Community pushback 
Members of local movements like “Save Broad River” and “Stop the Rendering” have been leading the opposition against Pilgrim’s Pride.
Franklin Springs residents have started a petition to remove Moore from office over his handling of the Pilgrim’s Pride and wastewater plant issues.
The project faces strong opposition from the Broad River Watershed Association and local residents due to concerns about water pollution and the facility’s proximity to Emmanuel University and residential areas.
Tonya Bonitatibus, executive director of Savannah Riverkeeper, said if Pilgrim’s rendering plant is built somewhere, it would likely be the largest of its type in Georgia.
One of the major concerns is about the environmental impact of a proposed rendering plant producing more soil amendments from animal byproducts, she said.
  The Broad River Watershed Association said the river is in better condition than a lot of Piedmont rivers. However, pollution threats are not taken lightly by its residents. Photo submitted by the Broad River Watershed Association
Soil amendments are commonly used on farms to improve certain physical characteristics, such as water retention or reducing compactness.
Bonitatibus said Pilgrim’s plant would not only increase the millions of gallons of leftover waste that would become soil amendments, but it could also result in vast amounts of industrial sewage being treated and discharged into waterways, she said.
The leftover chicken parts processed at a wastewater facility will include significant amounts of fats, oils, and greases that can harm water quality and aquatic life if not properly treated, Bonitatibus said.
“When an animal goes into an animal processing facility, they’re going to use the big chunks of the meat, right?” Bonitatibus said. “But you’re going to have feet and beaks and feathers and fat left over and at the end of that, that waste can’t go to a wastewater treatment plant or a landfill.”
This year isn’t the first time there has been controversy in Franklin County over a proposed Pilgrim plant. In 2021, the county would withdraw plans following protests over a proposed $70 million pet food ingredient and rendering plant near Carnesville.
“I have a grandchild with compromised lung issues who was born premature,” Franklin Springs resident Donna Bennett said. “I’m also a real estate agent so the environmental, private property impact is a huge concern. It’s infuriating that this has been going on behind our backs for three to four years in this city, and no one had any knowledge until about three months ago.”
Franklin County officials have joined several neighboring counties to express opposition to having the poultry plant built locally.
At a workshop meeting held Tuesday, Franklin County Chairperson Courtney Long read a statement indicating the board’s desire to protect the river and its surroundings.
“Many of those being targeted had absolutely no hand whatsoever in creating this situation and threatening them we feel like only weakens the cause that we’re all trying to fight,” Long said at the meeting, which was livestreamed.
“When we entered into the intergovernmental agreement, we did so by following the direction set by the previous board,” Long said. “As stewards of your tax dollars, we made that decision because it saved our taxpayers millions of dollars.”
On Tuesday, Royston resident Kay Williams criticized county commissioners for entering into a water treatment agreement.
“When you say you love us and you love the river, there is no earthly way you love anything, to let a poultry place come here and contaminate what we love and live with (like) our drinking water,” Williams said.
Moore disputes claims that an animal processing facility’s waste would be harmful after the animal byproducts and other contaminants are properly removed by wastewater treatment plants.
“Anything that would come to Franklin Springs would have to be treated by that industry’s own wastewater treatment plant, then it would have to be sent to Franklin to be treated before it would be emptied into the Broad River,” Moore said. “It would be a tremendous gain for the Broad River to get some clean water in it.”
Poultry industry critical to state
Northeast Georgia is a hotspot for the state’s prized poultry industry.
But other rural areas of the state are home to various poultry and other animal byproduct processing plants.
Mike Giles, president of the Georgia Poultry Federation, said for the poultry industry to continue to grow in Georgia, plants like Pilgrim’s rendering facilities are important.
Giles has defended the poultry industry when it allows chicken processing byproducts to be properly injected into the soil instead of being haphazardly dumped on top of land.
Rendering plants like the one apparently now scuttled in Franklin Springs are important since only two-thirds of each broiler chicken is for human consumption, Giles said.
Environmental groups in Georgia and other states have long voiced concerns about the odors and the potential for the waste to reach waterways that residents rely on for drinking and recreational activities.
“I would say that any community that is considering this type of a rendering facility needs to immediately go visit one first and try to understand how they can put the proper protections in place for their community before they allow the company to come in,” Bonitatibus said.

Food answers
While a bill to certify the origins of your cheeseburger is working its way through the Unicameral — with some in that august body rightly wondering why — a recent, far more important discussion took place: Should Nebraska be using access to food as a behavior modification tool?
To their credit, senators have moved forward State Sen. Victor Rountree’s Legislative Bill 314, a proposal to lift the ban on access to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for certain former felons who have served time on drug convictions. 
To date, proponents have been on the money in support of LB 314, arguing that addiction is not a moral issue but rather a disease. Plus, using food as a cudgel would continue the punishment of a crime for which offenders had already paid their debt to society. Rountree’s bill appears to be heading for final passage, a welcome turn for the 1,000 or so Nebraskans affected by the current ban.
How all Nebraskans pay for the food they put on their tables has also been a topic of discussion as it relates to the Legislature’s charge to carry out the will of the voting public who decided to increase the state’s minimum wage a couple of years ago. 
Minimum wage fight
The debate over State Sen. Jane Raybould’s LB 258 has been wide-ranging, rife with weedy details and occasionally personal, the overarching question here is just because the Legislature has the authority to alter what was decided at the polls, should it?
LB 258 changes the rate at which the minimum wage would rise starting in 2027 from the cost of living to a set percent each year. There are some exceptions for younger workers. The details are numerous and devilish, but the debate tone took an unfortunate turn last week. 
That’s when several senators argued that the solution for those earning a minimum wage was to forego dependence on government largesse and instead work harder, improve themselves, get an education or start their own business. The implication was that minimum wage earners are not hard workers, uninterested in self-improvement, uneducated and somehow in a position to open their own businesses. 
“Inexplicable” comes to mind when distilling such comments, but I’d question that. I think it explicable: Being woefully out of touch with all wage earners across the state dealing with high prices, stubborn inflation and the nation’s chaotic economic future. 
King’s words
State senators work hard and surely had Nebraskans’ best interest at heart when they raised their right hands on January 8. While a serious and sometimes difficult task, all Nebraskans live by the Legislature’s decisions. It is incumbent on them … indeed on all of us as voters, too … to have an understanding of not simply how legislation affects our lives, but also the lives of those with whom we have little or nothing in common, aside from geography.
Speaking of economic futures, now is a good time to remind ourselves of the words of Martin Luther King Jr. who said, “a budget is a moral document.” Debate begins this week to address the state economic forecasting board’s recent revision that adds $190 million over two years to the budget deficit. For an excellent primer on the details, read the Nebraska Examiner’s Zach Wendling’s piece here.
The sledding will be tough. That’s because as we see on our nightly television news and in our morning papers, some are selling a rosy, tariff-driven future, but few economists and business leaders are buying. 
Chaos and doubt have replaced certitude, a priceless commodity when paying for today, investing in tomorrow or both. The result? Roiling markets, talk of recession and a vague economic malaise among buyers, sellers and, most importantly, consumers. All of which affects Nebraskans and those with whom we have entrusted the state’s financial plan.
To wit: Any budget discussion, debate and eventual decision seen through King’s observation and ye shall know them by … how they spend our money.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”



Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.



Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Blue and red states slash taxes despite warnings of hard times ahead

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

I recently celebrated the Passover holiday, commemorating the deliverance of my people from slavery to freedom. Yet at numerous times in history since our deliverance from the Egyptians, we Jews have been anything but free. 
I am descended from a people who have been denied free speech and freedom of religion. We have been persecuted and murdered in the millions for pursuing the same. The message of Passover is that having known the bitterness of this oppression ourselves, we Jews must recognize and are obligated to fight oppression wherever and whenever it may raise its ugly specter.
This is the very reason why I believe deporting students who exercise their First Amendment rights is not only unconstitutional, it is antisemitic. It is oppressing individuals by suppressing their constitutional freedoms, ironically and erroneously in the name of combating antisemitism. 
But let’s be crystal clear: having been denied these rights ourselves, Jews must see abrogation of free speech rights of any group or individual in the same vein as having those freedoms denied to each of us. I see the faces of Jews ripped from their homes by the Gestapo in the terrified face of the young Tufts University student accosted on the street by unidentified ICE officers. As due process was withheld from us in Hitler’s Germany, we cannot abide circumventing due process for anyone.
What is done to one, is done to all.
 Moreover, claiming unlawfulness as an exercise on behalf of the Jewish people brands us as “the problem” once again. The danger is that, as in Hitler’s Germany, this will be extrapolated to mean that America’s democratic system is at risk because of the Jewish people. 
There is enough real antisemitism and historical precedence to go around without pinning on us the deportation of people who are speaking their conscience with no evidence of criminal wrongdoing and without due process.
Protest and free speech are guaranteed to anyone and everyone on United States soil. My father was a Jewish attorney who, as a manyfold decorated WW II bomber pilot, risked his life to protect those freedoms. From my youngest recollection he instilled in me the belief that despite its flaws and those of its authors, the U.S. Constitution was without peer in modern government frameworks.
 So many years later I still hold that belief. As a Jew, I receive it as the deepest insult and injustice, that defiance of our Constitution, that denial of First Amendment rights, that persecution of people because of their beliefs, should be declared to have been carried out in my name; in the name of the Jewish people. 
Combating antisemitism? Bah, humbug! No, not a war on antisemitism by any means. Deporting students for speaking their personal truths is the same war on free speech and withholding of due process we Jews have experienced time and time again. It is the petri dish in which antisemitism flourishes.
Never, never, in my name.

Many will picture beautiful estates, country clubs, and extreme wealth. Connecticut is home to some of the wealthiest towns in America. But it’s not all perfectly manicured lawns and waterfront properties. The stark reality behind this picture-perfect reputation that Connecticut has earned is a shocking divide in wealth, a growing poverty rate, and a housing system that is, frankly, a mess. 
It’s glaringly obvious to anyone who’s driven across different parts of Connecticut. Neighborhoods are largely segregated by income and race. It’s time we pay attention to impoverished residents who have been neglected and left out of the picture.

Kayla Bell
Connecticut is one of the most racially and economically segregated states in the country. In particular, Bridgeport and Hartford “remain among the most segregated in the nation in terms of race and ethnicity and among the highest in income inequality,”  reports Jacqueline Rabe Thomas of the Connecticut Insider.
Lawmakers have not adequately addressed the stark economic divide which disproportionately impacts people of color and other marginalized groups. Historically, policies systematically excluded Black families from equitable housing. Redlining was a discriminatory practice where financial services from banks or insurance companies denied services to predominantly Black communities. 
This left entire communities without the opportunity for upward mobility. These policies have left a dark legacy, continuing to create racial divides between neighborhoods, with families of color more likely to live in neighborhoods with low-quality housing. 
While redlining is illegal today, there have been many more discriminatory practices since. For example, reverse redlining aimed to fortify conditions of poverty. Segregated neighborhoods that were previously denied credit, became targets for predatory lenders who sold subprime loans at extremely high interest rates. These lenders knew that many families would never be able to pay off the debt, leading to bankruptcies and foreclosures that disproportionately impacted people of color. The division is a direct result of exclusionary zoning and discriminatory practices. It is imperative that we name this issue for what it is: Racism.
Connecticut lawmakers have a responsibility to serve their communities, and they have not done an adequate job when it comes to housing. A 2020 report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition expressed that Connecticut has a severe shortage of affordable rental homes. 
Exclusionary zoning and lack of affordable housing have prevented many families of color from moving into upper-class neighborhoods, which also, in turn, impacts the quality of education their children receive. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated housing inequality. Rates of eviction skyrocketed, and marginalized communities took the brunt of it. 
It’s clear that housing impacts so many other facets of life. Where a person grows up is a defining factor of life expectancy and a determinant of overall health and well-being: “Those growing up just a few blocks apart in different municipalities have drastically different outcomes in life,” Thomas reported. For example, children who grow up in segregated neighborhoods have higher rates of incarceration and teenage pregnancy and are more likely to work in lower paying or minimum wage jobs. It would cost, on average, 3.5 times more to live in areas with ‘well-resourced, high-performing schools in Connecticut, one of the largest disparities in the country,” Thomas wrote. Connecticut’s House Majority Leader, Jason Rojas of East Hartford, expressed that “There are serious ramifications for people, for communities, and for our state to continue to not address this issue.”
I’m calling on Connecticut lawmakers and representatives to advocate for an expansion of affordable housing, especially options that are integrated in wealthier neighborhoods. It should be noted that there is much controversy over this. Many members of affluent neighborhoods are opposed to the integration of affordable housing. There is an attitude present that the suburban utopia will be “tainted” by apartment buildings and low-income housing. This perspective has inherent undertones of white supremacy.
Tackling this issue requires bold action. I’m also calling on local governments to invest into their low-income neighborhoods, rather than contributing to gentrification, which increases costs of living and displaces families, some of whom have been living in their homes for generations. 
Housing is part of a much larger issue, as is education, crime, health, etc. To tackle any and all of these issues, we must look at the broader picture. I am calling on all legislators to advocate for any policies or initiatives that allow low-income families to build wealth and provide a path to economic stability.

 Senate Bill 1349 offers a chance to reimagine school choice not as a partisan flashpoint, but as a path to equity, excellence, and opportunity for all students and their teachers.
In Connecticut, choice is not a threat to public education. It is a tool for ensuring public education fulfills its constitutional promise: that every child, no matter their zip code, has access to a great school.
We know this from experience. Connecticut has long invested in diverse public school models —magnet schools, inter-district programs, charter schools— that provide families with options that supplement district offerings. These are public solutions to public challenges, born out of our state’s commitment to fairness and innovation. The landmark Sheff v. O’Neill decision led to bold experimentation that continues to benefit thousands of students across our state. We must do more and better.
Senate Bill 1349 builds on this legacy. It expands access to high-quality public education by giving more families a say in where and how their children learn —while ensuring that transparency, oversight, and public accountability remain central. This is not about shifting public dollars to private systems. It is about expanding public school options to reflect the diverse needs of the students they serve.
When families are empowered to choose, students thrive. Research and real-world results show that the presence of high-performing, non-traditional public schools can help raise the bar for entire systems. Teachers gain the freedom to work in schools aligned with their values and methods. Communities are strengthened by responsive, student-centered learning environments. The whole district benefits. We know it works—because it’s already working here in Connecticut.
Yet far too many families still face barriers. They wait on lottery lists because choice is a chance they are willing to take. While we’ve made progress, inequities persist—especially for children of color, multilingual learners, and students with disabilities. If we want every student to succeed, we must support a system that adapts to the learner, not the other way around.
As Frederick Douglass said, “Once you learn to read, you will be forever free.” Every child who succeeds becomes a raindrop in the river toward freedom.
Connecticut can lead better. We are not here to dismantle our public system. We are here to improve it, to expand it, and to fulfill its mission with integrity. The choice we face is not between tradition and disruption —but between stagnation and progress. If we fail to act, we deny generations of children the chance to thrive in a system that sees them, supports them, and adapts to their needs.
This is the moment to be bold. To insist that school choice and public education are not enemies, but allies in the urgent work of opportunity and success.
When choice comes to town, let it come with purpose, with partnership, and with the promise of freedom through learning, to ensure that public education truly belongs to all of us—and works for every child.
Instead of running to catch up, let’s choose to do better.

An apparent immigration enforcement action by agents with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency early Sunday morning in Nashville resulted in the detentions of area immigrants, officials said. 
According to a press release from state Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Nashville Democrat, “Witnesses reported multiple drivers pulled over and detained, including mothers driving to work, allegedly leaving children in vehicles by themselves. Videos, photos, and firsthand accounts point to ICE working in tandem with the Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) to carry out what can only be described as a dragnet.” 
A Tennessee Lookout photojournalist on Sunday documented buses leaving a U.S. Department of Homeland Security facility in Nashville. Family members of the alleged detainees were also present, protesting the alleged detentions.

“Arbitrarily rounding up parents on their way home and workers traveling to their jobs does not make Nashville safer or stronger,” said Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition in a statement. “Instead it shatters families, erodes trust in law enforcement, and leads to fear, trauma and isolation that weakens the collective fabric of our community.”
“This is yet another unconscionable act of cruelty and abuse of power by ICE collaborating with state law enforcement that will have a devastating impact on families throughout Nashville and beyond,” Luna said. 
In a statement posted on social media, Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell said, “This type of federal enforcement action is not focused on making us safer and leaves people in our community fearing any interaction with law enforcement when there is a crime occurring. We will be seeking the names of those detained.”
At publication time, the Lookout had not received responses to requests for comment from ICE or the Tennessee Highway Patrol.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Legislature gaveled in at 8 a.m. Friday and didn’t adjourn about 4 a.m. Saturday to close out the 69th Legislative Assembly.
Lawmakers used 74 of 80 available legislative days, though that does not include days when committees met and the full House and Senate did not convene.
Legislators introduced 1,089 bills and resolutions, the highest number since 2009, according to Legislative Council.
More than 615 bills passed both chambers, with final figures not immediately available.
As of 5 p.m. Friday, Gov. Kelly Armstrong had signed 536 bills and issued four vetoes, all of which were sustained by the Legislature.
Armstrong has 15 business days to sign all remaining bills.
In the final hours, legislators approved major budget bills and compromised on a historic property tax package. They worked through the night, at times socializing or saying goodbyes to colleagues while waiting on conference committees to complete their work or amendments to be drafted by legislative staff.
“Democracy is messy, but it is the best form of government there is,” Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, said as the Senate adjourned sine die.

There were no public defenders available to represent the defendant. (Photo by Jake Parrish/InvestigateWest)While Washington state lawmakers’ budget more than doubles funding for public defenders, those attorneys say the sum is still woefully inadequate to meet the needs of local courts. 
Unlike most states, Washington does not bear the burden of funding the constitutional right to counsel. Instead, the onus is on local governments with the state historically only funding less than 3% of overall costs. 
“They were paying such a small portion of the cost that the increase was going to look large,” said Derek Young, interim director of the Washington State Association of Counties. “In a session where they had budget frames and were making cuts to other important programs, I saw this as a really positive first step, recognition that something has to change.” 
The new budget, awaiting the governor’s signature, would increase the state’s contributions to public defense to around 6% of total funding during the next biennium, 2026-2027. The funding boost is not guaranteed after that.
“This is a great start,” said Katrin Johnson, deputy director for the state’s Office of Public Defense, which provides supplemental representation to indigent defendants and disburses the state’s funding to counties and cities. “It’s about collaboration and education to help the Legislature understand the local difficulties and challenges counties have in funding public defense.”
For years, public defender offices across Washington have been struggling to recruit and retain attorneys. It’s a taxing job with a high workload, and not many law school graduates are inclined to relocate to rural areas, leaving these jurisdictions especially susceptible to a shortage. 
Without an adequate pool of public defenders, defendants in places like Yakima County are left waiting weeks, sometimes months, to resolve their cases. 
The people most vulnerable to the state’s shortage of public defenders are disproportionately people of color, said Pierce County Executive Ryan Mello, who testified before the Legislature in favor of increasing state funding for public defense. 
“Poor folks, people of color, sit in jail longer,” Mello said. “The longer they sit in jail, not adjudicating their case, the more likely they are to lose their job, to lose their family, to lose their housing, and things spiral out of control.”
Local jurisdictions provide the majority of funding for public defense, about 97%, often leading to public defense programs having to negotiate with county commissioners to increase funding amid inflationary costs for court services.
“It’s inappropriate to rely just on local revenue to fund a constitutional right,” Young said.
The state’s Office of Public Defense administers the limited state funding given to counties and cities through a grant program. Since 2017, funding has remained stagnant — not surpassing 2% of the overall money spent by courts to provide public defense services, according to data from the Office of Public Defense. The funding is dispersed to counties in varying amounts based on population and caseload size.

County revenues collected from property and sales taxes make up the remaining funds, but in Washington, local governments can only increase their property tax revenue by 1% without voter-approved ballot measures, failing to keep pace with the rising costs of running a court.
“The money we get [from the state] wouldn’t even pay for one attorney,” said Jeremy Ford, director of the Chelan County public defender’s office. “The problem is that the millions of dollars that gets spread out proportionally based on the size of your county or city… means us rural counties get less resources, which is always the case.”
Last year, the Chelan County public defender’s office received $81,000 from the grant, amounting to just 2.2% of total costs. 
“The money they’re passing through isn’t really enough to do any substantial help for anybody,” Ford said.
Two identical House and Senate bills related to public defense funding died this session. Over a rolling basis, those bills would have made the state responsible for 50% of the costs associated with public defense services. 
“Budgetarily, I knew it would be a big ask,” said Rep. Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds and prime sponsor of the House bill, citing the state’s multibillion-dollar budget deficit. “I’ve been in the Legislature for 11 years and always kind of knew about the shortfall in public defense funding, but I didn’t quite realize how acute it was.”
Neither bill made it out of committee, but those involved say there was more support for public defense this year than previously.
“There has been proposed legislation for many years to increase the amount of state funding for local public defense, and this is the first time we’ve received more,” Johnson said. “It’s a constitutional right. We want to make sure it’s being done well no matter what jurisdiction it falls under.”
Peterson said he will continue to work with the Legislature to secure public defense funding across the state. 
“We can’t just pay for more police officers,” Peterson said. “We need to pay for the whole system to make sure it works.”
Gov. Bob Ferguson has until May 20 to sign or veto the new budget. If there is no action by then, the budget will become law.
“I think the governor, being the former attorney general, has a really good understanding of the criminal justice system,” said Mello, the Pierce County executive. “He understands the need for access to justice … which really increases our chances at this part of the budget being signed into law.”

(Submitted photo)The Indiana Capital Chronicle took home seven awards from the Society of Professional Journalists’ annual Indiana chapter banquet Friday evening — including a top recognition for Senior Reporter Casey Smith, who was honored as the Journalist of the Year.
SPJ board members cited Smith’s accomplishments as an education writer while announcing the award, as well as her investigative work into Jamey Noel, a disgraced former sheriff now serving time in prison for misusing public funds for private gain.
Judges also recognized Smith as likely being the first reporter to witness a state execution. Smith earned the trust of Joseph Cochran’s defense team and was invited as part of Cochran’s personal guest list.

That work earned Smith — and ICC Editor-in-Chief Niki Kelly — a first-place nod in the criminal justice category. Kelly has covered Cochran’s case since the beginning, when she was a courts reporter with the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette.
Smith also won a second-place finish for her environmental reporting on a 2024 bill seeking to exempt certain products from being defined as toxic PFAs “forever chemicals.”
The ICC’s four-person team won five other awards on Friday, including first place for best journalism website and third place for the publication’s daily newsletter, Fast Break.
Senior Reporter Whitney Downard nabbed a first-place win for her personality profile of Abbey Hall, a Hoosier who traveled to Illinois for an abortion after learning her daughter would be born with a detrimental birth defect. Downard also won second place in the Medical and Science Reporting category for her story about transportation troubles for adult day care recipients following a transition to managed care.

Larry Rhoden, points toward the property line of land in rural Lincoln County that had been surveyed for the purpose of constructing a men's prison. (John Hult/South Dakoa Searchlight. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)When the South Dakota Department of Corrections announced the site where it hoped to build a 1,500-bed men’s prison in 2023, it told the public it was the only usable site available.
The state had sent a request for information months earlier, hoping someone would offer up land for the project. No one who was willing to sell had exactly what the state was after, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko said. 
This week, department spokesman Michael Winder again wrote that “no formal submissions” met the criteria for the prison.
“The state continued to do outreach, get referrals, and conduct research” after the request was placed, Winder wrote, but “in the fall of 2023, the other sites the state was pursuing declined to sell.”
So the department transferred $8 million to the state Office of School and Public Lands, laying claim to 320 acres of farmland a few miles south of Harrisburg that had been leased to farmers for years. The lease proceeds were used to fund the state’s K-12 schools, and the $8 million went into the trust fund into which those lease payments had flowed. 


 The locations of potential men’s prison sites submitted to Project Prison Reset.
The site was a “gift from God,” Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden would later say. But its selection sparked fierce opposition, political activism and a lawsuit from neighbors. It also contributed to the Rhoden administration’s failure to push the $825 million project across the finish line during the 2025 legislative session. 
In March, the state sent out another request for information, this time as part of an effort to “reset” discussions on a correctional facility to replace the state penitentiary. 
In less than a month, more than a dozen options emerged. 
One of them, the former Citibank campus in northern Sioux Falls, was apparently available as an option back in 2023. 
Citibank had built a new headquarters on the south end of Sioux Falls in 2019. A representative for the company selling the land said they didn’t submit it as a possible prison site in 2023, but said the state didn’t reach out during the “outreach” phase of its site search.
“I don’t know what happened the first time around,” said Troy Fawcett of NAI Sioux Falls Commercial Real Estate.
New process wider in scope
Rhoden’s office wouldn’t comment on whether the former Citibank campus just north of the state penitentiary was under consideration in 2023, but spokeswoman Josie Harms did note its size in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight. 
In the first request for information, the state sought at least 100-200 acres of land or more for a 1,500 bed facility, based on a consultant’s report.
“The Project Prison Reset task force isn’t looking back — we’re moving forward,” Harms wrote to Searchlight. “With that said, the Citibank building is only 70 acres.”
South Dakota corrections work group formally backs need for new prison

Ryan Brunner, a policy adviser for Rhoden, presented the new options to members of Project Prison Reset during the group’s second meeting on Tuesday in Springfield. He told Searchlight after the meeting that several options may not have been for sale in 2023, and that the market in Sioux Falls has changed.
“We’ll have to do some analysis on these sites to see if they’re a fit or not,” Brunner said.
The parameters for a potential site are less restrictive this time around. 
The governor’s work group is exploring all options, including smaller facilities, multiple facilities and locations outside the Sioux Falls area. There’s a preference for sites within 20 miles of Sioux Falls in the newer request for information, but that’s not a requirement.
That easing of requirements made it possible for the state to field offers from Big Stone City, Aberdeen, Huron and Mitchell. Big Stone has an empty cheese plant on more than 100 acres. Huron has 100 acres in an industrial park. Mitchell has more than that, on land south of town near its landfill. Aberdeen has two options on two ends of the Hub City.
The newer parameters also put the Citibank site, with its 70 acres, in the running. That offer is the spendiest option by asking price, at $33.8 million, and the one with the smallest footprint.
It does offer some enticements the others do not, though. 
It has buildings that could be refurbished, rather than built from the ground up. It’s connected to water and sewer, and is less than a mile from the current penitentiary campus. The minimum and maximum security units on the current penitentiary grounds will remain, regardless of the future of the 1881 main penitentiary.

More options offer more wiggle room
Sen. Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, told South Dakota Searchlight that the work group’s Springfield trip, with its tour of the medium-security Mike Durfee State Prison and rundowns of the multiple vocational programs offered there to more than 1,000 inmates, was illuminating. It solidified his skepticism on the need for 100 acres or more.
The Mike Dufee campus, formerly a university, is smaller than 70 acres. The penitentiary in Sioux Falls is overcrowded by medium security inmates, Karr noted, not maximum security ones. The 1,500-bed proposal and its 100-plus acres were designed around maximum security housing units.
“I’m not convinced we need 100 acres,” Karr said. “I don’t think anybody is at this point.”
Karr’s not fully sold on any of the new proposals – there isn’t space at any of them for the ideal security perimeter, for example – but said the idea that Citibank is “almost turn-key” is appealing. 
Karr said the state should have worked harder to find sites back in 2023, instead of requesting information and waiting for offers. The work of site selection may have been more fruitful if it had included the kind of public forums now taking place with Project Prison Reset, he said.
“This is getting vetted and discussed the way it should have been the first time around,” he said.
Prison work group peppered with public testimony in first Sioux Falls meeting

Other options include multiple undeveloped properties with 100 acres or more in the Sioux Falls area, most presented for sale on a per-acre basis. 
There’s land at the intersection of interstates 29 and 90, a plot near Amazon’s Sioux Falls distribution center, and another near the Department of Correction’s West Farm site, home to a facility for juveniles in state custody.
The Sioux Falls Development Foundation has offered land near Worthing as another Lincoln County option, and the city of Canton pointed to tracts of land west of town.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen leads the Project Prison Reset work group. During the initial site discussions in 2023, he was still a Republican state representative for District 13 in Sioux Falls. 
He’s pleased to have so many offers, noting that the publicity surrounding the work group may have drawn more attention. 
Even so, he said, “we need to be realistic” about how the potential sales might go over with neighbors. The site obtained in 2023, he said, is still an option.
“I don’t find it particularly surprising that we have owners of land in some of these communities who are willing to offer it,” Venhuizen said.

(Photo by Julie Gammack)My mother loved pink azaleas. They had to be a particular shade of pink to be just right. Kind of a salmon color — not too pinky. On her birthday and holidays, Boesen’s the Florist would deliver just the right plant, with just the right color — unless there was a new clerk handling the order, someone who didn’t understand that the pink had to be exactly right, or there might be tears.
Growing up in Iowa, we couldn’t grow our own azaleas. They couldn’t withstand the frigid winters. So when I moved to Washington, D.C. and experienced spring — real spring, where azaleas bloom with abandon, or neatly trimmed, along sidewalks and in the yards of old neighborhoods — I was stunned.
They were everywhere. White. Deep red. And my mother’s favorite: a light coral pink.
As an aside, when I was a talk radio host, I once interviewed a U.S. senator and asked — just making small talk during a commercial break — if the azaleas were in bloom in D.C.
He fumbled. Didn’t know what an azalea was. Tried to fake it. Hysterical.
Right now, we’re in Annapolis, Maryland, living on a boat for a couple of weeks. I’m driving around running errands in this magical geography, where spring arrives earlier than it does in Des Moines. I’ve seen iris. Dogwood. And yes, azaleas — loads of them.
And in between stops, I found myself caught in the middle of a breakdown between two friends — longtime friends — and tried to mediate a fragile, unraveling relationship.
I failed.
They’re in different zones.
According to the 2023 USDA Hardiness Zone Map, Des Moines is in Zone 5b, where winter temperatures can dip to -15°F. That’s a harsh climate. Only the hardiest plants can survive there.
Annapolis, by contrast, is in Zone 8a. Here, the winters are softer. The growing season is longer. The soil more forgiving. Azaleas — my mother’s coral-pink azaleas — thrive here.
  (Photo by Julie Gammack)
Some relationships are like that. They need the right climate: the right light, the right soil, the right rhythm of warmth and cold. And some, like azaleas in Iowa — just won’t survive. You can try, but they won’t thrive. Not really.
Then sometimes, you move — or life moves you — and what once took great effort now grows all on its own. You look around, and love is blooming in yards and along sidewalks. It feels natural.
And sometimes… sometimes, you’re watching something wilt. A relationship struggling to survive the cold. The arctic blast of fierce emails sound colder than they were meant to. The texts land wrong — stripped of tone, they feel abrupt. Frigid.
Too frigid to survive.
I told one of them, “I wish I had a magic wand. I wish I could wave it and make peace between you.”
But I don’t. I just know what it’s like to experience life in both zones.

Demand for electricity in the Northwest could double by 2046, according to a new energy forecast from regional experts.
During the next two decades, demand could increase by between 1.8% and 3.1% annually, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council heard Tuesday. The projected growth will come primarily from companies building more data centers in the region, more electric vehicles on roads, electrifying buildings, computer chip manufacturing and the production of “green hydrogen” created by running an electrical current through water to split the molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.
 

Council staff presented the 20-year forecast for electricity demand in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and western Montana Tuesday to the council’s eight, governor-appointed members. Each state’s governor gets to appoint two representatives.
“The data centers, naturally in our forecasts, are the very early load growth driver here. They’re the big driver of near term demand,” Steven Simmons, senior energy forecasting analyst, told the council. Energy demand from data centers and from all electric vehicles in the region are expected to be equal by 2046, and demand from EVs is likely to surpass data center demand after 2046, Simmons said.
Residential and commercial demand, which includes forecasted energy demand for electric vehicle charging at homes and buildings, but does not include data centers, is expected to grow more gradually. Demand for residential and commercial energy in Washington alone will equal the combined demand from those sectors in Oregon, Idaho and Montana during the next two decades.
The energy forecast, part of the council’s forthcoming 9th Northwest Regional Power Plan to manage demand, does not yet include some possible variables that could reduce future demand, such as improved energy efficiency in cars, buildings and some industries as a response to demand, as well as growing adoption of rooftop solar on residential and commercial buildings.
But rapidly growing demand now means electricity grids in the Northwest and across the U.S. are encountering transmission constraints, and scaling infrastructure to meet demand has been slow due to supply chain delays and issues, staff said.
  Data centers 

Council staff expect the biggest growth in data center and computer chip energy demand will occur in eastern Oregon, eastern Washington, and the Portland and Boise metro areas, based on historical trends and announced projects.
There are more than 100 data centers in Oregon, according to the company Data Center Map, and there are more than 5,000 data centers throughout the U.S. according to Statista — the most in any country.
Oregon’s data center market is the fifth largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and X, formerly named Twitter, have massive data centers in eastern Oregon as well as in The Dalles, Hillsboro and Prineville.
  What’s next 

To develop its next power plan, the council will evaluate supply side resources, including the potential for more regional windfarms, utility-scale and small-scale solar installations, better battery storage and more geothermal and fracked gas sources, among other options.
The council has published regional power plans about every five years since 1983, to lay out how the region will maintain an affordable and adequate power supply. A draft of the plan, an update from the last one that was published in 2021, is expected to be ready for public review and input by July 2026 and would be finalized by late 2026, according to council spokesperson Peter Jensen.
The Northwest Power and Conservation Council was formed in 1981 following passage of the federal Northwest Power Act. That act directed the four states to work collaboratively on regional energy planning and to stop the decline of native Columbia Basin fish species that have suffered massive population losses during the last century, primarily from the development of hydroelectric dams in the region.
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek in February appointed two new Oregon representatives to the council: Margaret Hoffmann, of Bend, and Chuck Sams, of Pendleton. Hoffman is the former Oregon director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development program and energy adviser to former Oregon Govs. John Kitzhaber and Kate Brown.

Within the first 72 hours, farmers start depopulating, an industry term for killing contaminated flocks.
Despite the sweltering heat inside the barns, hired workers wear gloves, face masks and other protective equipment and repetitively pick up flailing, sick chickens and place them into a metal container filled with carbon dioxide. In a few minutes, the chickens are dead.
In other cases, workers seal the barn doors and crank up the temperature, causing the birds to die from heat stroke, or flood the barn with a suffocating foam. In a few hours, most of the chickens are dead and workers begin to haul thousands, if not millions, of lifeless caracasses out to dump trucks.
The stench of death seeps into workers’ clothes, sweat and even the water they’re supposed to shower in.
This is the business of killing chickens during the ongoing bird flu epidemic. And business is booming.
As the virus spreads and drives up grocery prices by shrinking the nation’s supply of eggs and meat, bird disposal companies, environmental waste businesses and large poultry producers have received millions of federal dollars to kill flocks, compost their bodies and clean barns across the country.
However, the scale and urgency of these recent depopulation events have left room for worker protections to fall through the cracks, Investigate Midwest has found.
A review of thousands of pages of state depopulation inspection records and conversations with dozens of people who work behind the scenes has revealed:


Underage workers, in some cases, have been hired to kill poultry flocks, handle dead carcasses and clean industrial poultry farms.
Workers sometimes lack personal protective equipment or receive damaged gear, despite the risk of the virus jumping from animals to people.
Dealing with a federal backlog, some farms have used killing methods considered inhumane because it can be quicker and cheaper.


“The biggest factor in agricultural safety is the urgency,” said Bethany Alcauter, director of research and public health for the National Center for Farmworker Health, a Texas-based nonprofit that advocates for worker safety and health. “Everything has to get done in a short amount of time and that really can be problematic because there’s not the same amount of time to adequately train workers.”
The current bird flu outbreak is also the first time in the nation’s history that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has put a single federal contractor in charge of responding to outbreaks when a business or state agriculture department can’t handle a farm’s depopulation request.

In the past, the USDA would train emergency response contractors across the country to deal with outbreaks in their state and region.
This practice changed with the most recent outbreak when the USDA awarded a contract to Patriot Environmental Services to be the single provider of federal depopulation services.
The use of a single federal contractor has caused delays when a farm requests assistance from the federal government to depopulate a flock, according to depopulation consultants, veterinarians and state agriculture agencies interviewed.
  An excerpt of an email exchange between reporter John McCracken and CDPHE spokesperson David Ellenberger regarding the results of a CDPHE farmworker survey.

No interpreters. No PPE. Just blood stains and feathers.
In July 2024, hundreds of workers descended on two poultry farms in rural Colorado, an hour northeast of Denver, to kill over 3 million egg-laying chickens.
Two of the state’s largest egg companies had tested positive for bird flu and their flocks needed to be destroyed.
Officials with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), the USDA and the Centers for Disease Control were onsite at both outbreaks to monitor for symptoms of human exposure to the virus and to spot behavioral health concerns — that is, the psychological impact of performing high-volume animal killings in hazardous, often distressing conditions.
CDPHE forms obtained by Investigate Midwest through public records requests show agency workers interviewing primarily Spanish-speaking workers. A behavioral health worker wrote in a daily report that USDA staff approached farm management and asked if they could meet with full-time farm employees to discuss working conditions, to which management said “absolutely not.”

“They did not have the ability to go to the workers with us and did not have anyone who could be an interpreter for us,” the behavioral health worker wrote in a report, referring to USDA employees onsite.
A separate behavioral health official wrote that they witnessed workers with torn or missing PPE, PPE not being utilized, and saw “animal matter, including blood stains and feathers” on workers’ torn PPE.

The same behavioral health official noted that culling and disposal workers were required to shower at the entrance and exit of the barn, but workers said several people were not showering because the “water has a dead chicken smell” and “the horrible smell stays on the skin.”
One of the July 2024 outbreaks was at an Opal Foods commercial egg facility in Roggen, Colorado, where 1.8 million egg-laying hens were killed. Opal is a private company headquartered in Neosho, Missouri, and partially owned by Indiana-based Rose Acre Farms, the nation’s second-largest egg production company.
Opal Foods has received $24 million in payments from the USDA to cover the cost of the lost flocks since 2022, a federal response known as “indemnity payments.”
The other outbreak occurred at Morning Fresh Farms, half an hour away in Platteville, Colorado, where 1.2 million egg-laying chickens were killed. Morning Fresh is a subsidiary of Versova Holding, the nation’s fifth-largest egg-production company, which employs more than 2,000 people and purchased Morning Fresh in 2023.
Morning Fresh received nearly $7 million in indemnity payments in 2022 and 2023, but federal data does not list them, or their parent company as a recipient of funds in 2024.
Depopulation workers on both farms spent hours each day picking up chickens, putting them in metal rolling carts and filling the carts with carbon dioxide.
This process subdues and kills the birds in a few minutes but poses a danger to workers because of the repeated exposure chicken handlers have to sick birds, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, a nonprofit that set guidelines for depopulation methods with the USDA in 2019.

Underage labor flagged during bird flu response in Colorado
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment employees surveyed contract workers at both Colorado facilities to monitor for symptoms of bird flu and in a subsequent report, the Centers for Diseases Control showed workers self-identifying as young as 15.
The Colorado Youth Employment Opportunity Act prevents workers under 18 from performing hazardous work such as euthanasia and disposal of animal carcasses unless performed in certain programs, such as student-learning initiatives, agricultural education opportunities like 4-H, and work apprenticeship training, according to a department spokesperson.
The Colorado health agency confirmed with Investigate Midwest that workers under the age of 18 were present based on self-reported answers to survey questions and conversations with farm staff. The department did not provide the specific ages of workers, citing state privacy records laws.
Investigate Midwest also received records through the Freedom of Information Act for Occupational Health and Safety Administration, or OSHA, inspections done at both facilities in July and August 2024.
The records included the names of four contract labor companies interviewed by OSHA, two of which matched company names provided by the Colorado Department of Public Health.
All four contract labor companies denied using employees under the age of 18.
Aaron Garcia, owner of Atlas Labor and Staffing Solutions, which was hired during the Colorado outbreak, said his company and other contractors were working at both egg farms around the same time, given their proximity to each other and similar outbreak timeframes.
Garcia said he has heard of agriculture contract companies hiring underage workers throughout the bird flu epidemic, but his company has not done so.
He said his company, based in Iowa, was paid to provide laborers who cleaned and disinfected barns and provide laundry services for workers’ uniforms. For a few days, his crew picked up dead birds and placed them in disposal trucks. He said all of his workers’ ages were verified through federal E-Verify services.
“It’s illegal, in the first place, and it does affect the reputation of the guys that are actually trying to do it right and follow the laws,” he said.
Brian Mouw, a manager with D&H Poultry Services based in Sibley, Iowa, who was contracted to work at Opal Foods during the July 2024 outbreak, said all of their employees’ ages are verified before being hired.

“The other 200-275 people were with three other contractors hired by Opal, it could’ve been them,” he said in an email to Investigate Midwest. “They didn’t work under us.”
Khali Depardo, chief operating officer at 5280 Staffing, a Colorado-based staffing agency listed on OSHA documents as a contractor for Morning Fresh Farms, said his company “does not hire anyone under the age of 18, at any time.”
A spokesperson for Express Employment Professionals, an Oklahoma-based staffing agency also listed as a contractor in OSHA documents, said its Greeley, Colorado, office does contract work with Morning Fresh Farms but was not contracted to provide labor related to bird flu depopulation.
“Express Employment Professionals of Greeley, CO., has not employed individuals under 18 years old at Morning Fresh Farms,” the staffing agency spokesperson said in an email.

Investigate Midwest provided its findings of potential underage workers and their tasks to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment. An agency spokesperson said it was unaware of any underage labor working on commercial egg farms.
“Without a full investigation, we are unable to definitively determine whether the work at issue was ‘hazardous’ under Colorado law, and if so was otherwise permissible, and we cannot opine on federal law as that is outside of our authority,” the spokesperson said.

Asked about the Colorado case, a U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson said it “is not clear” whether the specific case violates federal laws.

Federal child labor regulations prohibit workers under the age of 16 from conducting certain hazardous tasks while working on farms, such as working with pesticides and chemicals, but makes no mention of the gases and tactics used to kill poultry during depopulation.
The commercial egg companies behind culling events in July of 2024 denied the use of child labor as well as the hiring of contractors who used child labor.
“Morning Fresh Farms holds the highest standards for ensuring all employees are eligible to work,” a company spokesperson said in a statement provided to Investigate Midwest. “Our company has no awareness of any underage labor issues by contracting companies working on our farm during our response to highly pathogenic avian influenza.”
Versova Holdings, parent company to Morning Fresh Farms, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
“Opal Foods, LLC is a separate, independent company in which Rose Acre Farms has partial ownership,” said a spokesperson for Rose Acre Farms, parent company of Opal Foods. “We do not know all the details nor can we speak to Opal Foods’ internal operations, but Rose Acre Farms is not aware of any instances of underage hiring at Opal Foods, LLC. You should however direct your questions regarding this issue to Opal Foods.”
Opal Foods did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The USDA’s one-contractor system. Efficient or overloaded?
Over 168 million birds have been depopulated in the U.S. since early 2022, the majority of which have been at commercial operations. When a flock is killed, the USDA can compensate producers for the loss of revenue and the cost to depopulate.
Currently, operators are paid a flat fee for depopulation and disposal fees, regardless of whether the farm handles the killing on their own or hires a contractor. Producers are reimbursed $1.62 per bird for egg-laying chickens, $2.95 per meat chickens, $4.50 for turkeys and just over $5 per duck, as of February 2025, according to USDA documents.
When a farm doesn’t have the resources or money to kill a flock on its own, the state’s agriculture department is contacted. If the state does not have access to equipment or labor, a USDA-approved contract company steps in and kills the birds.
Patriot Environmental Services is the nation’s only federal contractor able to provide depopulation services when requested by the USDA.
The company is a subsidiary of the national environmental cleanup company Crystal-Clean and is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, with 18 locations across the country.
Parent company Crystal-Clean works with oil spills and waste management and is owned by the private equity firm J.F. Lehman & Company. Crystal-Clean was fined $1.1 million in 2023 by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for failure to have proper permitting and handling of hazardous waste materials.

Patriot Environmental Services has received more than $18 million in USDA poultry depopulation contracts since the beginning of the most recent outbreak, a figure that accounts for nearly a quarter of all depopulation contracts, technical assistance payments, research and grant funding related to bird flu funded by the federal government.
This money has been paid to private companies, state agencies, universities and research groups related to poultry depopulation.
Federal contracts and grants related to poultry depopulation during the ongoing outbreak have exceeded the total amount spent during the 2014 to 2015 outbreak of bird flu, from $68 million to $73 million and counting.

In some states, poultry producers receive technical training from the state department of agriculture on proper depopulation methods and previously, the USDA would train emergency response companies across the country to handle outbreaks, according to Dan Hougentogler, an emergency response and depopulation consultant with nearly two decades of experience in the animal disease outbreak and research industry.
This practice changed with the most recent outbreak when the USDA awarded a contract to Patriot Environmental Services to be the single provider of federal depopulation services.
Hougentogler said this switch has caused a bottleneck when multiple farms need access to the federal services at the same time.
A common depopulation tactic is to fill barns with suffocating foam and Patriot Environmental Services is the only company that can access the federal foaming equipment, he said.

A state agency located in the same area as the national equipment has to wait for Patriot Environmental Services to deploy a team and use the equipment, even if they have staff trained to operate the equipment, he continued.
“Not having an expansive, trained network to operate this federal equipment, or allowing states to utilize the equipment that’s just sitting here with minimal people to use it, does cause some concern,” Hougentogler said.
The nation’s largest poultry companies do not typically use a third party for depopulation services, according to a spokesperson for the National Chicken Council, an industry advocacy group whose board members include executive leaders of several major poultry processors.
The U.S. Poultry & Egg Association, whose members include leadership at Rose Acre Foods, Versova and Cal-Maine Foods, said its members follow all guidelines set by the American Veterinary Medical Association and referred questions to the USDA.
The USDA, Patriot Environmental Services and Crystal-Clean did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
In some cases, the backlog has caused companies to use more controversial methods of depopulation because they do not have the equipment or labor on hand to complete the killings in the needed time frame.
Hougentogler said he was aware of turkey farms that used “less appropriate methods” when they couldn’t access the federal contracts in time. He noted an example where a turkey farm used ventilation shutdown and heat, referred to in the industry as VSD+, to depopulate a flock of commercial poultry.
VSD+ is a controversial method of killing animals, but is currently accepted by industry standards set by the American Veterinary Medical Association.
The USDA and the AVMA note that VSD+ is to be used only in “constrained circumstances,” but the majority of birds killed during the ongoing outbreak have been killed using ventilation shutdown.

Workers close off the circulation of air and seal entrances to barns with ventilation shutdown, oftentimes adding extra heating units to increase the temperature.

“Ultimately, the goal is to have the production system and the state veterinarian agree on what is best for both the production system and animal welfare,” Hougentogler said. “We are depopulating the animal regardless, but until they are unconscious, we should still take as much care for them as possible.”
Utah state veterinarian Amanda Price told Investigate Midwest that the state was able to receive help from the federal contractor Patriot Environmental Services when requested, but some instances were delayed by a few days. This resulted in farms using ventilation shutdown in an effort to stay within target time frames meant to prevent virus spread.
Crystal Heath, a California-based veterinarian and co-founder of Our Honor, a nonprofit group of veterinarian members that advocate against using ventilation shutdowns in the U.S., said that ventilation shutdown is a cruel method to kill flocks.
The practice is banned in the European Union and has been criticized for its cruelty to animals in both commercial pork and poultry depopulation.










“If producers are going to get bailout money, they should put plans in place to depopulate with less cruel methods.”


– Crystal Heath, veterinarian and co-founder of Our Honor


“If (producers) are going to get bailout money, they should put plans in place to depopulate with less cruel methods,” Heath said.
The American Veterinary Medical Association is currently reviewing proposals to update its depopulation guidance and is expected to announce changes later this year. The AVMA did not respond to a request for comment.
McDonald’s egg supplier kills millions of birds in Michigan with VSD+
Once a farm has depopulated its flock, the work isn’t over.
Carcasses, feed, eggs, manure, and other organic materials are gathered and composted or disposed of, a process that requires a fleet of equipment and workers.
Michigan, a state with 31 confirmed cases of bird flu in dairy cattle herds, has had 16 commercial poultry farms infected with bird flu since 2022, with more than 7 million birds killed.
Most birds killed in Michigan were at egg-laying commercial farms using the ventilation shutdown method, according to USDA data.
“Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) isn’t going to discuss details about the responses done on individual farms as most of that information is protected by Michigan law,” MDARD Director Tim Boring said in a statement provided to Investigate Midwest in response to questions about the use of ventilation shutdown.
“At every facility, we are balancing multiple priorities; including, but not limited to, stopping the spread of the disease, animal welfare, practicality given the structure, and of course safety of the people involved,” the statement continued.
Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development HPAI activity logs obtained via public records requests.
Documents obtained through records requests from the Michigan Department of Agriculture show Herbruck’s Poultry Ranch, the state’s largest egg-producer and supplier of eggs to McDonald’s, disposing of dozens of dump trucks filled with chickens by the day during a depopulation that occurred in April 2024.
Records referred to Herbruck trucks hauling caracasses to be composted at an outbreak site named “IO 02,” which is a reference to “Ionia 02.” This was the site of an April 2022 depopulation event that killed 2.1 million egg-laying chickens.
Herbrucks used ventilation shutdown to kill the flock, based on USDA depopulation data and references to renting and using “heaters” made in the daily logs filled out by staff on site.
Daily worker logs describe days where 55 loads of dead chickens and other material were hauled off the farms to be composted or sent to a landfill.
Contracted environmental waste companies, composting companies, labor and disinfecting crews hauled dead birds and contaminated materials to nearby landfills as well as composted the dead carcassess.
Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development HPAI activity logs obtained via public records requests.
Composting the bodies of birds infected with bird flu is a common practice in disposal and requires all organic material to reach an internal temperature of at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit for three days in order to kill the virus and other pathogens.
Contaminated feed, manure, bodies, eggs and other waste are stacked into large mounds, monitored for internal temperatures and eventually spread back onto land as fertilization.
Herbruck, which received $89 million in indemnity payments for the flocks killed by VSD+, was part of fast-food giant McDonald’s push for cage-free eggs and the decision to “prioritize the health and welfare of the animals,” according to a 2024 company press release.
Herbruck announced it was laying off hundreds of workers in Michigan a month after its 2024 bird flu outbreak.
Mohamed Mousa, Herbruck vice president, declined to answer questions about the company’s depopulation events and bird flu outbreaks. In an email, Mousa said the company does not have a media contact and is trying to “move on.”

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.

“I urge Nevadans to access their accounts on 23andMe’s website and consider deleting their shared genetic data in order to ensure their privacy. 23andMe has indicated they will continue to honor such actions, and users should make use of this option as soon as possible.” – Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, in a statement on March 26

23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
States Battle Big Tech Over Data Privacy Laws

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Nevada, Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“I urge Nevadans to access their accounts on 23andMe’s website and consider deleting their shared genetic data in order to ensure their privacy. 23andMe has indicated they will continue to honor such actions, and users should make use of this option as soon as possible,” Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
DNA Databases Are Boon to Police But Menace to Privacy, Critics Say

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.

“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”

Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Blue and red states slash taxes despite warnings of hard times ahead

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

DemasMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office made nearly 2,000 pages of election documents public Friday after providing them to a legislative oversight committee.
The Michigan Department of State materials include training newsletters sent to clerks, the clerk training accreditation manual and the Election Day “flip chart” manual used by election workers at the polls.
Combined with documents previously released to the committee, there are now more than 3,000 pages of election documents available on the department’s website.
A press release from the department said it will continue to release additional materials after reviewing them to redact any sensitive information that it says could compromise election security.
“Everyone at the Michigan Department of State is committed to transparency and openness to the people we serve,” said Khyla Craine, the department’s chief legal director. “We are also committed to protecting sensitive information which, if publicly released, could be used by bad actors to interfere with the chain of custody of ballots, tamper with election equipment, or impersonate a clerk on Election Day.”
But Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), who chairs the House Election Integrity Committee, said the documents provided so far have primarily been newsletters that do not match the training materials requested by legislators.
“Leave it to our Secretary of State to ‘transparently’ dump 1,900 pages of the wrong stuff on a Friday afternoon,” Smit said. “We will conduct a thorough review of everything her department released today. But, after sifting through the information for several hours, we’ve yet to see much of the substantive training materials we requested. Secretary Benson knows what we are asking for, and she [is] refusing to give us access anyway.”
Benson’s office says reviewing the documents has “required hundreds of hours and cost thousands of taxpayer dollars to review and produce.”
While the House Oversight Committee voted last month to issue a subpoena for the documents, the department says it will “continue to release additional materials to the Committee and on the public site once the department’s legal and election security teams are able to review them and redact any sensitive information that could compromise election security.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_0978-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

The effort to make Canada the 14th colony had proved a failure. Although it was never a colony, Vermont, not Canada, would become the 14th state.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Ethan and Ira’s Canadian debacles.","American General Richard Montgomery was honored with poems, pamphlets, monuments and paintings after his death at the Battle of Quebec in 1775. John Trumbull’s romanticized depiction of Montgomery’s death is in the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery. Photo via Wikimedia CommonsIf Ethan and Ira Allen had their way, Canada would have been America’s 14th colony. The Allen brothers were hardly alone in pushing to have Canada join the United States. In 1774, delegates to the First Continental Congress, including Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, published an open letter to the Province of Quebec, urging Canadians to join their struggle against the British government. All they heard back was crickets.So the following year, the Allens joined more than 3,000 other colonists to try a different approach with Canada — invasion. The belief was that if the colonists made a show of force, then French Canadians, who represented a majority of European settlers in the region, would rise up against their British overlords. This Canadian-American alliance would deprive Britain of a staging area for invading the United Colonies. (This was so early in the war that the name “United States of America” hadn’t yet been coined.) It would also significantly expand the landmass and population of the Colonies. The invasion, however, would turn disastrous for the colonists, and Ethan in particular. Ethan was full of confidence in 1775 — when was he ever lacking in confidence? — because in May he had led troops in America’s first offensive victory of the war by capturing Fort Ticonderoga on the New York shore of Lake Champlain. Actually, he jointly led forces that night — working beside Benedict Arnold, who was perhaps America’s most effective officer before turning traitor. Also, the fort was crumbling and only lightly defended by British troops who had no warning an attack might come. Still, this was an important American success and made the 37-year-old Ethan Allen a household name. After capturing the fort, Arnold acted on news that a British sloop was anchored at the north end of the lake near Saint-Jean (St. Johns), Quebec. He hoped to seize it before news of Ticonderoga’s fall spread. Boarding a schooner stolen from a prominent Tory, Arnold and his crew captured the sloop without firing a shot. For good measure, they burned several smaller boats and raided supplies from the fort at Saint-Jean. Arnold declared, “At present, we are Masters of the Lake.” As the main route between British Canada and the Colonies, the lake was strategically invaluable.Sailing south with their prize, Arnold’s force encountered a group of four boats paddling north. The 100 weary men aboard the boats had been hurriedly organized by Ethan, so hastily, in fact, that they lacked sufficient rations. Nevertheless, Ethan seemed eager to outdo Arnold, announcing that his motley crew would take the town of Saint-Jean. Arnold tried to talk Ethan out of this rash plan. He failed.“100 mad fellows are going to take possession of St. John’s,” Arnold later wrote in his journal. “… A wild, impractical expensive Scheme. Of no Consequence.”And little chance of success. Ethan’s flotilla reached Saint-Jean after dark. The exhausted men secured their boats and promptly fell asleep on the riverbank. By then, 200 British soldiers had reinforced the town. At dawn, Ethan’s men were jolted awake by the sound of cannons firing from the opposite shore. Clearly outnumbered and outgunned, Ethan and his men retreated, hastily. Leaping into their boats and paddling out of range, they abandoned three of their compatriots, one of whom was captured. The other two walked the 100 miles south to Ticonderoga. Ethan Allen, here depicted in a sculpture at the U.S. Capitol by Vermont artist Larkin Mead, was captured in 1775 while trying to seize Montreal with a small force. Photo via Wikimedia CommonsThat summer Ethan returned to Canada, this time as a scout for the American army. His Green Mountain Boys had transformed into the Green Mountain Rangers, a regiment in the Continental Army. As part of the reorganization, troops elected the level-headed Seth Warner to lead them. Perhaps fearing Ethan’s recklessness, they opted not to give him a leadership role. His brothers Ira and Heman, however, were named as officers.  Ethan proved effective as a scout, moving freely behind enemy lines, recruiting French-Canadians and members of the native population to fight the British during the coming American offensive. “I … have two hundred and fifty Canadians under arms; as I march, they gather fast,” Ethan reported to invasion commander Gen. Richard Montgomery. He sent most of the men to Montgomery, but still had nearly 100 with him when he decided to improvise — he would lead the capture of Montreal. Working with Major John Brown, who had about 200 recruits of his own, Ethan devised a plan to use their forces to simultaneously attack Montreal from opposite directions, even though Montgomery had given no such orders. In fact, the general thought Saint-Jean a more valuable target. The assault was a fiasco. On Sept. 25, Ethan’s force descended on Montreal from the north, but the signal from Brown indicating that his men were in position to the south never came. Gen. Guy Carleton, the governor of the province of Quebec, rallied a force of Canadian, British and native fighters and advanced on the invaders. Ethan and 38 of his men were captured. He would spend the next two and a half years a prisoner of war. “I thought to have enrolled my name in the list of illustrious American heroes,” Ethan later wrote of that day, “but was nipped in the bud.”Earlier that month, Ira Allen attained a position of trust, when Gen. Montgomery selected him to serve as a lieutenant on his staff. Ira was only 24 years old. At the time, Montgomery was beginning a siege on Fort Saint-Jean. Critical to the operation’s success was keeping Carleton’s forces trapped in Montreal, a task that fell partly to the Green Mountain Rangers. The commander of Fort Saint-Jean, realizing that reinforcements from Montreal would never arrive, surrendered on Nov. 3. The Americans quickly moved on to their next target, Montreal. Believing the town undefendable against this larger force, Carleton withdrew his troops and headed to Quebec City and its imposing citadel, located some 150 miles to the northeast. This time, the Americans took Montreal without a fight. Next, they would seize Quebec City.Ira traveled with the Continental Army to Quebec City along the St. Lawrence River. There Montgomery planned to rendezvous with Benedict Arnold and 1,100 Continental Army troops who were trekking to Quebec through the woods of what is now northern Maine. When Montgomery’s troops reached Quebec City on Dec. 1, a shocking sight awaited them. Having marched, rowed and portaged all the way from Boston, Arnold’s force was a shadow of its former self. Desertion, disease and death had thinned its ranks to about 600. Those remaining were ragged, hungry and desperately short of supplies. Anticipating that Arnold’s men would need resupplying, though perhaps not to this extent, Montgomery had brought winter clothing and provisions. Despite the poor condition of the troops and having only about 1,200 men to the Quebec citadel’s 1,800 defenders, Montgomery and Arnold stuck with the plan. When Carleton rejected a call to surrender, the Americans bombarded the town with the few mortars and cannons they possessed. Montgomery knew he couldn’t mount a successful siege; he lacked sufficient artillery and the frozen ground made it impossible for his men to dig trenches. So he planned an assault.Ira Allen, depicted here later in life, was a 24 year old when he served as an officer in the Continental Army’s invasion of Canada in 1775. Photo via the Silver Special Collections Library, University of VermontThe Americans wanted to attack on a snowy night to conceal their approach. But the weather refused to cooperate. Finally, on the night of Dec. 27, it began to snow. As the Americans assembled for the assault, however, the sky cleared and the moon lit up the night. Montgomery postponed the attack, but he had only days to act. Arnold’s troops’ enlistments were due to expire at midnight on Dec. 31, leaving the men free to return home and effectively cutting the American force in half.  It must have seemed a good omen when it began to snow on the afternoon of Dec. 30. At 2 a.m. on Dec. 31, the Americans gathered for the assault. By this point, however, the snowstorm had become a blizzard, with snow drifting to two and three feet. Ira Allen was one of two officers leading an attack on Cape Diamond, the southern corner of the town’s wall perched atop a steep bluff. But this was just a diversion. When his unit began its attack, Ira lit rockets to cue the main strike force, led by Montgomery, to launch its attack on fortifications in the Lower Town. After helping carpenters cut through a wooden palisade fence, Montgomery led his men forward, breaking into a run with his sword drawn. As the group rounded a turn in the street, the town’s defenders fired a cannon loaded with grapeshot at the attackers. A dozen men were killed by the hail of small iron balls, including Montgomery. One of the few members of the storming party to survive was Capt. Aaron Burr.With their leader dead, the Americans fell into disarray and retreated. The battle was a rout. Against the 19 British and Canadian casualties, the Americans had 60 men killed or wounded and more than 400 captured. The Americans hunkered down outside Quebec’s walls and waited through the bitter Canadian winter in hopes that the Colonies were sending reinforcements. Ira Allen remained in the American army camp until February. Then, seeing the futility of the situation, he began the trek home. Reinforcements arrived in May, but they were British troops. Their arrival persuaded the remaining American soldiers it was time to head home. They carried with them memories of a scarring defeat and a raging epidemic of smallpox that had erupted in the camp. The effort to make Canada the 14th colony had proved a failure. Although it was never a colony, Vermont, not Canada, would become the 14th state.Gen. Richard Montgomery’s death made him an international hero. Congress commissioned a memorial in his honor, pamphleteer Thomas Paine and poet Anna Eliza Bleecker wrote of him, and members of the British Parliament even praised his valour. In Vermont, Ira Allen honored him by successfully lobbying for a town to be named after him.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Ethan and Ira’s Canadian debacles.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The_Death_of_General_Montgomery_in_the_Attack_on_Quebec_December_31_1775-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

The Legislature is maintaining its self-imposed climate obligations while simultaneously acknowledging that their proposed solutions are both impractical and too expensive.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sec. Julie Moore and Commissioner Kerrick Johnson: Unfunded laws have only theoretical benefits.","This commentary is by Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, and Kerrick Johnson, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service.Vermont’s Global Warming Solutions Act and Climate Superfund Act (Act 122) have created legal mandates, but — so far — the Legislature has not provided the necessary funding for this work. Without action from the Legislature in the near term, it is not clear how these laws can be implemented effectively, with potentially costly consequences. It is simply unwise to take a wait-and-see approach, as has been suggested by several legislators, knowing full well that more resources are needed to successfully execute the ambitious vision of these acts.In 2020, the Vermont Legislature passed the Global Warming Solutions Act over Gov. Phil Scott’s veto. This significant legislation created legal mandates to reduce climate pollution and established a “right of action” allowing special interests to sue state government if Vermont fails to meet these self-imposed obligations.Over the last two years, the Legislature identified two different policy approaches to raise the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to meet the mandates of the GWSA and directed the evaluation of both: a clean heat standard and a cap-and-invest framework. Unfortunately, independent, nonpartisan analyses found both schemes to be administratively complex, ill-timed and expensive.Given these concerns, legislative leaders have understandably been reluctant to move forward with implementing either policy. However, legislators have also not advanced — or even discussed — other approaches to supporting the work needed to meet the GWSA’s mandates. A bill, H.289, would have helped with these challenges, but has not been meaningfully addressed by the Legislature. In other words, the Legislature is maintaining its self-imposed climate obligations while simultaneously acknowledging that their proposed solutions are both impractical and too expensive.A similar pattern is evident with the Climate Superfund Act passed in 2024. This legislation was designed to allow Vermont to recover certain climate-related costs from oil companies. As required by the act, the Agency of Natural Resources and state treasurer delivered a report in January detailing the resources needed to advance this complex work: $1.2 million in contracted support and two additional staff positions dedicated to the work and anticipated legal challenges.Gov. Scott allowed Act 122 to become law without his signature and specifically acknowledged the report-back and the ability to reassess based on the feedback provided by ANR and the Treasurer’s Office. Despite receiving this report and supporting testimony, the House-backed budget did not include critical funding for this work.It is imperative that the Legislature either prioritize the full funding to complete necessary technical studies or repeal the mandates in Act 122. To date they have done neither, perhaps believing that funding this work is somehow optional. It is not.Failing to fund the work required by the GWSA and the Climate Superfund Act makes it more difficult to achieve the goals of the legislation. It also undermines confidence in public policy, increases climate anxiety, can lead to burnout, and diverts scarce resources from reducing climate pollution and improving resiliency to extreme weather to responding to litigation — litigation that has already begun.We are sympathetic to the position lawmakers are in — this was a bold approach and it’s hard to acknowledge that plans pushed through over a gubernatorial veto were too ambitious in schedule and unaffordable to implement.The principles that underpin GWSA and the Climate Superfund Act are important, and it is in the best interest of Vermonters to ensure that this work is successful. Realizing these outcomes, however, requires more than simply enacting idealistic laws — it requires working together to design achievable, properly funded initiatives rather than marching toward impractical requirements.Importantly, there are many concrete actions — including maintaining current, unprecedented levels of investments in things like weatherization and electric vehicle charging infrastructure — that can and should be undertaken this session. Action on these measures keeps Vermont at the forefront of climate action while avoiding the pitfalls of unfunded mandates, including those that leave space for unnecessary and counterproductive legal challenges.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sec.

Show the state and the country that Rutland will not stand by while its most vulnerable residents are abandoned.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Leslie Burg: Rutland can’t afford to lose Head Start, or the programs that keep us together.","This commentary is by Leslie Burg of Manchester. She is a community member of the Rutland Head Start Policy Council and an emerita professor of literacy and disabilities at Northeastern University.Rutland is a city that represents the best of what it means to be American: hardworking, community-minded and resilient. But right now, we are facing a crisis that could upend the lives of hundreds of local families — and leave an already stretched community reeling. The Trump administration has proposed eliminating all federal funding for Head Start in its 2026 budget. If this budget moves forward, it will not only devastate Rutland County Head Start — it will also trigger a ripple effect across countless essential services in our region. Let me be clear: Head Start is not “just child care.” It is a lifeline. Our program currently serves 69 of Rutland’s most vulnerable infants, toddlers and preschoolers — all from families living at or below the poverty line. For $1.9 million in federal support, Rutland receives a comprehensive, wraparound support system that includes: • Family stabilization — Rutland County Head Start Director Donna Barrow has told me that 25% of our families are homeless and 50% are navigating mental health needs. • Developmental screenings — Barrow also says that 25% of children we serve receive special education support because we caught early warning signs. • Health and nutrition — Many of our children would not eat consistently without the meals and snacks we provide daily. • Job security for parents — Without our program, working parents — mostly in low-wage jobs — would lose their ability to earn an income. We’ve spent over 30 years building a program that works. It’s efficient, effective and deeply rooted in the needs of this community. If the proposed cuts go through, this entire system collapses overnight. And not just ours. Other local programs — those that support domestic violence survivors, provide mental health services, house the unhoused and deliver early intervention care — are also dependent on fragile federal and state funding streams. Many are already stretched to the breaking point. If one piece falls, others will be forced to fill the void with fewer resources and greater need. The cost will not only be measured in dollars, but in the toll on families, frontline workers and the long-term health of our city.We’re already seeing the warning signs: Families living in cars and tents. Parents with not enough food for their family. Children poisoned by lead, left untested until they show signs of learning delays. Teachers and staff — some of them parents themselves — facing the threat of losing their homes if our program disappears. This is not hypothetical. This is already happening. And without action, it’s about to get much worse. It doesn’t have to be this way. Rutland has the power to respond — together. We need our elected officials, local leaders, business owners, nonprofit partners and neighbors to come together and push back. We must tell our stories. Write letters. Make calls. Organize. Show the state and the country that Rutland will not stand by while its most vulnerable residents are abandoned. This is not just about Head Start. It’s about every program that helps keep our community whole. It’s about the belief that every child, regardless of ZIP code or income level, deserves a fair start. The attack on Rutland’s Head Start program is close and personal to us. However, we need to understand that this is taking place across our country. Programs intended to help our most vulnerable, children, families, the disabled and our elderly, are being defunded and strategically destroyed.Programs intended to benefit America’s middle-class — i.e. Pell grants so high school students who wish to can afford to go on to college, and, yes, Social Security — are being stripped and sold for parts. And the list goes on. The eroding of our institutions and programs that support the health and welfare of all Americans has but one objective — to weaken them until they ultimately collapse, taking our federal government with them, opening the door to an oligarchic dictatorship, erasing everything America has stood for over the past 250 years. Rutland has to speak out, opposing the elimination of our Head Start program, so essential to our community. However, we also have to recognize the danger to our country as a whole, and make our voices heard while we can. The kind of future those currently in power have for America will find us in a country we no longer recognize and don’t want to live in. We must speak out now, before we lose the rights we take for granted and our voices are silenced.This is not just about Head Start. It’s about every program that helps keep our communities and our country whole. It’s about the belief that every child, regardless of ZIP code or income level, deserves a fair start and that every American deserves a fair shake. If you’re reading this and wondering how to help — start by speaking up. Talk to your neighbors. Share this story. Contact your representatives. Demand that programs like Head Start, and the many others serving families in crisis, be protected and fully funded. Rutland is stronger when we stand together. Let’s raise our voices before it’s too late.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Leslie Burg: Rutland can’t afford to lose Head Start, or the programs that keep us together.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

Photo by Ian Kreinsen/The CitizenThis story by Ian Kreinsen was first published in The Citizen on May 1.Marianna Holzer leafed through a carefully bound photo book that tells her family’s story.On one side of her family, her Swiss grandfather passed the bookbinding tradition on to his son, who passed it on to her. On the other side, her German mother’s family resisted Hitler’s regime.Today, Holzer and her husband, Rik Palieri, run the Holzer Book Bindery from their basement in Hinesburg. For Holzer, bookbinding is more than just a business — it’s a bridge to the past and a way to safeguard a legacy of activism.“Preserving books means preserving our history, so it all ties together,” she said.Her Swiss grandfather, Ulrich Holzer, learned the trade in Italy. But during his time there, a wave of disease and anti-foreigner scapegoating forced him to flee.Ulrich fled on a boat bound for the Holy Land, but when disease broke out onboard, he was cast ashore along with the dead in Gibraltar. A passerby heard him crying for water, and he wound up on a different ship bound for Boston.Without speaking English or having any documentation, he gravitated toward a community of Italian speakers, who helped him establish a book bindery in Hyde Park. His son, Albert Holzer, later took over the business. Marianna Holzer spent her early childhood in the shop.Marianna Holzer presses gold onto a bookmark. Photo by Ian Kreinsen/The CitizenWhen the bindery closed in the 1960s, the family ended up in Putney. Then, Albert Holzer died when Marianna was just 11.Still, her mother understood the craft and helped pass it on to her daughter.“She started in a walkout basement, like this, binding books for friends,” she said. “She taught me some basic things.”Her mother, Christel Holzer, came from a family of Nazi resisters in Germany. At one point, soldiers burned her grandfather’s books on his lawn. She believes that her aunt — a fierce anti-Nazi — was murdered for helping her husband escape from a concentration camp.During that regime, Christel Holzer learned bookbinding as an act of resistance.“She decided to go into something that maybe Hitler couldn’t twist around. So, she studied arts and crafts,” Marianna said. “While she was doing that, she learned bookbinding.”After immigrating to America, Christel Holzer was hired by Albert Holzer’s bindery. The two later married.Like Christel Holzer, musician Rik Palieri also got swept up in the Holzer family business.When he and Marianna Holzer started dating, Palieri spent most of his spare time with her at the Brown River Bindery, where she worked before going independent.“I realized I not only needed to be a musician, but I also had to help out to make this relationship work,” he said.Marianna Holzer looks through a family photobook. Photo by Ian Kreinsen/The CitizenToday, Palieri is fully integrated into the bindery. Holzer handles the technical work — taking precise measurements and making repairs — while Palieri gravitates toward the artistic side of the trade.Holzer converted her basement into a shop in 2008 and opened the binding business in 2010. Fifteen years later, tarnished tools, sheets of gold leaf, and strips of leather clutter the workspace where she breathes new life into time-worn books.Yet, her shop is not just a curious relic from the previous century. Business is booming.“I don’t advertise,” she said. “But people keep finding me.”Customers particularly gravitated toward her during the pandemic.“People were going into their attics, finding old books, and thinking, ‘We should do something with this.’ They’d call me up, and I’d meet them outside, even in the winter,” she said.Holzer receives anything from used Bibles to cookbooks to beloved Harry Potter books. Often, they have notes scribbled in the margin, bits of food, and wine stains.“One of the weirder books I did was a mechanics manual from the sixties,” Palieri said. “It was all greasy, but it reminded him of working on cars with his father.”Rio Palieri, Marianna Holzer and their dog Dolina. Photo by Ian Kreinsen/The Citizen“Most of the books I work on are not valuable,” Holzer said. “We’re more about sentimental value.”Sentimentality extends beyond Holzer’s customers. Above her studio, she keeps a collection of professional books from her family and childhood, including a Brothers Grimm volume her father used to read to her as a child.Next to her bookcase, she keeps a sign reading “resist.” Inspired by her mother, Holzer often attends protests and voices her opinions about the current administration.For Holzer, the bind between books, memory, resistance and human connection is clear.“Books hold our history, hold information and enable people to imagine and see themselves as others when they feel isolated and alone,” she said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Family’s bookbinding business a page turning story of resistance, resilience.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Marianna-Holzer.jpg?fit=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

Photo by Mike Stewar/APDespite many other states still lagging behind, 92% of Vermonters already have a REAL ID — which will be required under federal law for domestic air travel starting May 7.After the deadline, U.S. air travelers 18 and older will need a REAL ID or another TSA-acceptable form of identification — such as a passport or Enhanced Driver’s License — to board domestic flights or enter certain federal buildings. Vermont is one of just 12 states with 90% or more of its IDs in compliance. Meanwhile, 30 states remain under 70% compliant — with New Jersey’s rate being the lowest, at 17%, according to data collected by CBS News. Nearby New Hampshire has 62% compliance, Massachusetts has 57%, New York has 43% and Maine has just 27%, according to the CBS data. Although the REAL ID Act was passed two decades ago to set federal security standards for state-issued IDs, many Americans are still unprepared for its implementation. While the federal government says most air travelers already show compliant IDs, roughly 1 in 5 still do not, according to the Associated Press.Enforcement of the REAL ID Act has already faced multiple delays due to deadline extensions, and at least one state has requested another extension. However, Transportation Security Administration spokesperson Dan Velez told the Associated Press that he expects no further delays.Vermont has been promoting REAL ID since 2014. Because the majority of the state’s license holders are already REAL ID compliant, the department does not anticipate a large increase in appointment traffic as the deadline draws near, according to state DMV Deputy Commissioner Matthew Rousseau.To obtain a REAL ID, Vermonters must visit a DMV office in person and present proof of identity, a Social Security card, and two documents verifying Vermont residency, such as utility bills. Applying for an Enhanced Driver’s License requires proof of U.S. citizenship, such as a birth certificate or passport. Copies of birth certificates are not accepted, but a certified duplicate or original is accepted. Residents who still need the upgrade can start the process early by booking an appointment to avoid last-minute issues. The process typically takes about 15 minutes, according to Rousseau. Once approved, REAL IDs typically arrive by mail within 7-10 business days but can take up to 21 days.Read the story on VTDigger here:  92% of Vermonters have REAL ID-compliant licenses ahead of national deadline.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP-REAL-ID-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 07:03:17.959337

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.












A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing.


– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America




Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-04 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,How state law allows private schools to ‘double dip’ by using two public programs for the same students,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/04/state-law-private-schools-double-dip/,"The Mississippi Legislature’s insistence of not requiring oversight has resulted in a way for private schools to “double dip,” or receive money from two separate state programs to educate the same handful of students.","The Mississippi Legislature’s insistence of not requiring oversight has resulted in a way for private schools to “double dip,” or receive money from two separate state programs to educate the same handful of students.
There is currently no mechanism in state law to allow state officials to determine whether double dipping is occurring. More importantly, there is nothing in state law to prevent double dipping from occurring.
So, maybe the private schools are double dipping and maybe they are not. And this is not an effort to demonize private schools — many of which are doing stellar work — but to point out the lack of state oversight and to question the wisdom of sending public funds to private schools.
There are two primary programs in Mississippi that provide public funds and state tax credit funds to private schools: the Education Scholarship Account and the Children’s Promise Act.
The programs overlap in terms of the children the private schools must educate to receive the state benefits. To receive money through an Education Scholarship Account of up to $7,829 per year to attend a private school, a student must be designated as a special needs student. The special needs designation could be the result of a physical, mental or emotional issue. An attention deficit disorder, for instance, could result in a special needs designation.
On the other hand, students who make private schools eligible to receive the Children’s Promise Act tax credit benefits must have “a chronic illness or physical, intellectual, developmental or emotional disability” or be eligible for the free lunch program or be a foster child.
No more than $3 million per year can be spent through the Education Scholarship Account while the Children’s Promise Act is capped at $9 million annually.
The bottom line is that state officials do not know how many students the private schools are serving through the Children’s Promise Act state tax credits.
The Mississippi Department of Revenue, which has a certain amount of oversight of the Children’s Promise Act funds, has said in the past it knew the number of children being served in the first year a school received the state tax credit funds, but the agency does not know whether the number of students being served in following years changes.
In short, there is nothing in state law that would prevent a private school from receiving the maximum benefit of $405,000 annually while enrolling only one child fitting the definition that would make the school eligible to receive the tax credit funds.
There is a little more oversight of the Education Scholarship Account funds, though that oversight has been slow and has only occurred after a legislative watchdog group pointed out the lax oversight.
If a school has fewer than 10 students receiving the ESA funds, the state Department of Education will not release the exact number, citing privacy concerns. But the Department of Education has released the amount of ESA funds each school received during the 2023-24 school year.
According to that information, multiple schools receiving those ESA funds but educating fewer than 10 ESA students also are receiving significant Children’s Promise Act tax credit funds. According to the Department of Revenue, as of January, six schools had received the maximum tax credit funds of $405,000 for calendar year 2024.
Three of those schools also received Education Scholarship Account funds for fewer than 10 students. For instance, one private school received $16,461 in Education Scholarship Account funds, or most likely money for two students.
If the students receiving the ESA funds were the same ones making the school eligible for the $405,000 in tax credit funds, that would mean the state was paying $210,730 per student whereas the average per pupil spending in the public schools is about $11,500 per pupil in state and local funding.
Of course, state law does not prohibit private schools from educating only one child with special needs and being eligible for the maximum tax credit benefit of $405,000 annually.
Perhaps it seems far-fetched that a private school would be educating only one child to be eligible to receive up to $405,000 in tax credit funds.
But it also seems far-fetched that for years the students receiving the Education Scholarship Account funds were mandated by state law to use the money to go to schools equipped to meet their special education needs. Yet, research by the Legislature’s Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Committee (PEER) found the students were going to private schools that in some instances did not have any special education teachers and in some cases the students were still getting those services from the public schools.
Perhaps the Legislature’s PEER Committee needs to do some more research to determine whether double dipping is occurring.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/07060230/FVES_Classroom.jpg,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

In the face of accelerating climate change, the scale and scope of resilience work is growing far beyond what policy makers in the late 20th century thought possible. The general risk of not acting at the needed scale far surpasses the downside risk of any single action negatively impacting an ecosystem.
The post Accelerating climate change demands ‘agile s[...]","THE UPHEAVAL of federal support for climate change work could not have come at a worse time.  Communities across Massachusetts and the US are generally under-prepared to handle the current impacts of climate change, let alone the far greater challenges projected for the years ahead. Here in New England, where rates of heavy rainfall have increased by approximately 60 percent since the mid-20th century, frequent flooding threatens neighborhoods and cities. Stormwater systems are unable to deal with the increased frequency and intensity of deluge rainstorms. Other socioecological systems essential to community well-being, including food, housing, energy, waste management, and drinking water, are also vulnerable. In areas experiencing more frequent extreme storms or wildfires, insurance is becoming both harder to obtain and significantly more expensive. This unavailability or unaffordability of insurance threatens the stability of real estate markets. Even before a catastrophic storm hits, communities are already experiencing the impacts of climate change through increased property risk and the potential instability of tax revenues. The future of Massachusetts and New England depends on reconsidering regulation that stifles innovative nature-based design and projects and scaling up effective adaptation to accelerating climate change. Effective adaptation will require system agility — the forward-leaning ability to adapt continuously to changing conditions. Massachusetts and neighboring states have been taking positive steps. Over the past decade, best-practice resilience planning incorporated powerful analytical tools to understand both climate change threats and the full scope of vulnerabilities, particularly those worsened by social inequities like poverty and racial disparities. By integrating climate impacts such as sea-level rise and extreme rainfall with social vulnerability assessments and nature-based risk reduction strategies, communities can secure a thriving future grounded in greater equity and health for both people and the environment.  In coastal Massachusetts communities such as Wellfleet, Nantucket, and Plum Island accelerating shoreline loss is taking homes and threatening vital infrastructure and high value natural habitat. Massachusetts is giving our 78 coastal communities extra funding to develop risk-based coastal resilience plans. Using advanced modeling tools developed from the explosive growth of information technologies, these plans assess risks to valuable habitats, critical infrastructure, and community recreational assets. Informed by data sensing and analytical tools, the strategic placement of near-shore, habitat-friendly structures can slow erosion rates and create opportunities to avoid using hard structures that deflect energy and cause erosion elsewhere. The design process requires getting extensive site-specific data and most recently developed with the aid of artificial intelligence. But, implementing these projects requires working within the existing outmoded environmental management system that was not built to address the accelerating impacts of climate change. Procedural overload — multiple reviews, siloed rules, and an overly risk-averse perspective — undermine timely progress. For example, innovative nature-based measures like floating wetlands or naturalized reef structures that can reduce the wave energy on a shoreline face regulatory burden that is often higher than what is required for sea walls and other more traditional but more destructive alternatives. It took years for regulators to embrace green infrastructure as the better way to address stormwater pollution. Communities don’t have years for coastal regulators to embrace nature-based strategies to address coastal erosion that threatens vital infrastructure and habitat.   In the face of accelerating climate change, the scale and scope of resilience work is growing far beyond what policy makers in the late 20th century thought possible. The general risk of not acting at the needed scale far surpasses the downside risk of any single action negatively impacting an ecosystem.  Eventually a fundamental rethinking of the environmental management system is crucial for building the resilience necessary to thrive in the coming years. Unfortunately, redesigning the national environmental management system is unrealistic in this political environment. But there is way forward. Community-based public-private partnerships are a tested approach to scale the level of projects needed to meet an environmental challenge.  The ingredients for this partnership model start with a long-term source of revenue.  The second ingredient is a planning framework that defines the scope of what must be done. The next ingredient is a local or regional government that creates a partnership with private firm and an engagement program that effectively recruits the input of stakeholders.  With the promise of a large number of green infrastructure projects, the firm procures the needed design and build services at a scale necessary to meet the performance goals defined in the planning and permit framework. Most importantly the firm takes on the legal responsibility for achieving the goals of the program.    Like the challenge to build green infrastructure at scale to address stormwater pollution and flooding, using the extensive resilience planning work to create nature-based infrastructure to address community resilience challenges is a problem of scale and implementation speed. Community-based public-private partnerships offer a solution that has been endorsed by the EPA and is available to states and local governments.  However, these partnerships will only work if regulators rethink how they regulate nature-based work. Climate change is progressing rapidly and unpredictably. An environmental management system that does not acknowledge this urgency does not effectively serve governments or their citizens. By adopting a systemic approach to resilience planning and aligning our environmental management programs with the urgency of the climate crisis, we can better prepare for and mitigate its impacts. Curt Spalding is the former regional administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Executive Director of Save The Bay in Rhode Island.

Vermont’s symbolic rebel is viewed by some as a legend and others as a lightning rod. On this month’s 250th anniversary of his Revolutionary War capture of Fort Ticonderoga, scholars are aiming to separate fact from fiction.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ethan Allen has an image problem. Is the internet and present-day polarization to blame?.","Ethan Allen, as portrayed in a 1927 advertisement for Ticonderoga pencils. Photo courtesy Vermont Historical SocietyAs Revolutionary War leader of the Green Mountain Boys militia, Ethan Allen had seemingly no sooner captured Fort Ticonderoga from British troops on May 10, 1775, when he put quill pen to parchment to chronicle his effort.“I have,” Allen wrote, “taken the greatest care and pains to recollect the facts and arrange them; but as they touch a variety of characters and opposite interests, I am sensible that all will not be pleased with the relation of them.”Two and a half centuries later, that’s the one and only thing most people can agree on.“He has been accused of ignorance, weakness of mind, cowardice, infidelity, and atheism,” Henry Hall wrote in 1892’s “Ethan Allen: The Robin Hood of Vermont,” one of many books on the state’s love-him-or-hate-him symbolic rebel. “If Vermont is careful of her own fame, well does it become the people to know whether Ethan Allen was a hero or a humbug.”Search “Ethan Allen” online today and you’ll find more assertations of the latter, be it questions about whether he enslaved Black people or stole land from Indigenous populations.“He’s become a lightning rod for everyone’s feelings about that entire historical era,” Angie Grove, executive director of the Ethan Allen Homestead Museum in Burlington, said in a recent interview. “He gets all the credit and all the blame.”Historians say that divide is complicating efforts to mark next weekend’s 250th anniversary of his crossing of Lake Champlain and capture of Fort Ticonderoga — and, conversely, offering them the opportunity to separate fact from fiction.Ethan Allen, as sculpted in the U.S. Capitol’s National Statuary Hall. Photo courtesy Architect of the CapitolThe 2,000-acre Fort Ticonderoga historic site in Ticonderoga, New York, is set to present a reenactment of Allen’s raid between May 9 and 11, as well as educational stops in the Vermont towns of Sudbury, Orwell and Shoreham and a flyover by the Vermont Air National Guard.“Independence was not a foregone conclusion,” organizers note on their website. “Recovering the contingency of the American Revolution helps to underscore its profound significance.”For its part, the Ethan Allen Homestead Museum will offer free admission to Vermonters on May 10 in hopes of drawing visitors, be they curious or cynical.“I know that there are people who avoid the museum because they just assume Ethan Allen was a racist, Native American-slaughtering person,” Grove said.Then again, Grove has met others who swear Allen was a trail-blazing abolitionist at a time Vermont was drafting a 1777 constitution that would make it the first state to outlaw adult slavery. (Children wouldn’t be officially protected under the provision until 2022.)“Where did you get that information?” Grove will ask people expressing commendation or complaints.“Oh, it’s just well known,” she often hears in reply.But Grove — who holds a master’s degree in history from the University of Vermont — says it’s not so simple.Allen has been the subject of a slew of books, starting with his own in 1779. Then in 2014, the now late professors John Duffy and H. Nicholas Muller published “Inventing Ethan Allen,” an exploration of the historiography behind him.“How does the memory of Ethan Allen coincide with the reality of his life as well as much repeated supplemental legends and myths composed long after his death?” Duffy and Muller write in the prologue.The book notes, for example, that past authors often have emphasized or excluded facts to fit a particular narrative.“The story of Ethan Allen has been transformed since the 1830s to present a hero configured by comedic or tearful treatments in a consistently sentimental avoidance of events and actions that could otherwise have diminished his popular appeal,” Duffy and Muller write.Ethan Allen, as presented on a towering pedestal at Burlington’s Greenmount Cemetery. Photo courtesy Vermont Historical SocietyBut that doesn’t mean historians have censored content. Although scholars have found records of other family members using Black labor — the legal status of “free” or “slave” is rarely reported — they’ve yet to find any definitive proof whether Allen enslaved people.“In the absence of positive evidence, the question, ‘Did Ethan Allen ever own slaves?’ never appears in his biographies,” Duffy and Muller write.So why do people claim Allen did? Grove cites primary sources that show American Colonial society as a whole exploited marginalized populations — a fact that can lead some to extend the generalization to specific individuals.“We can make educated guesses, but we actually know very little about Ethan Allen’s political, social and moral relationship to slavery or Indigenous people that can be backed up with real evidence,” Grove said. “You can find claims online, but nobody has any sources for them. That isn’t to say we can’t find answers to these questions, but that research hasn’t been done yet.”Study, however, takes money.“Try as I might, I’ve found it challenging to convince people that research in general, and on Ethan Allen in particular, is worthy of investing in,” Grove said. “Anytime I mention anything about Ethan Allen, everyone says, ‘Nope, we don’t want to hear about him, we want to hear untold stories.’”Increasingly that’s leaving the internet to spin its own speculation.“In today’s climate, it doesn’t matter how much evidence or lack of evidence you have, people are going to feel the way they feel,” Grove said. “I always hope people are inspired by the idealism of the American Revolution — fighting for equality for all people, even though it didn’t give equality to all people. But I think it’s easier for some to blame certain figures of the past than to reckon with entrenched prejudices and inequalities in our society that have been passed down generation to generation.”The historian stresses she’s not taking sides, just in search of a truth not yet fully found. She hopes people will discover the homestead and its work — if only to take in one of the state’s oldest farmed areas, with a documented history dating back 600 years.“For better or for worse, Ethan Allen is the figurehead of Vermont,” Grove said. “It would be most responsible to invest in further research of him, particularly to see how well he represents the diverse state of today.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ethan Allen has an image problem.

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses. 


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
  HIPAA doesn’t help 

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)A surprise amendment to what was a simple bill caused an appreciable rift among Republicans in the Louisiana Legislature this past week, but it might have helped advance Gov. Jeff Landry’s signature legislation to address the state’s insurance crisis. 
House Bill 148, sponsored by Rep. Jeff Wiley, R-Maurepas, began as a measure to require insurance companies to tell customers what their previous billing amount was whenever sending out a coverage renewal notice. Wiley said it would simply let customers quickly see whether their insurance rates have gone up or down. 
However, the legislation underwent significant changes Wednesday on the House floor. 
Wiley accepted an amendment from Rep. Brian Glorioso, R-Slidell, that effectively combined his bill with some of the major provisions from a separate proposal from Democrats Robby Carter of Amite and Chad Brown of Plaquemine. Their measure, which has the governor’s backing, would give the state insurance commissioner the power to strike down any insurance rate increase considered “excessive” or unreasonably high. 
Currently, the commissioner can only exercise that power after holding a public hearing in which someone proves the state insurance market lacks competition. 
The amalgamated bill was advanced to the Senate on a 68-34,

The Carter-Brown bill had opposition from several Republican lawmakers and Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple, who some speculate could become the governor’s scapegoat if the latest efforts to reduce coverage prices fail. 
The proposal would have also backed the commissioner into a corner, forcing him to choose between rates based on real market conditions and rates that are lowered as a form of political favors, Temple has said in previous interviews. 
Some Republican lawmakers made similar arguments Wednesday and challenged whether Glorioso’s amendment was germane to Wiley’s original legislation. Legislative rules forbid members from hijacking a colleague’s bill with changes that differ dramatically from the purpose of the original proposal.  
One opponent, Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, asked House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, R-Eunice, to decide whether the Glorioso amendment departed radically from the Wiley bill. After consulting with the chamber’s parliamentarian, DeVillier said both proposals are related to the cost of insurance premiums.  
Rep. John Wyble, R-Franklinton, criticized the amendment for its lack of specificity in how the commissioner is supposed to determine whether a rate is unreasonable.
“So what’s an unreasonable profit — a 6% profit, a 4.5% profit, a 20% profit, a 100% profit?” Wyble asked.
Republicans Jay Gallé of Mandeville, Josh Carlson of Lafayette, Paula Davis of Baton Rouge and Chance Henry of Crowley also argued against the proposal, voting against the Glorioso amendment and the updated bill.

Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, who chairs the House Insurance Committee, also voted against both measures. He said he believes Glorioso’s amendment helped ensure the passage of the key provisions the governor wanted. 
Landry turned heads last month when he sat shoulder to shoulder with Brown at a committee hearing in support of the Democrat’s bill. The governor even drew praise from some of the state’s most liberal politicians after he railed against large corporations and called for stricter regulations on the insurance industry.
The Carter-Brown bill “was problematic for some Republican representatives,” Firment said in a phone interview Friday.
Moving the major provisions from that bill into a Republican-backed proposal was a way to try to ease the “heartburn” some conservatives were having, Firment said. 
The insurance commissioner is still lobbying against the revised bill. 
“I can’t speak to anyone’s motivation, but the only additional power this legislation gives me is the authority to deny rates for political, personal and other subjective reasons,” Temple said. “I’ve made that clear to the legislature and will continue working to help them understand what the bill does and why it is harmful to our insurance market.”
Wiley said he supported the amendment because of the special circumstances of the state’s insurance crisis. 
“I can just tell you that tough times call for tough decisions,” Wiley said.

March 4, 2025: Qatar to Connecticut 
In early March, sitting in his sister’s West Haven apartment, Sayed Rahim Rahim opened the small leather backpack where he carries his family’s documents for safekeeping. He pulled out certificates printed with Afghan and American flags that he received during the 12 years he worked as an automotive mechanic for the U.S. armed forces. 
On the rug, he spread out the Qatar Airways tickets and stack of passports that had helped get him, his wife, their son and four daughters across the Atlantic in a hasty departure less than a week earlier. 
The family’s arrival in Connecticut coincided with a chaotic new chapter for refugees coming to the United States, as the Trump administration halted new arrivals and began dismantling the services that once supported them. Funding cuts, an end to Temporary Protective Status for immigrants from countries like Haiti and Venezuela, and growing uncertainty for others about their future on U.S. soil have since become features of the national news cycle. 
In Connecticut, that chaos has shaken the refugee communities that have called the state home — and the resettlement agencies that have historically contracted with the federal government to lay the groundwork of a successful life in the United States.

Rahim’s family’s crisis-driven arrival may be a harbinger of how the new reality looks for refugees and Special Immigrant Visa holders like him, as support flounders and resettlement groups increasingly turn to private donors and volunteers to fill the gaps left behind.
The uncertainty began for the family in January, when they were readying to fly from a refugee camp in Qatar to the U.S. Along with more than 1,600 other Afghans, the family learned their flight had been abruptly cancelled, an action taken by President Donald J. Trump on Jan. 21, the day after he signed an executive order to indefinitely pause refugee resettlement.
The United States has ushered 200,000 Afghans to safety since the Taliban took control of the country after U.S. forces left in 2021, in what was widely considered a tragically botched exit. Afghans like Rahim, who had worked for the U.S. forces despite risks of retribution from the Taliban, had been promised a safe haven here through the pathway of Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) for him and his family. In Rahim’s case, the cancelled flight came after an eight-year wait for his visa to go through, during which time the radius of his life constricted to keep him and his family safe. For a year, he and his family lived in a hotel room. 
Meanwhile, in West Haven, Rahim’s brother-in-law, Noorjan Omerkhel, was shocked when he learned the flight was off. The family began scrambling for a solution.
Rahim and his family were still approved to come to the U.S. as SIVs, and the short-term passports they’d been issued for the trip were valid for a few more weeks. They just needed plane tickets. Omerkhel had lost his job a few months before, but he logged on to Qatar Airways and emptied most of his savings — $6,845.07 — on seven plane tickets. 
It was a blow, but Omerkhel had reason to believe that, once the family arrived, they’d be greeted with the same robust support he’d received when he came to the U.S. nine years earlier. He remembered how New Haven-based Integrated Refugee and Immigration Services (IRIS) had taken care of everything, from preparing an apartment, to cooking a first Afghan meal, to enrolling his kids in school and scheduling medical appointments. 
But when Rahim’s family arrived on Feb. 26, they met a different reality. 
IRIS was in crisis. Omerkhel alerted the group that Rahim and his family were planning to come, but just a few days before they arrived. 
Omerkhel brought them back from the airport and took them into his small home with his wife — Rahim’s sister — and their three kids for the first few nights. But he was worried. 
“There’s no case manager for (Rahim), he’s seeking help for transportation, his wife is pregnant, and his daughter is having a dental issue.”
He wondered if buying the plane tickets had been a mistake. 
“Now it fills me with upset, too much upset inside,” Omerkhel said. “I’m not a governor or mayor … simply put, I’m not (a) financially stable person. I lost my job, and still I’m struggling to find a job.” 
Back in January, IRIS had planned to help the family. But those arrangements were made before the organization was thrown into turmoil: Federal contracts worth $4 million were abruptly cancelled, the group was laying off dozens of employees and making the painful decision to give up its primary physical office. 
“We were in the midst of heartbreaking meetings,” said IRIS Executive Director Maggie Mitchell Salem.
IRIS was struggling to make sense of its new reality. Over the years, the group had co-signed leases on over 100 apartments. But with the funding to help pay for those apartments gone, they were searching for new housing for clients and working with landlords to transfer the leases to their clients’ names. 
Anxious phone calls flooded in from families who had fled war and violence in their home countries, then spent years painstakingly building new lives: learning English, going back to school, finding jobs and friendships in a wildly unfamiliar place. But without citizenship, what might become of those lives? Many of their case workers had lost their jobs and could no longer give them answers. 
Amid these calls and meetings, a group of core IRIS staff met in Mitchell Salem’s office in late February to talk about Rahim and his young family. 
“I think initially I said, ‘No, we can’t help,’” Mitchell Salem recalled. Their remaining staff was spread thin, and much of their funding had been wiped out. But as they talked, Mitchell Salem began to question herself. This work, she reasoned, was what IRIS had been built to do. 
“It’s like — we can still do this. It is absolutely right to do it,” Mitchell Salem said. “The community will have our back, regardless of whether the federal government does.”
The mood seemed to lift. More Afghan families arrived — a total of four families and a single man — and the group put out a fundraising call.
Hewad Hemat, manager of resettlement services at IRIS, and Rona Rohbar, the head of the IRIS health team, were assigned to help the family. 
“It was kind of shocking, difficult,” said Hemat, who also came to the U.S. as a refugee from Afghanistan in 2014. “A family with five kids, no credit history, the mother is pregnant and the children are so young! And there is no government help. We were very worried.”

March 7, 2025: Where would they live? 
It had been nine days since the family had arrived in the U.S., and they had moved from Omerkhel’s home to stay with Rahim’s brothers and cousin in a cramped two-bedroom apartment in West Haven. 
Rahim had met with IRIS earlier that day, and he had signals that the organization was trying to help him, but the predominant emotion was still anxiety about a stack of unsolved problems. Most important among them: Where would they live? Rahim’s relatives had been generous, but it was a lot to ask the three men living on their own to take in a family of seven. 
Whatever the obstacles of the day, Rahim’s children always gave him and his wife, Madina, some comic relief. His youngest daughter, Asna, was still working on her walking skills, and she stumbled across the carpet and into his lap. She babbled, then giggled at the tired smile Rahim pasted across his face. 
Asra, 3, curled up on a cushion, peering into a YouTube video on a cell phone. Asia, 4, circled the small apartment, on the hunt for something to busy herself. Serwat, 11, and Alia, 6, sat quietly with calm smiles on their lips, listening to their uncle translate questions to their father in his native Pashto. Rahim was beginning to learn English, but he couldn’t speak fluently like his brothers, who had served as translators with U.S. armed forces. Without being asked, Serwat and Alia pitched in, putting away visitors’ shoes or distracting the baby when she cried. 
Rahim had met with IRIS for an intake interview. When he went to their office, they gave him a couple of books for the children to explore — a pop-up book with pictures of trucks, another with games and pages of butterfly and princess stickers. At the apartment, the younger kids pulled the books from each others’ hands, anxious to look through them. Asra peeled the bright stickers off the page and pasted them up and down her arms. 
It was Ramadan, and the adults were fasting until the evening. Rahim’s wife Madina, who asked not to be photographed, had been feeling weaker than she had during previous pregnancies. Rahim urged her to break the fast and eat during the day, and sometimes she did. 
So far, the family hadn’t seen much beyond the walls of their relatives’ apartments. It was chilly out, in the 40’s. In typical New England fashion, the sky vacillated from a blanket of gray to light blue. “They’re too naughty” to take outside, Rahim said of his children with a smile, through his brother’s translation. As in, he wasn’t up for venturing into the unknown with five young kids. 
The family had practice hunkering down together in a small space — they had spent an entire year living in a Kabul hotel before getting to the refugee camp in Qatar, confined to the room for their safety.
March 11, 2025: Signs of progress
A few days later, progress: The family had doctors’ appointments, and Rahim and Madina now had their own cell phones, given to them by IRIS, so they weren’t dependent on borrowing relatives’ phones to communicate. IRIS was pulling together money for a few months’ rent, plus the deposit, so they’d be ready when they found an apartment. 
His brothers drove for Uber, and the noise of the children sometimes kept them awake. It was time to get their own place. 
“IRIS should help us,” Rahim reasoned. His wife was pregnant. Who knew how long it would be before he’d be able to start working? 
But his brothers agreed that Rahim’s career as a car mechanic was a stroke of good luck under the circumstances — that particular set of skills transcended borders and language. First, he’d need a driver’s license and an automotive repair license. It was another set of bureaucratic hills to climb. 
Rahim spent hours cooking a meal of kabuli pulao, the Afghan national dish of lamb and rice with spices, to break the daily Ramadan fast. Once the family ate, the children curled up together in the corner of the living room, watching videos on his phone.

March 12, 2025: Setbacks and opportunities 
Rohbar was in charge of getting the family medical care. Just a few months before, she would have had 11 team members working for her.
“The whole team is gone. I’m the only one left,” Rohbar said. 
It was lucky for Rahim and his family that Rohbar was the one left. She was from the same city in Afghanistan — Khost — and she spoke the same dialect, a version of Pashto she said can be unintelligible to people from outside that region. 
Rohbar helped the family schedule their medical appointments, but she was spread too thin to stay while a registered nurse checked their hearing and drew blood. Instead, she showed Rahim the number to dial for an interpreter. The connection faded in and out — “Hello? Are you there?” — the nurse asked the voice on the other end of the line. Sometimes, she was. 
The kids explored the beds, the walls, the medical supplies, as two nurses examined them one by one. Everyone remarked on the large family — so many kids! Madina stayed at home, resting before her prenatal appointment later in the day. Asra, the 3-year-old, smiled through a hearing test. And somehow Alia, 6, smiled through her blood draw.

W hen all of them had been poked and measured, a weary Rahim led the children to the front of the clinic. Within 15 minutes, Rohbar had pulled up in a minivan to take them back to Rahim’s brothers’ apartment.
Rohbar was doing what she could for the family under the circumstances, but she understood the chasm between these services and what she did for refugees just months earlier. In fact, Rohbar herself came as a refugee from Afghanistan 22 years ago as a teenager, and those first moments of welcoming live as vivid scenes in her memory. At the airport, they got off the long flight and were fingerprinted by immigration authorities. “You cannot trust any stranger,” in those early days, but there was a representative there from the International Organization for Migration who helped them through the paperwork, and then gave them bus tickets and guided the exhausted family to their bus. In New Haven, IRIS staff greeted them as they walked into the dark September night.
“The case manager was there with two or three cars, and the apartment was ready. The lights were on. Our favorite meal — the Afghan traditional meal — was on the table. The feast was ready, you know, the Afghan feast. The fridge was loaded with food. I don’t have words to explain the excitement.” 
Rohbar kept walking around from one end of the apartment to the other. The beds were made, and the closets were full of clothes. She was fascinated by the food in packages. Back in Afghanistan, they shopped in markets — she’d never seen the boxes and clamshell plastic that fills American supermarkets. “To me that was so interesting! I couldn’t believe it was real.”
And the dish they’d prepared amazed her. It was kabuli pulao. Rohbar had spent years learning to make the recipe from her mother, but her attempts were met with criticism. She never got it quite right. Yet somehow, these strangers across the world knew how to make the dish. 
That night still ranks as the happiest of Rohbar’s entire life. 
“Whenever I’m upset, these memories keep me alive,” Rohbar said. “I can still feel the joy from that night.” 
When Rohbar looked at Rahim and his family — one man, one boy, a woman and four girls with another baby girl on the way — she felt a responsibility, and an excitement, to lead by example.
As a woman, “it’s so shocking to them that I’m speaking in English, I’m working, I’m driving and showing them places,” Rohbar said. In Afghanistan, girls are not allowed to go to school beyond sixth grade, women are generally not allowed to work, get driver’s licenses or even spend time in public spaces. When they do, they must fully cover their bodies and faces. 
Rohbar gives the same pep talk to all of the women she resettles from Afghanistan.
“I tell them, ‘You came this far, you better pick up all the goody bags from here. You came for education, work, and it will be useless if you don’t do anything, if you just do what you did back home. If you don’t take advantage after sacrificing everything — your home! — it will all be in vain for you.’”
In time, Madina would be able to participate in the women’s groups that Rohbar organizes. She could get help learning English and even enroll in adult education if she wanted to. But not yet.
“In the beginning, when they arrive, it’s overwhelming,” Rohbar said.

April 4, 2025: A new home — but what happens next? 
A little over a month since the family arrived in the U.S., they finally had their own apartment. It was a walk-up on the second and third floors of a house in New Haven, near the idyllic Westville neighborhood. IRIS helped them find the apartment with four small bedrooms, overlooking a cemetery, just a few blocks from Edgewood Park. 
Madina had pains in her belly the night before. They still had no furniture, just a few rugs and cushions for the living room floor and the hallway.
But the family seemed lighter. Rahim’s English was improving, and he could express himself without a relative at hand to translate. 
“Right now, I’m good. The only problem is work, my wife is sick, my daughters, my son (needs to) go to school,” Rahim said. He couldn’t get his family around without a driver’s license. “I have appointments … if some people is not busy they coming (to drive me). My brother, my cousin.” 
Mostly, the family stayed inside. 
But today, with the sun out, Rahim decided to take them to the playground while Madina stayed with Asma, the youngest, at home. Rahim wrapped Asia and Asra in thick black parkas. Serwat and Alia, the oldest, helped their siblings tie their shoelaces. Finally, the kids jumped down the stairs and onto the sidewalk. Serwat retrieved a double stroller, and Rahim convinced the youngest girls to ride.
Daffodils and the pink cherry blossoms, the first of the season, opened their faces to the sun. Suddenly, desperate tears were rolling down Alia’s face. She wanted to climb out of the stroller and pick flowers from a manicured bed. She quieted when her father handed her a small, purple flower.

May 1, 2025: First day of school in four years
Serwat got up early. He took a shower and sprayed himself with cologne, gelled his hair and combed it neatly to the side. Today would be his first day in a brick and mortar school in four years. 
After the exit of U.S. armed forces from Afghanistan in 2021, the region of Khost where the family lived fell to Taliban control. Rahim decided to keep Serwat, then 7, at home. His school was 10 kilometers away, and the route between had become too dangerous to risk the journey. He was able to take classes during the few months the family spent at the Qatar refugee camp, but today was different: a new desk all to himself in Lauren Bitterman’s fifth-grade classroom at the Mauro-Sheridan Interdistrict Magnet School in New Haven. 
Serwat had visited the school the day before with Alia, who would start one day after her brother. They’d met all of their teachers and brought home the red shirts that are part of the school’s uniform.

Serwat walked into school with Rahim and Jennifer Huebner, the volunteer who gave them a ride that morning. The students received breakfast as they walked through the door, and Serwat grabbed a box of soy milk. Perhaps he was nervous, but he said only that he was happy. 
At his desk, Bitterman explained the day’s schedule in English, and Serwat mostly didn’t understand. But by a stroke of good luck, there was another Afghan boy, also from Khost, who would be seated next to Serwat. Once he arrived at school, he helped translate. To speak to Serwat’s parents, Bitterman would use a translation app.
Soon they’d leave for French class (“Oh great, another language!” Huebner exclaimed), and later Serwat would get a Halal lunch in the school’s cafeteria. 
Rahim and Huebner said goodbye to Serwat and left the classroom. There were still big milestones to come. Rahim had gotten his driver’s license, and the interfaith group of volunteers Huebner was part of, Shoreline Refugee Resettlement, which works with IRIS, had gotten the family a used Honda, which mechanic Peter Palumbo volunteered to fix up, as he had for other families. Palumbo was also searching for a job for Rahim.
“It makes me really happy to know there are people that are helping, even though they don’t have to do it,” Rahim said through a translator.
Rahim borrowed $800 from the Afghan community in New Haven, a collection of families who help one another through difficult times, to buy a rug and the flat cushions, or toshaka, to furnish one room of the apartment. The contours of their life in this place — where they would live, work, study — were finally visible.

Even so, the new country around them was in a moment of deep uncertainty, economically and politically. Congress was weighing cuts to the programs helping them, like SNAP and Medicaid. On April 11, thousands of Afghans learned that their Temporary Protective Status would not be renewed. That didn’t apply to Rahim and his family as SIVs, but it did impact other IRIS clients.
Rohbar, the IRIS worker who helped them arrange medical appointments, imagined that the future would not be easy for the family. Usually, a single member of IRIS would be assigned to check in with them daily, to make sure they had anything they needed. But there weren’t enough staff to go around any more. Her thoughts centered on Madina, who was due at the end of May. She was having another girl. 
Madina knew what hospital to go to for the birth, but what would happen next? How would their life look in a few months if Rahim found work and Madina had six children at home? Back in Afghanistan, the family would have lived in a compound where aunts and cousins would have lent a hand supervising the kids. 
“Here, it’s gonna be a new life for her,” Rohbar said. “She’s gonna be taking care of a newborn, herself. She’ll have to manage to get her kids to bus stops for school and have a little baby with her,” along with the three other girls who hadn’t yet reached school age. 
After he dropped off Serwat, Rahim went back to the apartment to help Madina. He’d clean up, send Asia and Asra to different corners of the room when they argued. He’d make Asma giggle as she followed him around the apartment. He’d cook a meal. Then, he’d walk back to the school to pick up Serwat and hear about his first day.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0307_SR_RahmanFamily_007-edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-04 06:00:28.736479

The 42-year-old mother was lured from her residence in Pittsburg to an immigration office in Kansas City under the pretext of an interview for a green card application. Accompanying Alvarado to that April 23 appointment was her husband, a recently naturalized U.S. citizen, and their 20-year-old daughter.
The daughter, Carina Moran, said in social media posts that Alvarado — who has deep ties to her southeast Kansas home — was tricked by ICE agents.
“I am the daughter of two immigrants,” Moran posted. “My father was born in El Salvador and my mother was born in Guatemala. My dad recently became (a) citizen after a decade of hard work and multiple long drives to interviews and today was my mom’s turn to present herself for her first interview. For an entire week leading up to today I cried and prayed that my mom would stay home and that she was going to a routine interview, but unfortunately we were lied to.”
The family had brought with them documentation to show Alvarado’s life in Pittsburg, including testimonials from community members. Her husband, Nixon Moran, had been a citizen since March. They expected Alvarado, too, would eventually become naturalized, and they hoped the spousal interview would be the first step.
Instead, officials at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Office asked Nixon Moran, 44, to step outside. Alvarado was taken into custody. The family learned that Alvarado had a deportation order from failing to appear in court when she was a youth, in the 2000s, and another issued that morning.
Alvarado, who suffers from diabetes and hypertension, was soon on her way to the Chase County Detention Center at Cottonwood Falls, two hours away in east-central Kansas. It’s a town of about 900 in a pastoral county known for its historic courthouse. The entire population of Chase County is only around 2,600. It’s the kind of place known for its history, Friday night jam sessions at the local cafe and postcard-perfect prairie vistas.
So why are detainees sent to Chase County?
Because for years the 148-bed detention center, owned and operated by the county, has been a major source of revenue. Under a contract with ICE, the jail is filled mostly with foreign nationals from Mexico and Central and South America. When I wrote about the jail in 2021, county officials said the jail was self-sustaining and helped ease the local tax burden. Back then, the jail averaged 70-75 inmates a day, and received $62 for each from ICE.
Now the jail has 143 inmates.
Of those, 119 — or 83% — are listed as “deportable alien,” according to the detention center’s online roster as of April 30. The remainder are either held on unspecified charges or on charges unrelated to immigration, such as assault or robbery.
The entry for Rosemery Alvarado included her mugshot and the two deportation counts. No other charges were listed.
The separation has torn the family apart, Carina Moran said in a post.
“I will not get to hug my mom or say goodbye, my siblings won’t get to either and my dad has to take on all of her responsibilities alone,” she said. “I am heartbroken that she will not watch us graduate, she won’t be there during the most important moments of our lives and I won’t get to share my first experiences with her anymore.”
There’s an online video of the March 19 naturalization ceremony in which Nixon Moran became an American citizen, held at Johnson County Community College. He was among 352 candidates for citizenship presented to U.S. Magistrate Judge Angel Mitchell, who noted that most Americans are either immigrants or descended from immigrants.
The event was both joyful and solemn.
It included the singing of “God Bless America” and a PowerPoint showing the countries of origin of the applicants who, among other requirements, had successfully passed a citizenship test. An oath required the newly minted citizens to renounce foreign princes and potentates, to support and defend the Constitution, and to take up arms for America when required by law.
“We should never take these freedoms for granted,” Mitchell advised, “lest we lose them someday.”
Perhaps Rosi Alvarado was inspired to begin a path to citizenship because of the unabashedly patriotic ceremony. She may have been frightened by stories of other undocumented individuals and even international students being taken from the street and placed in vans. Or she may have just delayed taking the necessary steps for so long because of her poor English skills, as noted by her daughter in a social media post: English proficiency is a requirement for most applicants under the age of 50.
It is unclear from statements made by the family why Alvarado had not obtained a green card, which grants foreign nationals the right to live and work in the United States. But what is abundantly clear is that Alvarado had made a home in Kansas, that she has a family that took their responsibilities to America seriously, and that she had resolved to do the right thing under the law.
The amount of resources ICE invested in removing Alvarado from her family and whisking her away to the detention center at Cottonwood Falls seems disproportionate to any offense she appears to have committed. In a reasonable and just society, the fact that Alvarado was married to an American citizen and had a family here should have moderated the response. But we no longer live in a reasonable or just society, and people living peacefully but without authorization in the United State have become the victims of a thirst for misguided vengeance.

This kind of hatred of others is not new.
It’s been with us in one form or another since the founding of the country, but every lifetime or so the old poison is channeled anew. Slavery could not exist unless it was doctrine that Black people were racially inferior, antisemitism was fueled by lies about secret cabals for world domination, and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community persists because of fear, lies and hatred. We have entered a new era of government-sponsored bigotry in which even the mention of equity, diversity, and inclusion is being scrubbed from the official record.
Part of the effort to whitewash America is the campaign against migrants who lack necessary documents to remain here legally. As a nation, we have always been more than happy to exploit their labor as farm workers and housekeepers. Now, by government decree and action, we are unwilling to treat them as human beings worthy of respect, a living wage, or a secure place to call home.
Where is Rosi Alvarado tonight?
Not in Kansas, unfortunately.
As of April 30, she was no longer listed on the Chase County Detention Center online roster. The same day, I filed a media request for her location with ICE officials. If the agency couldn’t tell me her exact location, I asked, could they at least confirm she was still in the United States? So far, I’ve received no response.
Carina Moran, however, posted Wednesday the family had received word Alvarado had been transferred to the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center awaiting deportation. Carina has set up a GoFundMe account to help with legal and medical costs related to her mother’s deportation. As of Friday, it had raised $18,430.
That Louisiana facility has become notorious in recent weeks as the location where Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk was held after being snatched by immigration authorities. Ozturk was accused of supporting terrorism by co-authoring an opinion essay in a student newspaper asking Tufts to “recognize Palestinian genocide.”
The Louisiana holding facility is also a for-profit prison, run by Geo Group.
The Marion County Record reported Thursday that Jay Whitney, the director of the Cottonwood Falls jail, said ICE had ordered her removed from the facility. He said he didn’t know the context of Alvarado’s arrest or “how this lady’s getting all this attention.”
A small group protested outside the detention center Sunday.
“I just have a contract to house her,” Whitney told the Record. “I don’t ask questions of how come you’re detaining her or how you’ve come to the conclusion to detain her. That’s on their end.”
It’s difficult to believe Whitney is unaware of Rosi’s case, considering 10 people were holding signs outside the facility over the weekend. But what is more disturbing is his lack of curiosity about the charges against those in his care.
Every jail — even a revenue-producing, tax-lowering enterprise like the Chase County Detention Center — has an obligation to ensure that inmates it is holding are not being denied basic constitutional protections. American law makes little distinction between citizens and noncitizens when it comes to basic rights such as free speech and due process.
Who is in jail and why is at the core of our system of law.
Habeas corpus is an ancient and foundational legal principle that means a person must be bodily presented before a judge on demand. It ensures that individuals are afforded due process and not illegally confined, held in secret prisons, or simply disappeared. While Congress and the courts have narrowed in recent years the ability of those in federal custody to seek relief under habeas corpus, it remains an essential safeguard to civil liberties.
I don’t know what Rosi Alvarado’s legal status is, whether she was given a chance to appear before a judge to protest her deportation, or why she had a failure to appear on her record. The family’s social media posts have been unclear and Carina, her daughter, has not responded to requests for an interview. Frankly, I’m not sure the family understands exactly what is happening. But if what Carina has posted is true, that her mother was lured to an immigration office in expectation of a green card interview and then whisked away in a white van, it raises disturbing and fundamental questions about ICE deportations.
In other cases, the government appears to be playing a sort of shell game with detainees, moving them quickly to jurisdictions far from their places of residence and then putting them on planes without sufficient due process. In at least one case, that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the government appears to be defying a Supreme Court order to facilitate the individual’s return from a notorious El Salvadoran prison.
The toll of the second Trump administration’s first 100 days is long and loud. It includes economic chaos, civil unease, the unraveling of the federal government, our diminished standing on the world stage and a threat to the rule of law at home.
I have seen no evidence that Rosi Alvarado was a threat to her community. Judging from her daughter’s comments and social media posts, she seems to have been the kind of mother most of us knew, precious to her children, one who held her family close and who enjoyed simple things like watching her kids play football. I think of Rosi and it brings to mind my own mother, long dead now, but still vibrant in memory.
The story of Rosi Alvarado is a story not just of her home, but ours.
It is a snapshot of America in 2025, a glimpse of the place where we live now. Don’t like the surroundings? Then act to change them. As citizens, we have a duty to our neighbors to make sure the Constitution, the supreme law of the land, is observed. If we don’t, home will start to feel like less like a castle and more like a dungeon.

Sage advice on any topic, but especially when it comes to coverage of transportation.  A couple of recent stories illustrate my point.
Improved cell service on Metro-North
Gov. Ned Lamont and Connecticut Department of Transportation Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto held a media event recently in Stamford to promote the fact that AT&T has improved its cell coverage along the New Haven line.  


That telephone company spent $60 million installing 30 high-powered macro towers and small cell nodes, some of them on CDOT land, in a public-private partnership. Many are specifically aimed at dead spots in service on the trains.
This is good news… if you are an AT&T subscriber.  If you use Verizon or T-Mobile and find an area with no cell coverage on your commute, this won’t help you.  The AT&T enhancements are for its customers only. That means only about a third of cellphone using commuters will benefit by this enhancement.
There is no word from the other companies on how they might be filling holes in their service.  But… it’s a start.
However if you read the media coverage, you’d think every commuter’s cellphone coverage had been improved!  “Cellphone service to get upgrade on Metro-North rail line,” proclaimed the Hearst papers.  “Wireless service upgrades coming to New Haven line for CT commuters,” said WSHU public radio. “Gov. Lamont and AT&T launch $6M infrastructure project to improve wireless cell service for Metro-North commuters,” reports News12 TV.
Improved cell coverage is a crucial issue for commuters looking to be more productive during train-time.  But attention-grabbing headlines such as these may lead to a perception of better service.  The more you’re told “cell service is getting better” the more you’ll think it is.  Or so the pols hope. 
But… don’t believe the hype.
Faster than Acela?
In April another media event, this time at Grand Central, celebrated faster train service from New Haven:  three early morning (5 – 7 a.m.) super-express trains, one of them cutting ten minutes off its old running time, making that single train “faster than Acela.”
Great news… if you’re a pre-dawn-commuter from New Haven.  Again, kudos to Metro-North for much needed signal and infrastructure improvements.  But has the average commute to Grand Central really improved?  Not really.  The exception is not the rule.
With limited stops these super-express trains still average only 52 mph.  Regular express trains get about 46 mph and locals run just 38 mph.  Remember: the M-8 cars on Metro-North are capable of 80 mph.
How did the media portray these improvements?
“New Metro-North schedule, with shorter trips on New Haven line, now in effect,” trumpeted the Hearst papers. “Metro-North Is Faster Than Acela,” promised Bloomberg (quoting MTA chairman and CEO Janno Lieber).
The “faster than Acela” claim is technically true… for one Metro-North train.  Keep in mind that New Haven to Grand Central Terminal is 73 miles, but to Penn Station (on Amtrak) is 75 miles.  But not wanting to always sound like a grouch, I say good for Metro-North.
What worries me is the media coverage which over generalizes and lacks the caveats I’ve cited.  Telling commuters repeatedly that their trains are running faster, when they are not, may be persuasive, but it is not accurate.
So, take media coverage of transportation with a grain of salt.  The headlines don’t always tell the full story.  And don’t believe the hype.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)A lone legislative race and a smattering of local tax referendums around the state were put before Louisiana voters Saturday, when a sparse ballot had to compete with the usual spring schedule of festivals and events throughout the Bayou State
In East Baton Rouge Parish, a special election was held to fill the vacancy in Louisiana House District 67. The position became open when Larry Selders won a February election for the state Senate seat vacated when Cleo Fields won the 6th Congressional District race last year.


One notable item on Saturday’s ballot was the Lake Charles mayoral race, with Republican incumbent Nic Hunter losing to independent challenger Marshall Simien Jr.
Other highlights from Saturday’s results included a rejected property tax referendum for the East Baton Rouge Parish district attorney’s office. DA Hillar Moore had said the new millage was needed to bring his agency up to par in staffing and compensation with comparably large prosecutorial districts in Orleans and Jefferson parishes.
The 4-mill levy was projected to raise $24 million annually, with Moore projecting there would be enough revenue generated for his office to return millions to the parish government general fund. With the new tax failing, resources for the district attorney will continue to come from parish government.
In New Orleans, voters narrowly approved a property tax for the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, which has the primary task of operating the city jail. The final vote tally saw the measure prevail by a margin of two votes out of more than 25,000 ballots cast. The results still have to be verified by the Secretary of State.
Although the sheriff’s tax has already been in place for years, opponents leaned into a “no new taxes” message in their campaign against the 2.46-mill, 10-year collection. The tax is expected to generate nearly $14 million in revenue for the sheriff’s office.
St. Tammany Parish voters approved a bond sale for its public school system with a ceiling of $325 million. The debt is not expected to result in an increase to existing property millages dedicated to the school district.
A property tax in Livingston Parish public schools was renewed for another 10 years. The 7 mills will generate nearly $5 million a year for the district.
Rapides Parish voters also renewed two property taxes for their public school system, totaling 9.58 mills combined, for the next 10 years. They’re forecast to generate more than $10 million annually.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers adjourned early Saturday after approving a total state budget of $20.3 billion for 2025-27, with investments including a historic property tax package for homeowners, a new State Hospital and funding to address overcrowding at jails and prisons.
The overall budget, which includes federal dollars and other special funds, is a 3.5% increase over the current two-year budget cycle.
“We managed to address all of our needs and some of our wants, and we did it without raising any taxes. We did it without borrowing any money, and we provided record (property tax) relief,” said Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot.

The preliminary two-year budget for general fund spending for 2025-27 is $6.25 billion, an increase of 2.6% over 2023-25.
Though legislators started the 2025 session with excess revenue, they’re keeping a cautious eye to the future with the state’s growth projected to slow amid lower oil prices, declining oil tax revenue and uncertainty about tariffs. Lawmakers also funded investments that aim to spur new oil production and diversify the state’s economy.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong said he’s excited the Legislature passed a property tax package that includes a $1,600 primary residence tax credit and provisions to limit future property tax increases, an idea he pitched at the start of the session. Armstrong said he’s also pleased lawmakers adopted a “bell-to-bell” cellphone ban for public schools, another idea he championed.
“I think those two things will have an immediate impact,” Armstrong said early Saturday.
The property tax package is funded with earnings from the state’s $12 billion Legacy Fund. Armstrong said if lawmakers allow the fund to continue to grow, it could put most homeowners on a path to paying zero property taxes within a decade.
“What a legacy for our kids and grandkids, to be able to have a significant amount paid toward their property tax,” said House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson.
House Minority Leader Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks, told his colleagues he’s glad they spent more time on the “real issues facing North Dakotans” this year than they had in recent years, referring to culture war issues that dominated much of the 2023 session.
“Let that be the start of a positive trend for our body, and let us commit to resisting the pull of polarization and extremism,” Ista said.

Some, including Armstrong, said the Legislature missed an opportunity to do more to address the state’s housing and workforce needs.
“But those are tough issues, so we always have more time for that,” Armstrong said.
State hospital, behavioral health
Legislators approved $300 million to construct a new State Hospital in Jamestown, which will replace an outdated facility. The project will provide 140 beds to serve people in need of acute mental health services. 
Rep. Jon Nelson, R-Rugby, who chaired the division of the House Appropriations Committee that handled the budget for Health and Human Services, said that project is critical for the state. Lawmakers had considered reducing the funding to $285 million, but ultimately approved $300 million. The Office of Management and Budget will oversee construction of the project.
“It was our highest priority in our section with the Human Service budget,” Nelson said.

Lawmakers approved other investments in regional behavioral health services, including nearly $13 million to create 24 new in-patient acute psychiatric beds in Grand Forks and $1.5 million for 10 beds in Williston.  
Legislators also fully funded the Free Through Recovery and Community Connect programs that help people with recovery support.
Prison overcrowding
The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation budget includes $28.4 million for payments to county and regional jails, which are housing inmates due to crowding at state prisons. The department is looking to staff and operate unused space in Grand Forks County’s new jail expansion for some state prisoners. Armstrong’s administration secured a letter of intent from the Grand Forks County Commission to enter into an agreement, with terms still being finalized.

The budget also includes more than $35 million to complete the Heart River Correctional Center in Mandan, the first state prison designed for women. Another $8 million is dedicated for a temporary facility to add beds for the Missouri River Correctional Center and $20 million to design and plan a new medium-security prison that’s proposed to be built next to the State Penitentiary.
A group of three bills backed by the corrections department aims to keep people out of the criminal justice system and lead to a lower recidivism rate after inmates are released. 
The recidivism rate was a point of discussion as Attorney General Drew Wrigley backed what he called a truth-in-sentencing bill. Senate Bill 2128 sought to make sure inmates in the state prison system spend most of their sentence behind bars, but it was defeated in the House.
Education funding
K-12 education was a major topic for lawmakers, but proposals to establish private school vouchers or Education Savings Accounts did not survive the session. Armstrong vetoed one bill because it only affected private school students, and lawmakers defeated a more comprehensive bill, in large part due to the high price tag.
Lawmakers did approve a bill establishing public charter schools in North Dakota for the first time.
Legislators voted down proposals to provide free school meals to all students, an idea that was strongly supported by the public. 
Lawmakers did include $7.3 million in the Department of Public Instruction budget to make free lunch available to students from families within 225% of the federal poverty level. That’s an increase from 200% of the poverty line that was funded in the 2023 session. It means a family of four with an income of about $72,000 would qualify for free school lunches.
Free school lunch advocates call on Legislature to act 

The Together for School Meals coalition has said it’s deeply disappointed the Legislature did not pass universal school meals.
“Free school meals is a policy supported by 79% of North Dakotans and championed by over 80 local organizations committed to ending child hunger,” said Amy Jacobson, executive director of Prairie Action ND and a member of the coalition. “This bill had the power to put real money — an estimated $850 per child per year — back into the pockets of hardworking parents.” 
The overall Department of Public Instruction budget contains a 2.5% increase of the per-pupil payment for each year of the biennium, raising it to $11,349 in fiscal year 2026 and $11,633 the following year. The Senate advocated for 3% each year.
Legislation signed by Armstrong will make public K-12 schools phone-free, requiring personal electronic devices to be stowed and inaccessible during instructional time. The law takes effect Aug. 1.
Culture war bills
Lawmakers debated several controversial issues that ultimately failed. A resolution urging an end to same-sex marriage passed the House but later was defeated in the Senate.
Lawmakers also defeated a bill to require the display of the Ten Commandments in schools and public colleges and rejected a resolution that declared the kingship of Jesus Christ.
The Legislature spent a considerable amount of time on policing the content in public libraries and bathrooms at public schools. 
North Dakota governor vetoes controversial library content bill

Armstrong vetoed a bill that addressed content in public libraries and K-12 schools, which expanded on legislation approved two years ago. Failure to comply could have cost the library or school state funding and resulted in criminal charges. 
“The bill imposes vague and punitive burdens on professionals and opens the door to a host of unintended and damaging consequences for our communities,” Armstrong said in his veto message.
Armstrong signed a bill that prevents K-12 public schools from building new all-gender, multistall bathrooms. Lawmakers added an exemption for existing restrooms after schools complained they would have to spend millions to bring their facilities into compliance. Schools could be fined if they don’t comply with the bathroom policy and other regulations in the same section of code, including a requirement for schools and teachers to inform a students’ parents if they learn the child is transgender. 
The governor also signed a bill that amends Century Code to state “words used to reference an individual’s gender mean the individual’s sex,” a proposal some critics called discriminatory to transgender and intersex North Dakotans. 
Property rights
Landowner groups and local government officials argued with lawmakers this session to maintain local control, though frequently ended up on the losing side of the debate. 
House Bill 1258 gave the Public Service Commission more authority over setback rules on large electrical transmission lines, taking away authority from townships and counties.

Sen. Terry Wanzek, R-Jamestown, represents an area where a large power line is planned. A township created a half-mile setback from residences, and Wanzek said such rules hinder the project and threaten others like it across the state. 
House Bill 2321, which aimed to strengthen the position of landowners in negotiations with oil and infrastructure developers by helping them recoup legal fees, had support in the Senate but ultimately failed in the House. 
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, who represents an area where the controversial Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline is routed. His other bills to strengthen landowner rights and limit carbon capture development made little headway. 
On the final day of the session, lawmakers approved a bill that aims to keep North Dakota on the forefront of rare earth mineral development. The Northwest Landowners Association argued the bill is unconstitutional.
Loss of lawmaker
During the session, House members mourned the loss of Rep. Josh Christy, R-Fargo, who died in February at age 43. 
Last week, Armstrong signed two bills sponsored by Christy, who had developed a niche in the Legislature on the subjects of artificial intelligence and technology.

“While we continue to mourn, we celebrate the achievements he made and the legacy he left with his service,” Ista said.
As lawmakers closed out the session they also acknowledged Rep. Jim Kasper, R-Fargo, who was hospitalized late in the session.
Special session?
Lawmakers adjourned on day 74 of the session, which means they have six days remaining of their 80-day limit. 
Several expressed a desire to save days in case lawmakers need to return to address impacts on the state from cut federal funds.
“It’s highly likely that we’ll need to get called back,” said Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo.
Lee, who chaired the Senate Human Services Committee, said she’s watching potential cuts to Medicaid or other human services funding that could require the state to respond.
“Without the money, the state has to be able to step up,” Lee said. “And we’re lucky to be in a position to know that we’re probably going to be able to do that.”

The state Democrats issued a statement warning of “misguided and chaotic national policies” that threaten local impacts. 
“Already we’ve lost promised funds for rural infrastructure, mental health care and even the care of disabled persons,” Ista said.
The governor can also call a special session, which would not have a time limit.
“We’ll wait and see where we’re at,” Armstrong said Saturday. “It costs money to bring everybody back. Obviously, if there’s a real reason to do it, we will do it.”

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado House of Representatives passed a bill Saturday to expand the state’s existing protections for immigrants and further limit how local law enforcement can interact with federal immigration authorities.
Senate Bill 25-276 passed on a party-line vote, with Democrats in favor. The Senate, which approved it in April, needs to sign off on changes made in the House before the bill heads to Gov. Jared Polis’ desk.
“There is clarity in place of what happens when an (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) action takes place. Notice that I’m saying ‘when,’ because everyone here knows that there is zero sense of false hope, especially in our immigrant population. They know more than anyone here in this room that they are not living risk free,” Rep. Lorena Garcia, a bill sponsor and Adams County Democrat, said ahead of the vote.
“This bill is a declaration to our commitment to civil and constitutional rights in this state, for everyone who calls this state home,” she said.

The bill would prohibit local government officials and employees from sharing personal identifying information about immigration status with ICE and would also limit where ICE can go within a public school, child care facility, hospital and library without a warrant signed by a judge. A House amendment removed the inclusion of “surrounding areas” to those banned spaces.
Public officials who intentionally violate that data sharing provision would be liable for a $50,000 civil fine, which would go to the state’s immigration legal defense fund.
The bill would also prevent local sheriffs from delaying a person’s release from jail for the purpose of immigration enforcement, get rid of certain affidavit requirements for immigrants seeking in-state tuition or a drivers license, and allow immigrant defendants to ask that a guilty plea is overturned if they were not aware of immigration consequences of that plea when they made it.
“This bill does not provide immigrants with more rights than citizens, but it ensures equal treatment under the law,” bill sponsor Rep. Elizabeth Velasco, a Glenwood Springs Democrat, said.
Democrats framed the bill as a response to the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts and increased detentions of immigrants without legal status, which they said are often imposed without the due process the bill tries to protect.
“When we violate due process, we violate justice,” Garcia said.
An Aurora apartment building was the site of a chaotic immigration raid earlier this year, and dozens of international students in Colorado have had their visas revoked. There have also been coordinated drug and immigration enforcement efforts at unofficial nightclubs in Adams County and Colorado Springs, and it is unclear whether the people detained in those actions have a criminal history warranting arrest.
“One of the reasons why I appreciate this bill so much is that it is one of few that is really taking seriously the crisis that the federal administration poses for immigrants in particular and for marginalized people generally,” Rep. Yara Zokaie, a Fort Collins Democrat, said.
Republicans, during the initial debate on the bill and on Saturday, argued that the bill could provoke the Trump administration to target Colorado and withhold federal money. On Friday afternoon, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Polis, Attorney General Phil Weiser and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston to invalidate the type of “sanctuary” laws that prohibit coordination and information sharing between local officials and immigration authorities.
“This is super-sizing sanctuary policy,” Rep. Max Brooks, a Castle Rock Republican, said. “When we consider this bill, we ought to be looking at the downsides, not just the emotional stories to be able to support it, but we need to look at what could potentially be the harm and the downstream negative impact.”
Eric Maruyama, a Polis spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday that the “Governor’s office has expressed concerns about the original version of SB25-276, and has been working with legislators, as well as stakeholders, including law enforcement, throughout the process on amendments that would help gain the Governor’s support. Colorado is not a sanctuary state, and Governor Polis continues urging Congress to secure the border and do their job and pass comprehensive immigration reform.”
Once the bill is sent to Polis, he will have 30 days to sign or veto it. The legislative session ends Wednesday.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — While most of Churchill Downs’ spectators watched thoroughbreds race the track, jockeying of a different kind unfolded in the stands.
The Kentucky Derby — the most famous sporting event annually held in the Bluegrass State on the first Saturday in May — draws a spate of celebrities and business executives. With the amount of influence in attendance, it’s no wonder Kentucky politicians come out to the races. 
Despite Saturday’s rainy weather, horse racing fans gathered at the track early to take their seats and place bets in ticket booths. Some high-profile guests, including Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and his family, walked a red carpet to talk with local and national media outlets about the Derby. Others, like Democratic Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman and  Republican U.S. Rep. James Comer shared photos from the red carpet and grandstand online.
U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said on X he planned to attend the Derby with his wife, Kelley, on Saturday. 
“While you’re enjoying mint juleps and hot browns like we are, remember to thank all of those working to make the Derby possible!” Paul said, referring to a classic Derby cocktail and a dish that orignated in Louisville.
Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky said “there’s so many reasons” a politician may want to be seen at the Kentucky Derby. The event historically attracts many of the state’s power brokers, giving candidates and elected officials a chance to network “in a way that’s festive with the people whose support they need.” 
Beshear, the state’s top Democrat, said during his Thursday press conference that the Derby is “our premier day for talking to businesses that either are looking at Kentucky or could potentially look at Kentucky.” The governor added that the event brings a boost of tourism to the state. 
“I typically see about two races on Derby day — one if I’m just lucky enough to be standing next to the window and one, the Derby race itself,” Beshear said. “But I mean, this is a date where we don’t just see celebrities and athletes, which are great, it raises the profile of the event, but we see international CEOs enjoying the best of the best of hospitality.”

Beshear himself had a viral moment from during an interview he did at Churchill Downs earlier in the week. He told Louisville TV station WDRB that running for president in 2028 is “something I would consider” if he could be someone who could bring the U.S. together. That quote was picked up in national media reports. 
Ahead of the main race, Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman shared on X that the Derby is a “a tradition that brings the eyes of the world to the Commonwealth.”
“The Derby is more than a race. It’s a symbol of our history and culture,” Coleman said. “From the thundering hooves to the hats and hospitality, this day reminds us—there’s  no place like the Bluegrass.” 
Voss said one advantage for politicians who make news at the Derby is that media coverage of the event “reaches a lot of people who do not like politics and who basically avoid political news.” 
“This is a chance for those politicians to get name recognition with people who are usually very difficult or expensive to reach, and they’ll be reaching them for free. Well, minus the cost of attending,” Voss said.  “As political ads go, that’s cheap. What’s not to love, right? They get to go to this event, have a good time and they’re probably doing more for their political careers than they accomplished at the average boring or riskier outing.”
Former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican who is now seeking to replace Mitch McConnell in the U.S. Senate in 2026, made an appearance at Churchill Downs Thursday — also known as “Thurby.” While the Kentucky Derby is the last race on Saturday, horses run the track throughout the week at Churchill Downs. 
Politicians even celebrate the Derby outside of the Bluegrass State. On Thursday, McConnell held his annual Pre-Kentucky Derby Luncheon in the U.S. Capitol with a menu that included Kern’s Kitchen Derby-Pie, fried chicken and biscuits, fried okra and corn pudding. 
President Donald Trump issued a statement Saturday calling the Derby “an iconic American institution and an elegant celebration of our culture, customs, and unwavering competitive spirit.” The Republican last attended the races in 2022. 
The Derby also is an opportunity for politicians to be seen in a personable way, Voss said.  
“Sometimes we talk about it as the ‘Which candidate would you want to have a beer with?’ but it’s more general than that,” Voss said. “People trust more the representation they’ll get from a politician who seems more like them in certain ways, seems to have common sense, and being seen having fun, doing something like going to the Derby, makes the politician seem like less of a politician. Seems more like someone able to deliver the sort of representation a regular voter would like.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3954-1024x694.jpg,,,2025-05-03 18:06:15.634988

Nikema Williams. Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder Charlie Bailey, the former attorney general and lieutenant governor candidate, was elected as chairman of the Democratic Party of Georgia Saturday, replacing Atlanta U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams.
Bailey becomes the Georgia Democrat’s first full-time chair as the party intensifies its efforts to fundraise and campaign for candidates, and reenergize a base after setbacks following the 2020 historic elections for U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.
President Donald Trump’s return to the White House looms large as Georgia Democrats look ahead, which fueled questions about the role of party leadership in winning close elections. Trump’s narrow Georgia win played a key role in his return to the White House this year.
In the runoff election to lead Georgia Democrats, Bailey won 53% of the votes, with a margin of 116 votes to 98 votes over Wendy Davis, a former Rome City Commissioner and 2022 candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives.
Bailey was the Democratic nominee for attorney general in 2018 and lieutenant governor in 2022.
Top Georgia Democratic Party officials have endorsed Bailey, including U.S. Sen. Ossoff and U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath, a Marietta Democrat who delivered Bailey’s nomination speech on Saturday.
The new chair said he plans to hit the ground running by raising money for key races this year, and in next year’s election when Ossoff will be on the ballot. He’ll also need to focus on races for state legislative and statewide constitutional seats including governor.
Bailey will need to unite progressive and more moderate wings of Georgia’s Democratic base to get the party back in the win column.
“I only ask to be judged on my heart and on my work, and I think my work as a lawyer and in politics shows I’ve got a heart for democratic values,” Bailey said following the election. “We’re  going to support all of our people and get as many Democrats elected across the state as humanly possible.”
During his campaign for party chair, Bailey has cited his experience as an attorney who represented local officials seeking to stop last-minute rule changes made by the State Election Board that might have prevented the certification of the presidential election.
Bailey finished first among a field of party chair candidates that also included Gwinnett County state Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, former Augusta Mayor Hardie Davis, Nakita Hemingway of Atlanta, a former Democratic nominee for Agricultural commissioner and District 1 chairman Jay Jones from coastal Georgia, who finished third in Saturday’s election.
Bailey said that the state Democratic Party will have to win over voters by following the party’s long-held ideals for improving health care, education and the economy inequality.
Bailey said Georgia’s Republican Party is failing residents because of the closure of rural hospitals after the state GOP’s leadership resistance to full Medicaid expansion and lagging public school ratings.
“That is what they have given us, the people of Georgia,” Bailey said. “Democrats, independents, Republicans, they got full cause to be angry about that, and we’re going to make sure that they know what the Republicans have done, the choices they make, and what we stand for
  U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath delivered Charlie Bailey’s Democratic Party of Georgia chairperson nomination speech Saturday. Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder
McBath said Bailey is the right person to lead the party because he knows the ins and outs of politics while also being able to raise the millions of dollars needed for campaigning.
“I’m not going to mince words about what’s happening in D.C. right now,” McBath said. “Our democracy is truly on the line, and it’s time that Georgians stand up. It’s time that we say enough is enough.”

Chairman Drew McKissick of Columbia won in the first and only round of voting needed Saturday at the state GOP convention. He was backed by 56% of the 907 delegates attending the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center.

Former Sen. Lee Bright of Spartanburg County came in second with 41%, followed by Denny Floyd, longtime treasurer of the Anderson County GOP, at 3%.
“We’ve proven we know how to win in South Carolina,” McKissick told delegates gathered in South Carolina’s capital.
Chairman since 2017, McKissick has presided over a red wave that has given the Legislature its biggest Republican majority since Reconstruction.
A Democrat hasn’t won a statewide office in South Carolina since 2006, and Republicans hold six of the state’s seven U.S. House seats.
Nominating McKissick was 7th District Rep. Russell Fry of Murrells Inlet, who in November won his second term in the seat anchored by fast-growing Horry County.
“We need to keep mobilizing the grassroots and there’s no stronger person to do that than Drew McKissick,” said Fry, a former state legislator.
In the last eight years, 20 elected officials have switched parties from Democrat to Republican. The latest was Solicitor David Pascoe —chief prosecutor for Calhoun, Dorchester and Orangeburg counties since 2004 — who’s considering a 2026 run for state attorney general.
Others include freshman state Rep. Harriett Holman, who changed parties in 2022 while she was on the Dorchester County Council. She ousted a 20-year Democratic incumbent in the Statehouse last year — among 11 House seats and seven Senate seats flipped since 2020 — to become the Legislature’s only female Black Republican.
Holman, of Ridgeville, said she never would’ve been able to flip the seat held by Rep. Joe Jefferson for two decades if not for McKissick.
Other freshmen flipping a seat in November include state Sen. JD Chaplin of Hartsville, whose ousting of 22-year incumbent Sen. Gerald Malloy stunned even political observers. If not for McKissick, Chaplin told the crowd Saturday, that seat would still be blue.
“If it wasn’t for the support that Drew McKissick gave me, we would not have a supermajority in the Senate,” he said to applause.
But both Floyd and Bright, a firebrand former senator, argued the state has become too liberal. They argued the party needs to elect Republicans further to the right on the political spectrum.

The vote showed most of the party faithful disagreed.
Bright, a Freedom Caucus-like legislator before the hardline Republican caucus existed, lost a bid last year to regain the Senate seat he lost in 2016.
“One thing that’s so discouraging: People are so trusting that if I elect a Republican, I’m going to get conservative government, and we don’t,” he said.
McKissick was the national Republican Party co-chair for more than a year before announcing his resignation in February 2024.
His decision came as then-former President Donald Trump called for new leadership on the national level. Though he had not yet become the party’s official nominee, he’d won every state contest, including a 20-percentage-point win against former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in her home state.
Trump’s picks as the new co-chairs of the Republican National Committee were Michael Whatley, chair of the North Carolina GOP, and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump.

As McKissick was announced Saturday, one delegate in the crowd shouted, “He was fired by Trump.”
But McKissick said the suggestion that he has anything but a good relationship with Trump is false.
“People will try to mislead and lie to some folks about people coming into our party — trying to make it to be that they are more MAGA than someone else or they are more America First,” McKissick said to the SC Daily Gazette, referring to Trump’ Make America Great Again slogan.
Trump carried South Carolina by 18 percentage points over Vice President Kamala Harris.
“Everybody in this room supports Donald Trump. Everybody in this room voted for Donald Trump,” McKissick said. “Anybody here claiming they are more this or more that — makes no difference.”

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
States Battle Big Tech Over Data Privacy Laws

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
DNA Databases Are Boon to Police But Menace to Privacy, Critics Say

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.

It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A stripped-down campaign finance bill failed in the Senate early Saturday morning after a prolonged disagreement between chambers.
House Bill 1377 was the last bill on the House and Senate floor for the 2025 legislative session. Some lawmakers hoped it would be a vehicle for ambitious changes in campaign spending transparency, as well as for streamlining financial disclosure regulations for candidates.
It would have taken effect at the same time as the launch of the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office’s new campaign finance system.
“We had a real opportunity this year with the new software coming in to take a big step forward in our campaign finance transparency and unfortunately, we failed,” said Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, who sat on the conference committee appointed to workshop the bill.
North Dakota Legislature adopts ‘historic’ property tax bill on final day of session

A conference committee of six lawmakers met several times throughout the day to work out differences over the bill. The committee ultimately decided against including a handful of transparency-related proposals in the legislation.
Dissatisfied with what the committee advanced to the floor, Roers ultimately asked the Senate to reject the proposal when it got to the floor about 3:45 a.m. Saturday. It failed 5-39.
The House, meanwhile, gave the bill a favorable 65-25 vote. Rep. Dan Ruby, R, Minot, who sponsored House Bill 1377, said the bill deserved to pass even if some lawmakers wished it had done more for campaign finance transparency.
“This is still a good bill,” he said.
House Bill 1377 sought to incentivize campaign reporting compliance by increasing late fees and making info about late filers public online.
“If you are late with fines or amendments in the future, that information will be posted on the Secretary of State’s website,” said Rep. Vicky Steiner, R-Dickinson, who carried the bill on the floor Saturday morning.
Other changes highlighted by Steiner included inflationary adjustments to campaign contribution reporting thresholds, and updating state law to reflect an Attorney General’s Opinion related to federal political action committees.
The bill sought to revive some components of Senate Bill 2156, which failed upon its second visit to the Senate floor earlier this session after significant amendments by the House.
A Senate committee led by Roers had voted to fold elements of Senate Bill 2156 into House Bill 1377 — causing consternation among some lawmakers in the House. The Senate approved the changes, though the House voted last week not to concur with the amendments.
The conference committee discussed, though ultimately rejected, several transparency-related provisions.
One was to publicize candidates’ beginning and ending campaign fund balances. Lawmakers also considered making itemized campaign expenditures available to the public. North Dakota already makes campaign contributions above $200 public.
Some legislators on the committee were skeptical the additional information would be useful.
Steiner said during a Friday meeting that full campaign spending information should not be publicized because it can be weaponized against candidates  — especially in small communities.
“My rural legislators are concerned about someone saying, ‘You bought from Joe and you didn’t buy from me, Bill,’” she said during the meeting.
Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, said he doesn’t think the public is interested in a higher level of detail.
“Nobody’s asking to know which vendors I’m working with or those types of things,” Vetter said.
Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, told her colleagues on the House floor she was disappointed with the direction the bill had taken. She said she didn’t understand why some lawmakers are reluctant to make more campaign finance data public.
“No one should have to ask,” O’Brien said.
Bill would require more frequent financial disclosure reporting from North Dakota officials

Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who spoke with reporters early Saturday about some of the final bills of the session, said he doesn’t think citizen lawmakers should be required to report the same level of financial disclosures as congressional candidates. But he said the items in House Bill 1377 seemed reasonable.
“I don’t think asking for beginning fund balances and ending fund balances and itemizing your expenses in a campaign are too much to ask of elected officials,” said Armstrong, a former state senator and U.S. House representative. 
“I think the more transparency you have, the more trust you get from the public,” he added. 
Armstrong last week signed a separate bill that will require North Dakota officials to file financial disclosure forms annually, rather than only when they are appointed or file to run for office.  House Bill 1469 also requires the secretary of state to publish the forms online.

U of M Health-Sparrow serves as the Office of the Medical Examiner for several counties in mid-Michigan, including Eaton, Ingham, Ionia, Isabella, and Shiawassee counties, annually compiling a drug report tracking trend in drug-related deaths.
In 2024, drug-related deaths fell to below 130 deaths in the five counties, a steep drop from the more than 180 drug-related deaths seen in 2023, according to the U of M report. Clinton and Livingston counties, which are also served by U of M Health-Sparrow’s medical examiner, saw declines in drug deaths as well.
Though the report remarks that most drug-related deaths recorded are due to more than one substance, year after year opioids, particularly fentanyl, are involved.
Statewide, Michigan’s state health department has remarked that efforts to reduce drug-related deaths, particularly fighting the opioid crisis, are working, with Michigan seeing a decline in overdose deaths from 2021 to 2023 that was almost five times greater than the decline seen nationally.  
2024-annual-ome-drug-report
President Donald Trump first declared opioid overdoses to be a public health emergency in 2017, after overdoses began to accelerate in the 1990’s.
The U of M report found that drug deaths peaked in 2018 in mid-Michigan counties, reaching more than 200 deaths, largely attributed to a stark increase in fentanyl-related deaths, with 27 more deaths being related to the opioid than in 2017.
Between 2023 and 2024, fentanyl-related deaths were cut nearly in half, the U of M report found.
Last week, in an effort to curb the distribution of fentanyl in Michigan, lawmakers in the Michigan state House bipartisanly passed legislation to set mandatory minimum prison sentences for those found distributing heroin, fentanyl or carfentanil.
Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport) who is a sponsor on the legislation, House Bills 4255 and 4256, said in a statement last week that the package, which raised concerns with some over increasing incarceration, that it’s time for Michigan to get serious about getting drugs off the streets.
“Fentanyl has destroyed families, overwhelmed first responders, and turned every corner of our state into a potential crime scene,” Lightner said in the statement. “With this legislation, we are putting traffickers on notice: If you push this poison in Michigan, you will face serious time — no deals, no loopholes, no leniency.”

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Two bills originally designed to protect Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen from losing office if he’s suspended for disciplinary conduct failed to pass the Legislature, one in the House and one in the Senate.
Knudsen is facing discipline for statements he and lawyers under his supervision made that disparaged the court and for defying a court order in a legal standoff in 2021.
House Bill 856 and Senate Bill 49, in its initial draft, offered different ways to shield the attorney general from a proposed punishment some viewed as unfair.
Lawyers since have indicated the attorney general may not need protection, but a decision on discipline is pending with the Montana Supreme Court, and Republicans in the Montana Legislature have been critical of the judicial branch.
Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, carried one of the bills, HB 856, in the Senate, and she said Friday she was disappointed fellow Republican senators didn’t lend enough support for it.
“They did not use the tools at their disposal to protect their Republican attorney general,” McKamey said.
McKamey also said she suspected some of the opposition might have been payback from Republican leadership in the Senate — an allegation the president and majority leader disputed.
Republicans in the Senate were split this session, and McKamey is among a group who has at times bucked leadership.
“It certainly appears to be some sort of retribution,” McKamey said.
One day earlier, Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, said he had opposed the bill because he felt uncertain about its impact, and Friday, he responded to the allegation of possible retribution.
“That’s absolutely false. Sen. McKamey has no influence on my vote either way,” Regier said.
In 2023, the Office for Disciplinary conduct alleged Knudsen broke rules of professional conduct for lawyers in connection with the standoff. The office oversees discipline against members of the bar.
The Montana Supreme Court is considering a unanimous recommendation from the Commission on Practice that Knudsen be suspended for 90 days for multiple violations of rules.
HB 856 and SB 49 presented different methods to protect the attorney general from disciplinary consequences.
HB 856 would have ensured Knudsen wouldn’t be at risk of losing office if he faces the full recommended suspension of 90 days.
Montana law states that an office becomes vacant if an incumbent generally fails to discharge their duties for three consecutive months, and HB 856 would have extended the period to four months.
In committee, sponsor and Majority Leader Steve Fitzpatrick, R-Great Falls, said he thought the idea that Knudsen could get thrown out of office if he ended up suspended for 90 days was unfair, so he proposed HB 856.
Fitzpatrick said the people of Montana had just elected Knudsen, and he had won by a large margin. Knudsen, a Republican incumbent, took 60% of the vote in November 2024.
“It didn’t seem right to me that a disciplinary official would be able to basically override the will of the people,” Fitzpatrick said.
Since then, Fitzpatrick learned that even if the Supreme Court imposes a penalty of 90 days, it may not translate into a loss of office.
At a hearing in March before the Montana Supreme Court, lawyers for Knudsen and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel agreed such a penalty doesn’t mean he needs to lose his elected office.
For example, the 90 days, if imposed, don’t need to run consecutively, or they can be counted inside of a three-month period.
Knudsen’s team made other arguments as well, including that the Montana Constitution allows for the removal of a judge, but not an officer of another branch.
In the legislative committee hearing, Fitzpatrick said he didn’t know if the bill would have any impact on the attorney general’s situation, but he viewed four months as more appropriate than three months regardless.
The bill made it through the House, and the second to last week of the session, it passed a significant vote in the Senate, 28-22, without debate.
However, three days later, it failed on a final 22-27 vote.
Some Republicans who have been critical of the courts voted against it on second and third reading, and some changed their votes from yes to no.
Thursday, Fitzpatrick described the result as “confusing.”
McKamey said Fitzpatrick asked her to carry the bill in the Senate, and she tried her best with it.
She said the Knudsen family is clearly important to Republican leadership, and she described the lack of support for the bill as “short sighted.”
Austin Knudsen is the attorney general, and his mother, Rhonda Knudsen, is a former Republican legislator who served as an advisor to Regier during the session.
Regier and Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, were among the senators who voted against it, both consistently, and Regier said he wasn’t certain the bill was even relevant by the time it ended up on the floor.
McGillvray said he didn’t find it to be a significant bill, proposing a shift from three months to four, he found the speech McKamey made on the floor “pretty weak,” and he cast his vote accordingly.
“I don’t speak for how other people vote, but I don’t do retribution,” McGillvray said.
McGillvray also said if the Montana Supreme Court wanted to impose a penalty that sought to push Knudsen out of office with a suspension, it could simply extend the penalty to five months if the legislature changed the duration to four.
On the floor, McKamey had said the bill initially came about because of news reports that said Knudsen might lose his office if he was suspended for 90 days, but she said supporters of the bill later learned that might not be the case, and the law might not apply.
“Nonetheless, four months is a more appropriate timeframe than three months and provides approximately 120 days before a person loses a job that they were elected to do,” McKamey said on the floor.
Senate Bill 49 failed earlier in the House.
Sponsored by Sen. Barry Usher, R-Billings, SB 49 would have granted immunity from discipline to lawyers who are also elected as Constitutional officers, such as the attorney general or governor.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers set state funding for public broadcasting at $400,000 early Saturday, providing money for tower improvements after threatening to cut off Prairie Public funding completely earlier in the session. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong had proposed $2.9 million in his preliminary budget for the 2025-27 biennium, with $1.7 million in one-time funding to assist with transmitter maintenance and replacement. 
A bill mandating that Prairie Public funding be eliminated advanced through the House but was defeated in the Senate. 
The Senate vote allowed lawmakers to restore funding in House Bill 1015. Some senators, however, advocated for cutting back on the Prairie Public appropriation. 
The bill was amended in the Senate to provide $850,000 for Prairie Public, but did not restore its $1.2 million base funding. A conference committee this week cut the funding to $400,000 for infrastructure. 
John Harris, president and CEO of Prairie Public, testified in a hearing that Prairie Public would be spending $4 million to $7 million in the next 18 months to upgrade facilities and buy transmitters. 
Prairie Public leaders testified that the organization could survive without state funding, but that it will mean less local programming. Other funding sources for Prairie Public include charitable gambling, endowment funds and investments.

(City of New Orleans livestream)NEW ORLEANS – When Congress passed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in March 2021, it allocated $350 billion in assistance to state and local governments – providing the largest infusion of cash to local governments since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. For New Orleans, that money represented a desperately needed lifeline.
The city had been hit particularly hard by COVID-19. It was an early hotspot for the virus. And Black residents, who comprise about 60% of the city’s population, were disproportionately impacted, accounting for more than 75% of COVID deaths in the first few months of the pandemic. As New Orleans went into lockdown, the city watched its economy grind to a halt. Festivals were canceled. Hotels emptied out. Restaurants closed their dining rooms. Thousands were laid off.
For the city government, this represented a multi-pronged disaster: With tourism all but halted, the city was receiving dramatically less from sales taxes than usual, straining its finances. At the same time, the needs of its citizenry were at an all-time high. The city took out a certificate of indebtedness, which basically provided a $100 million line of credit, and partially furloughed its entire workforce.
But shortly after Congress passed ARPA, city leadership expressed cautious optimism.
“This is by no means a silver bullet or a panacea, but this funding will literally buy us time,” Mayor LaToya Cantrell said in a March 2021 press release.

New Orleans would go on to receive nearly $388 million in ARPA funds – among the largest allocations in the country for a city of its size. The money was directly given to local governments and came with few strings attached. The recipient governments had to obligate all of the funding by the end of 2024 and spend it by the end of 2026.
The Cantrell administration would use that money not only to plug substantial holes in the city’s revenues and build up its financial reserves, but also to fund a variety of initiatives across the city – from public safety to health to economic mobility.
Cantrell will leave City Hall next year after nearly eight years as mayor. And a big part of her legacy will be about how she handled the pandemic. Not just the lockdown months, the mask mandates and the various phases of reopening, but the huge opportunity that this federal windfall represented for the city, and whether she took it.
“ARPA funds were absolutely transformational for New Orleans,” a spokesperson for the city of New Orleans said in an email, pointing to a slew of programs the city funded, from catch basin cleaning to workforce development to technological upgrades.
But not everyone agrees.
Nellie Catzen is the executive director of the Committee for a Better New Orleans, a nonprofit focused on civic engagement, especially regarding the city’s budget. She said that federal pandemic aid could have been transformational for New Orleans in meaningfully addressing inequities across the city, but city leadership decided to go another way.
“For me, the overarching legacy is one of missed opportunities,” Catzen said.
Helping city workers
About $187 million, or nearly half of the $388 million the city was allocated, went to “revenue replacement,” a purposely flexible spending category authorized in ARPA, which allowed local governments to shore up departments and services while tax revenues were down.
Dave Kamper at the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank in Washington, D.C., said that for cities of New Orleans’ size, spending approximately half of ARPA money on revenue replacement is fairly typical.
“One of the great successes of ARPA is that they just let the local authorities make the decisions that made the most sense to them,” Kamper told Verite News.
Kamper noted that money used for revenue replacement was probably most impactful in its ability to maintain or even build the public sector workforce.
New Orleans City Councilman Joe Giarrusso, who chairs the council’s budget committee, agrees that revenue replacement played a key role in helping city workers.
Under the furloughs, enacted in late 2020, most city employees were being sent home without pay for one day per pay period. Some of them — political appointees often in managerial roles — were made to work through their unpaid furlough days.
“So, we were dealing with two issues: the tangible one of [city employees] making less money and then morale issues on top of that – because [employees] are being asked to work under psychological pressure, making less money and being in the pandemic, and being asked to serve the public while doing all of those things,” Giarrusso said.

The city used $32 million in ARPA money to unfurlough workers and pay them back for their lost wages, according to a 2022 report by the Bureau of Governmental Research. The money also allowed the city to raise the wages for city workers.
But Catzen said that far too much of that money went to the New Orleans Police Department, which, as it turned out, didn’t need it.
“I think the city of New Orleans, like many municipalities, leaned too hard on revenue replacement, specifically revenue replacement for the police department,” Catzen said.
In 2021, more ARPA dollars flowed to the New Orleans Police Department than any other city department, BGR found. The money allowed the city to increase the NOPD budget by $17 million, to $181 million from $164 million. The following year, $22 million in ARPA funds initially brought the department’s budget above $200 million, though it was later adjusted to about $170 million.
But the department, which had been bleeding employees and was at its lowest officer count in decades, ended up spending far less both years: $155 million in 2021 and $161 million in 2022, according to city budget reports.
Public safety
Catzen noted that the police department didn’t only receive federal money through revenue replacement. It also received tens of millions more for things like officer recruitment and police cars, all of which fell into the “public safety” ARPA expenditure category.
“We did not then – and I’m not even sure that we do now – have the officers hired to drive these vehicles,” Catzen said.
In fact, public safety was the city’s second most-funded category of ARPA expenditures — behind only revenue replacement — at  $95.29 million, or about a quarter of the city’s ARPA money. This was largely on account of some capital-intensive initiatives, including nearly $30 million toward the modernization of technology in the criminal justice system.
“The Sheriff’s Office was literally running their programs on MS-DOS,” Giarrusso said, referencing an operating system released in the early 1980s. “I think somebody said it was the same programming that gave us Donkey Kong.”
Giarrusso also noted that the city allocated about $26 million in ARPA funds for public safety vehicles, which paid not only for the new police cars, but also new ambulances.
“So many times, people focus on NOPD, but EMS really got a bunch of money for ambulances, like their fleet was in need of upgrading,” Giarrusso said.
The Mayor’s Office defended the decision to dedicate so much money to public safety.
“These investments are vital to ensuring that public employees can efficiently and effectively do their jobs,” a city spokesperson said. “Upgraded equipment, facilities, and vehicles directly impact their ability to respond quickly, operate safely, and serve the community, leading to better outcomes for residents and safer working conditions for frontline workers.”
Kamper, who has studied how different cities and states have spent ARPA money, said that, in his opinion, cities may have chosen to direct their money towards public safety and policing because that is where they are used to directing money.
“To spend it on public safety strikes me as a small-c conservative measure that probably doesn’t have as much of a return as getting money in the pockets of working families through housing help or premium pay or through things like setting up community grocery stores or assisting tenants or building housing,” Kamper said.
Addressing inequities
Getting money into working families’ pockets is precisely what a group of local nonprofits asked the city to do in April 2023.
At the time, the city had yet to allocate about $55 million in ARPA money. It was also sitting on about $300 million in surplus funds.
So three nonprofit groups — the Vera Institute of Justice, the Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center and the New Orleans Workers’ Center for Racial Justice — came to the council with a plan: They wanted the city to spend $147 million to build thousands of units of affordable housing, expand youth programming and offer free public transit, among other items.
“This was an opportunity cities could use to be inventive and transformative, to do things that they always had on their to-do list and never had the resources to do,” Kamper said. “I think upgrading vehicles and building new law enforcement facilities isn’t particularly inventive.”
Kamper pointed to a handful of examples elsewhere that he thought were particularly inventive uses of ARPA money. He said that Charleston, West Virginia, opened a community-run grocery store to address food insecurity. A county in Massachusetts used the federal money to make bus transit free, doubling ridership and cutting complaints in half. Austin, Texas, spent more than $100 million of its ARPA funding addressing homelessness and housing.

In New Orleans, the City Council did not adopt the groups’ $147 million plan.
However, the city did fund a number of equity-minded projects across the city, providing funding for community solar panels and batteries, guaranteed income pilot projects, free transit for youth, and medical debt relief, among other projects. City leaders also dedicated at least $5 million to reducing homelessness in the city, providing funding to close encampments, support low-barrier shelters and rapidly re-house individuals.
And the City Council made substantial investments in affordable housing. The council created a $30 million housing trust fund to help provide gap financing for affordable and workforce housing developments, using $8 million of ARPA money. Voters later approved an amendment to the city charter that made the housing trust fund permanent, this time using money from the general fund, not ARPA.
Despite the many wins, which Catzen happily acknowledges, she still thinks that the city didn’t do enough to involve residents in decision-making and address their fundamental needs.
“We had an opportunity to really flip that script and say in response to the major desperation that Black and brown people and working people were facing that we are going to invest in equity and choose to put our money towards lessening that disparity,” Catzen said. “They had the mandate in the federal policy to do that, and they had the data behind that. And the fact that they really didn’t do that meaningfully is a real missed opportunity.”
But Giarrusso added that everyone wanted a piece of the ARPA pie, and the City Council worked hard to include many different projects in its annual budget. He said that the council was hearing from people on all sides who had big ideas for the money, from poverty reduction to housing to infrastructure to even support for religious communities.
“[ARPA] felt like the Stanley Cup in that we had this money and it passed from stakeholder to stakeholder, because everybody had an interest in it,” Giarrusso said.
The legacy of ARPA
The impact ARPA had on New Orleans might be a little boring, Giarrusso admits, but it was still a boon for the city: Not only did the city avoid financial catastrophe, but it also managed to build up its financial reserves and bonding capacity.
“My view is that the city is as financially healthy as it’s ever been,” Giarrusso said, “which then for the next administration gives them way more runway to do bigger, more visionary capital project things and even nuts-and-bolts projects that just need to be done.”
But Rebecca Mowbray, president of the Bureau of Governmental Research, cautioned that some of the ARPA spending may have given residents the wrong impression about the state of the city’s finances. While she acknowledged that the city did avoid financial catastrophe, she said that it also used ARPA money to fund things it should’ve already been funding, like catch basin cleaning. And by funding so many new initiatives, the city may have created more financial obligations in the future, Mowbray cautions.
“It’s interesting that this program, which was supposed to give money out to local jurisdictions to help them stay liquid and insulate governments and residents from some of the risks of the pandemic, could actually end up creating some financial risk if we’re on the hook for new programs even if the city doesn’t have the money on a recurring basis,” Mowbray said.
But as New Orleans prepares for a number of challenges, including the potential withdrawal of federal funding by the Trump administration and threats of further attacks by the state government, Catzen said she hopes residents still feel empowered to advocate for how they want the city to spend the money it does have.
“This period of austerity means that what we do with our money that we raise here – and that we can do whatever we want with – will be all the more important,” Catzen said. “And so it is within the jurisdiction of the city and within their responsibility to spend the money that we have to meet the needs of the people.”

Rain is pelting the cherry orchards at Wunsch Farms on the Old Mission Peninsula.
Michal Peterson is wearing a full suit of rain gear. On the back of a flatbed truck are bee hives, stacked two or three high and dripping wet in the downpour. Peterson uses a Hummerbee forklift — “pretty much a forklift on steroids” — to offload them and drop them off around the rows of budding cherry trees.
He hands me a veil so I don’t get stung.

Peterson works for Hilbert’s Honey, Co., distributing beehives on orchards across northern Michigan, work he’s been doing for 18 years.
“The wild honeybees aren’t really around much. You got some butterflies, the monarchs and the bumble bees, but it’s just another extra pollination to insure the farmer,” he said.
Pollination is an essential part of many farming operations. That’s because pollinators — from bees to bugs to birds — are crucial for plant growth and reproduction.
Cherry trees, for example, need pollination in order to develop: More pollination means more fruit.
And the honeybees Peterson is setting up in northern Michigan are actually from Florida.
Commercial honeybees are considered livestock by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and shipping colonies to different crops around the country is a common practice. For instance, hundreds of thousands of colonies were sent to California’s almond orchards in 2017.
But the process comes with complications and concerns.
European honeybees are not native to North America, and can disrupt ecosystems and out-compete native species for resources. Non-native bees face a number of threats as well: pesticides, diseases and parasites, and weather. Some years have seen high mortality rates, including this year, when some commercial operations reported high losses.
Peterson said they coordinate with those running the farm to reduce their bees’ exposure to pesticides.
“He tells me when he’s done spraying, and I can put the bees in,” said Peterson. “Right now, they’re probably going to spray after it stops raining, for fungicide or whatever. That don’t really hurt the bees. It’s the poisons that they put out.”

Tens of thousands of bees teem inside one of the hives. Hilbert’s hives usually have between 30,000 and 100,000 bees. They generally try to place the hives in the orchards when it’s cool out — early morning or late evening — so the bees are less active. On a chilly, rainy day that’s less of a concern.
The cherry trees aren’t yet in bloom.
“By next week, you’ll start seeing them kind of popcorn out of their shell and have white buds coming out,” Peterson said. “So this is about the right time, as you can see, the rain don’t stop me. [The bees] have to go in a certain time so they can get acclimated to their surroundings.”
When Peterson began, he was in between jobs, and knew he wanted to work outside. His brother-in-law, a fifth generation beekeeper, reached out to ask him for help.
“I learned from the best, I feel,” he said.
Peterson clearly loves his job. “The view is amazing,” he said, though we couldn’t see much in the downpour.
“While I’m putting in bees, it’s really beautiful out here,” he said. “I always get excited when I have to put bees in the cherries.”

Hilbert’s Honey is based in Traverse City and LaBelle, Florida, and Peterson is trying to get back down to Florida to make a second trip — his second this season.
He and his family rear queen bees in Florida and help pollinate watermelon crops there as well.
“I have a list of pollinations to do, and I’m almost done with this one,” he said. “We do pollination up [US-31] and all the way up north of Northport. We try to stay local, try to help the local farmers. We also do almond pollination in the wintertime in California,” he said.
“The bees travel more than we do.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bee-hive-1024x743.jpg,,,2025-05-03 12:10:05.167085

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”
Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 
‘Generational change’ to taxes
While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 
An uneven tax burden
Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

And this story took place when my husband and I lived in town, but wanted to experiment with farming. So, we partnered with Joe and Lonna, a farming couple that lived just outside of Ames, Iowa at Onion Creek Farm. We decided to go all in and raise a handful of sheep together.
You know, Joe and Lonna have a history of putting up with crazy young people who want to experiment with different farming ideas. So, we thought, let’s do this.
And we decided to rent a ram, like we had done a couple winters in the past. We didn’t keep a ram year-round to breed our ladies. We just wanted to rent one for a few weeks every December, so we’d end up with lambs the next spring.

Joe and Lonna are vegetable farmers by trade, but they were really into the idea of letting livestock graze their veggie fields at certain times of the year to get that fertility, build up the soil, et cetera. It was a great partnership. It had gone smoothly for several years.
Well, this year, Joe and I took a livestock trailer, hauled it down to another farmer’s place to pick up this ram that we were renting. And, you know, hauling a livestock trailer is a whole feat in itself. And, honestly, the day had gone super smoothly. We were really proud of ourselves.
We dropped off some sheep at another farm on the way, and here we are picking up this ram to take back to Joe and Lana’s farm. Great, wonderful. It all went super smoothly.
By the time we got back, it was almost dark. And we backed the trailer up into the fenced-in pasture. The ladies are there waiting for their fellow. And we’re just so, so happy the day has gone really well.
We get out of the truck. As we open the back door to the trailer, this ram — whom I’m convinced has springs built into its hoofs — this ram soars over the fence that we have set up, disregarding the females waiting there to be bred.
No, it doesn’t matter. This ram soars over this fence like a reindeer pulling Santa’s sleigh.
It’s dusk. And luckily, the ram was white because we could see the white speck running into the woods, just getting further and further away from us. So, of course, I take a bucket of grain, but then again, these are grass-fed animals. They’ve never been trained to pellets or grain of any sort, but I do what I can.
I take a bucket of grain into the woods. I try to call this animal. I’m running through the woods at night. There’s no way. I cannot find this animal at all, so I decide I’ll be back first thing in the morning, crack of dawn.
And let’s hope that the ram is just standing at the fence line, smells the ladies ready to get back in, or better yet, has already jumped back in with the ladies. That’ll probably happen. I’ll come back in the morning.

After a sleepless night I show up, crack of dawn. There’s no ram in the pasture. There is no ram to be seen. This is when we realize, okay, this is going to be a little bit more serious of a situation than your average.
Like I said, this is right before Christmas. For the next six days, we are just on edge with trying to track this ram down. We do everything someone does when an animal escapes.
You call all the neighbors. You call the animal control of the county we were in and the next county over. We don’t know how far this thing’s going to get. We check Ames Facebook group incessantly to see if anyone’s had a ram sighting.
You know, we call our friends. We’re going to call the sheriff. We’ve got to report this animal so we can get this thing back. We spend our days searching through cornfields and forests around the farm, looking for this animal to see if we can find any sort of clues.
And then by the time night falls, we decide, all right, we can’t really look much more.
Let’s retire for the night, see what happens tomorrow. Maybe we’ll get a call.
Christmas carols don’t ease missing-sheep anxiety
A couple days before Christmas, we get invited to go over to sing Christmas carols in front of a fireplace at a friend’s house. And we thought, you know what, let’s get our minds off of this. This will be really nice to just go sing some Christmas songs.
So we get there. We’re drinking hot cocoa. We’re doing the things. We’re trying to forget about the circumstance. And we’re singing these songs and I realized that there’s like multiple Christmas carols that have the lyrics, shepherds watching o’er their flocks.
And I am like, okay, this isn’t helping and I need to leave. This is not fun for me anymore. So that didn’t work out.
We also realized family Christmas is canceled. Like we can’t get out town now. We have to stay. Can’t visit the family because we got this ram on the loose, and we don’t even own the ram, right? If we owned it, different story, I wouldn’t care as much, but we’re borrowing the ram.
Okay, so then we get a call. We get a call on December 23rd, a couple days before Christmas, that the ram has been spotted on a golf course north of town. Hallelujah, we drive straight to the golf course. Wonderful.
Ram plays through
And it’s great that this ram’s on the golf course. There’s still some grass to graze.
All the ponds are aerated, so the ram has water to drink. And I’m like, you know, it could live its whole life there, I guess.
We’re going to figure out how to get it. And so, of course, what do we do?
We call our friends. We get people to help us. We go get our mobile netting, like all of our rolls of net fencing. We’re just going to fence this ram and get it into the trailer and that’ll be it.
All right. We start to execute this plan and we realize that this ram has like the largest flight zone of any livestock I’ve ever worked with in my life. Usually a flight zone should be, oh, let’s say, 10 to 20 feet. This thing’s like 300 feet. And it is so skittish.
And there’s no way. There’s no way with a wall of human people. Are we going to get this ram? There’s no way with putting fencing around this animal.
The golfers on the golf course, on the other hand, they all think this is hilarious. They’re like, this is a new challenge for us. This is hilarious. We get to golf with the sheep and they’re laughing and they’re like, oh, are you the owners of the sheep?
And you know, I was not feeling the holiday spirit like these people were, but I’m glad it could provide some entertainment.
Then this is really when the spiral and the mad madness begins.
Lasso’s a no-go
I call the ISU rodeo Club. Iowa State University Rodeo Club.
Of course, they’re on Christmas break, okay? No one’s there to help lassoing.

Then I we have a friend who says, you know what, my dad grew up on a ranch in Colorado. He is a lasso master.
He dusted off his old trusty lasso and he came out to the field and we’re like, okay, this is it, this is it.
He said, “Let me go by myself. Let me try this.”
He’s very calm.
I am not calm at this moment.
So I stay in the parking lot.
He walks out with his lasso and he comes back very quickly after and says, “There’s no way I’m getting close enough to lasso this ram.
Okay, so that’s out.
Then I’m making a call to the sheriff, asking the sheriff if he can tranquilize this animal.
Sheriff tells me, sorry, ma’am, but if the ram is not deemed a danger to society, we cannot tranquilize within city limits.
Okay. So then the tranquilizer gun is that the top of my Christmas list? Didn’t expect that, okay? And they’re expensive. I’m looking into what I need to do to buy this tranquilizer gun.
Okay. So none of that worked.
Here we are Christmas Day. We do our thing in the morning. We celebrate Christmas, still don’t have this ram.
We get through the holiday and then the breakthrough happened, December 26th.
Ram busts into church
We get a call that the ram has now been spotted at the mega church across the street from the golf course.
We get the call and so does Joe, the farmer, who lives closer to the church.
We’re both on our way to the church.
Joe, somewhat unfortunately, gets there before us because we had just gone to the airport to pick up a friend who’s visiting us. We’re getting there as quick as we can.
And the janitor at this church day after Christmas is cleaning up. They had a bunch of people there the night before.
This is a huge church, so there’s these massive windows and massive glass doors.
And the janitor hears boom, boom, boom. And he thinks someone’s breaking into the church. I got to go see what’s going on. But it’s like morning time, daylight. He looks out the window and there’s a ram ramming its reflection in the window, probably about to bust through this window.
Turns out this holy lamb of God had been across the street at the golf course. Full-sized window there. He’d walked through a glass door there, completely shattered it already.
And this is the true Christmas miracle.
The janitor is also a farmer and somehow he goes outside and manages to hog tie the ram up. This ram is tied with its hoofs with some twine and rope, and it is now ready for pickup.
Joe, the farmer, gets there before we do, like I said, and he loads the ram up in the back of his truck and goes back to the farm.
Okay.
Visiting pal pukes
We are driving as fast as we can back from this airport with this friend. It is important to mention who the friend is. The friend is a photographer from LA. Artsy type. He is an Iowa boy, but he doesn’t spend much time on farms anymore. So, you know, he’s not used to chasing a ram on a farm.
We go directly from the airport to the farm as we’re speeding and bumping down the gravel road. We start to see Joe standing there next to a fence, and then we see the ram scaling the fence and starting to fly over it, and escape again.
And this time he’s running off towards the same woods with a rope dangling from the back of his hoof, and that’s when my husband just throws the car in park, and runs out sprinting.
I’ve never seen this guy run this fast, sprinting as fast as he can to capture by hand this ram, so he doesn’t escape again after he’s been on the loose for six days.
And then Rob, the photographer, decides to help, what else can he do? He starts sprinting. And okay, luckily, there was a loose piece of old barbed wire and the ram got caught up in it.
And at that moment, my husband Omar was able to just manhandle the ram, just lay flat his whole body weight on the animal, and then grab the rope and start tying him up again.
And we look back, Rob, the photographer, he’s vomiting. He’s puking all over the field because he didn’t expect this. I’m just standing there like I can’t quite see what’s happening in the woods with the ram and Omar.
I don’t know what to do.
Anyway, Omar emerges from the woods, carrying a ram who is squirming and trying to get away.
I will tell you that the heroes of this story are Omar and the janitor.
I have no idea what happened between the pick up at the mega church and the escape back at the farm. That doesn’t matter anymore. These details don’t matter. What matters is that we obviously realized that we’re not going to use this ram for breeding.
We’re not going to spread those genetics on.
Then we put that ram immediately in the back of the truck and we drove it back to its home farm. We returned that ram never to see it again.
And I do just want to say that, you know, it’s a true Christmas miracle that we got that ram back in one piece.
We did not have to sacrifice its life during this process.
And I also want to thank Joe and Lonna for allowing us to bring this madness to their farm.
And I want to thank all farmers who are willing to put up with a little bit of madness from young beginning farmers.

Some legislators would like to put an end to that.  The prevailing wisdom in the Legislature seems to be that voters here are suffering from “ballot fatigue.” They claim voters are just sick and tired of all the initiated […],"Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, speaks with another lawmaker on the House floor during the Governor's Budget Address on Dec. 3, 2024. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota citizens have had the right to petition issues on to the ballot since 1898. Some legislators would like to put an end to that. 
The prevailing wisdom in the Legislature seems to be that voters here are suffering from “ballot fatigue.” They claim voters are just sick and tired of all the initiated measures and constitutional amendments on the ballot. 
In reality, “ballot fatigue” is just a legislative code phrase for “let’s make it so tough to get an issue on the ballot that citizens will just give up.” That was the impetus behind House Joint Resolution 5003, a constitutional amendment that’s already on the ballot for 2026. 
The measure was sponsored by an irony-impaired Republican representative from Sioux Falls, John Hughes. Hughes didn’t think it was at all odd to say that voters were “fatigued” by the seven 2024 ballot issues, all the while sponsoring his own constitutional amendment for the 2026 election. 
Lawmaker assertions about voter fatigue don’t stop them from sending four measures to the ballot

Hughes’ ballot measure calls for constitutional ballot issues to need 60% of the vote to be enacted. Currently those measures have to get just more than 50% to become part of the constitution. (There’s more irony to go around. Hughes placed his 60% amendment on the ballot in chambers where all he needed to do was convince just more than half of his colleagues it was a good idea. In 2026, if the 60% threshold is approved by voters, it will need just more than 50% of the votes cast.)
Lawmakers had quite a time with ballot issues during the 2025 legislative session. They may be suffering from their own version of ballot fatigue as they considered 11 ballot issues, ultimately placing four of them on the 2026 ballot. There’s another legislative session before the next election. That’s another chance for lawmakers to endorse even more ballot measures. 
A check of the Secretary of State’s website shows there are already six other ballot issues waiting in the wings for the 2026 ballot. Their backers will try to get them on the ballot the old-fashioned way: by collecting the signatures of registered voters. It takes 17,508 signatures to get an initiated measure on the ballot and 35,017 signatures before voters can consider a constitutional amendment. 
There’s a stark disparity between the relative ease that lawmakers have if they want to get a measure on the ballot and the drudgery of collecting thousands of signatures for citizen-led ballot efforts. 
If voters are suffering from ballot fatigue, perhaps lawmakers are suffering from “ballot envy,” an anguish rooted in the realization that there are people in the state with far more will and determination than they have when it comes to getting an issue before the voters. 
When they talk about ballot fatigue, lawmakers would have you believe that they want to protect voters from the chore of making a few extra choices on Election Day. The real definition of ballot fatigue is that lawmakers are tired of seeing issues appear and reappear on the ballot that don’t conform to their worldview. Given the current Republican super-majorities in both chambers, there’s no other way than through a ballot initiative for citizens to get issues like abortion and marijuana legalization in front of voters. 
For Republicans, it’s not the voting that’s tiring but the effort it takes every two years to fight off ideas that they find disagreeable. They point to the cavalcade of political commercials as a bad thing rather than celebrating the notion that political messages are just our free speech rights in action.
Of course ballot fatigue is a play on words, substituting the word ballot for battle. But South Dakotans are in a real battle to keep their access to the ballot. It’s a battle in which we can’t afford to get fatigued.
