(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said he plans to file the first Iowa Farm Act, to support farmers and rural communities in the state with tax relief, expanded economic opportunities and enhanced biosecurity.  
Naig, in an interview Wednesday with Iowa Capital Dispatch, said the bill is like a federal farm bill in that it “comprehensively brings in multiple facets” of farm and rural policy into one bill. 
“I think there’s value in having something that really cuts across and brings together the diverse, different interests of agriculture,” Naig said. “What that allows us to do, too, is to then have a platform, have a vehicle that we can talk to legislators about … a nice opportunity to create a focal point for ag and ag policy during a session.”

The bill includes provisions for expanded economic opportunities for farmers, tax relief for farm families, support for beginning farmers and ranchers and strengthened biosecurity procedures. Naig said the policies in the bill were derived from conversations with different groups across Iowa about their priorities. 
Naig said while the Iowa Legislature moves a “tremendous amount” of ag-related policy each session, the bill comprises priorities from small groups like Iowa beekeepers and specialty crop farmers with the ag needs from livestock and row crop commodity groups. 
Naig has been Iowa secretary of agriculture since 2018 and is seeking reelection in 2026.
Economic opportunities
According to a news release from the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, the bill seeks to expand economic opportunities for farmers by modernizing zoning exemptions and agritourism definitions to better support on-farm operations. Specifically, the department notes activities like value-added processing and direct-to-consumer marketing should be acceptable exemptions. The news release also said Christmas tree farms should be “explicitly” included in agritourism liability protections. 
The bill would make permanent the Choose Iowa School Purchasing Pilot Program. The pilot program helps schools to purchase locally grown and raised products, which in turn, helps farmers to have a consistent local buyer.
Specialty crop and small-sized farm operations advocated for the program to be permanently funded in the 2025 legislative session after the Trump administration ended a similar federal program. 
The measure was proposed as an amendment to the state’s budget for agriculture and natural resources, but was not accepted. The pilot program awarded 33 schools a total of $70,000 in funding in May. 
The farm act would prioritize young and beginning farmers in the state’s Choose Iowa grant programs, and “provide flexibility” to expand Choose Iowa marketing opportunities.
In addition to the Iowa Farm Act, IDALS said in a release it plans to ask for a 1.6% budget increase, about $1.3 million, to maintain “essential operations.” 
Naig said the decision to pull some of these issues out of the budget proposal and into the Iowa Farm Act gives legislators some “optionality” and puts a “focus” on the different ag policy issues the department sees.
Tax provisions 
The bill has several tax provisions, including one that expands farmer rental income tax exemptions for retired farmers to include “modern” business structures like S corporations, trusts and estates. 
It would also eliminate the grain excise tax, which is currently paid on a per-bushel basis to the local property tax system.

Naig said while the grain excise tax is technically paid by grain dealers, it “tends to get passed on to farmers in one form or another.” Eliminating the tax, he said, would help farmers and also increase government efficiency by alleviating the need for the state to collect and then redistribute the taxes to counties. 
Naig said the elimination of the credit would likely have an impact on local governments, but he said that implication would be part of broader property tax discussions planned in the Legislature. 
The legislative proposal, which is not yet filed, was supported in the news release by officials from livestock, dairy, propane and row crop commodity groups. 
Mark Mueller, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said in the release that the package “addresses the real needs facing rural communities today.” 
“We are especially encouraged by the focus on modernizing regulations, delivering tax relief and growing new markets for Iowa corn and other farm products,” Mueller said. 
The farm act would also exempt sales tax on the purchase of honey bees, bringing the industry in line with tax protocols for other livestock industries. The Iowa honey industry has asked for this change for several years. 
The bill would exempt storage tanks under 91,000 gallons from property taxes. 
Naig said some provisions of the Iowa Farm Act have low or no cost to the state, but the overall price tag for the act won’t be known until the fiscal notes are released.
The farm act also has provisions around biosecurity. Naig said these were included in response to the ongoing outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which since February 2022 has impacted more than 185 million commercial and backyard birds. 
The bill would “safeguard” producer confidentiality during foreign animal disease outbreaks in an attempt to increase early reporting. It would also authorize the state to lease space for equipment used to respond to outbreaks. 
Josh Berg, president of the Iowa Turkey Federation, applauded these sections of the proposed policy and said they are “critical” to responding to a foreign animal disease outbreaks. 
“These forward-thinking provisions will enhance Iowa’s ability to support Iowa’s family farmers during times of crisis,” Berg said.
Naig said the bill text is still being finalized, but he is “hopeful” the Iowa Farm Act will become law this legislative session. 
“We’ve been briefing and talking with (leadership) throughout the process,” Naig said. “We respect the legislative process. This is something that I can do, is to introduce a bill and introduce these concepts and then work to secure passage of that. Very hopeful that we see a large percentage of this actually make it across the finish line and signed by the governor.”

(Getty Images)Indiana could join a growing number of states scrutinizing ultra-processed foods in schools under legislation heard Wednesday that would restrict certain additives in student meals and snacks.
House Bill 1137, authored by Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis, would apply to any public school that participates in a federally funded or assisted meal program. 
Beginning with the 2027-28 school year, those schools could no longer serve or sell foods or beverages containing certain additives during the school day, including in cafeterias and vending machines, nor allow third-party vendors to do so.
Some examples might include sugary cereals, chicken nuggets, chips and applesauce.
Schools would also be required to post their breakfast and lunch menus on their websites, along with ingredient lists for each item.
“This is a healthy school lunch bill,” McGuire told members of the House Education Committee. “What we serve kids at school isn’t just about lunch. It’s about their health, their ability to learn and the long-term future of our children.”
McGuire said she expects amendments to be finalized and considered next week, before the committee decides whether to advance the bill to the full House.
‘Low-hanging fruit’
McGuire framed the proposal as a response to what she called a growing childhood chronic disease crisis, pointing to rising rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes and metabolic disease among children.
“Ultra-processed foods now make up a huge share of what kids eat every day, and for many students, school meals account for nearly half of their daily calories,” she said. “In fact, about 65% of food served through the school lunch program are considered ultra-processed.”

The bill’s current draft defines “ultra-processed” foods as those containing one or more of 13 listed ingredients, including potassium bromate, propylparaben, titanium dioxide, several synthetic food dyes, and preservatives such as BHT and TBHQ. 
Many of those additives, McGuire said, have been linked in research to cancer risks, endocrine disruption or effects on attention and brain development.
“These ingredients are inflammatory,” she said later in the hearing. “They are leading to chronic disease, and so this is kind of low-hanging fruit to try to get to start on it.”
McGuire told lawmakers she plans to amend the bill before a committee vote, however, to avoid putting a formal definition of “ultra-processed” food into state law. She said the change was prompted by concerns about conflicting standards if federal agencies later adopt a different definition from Indiana’s.
“We’re just going to keep a list of ingredients that are prohibited,” McGuire said, “so that way, we don’t have that conflict.”
Still, the bill includes several exceptions. 
Schools could still sell foods containing the listed ingredients as part of fundraising events, as long as sales occur at least 30 minutes after the end of the school day. McGuire said the carveout is meant to preserve concession stands at athletic events. Parents would also remain free to send such foods with their children during the school day.
“We can’t control what a parent sends in with a school lunch,” McGuire said. “That becomes parental choice.”
Mixed support in public testimony
Supporters argued that the bill takes a “measured” approach and gives schools ample time to comply. Changes would not take effect until the 2027-28 school year, allowing districts to renegotiate food service contracts and work with vendors.
“This bill provides districts the necessary time to review their contracts, work with vendors and make changes without any disruption to school meal service for students and their families,” said Cindy Long, executive director of the Indiana Association of School Principals, which supports the bill.
Long said that posting menus and ingredients online would additionally help build parent trust. 
The Indiana Small Rural Schools Association also testified in support, while urging lawmakers to consider policies that expand farm-to-school programs and local food sourcing.

Separately, Josh Trenary, with the Indiana Pork Producers Association, said his organization opposes the bill “in its current form.” He argued that focusing solely on a list of additives fails to account for why some processing occurs.
“There’s more to evaluating the value of a food product than just creating a static list of additives,” Trenary said. 
He pointed specifically to BHT, which he said is used in some pork processing to prevent fats from turning rancid. 
“If a food is nutrient dense and it’s being processed in some way to either improve safety, shelf life or nutrient availability, it shouldn’t be regulated according to this approach,” Trenary continued.
The Indiana State Poultry Association took a neutral position but echoed concerns about ensuring that high-protein foods such as eggs and turkey products are not inadvertently excluded from school menus.
McGuire maintained that alternatives to certain preservatives already exist and are being used by major retailers and restaurant chains. 
“We’re asking for producers to choose different alternatives,” she said. “This is coming down the line.”
The bill also drew questions about whether Indiana is moving faster than the federal government, which is studying ultra-processed foods and food additives.










We’re asking for producers to choose different alternatives. This is coming down the line.


– Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis


Rep. Sheila Klinker, D-Lafayette, asked whether the state should wait for more specific federal guidance.
McGuire said the delayed implementation date in her bills allows time to adjust if federal standards change.
“If, through the course of the year, something comes out about one of these particular ingredients at the federal level, we can still address that,” she said.
Officials from the Indiana Department of Health testified in support of the bill and said the agency is continuing its own review of food dyes, additives and ultra-processed foods.
“We are supportive of the transparency language and allowing parents to know what’s in their school lunches,” said Rachel Swartwood, the department’s chief of policy for health and family services. She said the measure aligns with Gov. Mike Braun’s “Make Indiana Healthy Again” initiative.
About 90% of Indiana public schools participated in the federally-funded National School Lunch Program in fiscal year 2025, according to a legislative fiscal analysis, but any financial impact on schools would depend largely on future contract terms negotiated with food service vendors.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 19:00:05+00:00,CT Mirror,CT DMV commissioner calls for more reforms to towing law,Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/connecticut-towing-dmv-proposal-update/,The recommendations would require more notifications to car owners and streamline the process for selling unclaimed vehicles in CT.,"This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with The Connecticut Mirror. Sign up for Dispatches to get our stories in your inbox every week.
Despite a slew of reforms enacted last year to rein in the practices of towing companies, more needs to be done to protect consumers whose cars face removal and possible sale, the commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles said Tuesday.
DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera laid out five recommendations he plans to make for the legislature to consider during its session that begins in February. The recommendations follow a Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica investigation that exposed how state law for decades favored towing companies at the expense of low-income consumers. They also follow months of meetings with a group of industry and consumer representatives.
The recommendations would require towing companies to make more effort to notify owners that their cars have been towed and streamline the process by which the firms can sell unclaimed vehicles.
The commissioner announced his proposal at the last scheduled meeting of a working group of towing and consumer representatives. The group was created as part of a towing reform law passed last year after the news organizations showed how towing companies were seeking the DMV’s permission to sell some cars after as little as 15 days, one of the shortest time frames in the country. Many low-income residents were towed for minor violations, sometimes from their own apartment complexes, only to lose their cars when they couldn’t afford to get them back before they were sold.
If the legislature adopts the recommendations, towing companies would no longer place values on vehicles that they tow, which now determines whether a tower can start the sales process in 15 days or 45 days. Instead, all cars would be sold at a public auction after 30 days, Guerrera said.
Other recommendations include requiring towing companies to send two letters to the registered owner of the vehicle after it’s towed, one certified and one not. If the car isn’t claimed, towers would have to send a third letter to the owner after 30 days to inform them when and where the auction will be held. The towing companies would be required to either advertise the auction on their websites or publish legal advertisements in local newspapers.
The DMV would also be required to set up a portal on its website listing every towed car so that people can find out which tower has their vehicle, when it was towed and when the auction will be.
If a vehicle receives no bids and the car owner shows up, the towing company would be required to offer the car back to them at whatever their costs are before selling it for scrap.
There was little pushback from industry leaders or consumer advocates on Tuesday even though towing representatives had previously complained that the changes would add costs and consumer lawyers had objected that the recommendations didn’t go far enough to protect drivers.
The proposal also didn’t address the initial task the legislature assigned to the group: how to handle the profits from the sales of towed cars. Currently, towing companies are supposed to hold onto proceeds for a year so owners or lenders can claim them. After that, any unclaimed funds, minus towing fees, are required to be turned over to the state. But CT Mirror and ProPublica found that hasn’t happened in part because the DMV never set up a system to collect the money.
Guerrera said after the meeting that the DMV has set up a process to monitor whether towing companies are turning funds over to the state. He said they won’t know if the system is working until October because the money from sales of towed cars must be held for a year.
After Guerrera finished outlining his proposal, Eileen Colonese, secretary of the industry group Towing & Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, said Guerrera’s plan doesn’t address a key issue: The last registered owner of the vehicle is not necessarily the owner when it’s towed.
“I still believe that until the state of Connecticut comes up with a process to figure out who really owns the vehicles, all of this stuff that we’re doing is pretty much nonsensical because we’re still not notifying the current owner of the vehicle,” Colonese said.
Consumer advocate and attorney Raphael Podolsky said Guerrera’s recommendations are a “step in the right direction, but there’s still a lot of issues that need to be addressed until the system is fixed.”
Guerrera said his plan was “inspired” by the discussions during the previous four committee meetings. He said he hopes the portal on the state’s website will also help DMV personnel better track what towing companies are doing with vehicles.
Under the revised law, which went into effect on Oct. 1, towing companies must now give people warning before removing vehicles from apartment parking lots unless there’s a safety issue. They also must accept credit cards, let people retrieve their belongings and be available on weekends for people to pick up their cars. And although the sales process can begin after 15 days for vehicles worth less than $1,500, towers must wait 30 days before selling them.
Guerrera said he expects that the working group will keep meeting.“I want to have continuous meetings, whether it’s quarterly or twice a quarter, to try and narrow down any issues that come up or that need to be fixed so that we can create a system that works for everybody,” Guerrera said.

Microplastics littering Rhode Island's coastline increased in 2025, according to a new Save the Bay report. (Photo by Pam Gilpin for Rhode Island Current)Cigarette butts strewn across the sand and plastic bottles bobbing in the waves are the most obvious targets of frustration about litter on Rhode Island beaches.
But the button-sized plastic and foam pieces less visible to the casual observer might be a more serious problem. More than 14,000 of these 2.5-or-smaller centimeter pieces were collected from state shorelines as part of 2025 volunteer-led efforts through the International Coastal Cleanup, according to a new report from Save the Bay. 
Tiny trash came in second to cigarette butts, which claimed the dubious honor of no. 1 trash item among the 15,561 pounds of trash collected from September to November 2025. “Other plastic waste” was the third most prevalent, followed by food waste, bottle caps and plastic beverage bottles and cans.
Plastic pellets known as ‘nurdles’ are polluting beaches and waterways

But total cigarette butts, and most types of plastic and glass bottles and cans, decreased compared with cleanup totals in 2024. Plastic and foam pieces, on the other hand, rose in quantity — a potential explanation for why the weight of total trash collected in 2025 was less than the prior year, but the total number of items was higher.
“The data reflects what we are seeing on our shores: lots of single-use items, beverage containers, and plastic and foam pieces caused by materials breaking apart over time,” July Lewis, Save The Bay’s volunteer and internship manager, said in a statement. 
And that’s just what volunteers were able to see with their own eyes.
The tiny pieces of plastic break into smaller and smaller segments, and eventually end up ingested by marine life and people, or pile up at the bottom of Narragansett Bay. A new paper published in the September 2025 Marine Pollution Bulletin by University of Rhode Island researchers found higher concentrations of microplastics in the northern part of Narragansett Bay, correlating to more densely populated urban areas. The same study also showed marshes trapped 10 to 50 times more microplastics than seabeds.
The Save the Bay report highlights ways to “stop plastic pollution at the source,” such as picking up pet waste, bringing a trash bag to the beach and encouraging friends and family to stop littering.
Bottle bill, revisited 
Not mentioned in the six-page report, but top of mind for coastal advocates: a statewide bottle-deposit refund program to incentivize recycling of plastic and glass bottles and cans. 
“The main reason Save the Bay cares about the bottle bill is because of the data you see from our coastal cleanups,” Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, said in an interview Wednesday. “It’s the only real, proven, effective policy to reduce litter from bottle waste.”
Various iterations of a bottle bill have failed to advance in either chamber of the Rhode Island General assembly, despite a two-year review by an 18-member legislative panel, which was unsuccessful in finding common ground between business and environmental groups. 
On the final day of the 2025 session, lawmakers passed what some dubbed a compromise solution, calling for yet another study of the topic – this time, by a third-party consultant hired by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The study is due by Dec. 1, 2026, with an interim status report expected by April 1.
Does that sink bottle bill legislation this year? Not necessarily.
Rep. Carol McEntee, the South Kingstown Democrat who has championed a bottle-deposit program for years, pledged to reintroduce her proposal in 2026, even though the state-commissioned study will not be completed before the session ends in June.
“There’s no reason the Assembly couldn’t pass a bottle bill this year, even with an implementation analysis still going on,” Thorp said. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday. Shekarchi indicated in a Boston Globe interview in December that he wanted to wait until the study was finished before considering additional legislation.
Even if that’s the case, Thorp said having a piece of legislation to point to when educating lawmakers, retailers and the wider public is important.
“We’re not going to let a whole year go by and not do any advocacy on the bottle bill,” Thorp said. “There’s still a lot of education that needs to happen.”
Bonus: robot vacuum 
Save the Bay’s trash collection report reflects cleanups conducted from September to November 2025 by 2,971 volunteers across all five counties. Data might change when the global organizer Ocean Conservancy publishes its final report this summer.
Unusual items documented in the 2025 cleanup report in Rhode Island included a robot vacuum, a bird feeder, a nitrous oxide tank and 220 individual shoes and slippers. 
The 2026 International Coastal Cleanup will take place from September to November. For more information or to sign up to volunteer, visit Save the Bay’s website.

An ICE officer shot a woman driving an SUV through her car window in south Minneapolis on Wednesday morning. The person is dead, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security.
Video of the incident shared with the Reformer shows masked ICE officers approach a Honda Pilot stopped in the middle of Portland Avenue near near 34th Street. One officer tells the driver to “get out of the f*cking car” and tries to open the door. The driver then slowly backs up and appears to be leaving, when another officer fires three shots. The SUV then traveled a short distance before crashing into a parked car.
The witness who took the video, Caitlin Callenson, said she was on a walk when she saw an ICE vehicle stuck in the snow. As more ICE vehicles arrived, bystanders blew whistles in protest, and the driver of the SUV tried to block the ICE vehicles.
Callenson said she did not see ICE agents attempting to detain anyone leading up to or after the shooting.
After the shots were fired, the driver was “then was completely slumped over in the vehicle,” said Emily Heller, another witness. Federal agents wouldn’t allow a man who said he is a physician to examine the driver, Heller said. Emergency medical technicians arrived 15 minutes later, she said.
Tricia McLaughlin, assistant Secretary Dept. of Homeland Security, writing on X, gave a different version of what happened: “One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them — an act of domestic terrorism. An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”

As some federal officers attempted to leave, protestors blocked their vehicle. The officers fired a noxious gas at close range, causing distress and vomiting for many demonstrators and journalists.
Protests are ongoing.
Protesters hurled insults at Minneapolis Police officers, who are not supposed to assist with immigration enforcement, but were on the scene Wednesday morning.
City Council members including Robin Wonsley and Jamal Osman addressed the crowd, saying the area was an active crime scene, and that MPD was present to investigate.
“We are trying to get MPD the f*ck out of here. That is the best way they can be helpful right now,” Wonsley told the demonstrators.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty issued a statement soon after the shooting saying she is “pushing hard for a local investigation which is the only way to ensure full transparency and review by our office.”
U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, a St. Paul Democrat, called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who filmed herself observing ICE actions in Minneapolis on Tuesday, to immediately stop the ICE operation “to restore order and prevent further injuries.”

Southern California Edison recibió 1500 solicitudes para su programa de compensación por incendios de Eaton y sólo ha pagado 82 después de casi dos meses.

Tras poco más de dos meses, Southern California Edison ha logrado atraer a más de 1800 clientes a un programa de compensación destinado a resolver numerosas demandas contra la compañía por el mortal incendio de Eaton. Hasta el lunes, la compañía había presentado ofertas a 82 de los solicitantes, según informó Edison a CalMatters.
La portavoz de Edison, Kathleen Dunleavy, dijo que el ritmo del proceso de las aplicaciones está por delante de lo previsto.
Los sobrevivientes del incendio, que han estado brindando comentarios a Edison desde antes de que lanzara el programa de conciliación, aún tienen fuertes críticas al programa de indemnización de la empresa de servicios públicos, denominado ” Programa de Compensación para la Recuperación de Incendios Forestales “. Se quejan de que este programa exige a los participantes que renuncien a demandas contra la empresa y les impide solicitar más indemnizaciones por reclamaciones de salud relacionadas con incendios. Muchos afirmaron que los límites de pago del programa, que limitan la cantidad que pueden recibir los solicitantes, eran demasiado bajos y permitían a Edison pagar menos de lo que la compañía eléctrica podría adeudar si se le encontrara responsable del incendio.
El incendio de Eaton quemó 14,000 acres del condado de Los Ángeles en enero y causó la muerte de 19 personas. Si bien aún no se ha determinado la causa oficial, una teoría predominante es que el equipo de Edison provocó el incendio. El Departamento de Justicia de EE. UU. se encuentra entre quienes han culpado a la compañía eléctrica por el incendio.
El dinero del seguro y los ahorros personales se están agotando para quienes perdieron sus hogares, su sustento y a sus seres queridos en el incendio, afirman los sobrevivientes y activistas. Muchos se encuentran sin hogar o enfrentan inseguridad habitacional. Una encuestaEditSign estimó que el 80% de los residentes de Altadena seguían desplazados por el incendio en octubre. La Red de Sobrevivientes del Incendio de Eaton , una destacada organización de base, solicitó a EdisonEditSign que proporcionara hasta $200,000 por hogar desplazado, “con base en costos verificados”, para ayudar a cubrir los costos de vivienda.
 “Es responsabilidad de Edison resolver todo esto”, dijo Joy Chen, directora ejecutiva del grupo. “Es su responsabilidad”.
 Hasta noviembre, se habían pagado aproximadamente $7.6 mil millones en reclamaciones de seguros relacionadas con el incendio de Eaton, según las cifras más recientes disponibles del Departamento de Seguros de California. Aproximadamente el 90% del pago correspondió a propiedades residenciales.
 Edison ofreció un total colectivo de 34,4 millones de dólares para resolver las 82 reclamaciones, y ninguna de las ofertas fue rechazada, afirmó.
 En una entrevista con CalMatters, Pedro Pizarro, director ejecutivo de Edison International, afirmó que aproximadamente la mitad de las reclamaciones que recibieron una oferta de Edison hasta diciembre fueron por pérdidas totales, y aproximadamente la otra mitad por daños causados por humo y cenizas. Si bien no proporcionó cifras específicas, Pizarro indicó que las reclamaciones se distribuyeron según la geografía, los niveles de ingresos y el valor de las viviendas. Muchas de las reclamaciones que recibieron ofertas forman parte de la opción de vía rápida del programa.
 En una conferencia de prensa celebrada el 16 de diciembre por la red de sobrevivientes, los residentes desplazados hablaron sobre cómo la inestabilidad habitacional y la pérdida de sus hogares han afectado sus vidas. Gabriel González, propietario de una empresa de plomería, perdió su casa, su negocio y herramientas por un valor aproximado de $80,000 en el incendio. Vivió en su auto durante un largo periodo antes de recibir una pequeña ayuda financiera que le permitió vivir en un lugar de alquiler durante unos meses. Pero se espera que ese dinero se agote este mes.
 “A partir del primero de enero probablemente volveré a estar en mi auto”, dijo en el evento.
 Pizarro informó a CalMatters que Edison no proporcionará fondos a los residentes para vivienda fuera de su programa de compensación, alegando la necesidad de validar los gastos. La solicitud de la red de sobrevivientes para asistencia con los costos de vivienda se limitó a los costos verificables.
 Una crítica al programa fue que los niños no reciben la misma compensación que los adultos. Bajo la versión actual del programa, los niños reciben entre el 50% y el 65% de la compensación que reciben los adultos por la pérdida de su residencia, dependiendo de la categoría del daño. Si su vivienda principal fuera destruida, los adultos recibirían $115,000 y los niños $75,000. Estas tarifas son ligeramente superiores a las de una versión preliminar del plan que Edison publicó en otoño.
 Una carta abierta de la Red de Sobrevivientes del Incendio de Eaton en ese momento decía que dar a los niños una valoración inferior a la de los adultos “trata su sufrimiento como menor cuando, en realidad, es mayor”.
 Pizarro dijo que Edison optó por una valoración más baja porque los niños a menudo no reciben tanto como los adultos en programas similares y los adultos “terminan asumiendo más responsabilidad y más costos” para el hogar y los “arreglos para los niños”.
 “La realidad es que los adultos tienen una carga mucho mayor aquí”, dijo, “y por eso es justo que tengamos más compensación dirigida a los adultos”.
 Otra frustración expresada por los afectados por el incendio fue la exigencia de que los participantes renunciaran a su derecho a demandar a la empresa. Los representantes legales de los sobrevivientes del incendio que demandaron a la empresa advirtieron que el programa de conciliación a través de Edison podría privar a las personas de cualquier indemnización por daños y perjuicios que un tribunal pudiera otorgar, así como de una posible compensación o supervisión médica a largo plazo.
 “Estamos abordando esto como una forma de resolver litigios”, dijo Pizarro. “Es una forma de acuerdo legal, y los acuerdos legales suelen ser acuerdos que resuelven todos los asuntos; de lo contrario, no constituyen realmente una conclusión del litigio”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_28.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 13:59:27.635951

Wes Moore (D) decried a new federal job that showed Maryland lost 25,000 federal jobs in 2025 — the most of any state in the nation. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)State officials are decrying new federal jobs numbers that show Maryland lost more than 10,000 federal jobs over two months at the end of last year, bringing the total jobs lost for the year to 25,000.
The report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that Maryland lost more federal jobs since President Donald Trump took office than any other state in the nation. In sharp remarks Wednesday directed at the Republican administration in Washington, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said  Washington has “broken its pact” with Maryland and with the country.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“Donald Trump ran on a premise that he alone could fix it,” Moore said during the Board of Public Works meeting Wednesday. “What he didn’t tell the American people was that he alone could break it, and the policies that we continue to see from this White House have continued to make all of our lives harder.”
The updated figures reflect job loses from October and November, when the so-called “fork in the road” job buyout took effect, for federal employees who had the opportunity to resign and receive full pay and benefits until the end of September. State officials said it would be not be until after the deadline when the impact of those decisions would start to be seen.
Federal jobs represent about 6% of the state’s total employment and 10% of the state’s overall wages.
“As I said, months into the new Trump Vance administration, what is happening to the state of Maryland that these are not lancing blows. These are direct shots. They are direct shots that are impacting every single corner of our stat,” Moore said.
The numbers released Wednesday do not come as a surprise. The Board of Revenue Estimates last March projected a reduction of as many as 28,000 federal jobs in the state.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Tom Loftus)FRANKFORT — The cost to expand the headquarters of the Republican Party of Kentucky rose above  $4.4 million in the final quarter of 2025 as the project was completed, according to a report filed this week with the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance.
But more large contributions from special interests during the same period allowed the fund to remain easily in balance. The two largest contributions to the fund during the period were $150,000 from tobacco giant Altria Client Services, of Richmond, Virginia,and $50,000 from The Jockey Club, of New York City, according to the new filing by the Republican Party of Kentucky (RPK) Building Fund .
Both Altria and The Jockey Club had made previous contributions to the fund.
Three years ago Kentucky Lantern first reported that the RPK had begun planning and fundraising for the expansion of its headquarters on Third Street in Frankfort and that the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer had donated a stunning $1 million to the effort.

Over the three years a small number of donors — nearly all corporations or other entities with lobbying interests in Washington and/or Frankfort — have made very large contributions totaling more than $4.4 million to pay for the new structure.
The RPK headquarters is named the “Mitch McConnell Building” in honor of Kentucky’s senior senator who is credited with propelling the ascent of the Republican Party to dominance in the state over the last 40 years. McConnell, the longest-serving U.S. Senate leader in history, led Senate Republicans from 2007 until 2025. He announced last year on his 83rd birthday that he would not seek reelection this year, setting off a crowded race to succeed him.
As for the contributions, Adam Hope, spokesman for the RPK, said, “All funding raised for our expansion was done by the book. Contributions to our building fund are a reflection of the strength of our party and the enthusiasm of our supporters, in Kentucky and beyond, who believe in the progress Republicans are making for the betterment of the Commonwealth.”
The project was made possible by a 2017 law passed by the General Assembly in 2017, the first year that Republicans controlled both chambers of the legislature. Before then, corporations were not allowed to contribute to a state political party, and people were restricted to giving no more than $15,000 a year. But the 2017 law allowed parties to create building funds that could accept contributions from corporations or people in unlimited amounts.
The report filed this week by the RPK Building Fund listed $580,000 in expenses during the last three months of 2025. That brought total spending on the project to a bit over $4.4 million.

By far the largest share of spending — about $3.8 million — was paid to contractor Branscum Construction, of Russell Springs. Stengel-Hill Architects, of Louisville, has been paid about $263,000 through 2025, according to the reports. And the third highest expense has been $195,000 paid to Haney Consulting, the political fundraising business run by Laura Haney, a longtime fundraiser for McConnell as well as other Kentucky Republican causes.
The Kentucky Democratic Party reported one major deposit during the last quarter to its building fund of $499,241. This is apparently most of the proceeds from the sale last fall of its old headquarters on Interstate 64. The Kentucky Lantern reported last month that property records filed in Franklin County show that the party sold the old headquarters property for $540,000 and is now headquartered in offices on Ann Street in Frankfort. 
Morgan Eaves, executive director of the Kentucky Democratic Party, said, “Our focus has not been on a big new building but on policy – policy that will help Kentuckians who are losing health care and other basic needs because of things like the Republican Big Beautiful Bill.”

Last year, lawmakers revised the process for challenging ballot language and, in the same legislation, gave the attorney general power to appeal preliminary injunctions blocking enforcement of state laws or regulations.
Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green upheld the provisions on ballot language lawsuits but ruled the new appeals power was an impermissible grant of authority because it was limited to the attorney general.
“There is no compelling governmental interest achieved in allowing only the attorney general to appeal a preliminary injunction where a court has found that a challenged state law is flawed and granted injunctive relief,” Green wrote in his September decision.
In the appeal heard Wednesday, the attorney general’s office sought to undermine the case against the law by arguing that the plaintiff, liberal activist Sean Nicholson, had no standing, or right to sue, over the law. And, Deputy Solicitor General Samuel Freedlund argued, the court  should rule that all the provisions of the law fit easily under the general heading of “judicial proceedings.”
Chiefs in, Royals out: Missouri secretary of state once again catches flak over ballot summary

When the bill was filed in the state Senate, its title said it was about ballot titles written by the General Assembly. The title was changed to be the broader “judicial proceedings” when the bill was amended on the Senate floor.
“The original bill, as introduced, effected judicial proceedings related specifically to ballot title litigation, but this court has made clear, time and time again, that it’s whether the amendments are germane to the overarching purpose,” Freedlund said.
Those arguments ignore constitutional provisions requiring bills to have a single subject, with a clear title, and that everything included in a final version bear a relationship to the subject addressed when the bill was introduced, said Chuck Hatfield, the attorney representing Nicholson.
The legislation, as passed, combined two bills with different subjects and changed provisions of law in two of overarching titles used to organize the statutes, Hatfield noted.
“We think that all of those things point out that the legislature has told us that these were different subjects, these were different purposes,” Hatfield said.
To address the constitutional questions, however, the judges must first resolve whether Nicholson has standing.
Hatfield reminded the court that it has liberally applied the principle of standing in past challenges to state law. 
A person has a right to sue if they are specifically impacted by a new law. The courts also allow any taxpayer to sue if legislation will result in the spending of state funds.
Nicholson satisfies both requirements, Hatfield said. He is a campaign consultant working on ballot measures, so he has a specific interest in how ballot language is determined, he said.
And taxpayer standing doesn’t depend on an identifiable new expense, just that enforcement will cost money, he said.
“You don’t have to show it is tied to a very specific, ‘this amount of money is going to go out the door for this particular thing’,” Hatfield told the judges.
Freedlund, however, said Nicholson was not the correct plaintiff because he is not involved in any pending cases on ballot language and there is no new, direct expense as a result of the law.
“Taxpayer standing requires some sort of direct expenditure,” he argued.
The law is part of a coordinated Republican reaction to liberal ballot initiatives approved by voters enacting laws and constitutional amendments the GOP would not pass through the legislature.
Over the past decade, voters have legalized marijuana, expanded Medicaid eligibility, increased the minimum wage and enacted protections for abortion rights over GOP opposition.
Other legislation to limit the initiative petition process includes a constitutional amendment to change the way majorities are counted that will be on the November ballot and limitations on who can be hired to circulate petitions.
Ballot title challenges are common for both initiative petitions and measures approved for the ballot by lawmakers. Before the new law, if a judge found the ballot language was insufficient or unfairly partisan, the court would revise it.
Under the law, a finding against ballot language means it goes to the secretary of state, who is given up to three chances to rewrite it before the courts take over the job. 
The bill’s provisions governing the revision of ballot language are a reaction to the legal fight over the wording for the abortion rights amendment approved by voters in 2024.
In 2023, Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem ruled the ballot title written by then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft was “argumentative” or unfairly biased and rewrote it. That decision was upheld by the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals.
The first use of the new law was during a challenge to the ballot language written for a constitutional amendment passed by lawmakers that would reimpose Missouri’s near-total ban on abortions. Green rejected the original ballot language written by lawmakers. He approved the second revision made by Hoskins, but that version was rewritten again by the Western District Court of Appeals when it ruled the wording drafted by Hoskins was riddled with errors.
The abortion rights amendment from 2024 was also the spur to lawmakers for the language granting special appeal power to the attorney general. 
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state over laws and regulations that prevented Missourians from immediately accessing abortion following the election. 
Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang found some of the regulations to be unconstitutional under the new abortion rights law and, in two preliminary injunctions, blocked state laws requiring a 72-hour waiting period for abortions, requiring physicians performing abortions have admitting privileges at a local hospital, and requiring a licensing requirement for abortion clinics. 
That allowed surgical abortions to resume but medication abortions, the most common way of ending a pregnancy, are still off-limits.
The case goes to trial next week.
In court on Wednesday, Freedlund defended the grant of power to the attorney general as a reasonable way for the state to protect its interest in seeing that new laws are enforced. 
Green’s ruling incorrectly interpreted how to determine if a law provides equal protections to all people when he ruled against the law, Freedlund said.  
“It’s critical that the circuit court erred at every single step of the analysis, in our view, and any one of those errors was fatal to the trial court’s judgment,” he said.
In his arguments about the powers of the attorney general, Hatfield focused on whether the entire bill should have been tossed out by Green when he found the provision on preliminary injunctions to be unconstitutional.
Instead, Hatfield said, Green severed the bill, allowing the ballot title sections to remain intact while blocking the appeal power section.
Green got that wrong, he said, adding that it will be up to the judges to decide which, if any, provisions remain in law.
“So at the end of the day, like a lot of your cases,” Hatfield said, “this is sort of about line drawing.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20240404_122730-scaled-e1712257678774-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-07 13:59:27.635951

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas legislators will pursue a statewide school cell phone ban, superseding the state education board’s past directives to allow local districts to deal with cell phones as they see fit.
The initiative already has the support of two-thirds of the Senate, according to a joint announcement from Sens. Chase Blasi, an Andale Republican, and Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat.
If passed into law, Senate Bill 302 would require each local school board and nonpublic school’s governing authority to create policies dictating student cell phone use during instructional time by Sept. 1.
The bill establishes a bell-to-bell mandate, requiring students to power off and store any personal electronic communication devices, and it forces districts to create disciplinary actions and enforcement procedures for any violations. It also allows districts to limit or prohibit cell phone usage during school-sponsored activities that take place outside of normal school hours.
The bill will be a “high priority,” the Tuesday announcement said. It was filed less than a week before the start of the 2026 legislative session.
“Phone-free schools give students space to think, build authentic human relationships and protect student mental health from constant digital pressure,” Blasi said. “The longer phones stay in classrooms, the harder it becomes to undo the damage.”
If the legislation becomes law, it would override local boards’ existing policies if incongruous with the state’s mandates. It also could bolster the Kansas State Board of Education’s previous guidance.
The board unanimously approved a list of recommendations in December 2024 that encouraged districts to adopt bell-to-bell policies that mandate K-12 students’ personal cell phones be powered off from the beginning of the school day to the end, including during lunch and passing periods, and stored in an off-limits location. The recommendations highlighted a need for greater mental health support and parental oversight.
A student can use a device if it is necessary for an education or specialized instruction program or if a doctor deems it medically necessary to support a student’s health and well-being. Students are allowed to contact their parents or guardians through a school telephone, according to the bill’s text.
Sykes said the legislation helps strengthen Kansas schools and teachers.
“Studies show that classrooms without phones have more engaged students leading to face-to-face conversations, stronger peer relationships, safer school environments and better academic outcomes,” she said.
Teachers are not prohibited from using personal communication devices at school, but the bill does require new policies banning school employees “from privately or directly communicating with any student via a social media platform for official school purposes.” A school board or nonpublic school authority can approve a social media platform to be used for official school purposes, the bill said. Private, direct communications are not encompassed in “official school purposes.”
Carrie Rahfaldt, a spokesperson for House Speaker Dan Hawkins, said he is supportive of the legislation.

(National Weather Service photo, courtesy of Candyse Arivett)Gov. Larry Rhoden has asked the federal government to help pay for more than $1.7 million in damage to public property in South Dakota caused by a storm last month.
Wind gusts of 100 miles an hour or more tore through large swaths of western South Dakota and eastern Wyoming Dec. 17-18, causing what a press release from Rhoden’s office called “severe infrastructure damage.” 
Pennington, Custer and Fall River counties were among the most affected, the release says. The National Weather Service logged the highest wind gusts in recorded history at the agency’s monitoring sites in eastern Rapid City and the Rapid City airport during the storm, at 91 and 94 miles per hour, respectively. The top wind gust recorded by the agency during the storm was 101 miles per hour at a location 4 miles south of downtown Rapid City.
Some residents in the Black Hills experienced power outages that lasted a week, according to the weather service.
Rhoden’s disaster declaration, signed on Wednesday, opens the door to possible assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
If FEMA approves the declaration, it could pick up as much as 75% of the price of repairs to public property. Counties would pay 15% of repair costs; the state would pay 10%. 
To qualify for federal aid, an incident must cause at least $1.7 million in damage to public property. The December storm’s damage tally thus far “exceeds that amount,” Rhoden’s press release says.

(Photo by Getty Images)Lawmakers are considering a proposal that could help Maine renters lower electricity costs through the use of solar energy.
State Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock) said LD 1730 would allow for small, plug-in solar units so renters and other Mainers can access the renewable energy source without the large upfront investment of traditional panels and without adding costs to the state or other ratepayers. 
“For many of my neighbors, especially those who rent their homes or live in apartments, solar panels seem meant for someone else,” Grohoski said. “If you don’t own your roof or you don’t have thousands of dollars for an upfront investment, the savings that solar generates can feel out of reach.”
When introducing the bill to the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee during a public hearing Tuesday afternoon, she said these sorts of units cost less to install than traditional roof panels and don’t require any permanent modifications to the property.
Lawmakers in Vermont and New Hampshire are also looking into welcoming these systems, which have already taken off in Europe. More than a million such units have been deployed in Germany.
Grohoski said the portable solar devices would not be included in the state’s net energy billing program because they don’t contribute power back to the grid. Though, the proposal does include a notification process so utilities can know where the units are located for load planning purposes.
Net energy billing, a credit program developed to incentivize the adoption of renewable energy, has been scrutinized in recent years for contributing to rising energy costs, though state officials say the volatility of natural gas prices is a more significant driver. 
The state Department of Energy Resources testified in favor of Grohoski’s proposal Tuesday. Public Advocate Heather Sanborn described these devices as “another tool for affordability” that should be brought into the mix for Maine ratepayers.
“This is not a solution to affordability writ large,” Sanborn said. “This is just another tool in our toolbelt to allow for an all-of-the-above approach to affordability.”
This focus on costs comes as Central Maine Power and Versant customers are slated to see their bills increase by an average of $13 to $17, according to an analysis by the Office of Public Advocate. 
Last month, utility regulators redesigned and expanded eligibility for a program that helps low-income Mainers pay their electric bills. 
Versant Power is opposed to the plug-in solar proposal. The utility said such technology necessitates more robust safety certifications and requirements from the National Electrical Code, which sets the country’s standards for electrical design and installation. However, Versant said it supports customers being able to utilize that sort of technology.
Grohoski’s proposal outlines multiple safety standards. For example, it would include provisions to protect utility line workers and require systems to limit combined output to ensure they don’t overload standard household units.
The bill would also require new buildings with four or more units to provide outdoor outlets so future renters could utilize small solar devices more easily. 
“It’s about giving a person on a third floor apartment the same power to lower their electricity bill as a homeowner who has a south-facing roof,” Grohoski told the committee.
Given the relatively small amount of electricity these devices typically use — it was compared to an air conditioner or a hair dryer (depending on exact size of the unit) by experts during the public hearing — some committee members raised questions as to why this legislation is even needed. 
Versant said it appreciated the notification process outlined in the bill and argued the legislation is necessary since it would exempt these solar devices from the interconnection process and standards.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2169269955-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 12:59:04.558689

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) A former University of Iowa Hospitals physician is appealing a court decision tied to an Iowa Board of Medicine investigation into his conduct.
In 2021, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Shafik N. Wassef, 42, an Iowa-licensed physician who formerly practiced in Iowa City, with violating patient privacy standards.
A year later, in March 2022, the board amended and expanded its statement of charges in the case, charging Wassef with the added offenses of professional incompetence, practicing in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public, and unprofessional conduct.

The board has not publicly disclosed any of the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges.
In 2024, the board agreed to hand the case off to an administrative law judge. Wassef then sought summary judgment in the matter, which would have resulted in dismissal of the charges before the planned disciplinary hearing could be held.
The administrative law judge denied the request for summary judgment, which prompted Wassef to file a petition in Polk County District Court, seeking judicial review of that decision.
Polk County District Judge David Nelmark then ordered that all court records that “describe the (board’s) investigation and/or the factual basis of the disciplinary charges” against Wassef be sealed from public view.
In a recent ruling, Nelmark granted the state’s request to dismiss Wassef’s lawsuit.
In doing so, Nelmark noted that while he would “not go into the alleged wrongdoing” in the case, the board’s allegations against Wassef “involve HIPAA violations” — a reference to the federal Health Information Portability and Accountability Act, which protects patient records from unwarranted disclosure.
In his lawsuit, Wassef argued the Board of Medicine violated its own rules when it did not identify any evidence to support the disciplinary charges against him when arguing that administrative law judge should deny Wassef’s request that the disciplinary matter be dismissed through summary judgment.
In his decision, Nelmark wrote that it’s clear the board has identified for Wassef the names of the individuals involved in the patient-privacy matter, and the time period in which the alleged violations occurred.
“It is not clear to the court what additional evidence Dr. Wassef was seeking from the board that he did not receive,” Nelmark wrote in his decision. “Dr. Wassef asserts that his actions did not constitute HIPAA violations and that the investigation into his conduct was flawed, but it does not appear that he is unclear as to what the board alleges he did.”
Wassef has appealed Nelmark’s ruling to the Iowa Supreme Court.
Court records indicate Wassef is currently a resident of Florida, where he has an active medical license. In his petition, Wassef argues his Florida license will be adversely affected by the pending disciplinary charges if the case is permitted to proceed to a full disciplinary hearing.
Separately, Wassef is currently suing the University of Iowa Hospitals, alleging that in June 2018, just before his graduation from the UIHC residency program, he was contacted by the hospital’s compliance office and informed he had committed multiple HIPAA violations.
The hospital, Wassef alleges, then filed a complaint against him with the state licensing board and contacted the alleged patient “victims” in the matter to inform them of the situation and invite them to make formal complaints with the board.
The lawsuit, filed in December 2023, alleges the hospital’s allegations are false and have caused “catastrophic professional damage in his field that is ongoing to this day.”
The hospital has denied any wrongdoing. A trial in the case is scheduled for Oct. 13, 2026.

A Wednesday court filing from Commonwealth’s Attorney Miranda King says that the state’s fetal homicide law precludes using it in this case. The statute says “nothing in this chapter shall apply to any acts of a pregnant woman that caused the death of her unborn child.”
The state law “unambiguously exempts the defendant, the infant’s mother,” the filing states. “The Commonwealth has no grounds to pursue prosecution of Count One based on the legislature’s clear decision to exempt and protect the defendant mother’s actions in this matter.”

Kentucky State Police charged the woman, Melinda S. Spencer, 35, with fetal homicide as well as abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence. The latter are both Class D felonies. It’s unclear how far along her pregnancy was. She was indicted Tuesday and set to be arraigned Wednesday. 
King, the prosecutor, said in a statement that she “sought this job with the intention of being a pro-life prosecutor” but must and will follow the law, according to media outlets.

The drastic work project cuts made by House Republican appropriations chair Rep. Ann Bolin, and championed by House Speaker Matt Hall, were accomplished through an unconstitutional process that violated the separation of powers clause and other requirements in the Michigan Constitution, Attorney General Dana Nessel said Wednesday.
The determination came after reports of internal pressure for Michigan House Republicans who have tried to backtrack on the cuts that have affected a number of community services and projects that their constituents counted on.
Nessel was asked to give a formal opinion on the cuts in a request from state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing). The attorney general wrote in response that the disapproval mechanism used by Bollin (R-Brighton Township) unconstitutionally allowed one legislative committee to unilaterally terminate funding previously appropriated by the full Legislature and the governor.
In her opinion, Nessel concluded “that this disapproval mechanism violates both the Separation of Powers and Bicameralism and Presentment requirements in the Michigan Constitution.”
The separation of powers requirement limits the ability of one branch of government to exercise the functions of another; the presentment and bicameralism requirements reflect the constitutional mandate that laws must be debated and passed by both houses of the Legislature and presented to and signed by the governor.
Michigan Dems say $645M work project cuts are ‘cruel’; GOP’s Rylee Linting also calls foul

Bollin said in a statement that she believed Nessel was wrong on both the law and the facts, and that her opinion in the matter felt more like “a political defense of Democrats’ pet projects than an objective legal analysis.”
“The House Appropriations Committee acted fully within its legal authority under a law that has been on the books for decades — a statute enacted in the 1980s that clearly allows the Legislature to disapprove work projects that do not meet the standards required by law,” Bollin wrote. “Nothing about that authority is new, and nothing about our action was unconstitutional. What is new is Democrats’ frustration that the days of unchecked slush funds and blank checks are coming to an end.”
Nessel, however, said the disapproval mechanism violated the separation of powers clause because it allowed a single legislative committee “exert control over the executive’s implementation of enacted laws.”
The bicameralism and presentment requirements were violated because “the committee veto doesn’t comply with the constitutional requirement that legislative action be approved by both legislative chambers and presented to the governor, except in only certain narrow and explicit circumstances expressly identified within the Constitution itself.”
“By empowering a single legislative committee to negate the State Budget Director’s work-project designations, the statute reserves the very administrative control that the separation of powers forbids,” Nessel wrote in the opinion. “This disapproval mechanism effectively creates a ‘legislative veto’— or, more accurately, a ‘legislative committee veto.’ This comprises an unconstitutional reservation of administrative control that interferes with the executive branch’s core function of executing the laws. Under Article III, Section 2, when an appropriation is enacted, the Legislature’s role ends, and the executive branch’s duty to faithfully execute the law begins.”
Democrats praise decision
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), Anthony and House Minority Floor Leader Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) each applauded Nessel’s opinion.
“Not only was the House Republicans’ choice to steal money from the people of Michigan heinous, it was also unconstitutional,” Brinks said in a statement. “There’s no surprise here — when they can’t win in the Capitol, they try to bend the rules or break the law, hoping no one notices. But this time, people noticed. Pregnant and new moms who were counting on financial support noticed. Folks trying to combat the opioid epidemic noticed. And advocates for child abuse victims and those who help feed Michigan’s seniors noticed.”
‘Trust cuts both ways’: Nonprofits say Michigan House GOP cuts risk harming vulnerable families

Brinks added that she hopes the thousands of people who reached out in distress over the past month “can breathe a little easier, knowing that this will not stand.”
“This group of Republican legislators is unscrupulous, and everyone should demand better,” Brinks said.
Anthony said the opinion was “a lifeline for the countless non-profit organizations and local governments that have been left in limbo for weeks.”
“I’m talking about county land banks forced to halt affordable housing projects, community centers unable to answer questions from parents about whether their child’s Head Start program will be open this week, and school districts scrambling to make their balance sheet whole — all because House Republicans made a unilateral decision about who is and isn’t worthy of receiving contractually agreed upon state funding,” Anthony said in a statement.
Puri said the cuts amounted to cruelty aimed at some of the House GOP’s own constituents.
“From the moment House Republicans weaponized this rare provision to unilaterally, and without discussion, cut $645 million in appropriated funding for kids with cancer, sexual assault survivors, firefighters and police, and thousands of other cities, non-profits and Michiganders, House and Senate Democrats began fighting back,” Puri said in statement. “The uncertainty and chaos that these attempted cuts caused, not to mention the cruelty in slashing programs for vulnerable moms and babies, veterans and more, was both unprecedented and completely unwarranted.”
Blowback from GOP decision
The cuts are causing problems within the House GOP caucus, Gongwer News Service, a Lansing-based legislative news and intelligence service, reported Monday, noting that House Republicans in vulnerable districts were submitting requests to restore funding for work projects in their own communities — even after their leadership praised the cuts as a way to cut “waste, fraud and abuse,” a mantra the House majority repeated throughout the 2025-26 budget process.
Gongwer reported that Republican state Rep. Ron Robinson of Utica, who voted against the cuts, still called them “well-intentioned.”
State Rep. Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson) was also a House GOP member facing a tough election fight, and has told her constituents in a news release that the money had been simply paused. As Gongwer noted, the money was not paused, it was canned by House leadership.
In another odd twist, State Rep. Jim DeSana (R-Carleton) was among the members who voted for the cuts — which ultimately slashed nearly $2 million in state funding going to repair the roof of a building named after his father, The Detroit News reported.
Bollin went on the defend her committee’s actions, noting that Nessel “has never voted on a budget, never analyzed a state budget, and now appears perfectly comfortable defending a system where hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars were shuffled through vague work projects with little oversight and no accountability.”
“That is not how responsible government works, and it is not what Michigan taxpayers expect,” Bollin said. “It’s also worth remembering that Attorney General Nessel herself was hiding all of her department’s operations under a single line item until House Republicans stepped in this year to demand transparency and add accountability to her spending. That experience makes this opinion especially hard to take seriously.”
Bollin remained adamant that the Legislature had both the authority and the responsibility to oversee the spending of taxpayer dollars.
“We exercised that responsibility lawfully and in the best interest of the people of Michigan,” Bollin said. “Political opinions from the Attorney General’s office will not change that reality, nor will they deter House Republicans from continuing to restore accountability to state government.”

No pressure, Mississippi, but the Southeastern Conference hasn’t gone three years without a football national championship since the turn of the century.
Big Ten teams won the last two national titles — 2023 Michigan and 2024 Ohio State — and with No. 1 Indiana matched against No. 5 Oregon in the Peach Bowl on Friday, the conference is assured of being represented in the championship game again.
The last SEC team to play for it all was Georgia, which hammered TCU 65-7 in 2022 for its second straight title and the conference’s fourth in a row.
The “It Just Means More” conference hasn’t gone three years without a title since a four-year stretch from 1999-2002.
LSU won the Bowl Championship Series title game in 2003 but shared the title with Southern California. From 2006-22, the SEC won 13 of 17 championships and had at least one team in the title game all but one year.
The picks, with seedings and lines from BetMGM Sportsbook:
No. 6 Mississippi (plus 3 1/2) vs. No. 10 Miami
The Rebels (13-1) are as much a feel-good story as Indiana, maybe even more. The plot: Coach (Lane Kiffin) ditches team for a job with a conference rival (LSU), new coach (Pete Golding) opens his tenure with two playoff victories and several assistants stay on while moonlighting at LSU during the playoff run. Oh, and the star of the team (QB Trinidad Chambliss) is a transfer from Division II Ferris State. All this has galvanized the Rebels.
Against Miami, the challenge will be keeping Chambliss upright. The Hurricanes (12-2) have a combined 12 sacks in playoff wins over Texas A&M and Ohio State, and lead the nation with 46. The Rebels have kept Chambliss mostly clean, allowing just one sack in three games since Florida got to him five times on Nov. 15.

Miami QB Carson Beck has shaken off his interception issue with offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson’s emphasis on spreading around short passes. Beck has thrown just one interception in the last six games; he was picked off nine times in the first eight.
Pick: Mississippi 28-27
No. 1 Indiana (minus 3 1/2) vs. No. 5 Oregon
The Hoosiers and Ducks were dominant in the quarterfinals and now they square off for the second time this season. Indiana (14-0) handed Oregon (13-1) its only loss, 30-20 in Eugene on Oct. 11. The winner of the rematch will play for its school’s first national championship in football.

Much attention is paid to Indiana’s offense with Fernando Mendoza leading the way. He is going to have to be sharp against an Oregon defense that has improved its pass coverage since the first meeting. The Ducks flummoxed Behren Morton in the 23-0 quarterfinal win over Texas Tech.
This game will be close, and the Hoosiers have the more consistent defense. Remember, James Madison found a way to move the ball against Oregon in the first round, and the Hoosiers have the Heisman Trophy winner in Mendoza.

What may be less common is for politicians on the left to look back, or call attention to that.
And that’s where Brian Miller comes in.
A Helena-based attorney and student of the Federalist Papers, he, like some politicians, believes that America has strayed from its high-minded ideals.
And, the Democrat will try to unseat Republican incumbent Congressman Troy Downing, said that those in the center and left must reclaim the wisdom and vision of the nation’s founders because many of their ideas, especially about the separation of powers and limitations of government, can be a guide to escape the current cycle of political gridlock.
Miller told the Daily Montanan before the holidays “revolutionary” approaches are needed to overcome the challenges of housing, healthcare and the economy — and by revolutionary, he means a return to the some of the principles of the founders.
As for leaders like President Donald Trump, Miller said history has already spoken.
“He is using what (the founders) called ‘tyrannical use of power,’” Miller said. “He’s doing what the founding fathers said a tyrant does.”
 

  About Brian Miller 

Born: 1972 (Cleveland, Ohio)
Education: Bachelor’s degree, Emory University; Juris Doctorate, University of Montana
Status: Divorced, two children (Sage and Owen)
Website: https://www.miller4congress.com/



Miller jumped into the race because of his two children, Sage and Owen, and his love for the country and state.
“What I want people to think about is: What are we doing and where are we going?” he asked.
Although he’s running as a Democrat, Miller doesn’t describe himself as necessarily partisan. He said he’s more worried about the growing economic divide and the mountain of debt the country is accumulating— something he said will take a bipartisan effort to correct.
“If we don’t fix it, it will be destructive and hugely catastrophic,” Miller said.
He also said that it’s time to “decelerate” wealth accumulation, pointing out that the top 10% of Americans have two-thirds of the nation’s wealth, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
“You want to talk about affordability? There it is,” Miller said. “There is an insane concentration of wealth and money all going to a few people. We do not want socialism, but this is way out of whack. There is an unhealthy concentration of wealth and it will end up killing the economy.”
He plans to focus his year campaigning on making things like housing, childcare and healthcare more affordable. Miller advocates for more equity in taxing, especially when it comes to individual versus corporate taxation. He says the difference is fundamental and would require a shift away from the demands of short-term money to longer term growth.
Miller opposes Trump and the Republicans’ approach to tariffs, saying it’s among the most regressive form of taxation.
“Billionaires don’t care if a car is an extra $10,000,” Miller said. “You only notice when you’re making less than $50,000.”
Congressional candidate Brian Miller.
He said American businesses, regardless of politics, are paralyzed by the uncertainty that presidential politics has played. Miller said nowhere is that more obvious than in the agricultural sector. He pointed to examples of trade deals collapsing for soybeans and sky-rocketing input prices for feed and fertilizer.
“It’s unfair to blame the affordability crisis on Trump, but everything he’s done is making it worse,” Miller said.
He said the structural issues of increasing home prices, stagnant wages and housing shortages have been perennial problems, but Miller said Trump should be judged by what he said he could do.
“And he said he was the guy who would fix it all,” Miller said.
  Health insurance 

Miller also sees obvious solutions in American healthcare, beginning with the cost per capita and the health outcomes. He looks at Germany and sees Americans paying nearly double what it spends. While Germany spends around $300 yearly on administrative costs, America’s average is about triple.
“I am not saying a single-payer solution is the answer, but there’s a broad consensus that the problem is insurance companies,” he said.
He said government’s role in healthcare has yielded a positive benefit from providing more healthcare via Medicaid expansion to guaranteeing a market to businesses who found a cure for COVID by offering to buy the product. He said COVID and the vaccination, often maligned by some conservatives, shows perfectly how the government can be involved in helping to create solutions.
  Mounting debt 

Miller said despite conservative politicians talking about the debt, neither political party has done a lot to stop it recently. He worries the window of time to solve the looming financial crisis is closing.
He said that runs a close parallel to what the British colonists in America saw, which led to the Revolutionary War: A mother country which kept on pushing the colonies to the brink of financial collapse.
“Hamilton referred to the British as ‘economic enslavers,’” Miller said.
He said those feelings of being trapped with few ways out don’t so much resonate with older voters, but he’s said they’ve been embraced by younger voters.
“These conditions have become too extreme,” Miller said. “And both parties have a poverty of ideas.”
One of the thoughts that Miller wants to focus on is the misguided-but-popular sentiment from another Republican of his youth, Ronald Reagan. Though Miller credits Reagan for his charisma and communication, he said his messaging was wrong.
“We need to get away from this idea that government is your mortal enemy,” Miller said. “The government is not an alien force that wants to invade.”

Miller filed with the Federal Election Commission to run on Oct. 9, 2025.
According to the Federal Election website, Dr. Michael Eisenhauer of Great Falls filed to run in the race as an Independent on Dec. 15, 2025.

The Trump administration’s focus on Minnesota was sparked by unsubstantiated allegations shared by right-wing media figures that Somali Americans who committed fraud were using the proceeds to fund terrorist organizations abroad.
“@POTUS Trump and @Sec_Noem have rallied DHS law enforcement personnel to keep Americans safe and ERADICATE fraud,” DHS posted on X.
ICE did not respond to the Reformer’s requests for comment.
Immigrant rights organizations have been fielding many reports of ICE arrests around the metro, but an exact number of arrests is difficult to confirm. Unlike a few high-profile raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul in 2025, which involved dozens of agents and attracted large crowds, ICE appears to be focused on conducting smaller and faster operations.
Walz blasted the deployment as a waste of government resources on social media, sharing a video from a little over a week ago showing dozens of agents leading a single person out of a Hennepin County government building. He said the Trump administration did not give his office advance notice or any additional information on the operation.
“We have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us that are for a show of the cameras,” Walz said at a news conference on Tuesday. “We don’t even know they are, they’ll be wearing masks.”
Noem fired back at the governor for accusing them of misusing taxpayer dollars given the widening scandal of fraud in state-run social service programs that led him to end his campaign for a third term on Monday.
Around the country and in Minnesota, immigration agents have been accused of violating constitutional rights: detaining U.S. citizens for days, targeting individuals based on their speech; and arresting and holding people without probable cause.

In late December, ICE agents entered a private area of the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis without a judicial warrant, according to immigrant rights activists and Democratic elected officials, who urged Hennepin Healthcare to adopt a clear policy and train employees on how to interact with immigration agents.
Janna Gewirtz O’Brien, a pediatrician and president-elect of the Minnesota Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said fear of ICE is keeping immigrant families from seeking health care.
“There is a sense of fear that has been perpetuated by our administration, and we need hospitals to step up,” Gewirtz O’Brien said.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota and three Minnesota-based law firms recently sued federal immigration authorities, alleging that ICE agents and their leaders are also routinely violating the constitutional rights of the people protesting their actions.

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Former Senate Majority Leader Mason announces 2026 gubernatorial run


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday January 7, 2026 11:51 am





Former Maine Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason announced his run to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills on his podcast Wednesday morning, framing his campaign around the need for experienced leadership.
Mason, a Republican from Lisbon who spent eight years in the Maine Legislature and now works as a lobbyist, ran for governor in 2018 and was the runner up in the primary. On Wednesday, he commented on the crowded race he’s joining, saying he is the only Republican candidate with prior experience and understanding of how the Legislature works.
While state Sen. James Libby is among those running, the GOP primary field is packed with candidates with mostly business experience, such as former Planet Fitness president Ben Midgley, health care entrepreneur Jonathan Bush and David Jones, a construction and real estate business leader.
On the podcast, he said many candidates on both sides are “promising things that a governor cannot deliver on at all, or immediately.”
“The reason I’m running is very simple,” Mason said. “It’s not because I have better ideas. It’s because I know how to actually turn those ideas into results.”

Independent who previously tried to challenge Sen. Collins announces gubernatorial bid


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Friday November 7, 2025 3:57 pm





Another independent candidate has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. 
Derek Levasseur, who describes himself as a small business leader and published a memoir earlier this year about overcoming adversity, announced his plans to run for governor as an independent in a Facebook post Thursday. He filed paperwork with the Maine Ethics Commission the same day listing a Benton address. 
Levasseur said his focus is lowering the cost of living and reforming the state Department of Health and Human Services to increase accountability. He proposes eliminating property taxes on people’s primary homes and increasing government transparency.

Maine House Speaker Fecteau backs Pingree for governor


By: Lauren McCauley and AnnMarie Hilton -  1:44 pm





The Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives announced his top choice for Maine’s next governor.
At the former Biddeford Courthouse Friday afternoon, House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said he is backing Hannah Pingree in next year’s gubernatorial election.
He said Pingree, who also previously served as the leader of the legislature’s lower chamber and most recently as head of the state’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, has the leadership necessary to defend Maine from federal attacks and continue the work the state has done in recent years under a Democratic trifecta.
“As we watch the dysfunction and cruelty coming from Washington, it’s clear that we need leaders that will stand up for Maine people, for the food assistance they need, for the health care every person deserves, for smart forward-looking policies that will protect our state from climate change,” said Fecteau, who was flanked by roughly 20 current and former legislators.
“We need someone who will stand up to the Trump administration and the ridiculous ongoing attacks on the most vulnerable Mainers,” he continued. “Hannah Pingree is that person.”

Former Maine CDC director Nirav Shah joins governor’s race


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday October 20, 2025 10:50 am





The doctor who led Maine through the Covid-19 pandemic and later moved to a national public health position is running for governor. 
Nirav Shah announced Monday he will throw his name into an already crowded field of Democrats vying for the Blaine House. Shah was appointed as the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2019. He held that role until he became principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2023.
“As Maine CDC Director, I saw how we could get through incredibly tough times together with empathy, resilience, and vision,” Shah said in a news release. “I’ll bring those same values as governor to tackle big challenges: the unsustainable increases to the cost of living and housing, an economy that’s not delivering for people, and a rural health care system that’s struggling and will only get worse because of [President Donald] Trump.”

Republican Jonathan Bush launches bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday October 8, 2025 4:49 pm





Jonathan Bush, nephew of the late President George H.W. Bush, officially launched his campaign for governor on Wednesday, running as a Republican to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills in the 2026 election.
Branding himself as a “disruptor, a job creator and a fanatic Maine optimist,” the health care entrepreneur launched his campaign at the Belfast headquarters of athenahealth, a company he founded in 1997 but was eventually ousted from.
In a launch video, Bush outlined some of the changes he hopes to make as governor, including auditing the government, investing in trade schools and jumpstarting the economy “by getting rid of silly regulations.”
“To change things, I’m going to have to break a few eggs along the way,” he said in the video.

State Rep. Ed Crockett enters Maine governor’s race as independent


By: Emma Davis - Thursday September 25, 2025 5:07 pm





Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent.
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out.
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.

Jackson rallies with Sanders and Platner on Labor Day


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday September 3, 2025 10:02 am





Gubernatorial candidate Troy Jackson joined U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner at a packed rally at the Cross Insurance Arena in Portland on Labor Day.
Addressing the crowd of 6,500, Jackson used his speech to differentiate himself from other Democratic candidates.
“We have tried it their way and it doesn’t work,” said Jackson, a fifth-generation logger from Allagash. “It’s time for regular folks to take the wheel. Hell, we built the wheel.”
Sanders, an independent who ran twice for the Democratic nomination for president, endorsed both Jackson and Platner in their respective races.

Former Maine CDC head Dr. Nirav Shah considering bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Friday August 15, 2025 2:53 pm





Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

Hannah Pingree officially launches bid for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday June 10, 2025 7:02 am





Hannah Pingree officially launched her campaign for governor after months of speculation about the candidacy of the former Mills administration official and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

Republican state senator enters race for governor


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Thursday May 22, 2025 12:01 pm





State Sen. James Libby is running in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Libby, who represents parts of Cumberland, Oxford and York counties, is one of five Republican candidates contending for the Blaine House, according to filings with the Maine Ethics Commission.
The race is already starting to get crowded, with the Democratic ticket drawing notable names including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month.
Libby is in the middle of his second consecutive term in the Senate, but he has also spent time as a state representative after being first elected to the Legislature in 1992. He also ran in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary.

Former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson is running for governor in the 2026 election.
The fifth-generation logger announced Monday that he will join the Democratic primary, saying in a news release from his campaign that “too many Democrats have lost touch with working people or shown they’re not up to the fight.”
“I know what it’s like to punch a clock, live paycheck to paycheck, be treated like I didn’t matter while some billionaire got rich off my back – and how to turn that feeling of powerlessness into action,” he added.

Amid rumors of gubernatorial bid, Hannah Pingree to leave Mills administration


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Thursday May 15, 2025 5:58 pm





Hannah Pingree, who has led efforts on climate and housing policy for the state, will leave her position Friday.
“I’m so grateful to Governor Mills for the tremendous opportunity she gave me to dive into Maine’s biggest challenges and lead work across her administration to chart a path to solutions,” Pingree said in a news release from the governor’s office Thursday.
Though the release didn’t specify what Pingree plans to do next, she said she will “remain relentlessly focused on the future of the state we all love.” The Bangor Daily News has reported that Pingree is expected to throw her hat in the ring for the Democratic gubernatorial primary next year.

By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 26, 2025 7:53 am





Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced her run for governor in 2026, becoming the first major Democratic candidate to throw her hat in the ring.
During her address early Wednesday at the official launch event at the Hancock Community Center, Bellows said “we need leaders who will meet the moment.”
“Because while we’re paying our taxes or helping our parents measure out their medication, our country is being demolished by a greedy, unelected billionaire who thinks his dollars are more powerful than our voices…Who thinks the value of his stock portfolio matters more than the values of our community.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 16:47:52+00:00,CT Mirror,Avelo Airlines to exit deportation business,Thomas Breen | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/avelo-airlines-to-exit-deportation-business/,The airline will stop running deportation flights for the Trump administration after deciding its participation is too complex and costly to continue.,"Avelo Airlines plans to stop running deportation flights for the Trump administration later this month after deciding that its participation in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) program is too complex and costly to continue.
Avelo spokesperson Courtney Goff confirmed that coming move for the budget airline in an email comment sent to the Independent on Wednesday.
“Avelo will close the base at AZA [in Mesa, Arizona] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,” Goff wrote. “The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.”
AZ Family, a local news outlet in Phoenix, first reported on Avelo’s decision to end its deportation flights, which began out of Arizona last May — prompting a New Haven-based boycott movement, condemnation from politicians and activists across the country, and frequent protests outside of Tweed New Haven Airport, where Avelo has been flying direct commercial flights (but not deportation flights) since November 2021.
Avelo CEO Andrew Levy previously defended the company’s decision to run deportation flights on financial grounds, stating that the DHS contract was necessary to maintain Avelo’s operations, including its service of New Haveners. Click here to read an American Prospect report from November 2025 on Avelo’s “sloppy, dangerous deportation flights.”
“The big lesson here is that human suffering is not profitable,” said Pastor Jack Perkins Davidson of Hamden’s Spring Glen Church in a phone interview with the Independent Wednesday. “I hope Avelo and all corporations in the U.S. have learned that valuable lesson, that collaborating with injustice and collaborating with racism, though it may for them provide the allure of short-term gain, are empty promises. There is no benefit.”
Avelo doubles down on Tweed
Goff’s confirmation of Avelo’s decision to stop flying deportation flights also comes a day after she sent out a separate email press release Tuesday night under the subject line: “Avelo Airlines Reiterates Long-Term Commitment to Connecticut.”
“Avelo Airlines has been recapitalized, and its cash position is now one of the strongest in the U.S. airline industry relative to its size,” that Tuesday press release states. “The airline will use this cash infusion and balance sheet strength to execute its long-term strategy, with emphasis on further developing its key base at Tweed-New Haven Airport (HVN).”
The press release states that Avelo will “continue to operate a six-aircraft base” at Tweed “without major changes to the existing network or to its Crewmember employment at the airport.”
Across the country, Avelo will be “streamlining its network” around four different locations: New Haven’s Tweed airport (HVN); Wilmington, Delaware’s ILG airport; Charlotte, North Carolina’s Douglas International Airport (USA), and Lakeland, Florida’s airport (LAL). Avelo will also open a base at the McKinney, Texas airport (TKI) in “late 2026,” and it will close bases in Mesa, Arizona (AZA); Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina (RDU); and Wilmington, North Carolina (ILM).
“Concurrent with these network changes, Avelo will make near-term schedule changes that will impact many Customer itineraries. Communication will be sent directly to impacted Customers by email and text. Customers needing additional help can seek assistance from Avelo’s Customer Support Center.”
Avelo will also modify its fleet to remove six Boeing Next-Generation 737-700 aircraft, “leaving the airline primarily operating its more efficient Boeing Next-Generation 737-800 aircraft. These changes enable Avelo to focus on sustainably scaling five core bases in 2026 and to prepare the company for growth in the coming years, facilitated by the company’s recent order for up to 100 Embraer 195-E2 aircraft.”
Tuesday’s press release ends by stating that Avelo will continue to fly directly from Tweed to the following 24 destinations:

Atlanta, Ga. (ATL)
Charleston, S.C. (CHS)
Charlotte / Concord, N.C. (USA)
Chicago, Ill. (via ORD)
Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas (DFW)
Daytona Beach, Fla. (DAB)

Tampa, Fla. (TPA)
Washington, D.C./Baltimore, Md. (BWI)
West Palm Beach, Fla. (PBI)
Wilmington, N.C. (ILM)

“New Haven is Avelo’s largest base – employing nearly 300 Crewmembers and offering service to 24 nonstop destinations,” Tuesday’s press release states. “Since taking flight from HVN in November 2021, Avelo has flown more than four million Customers at Tweed on over 30,000 flights.”
All of this comes as Tweed New Haven Airport continues to move forward with plans to extend its runway and build a new, larger terminal on the East Haven side of the property in a bid to attract more commercial airfare. Avelo and fellow budget airline Breeze are the only two commercial carriers currently operating out of Tweed. Critics of the airport’s expansion, meanwhile, have consistently warned of increased flooding, air pollution, and excess noise and traffic that comes with a larger airport.

The Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter has launched a new free online tool aimed at helping Delaware residents evaluate their daily habits and take steps to support long-term brain health.
The Brain Health Habit Builder is a web-based, interactive experience that takes about three to five minutes to complete. Users answer questions about their lifestyle, then receive a personalized plan focused on small, manageable changes tied to brain health. The plan can be downloaded, printed, or shared, and the tool is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
“Healthy habits can help you live better now and protect your memory and thinking as you age,” said Kristina Fransel, executive director of the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter. “This new tool makes it easy to check your habits and build a personalized plan to support lifelong brain health.”
RELATED STORY: Delaware Faces an Alzheimer’s Surge—and a Growing Web of Challenges
The recommendations generated by the tool are informed by findings from the U.S. POINTER study, a large clinical trial that examined whether lifestyle interventions could improve cognitive function in older adults at risk for cognitive decline. The study found that a combination of physical activity, healthy eating, cognitive and social engagement, and regular health monitoring led to improved cognition.
Brain health refers to how well people think, learn, and remember. While research continues to evolve, studies increasingly suggest that addressing certain risk factors — such as inactivity, poor diet, and social isolation — may help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and possibly dementia.
The Alzheimer’s Association has expanded its public education efforts in recent years, offering community programs across Delaware and sharing research-based guidance through initiatives like its 10 Healthy Habits for Your Brain campaign.
The Brain Health Habit Builder is the first in a series of new resources planned by the organization following the release of the U.S. POINTER study results. Future initiatives include virtual brain health training for health care providers, a community recognition program highlighting businesses that promote brain-healthy practices, and a brain health roundtable designed to bring together leaders from health care, public health, and the private sector.
“The Alzheimer’s Association is committed to ensuring individuals have the information they need to routinely and meaningfully take action to improve their brain health,” Fransel said. “Making even small changes to improve brain health can make a big difference.”
Delaware residents can access the Brain Health Habit Builder at alz.org/habitbuilder.

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia MercurySince last summer the Virginia Department of Health has been investigating a potential pediatric cancer cluster in Southwest Virginia. On Wednesday, the agency announced it determined that the cancer rates don’t meet federal standards to be officially defined as a cancer cluster. 
Cancer clusters are defined as a greater than expected number of the same or related cancer cases that occur within a group of people in the same area over a specific time. Cancer clusters are rare, but could be indicative of environmental exposures or genetic predispositions but they sometimes randomly occur. VDH’s analysis of cases between 2014 and 2023 in the Scott County area of Virginia do not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition for a cluster. 
Though an official cluster has not been determined, the regional health district director emphasized that health officials are still keeping their eyes on matters — especially since some data for 2024 and 2025 are not yet finalized.
“The results of the current investigation are being shared, but our work will not stop here,” said LENOWISCO Health District Director Reisa Sloce. “We will continue to provide the Virginia Cancer Registry with any additional pediatric cancer information we receive to ensure the most recent cases are reviewed as that data becomes more complete.”
Data takes time to be finalized as it must be verified, analyzed and exchanged with other state registries. A two-year lag in health data is common across other states, so VDH plans to review the most recent data once the formal procedures make it fully available. 
As to what VDH has learned so far, it received 24 survey responses from residents of Scott, Lee and Wise countries. Half of the reports stemmed from Scott, so much of the investigation focused in that area. A total of eight cases of pediatric cancers from survey responses met the criteria for the analysis. 
Staff reviewed each patient’s medical reports to confirm the type of cancer, where the cancer originated within the patient’s body and when it was diagnosed. The reviews included doctors’ notes and test results. Environmental factors were also examined such as radon levels, drinking water quality, and industrial site concerns but no link to environmental factors were identified in VDH’s analysis. 
The Virginia Mercury also conducted its own survey but only received one response. That person did not have pediatric cancer, but was an adult who had cancer in 2015 and said it had returned last year. The person was from Scott County. 
With a cancer cluster ruled out for now, fresh data will be on the horizon. 
In the meantime, Sloce reiterated how state health workers “strive to connect you with available resources and address health related concerns.”

(Photo via Garrett Mason official Maine Senate Facebook page)Former Maine Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason announced his run to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills on his podcast Wednesday morning, framing his campaign around the need for experienced leadership.
Mason, a Republican from Lisbon who spent eight years in the Maine Legislature and now works as a lobbyist, ran for governor in 2018 and was the runner up in the primary. On Wednesday, he commented on the crowded race he’s joining, saying he is the only Republican candidate with prior experience and understanding of how the Legislature works. 
While state Sen. James Libby is among those running, the GOP primary field is packed with candidates with mostly business experience, such as former Planet Fitness president Ben Midgley, health care entrepreneur Jonathan Bush and David Jones, a construction and real estate business leader.
On the podcast, he said many candidates on both sides are “promising things that a governor cannot deliver on at all, or immediately.”
“The reason I’m running is very simple,” Mason said. “It’s not because I have better ideas. It’s because I know how to actually turn those ideas into results.”
The former Senate majority leader emphasized that Maine requires seasoned leadership at such a crucial moment for the state, not someone who tries to imitate Donald Trump or a political “hobbyist.” 
Mason admitted to having similar views to the other Republican candidates, highlighting key talking points for the party including overtaxation and government inefficiency, education reform, and rising crime — despite the most recent state report showing crime declining steadily since 2021. 
But drawing on his past roles as a business owner and legislator, Mason set himself apart as someone who could bring practical experience to the job. His entry into the race signals a major development in the Republican primary. 
“I’ve heard a lot of people in the Republican primary talk about how they’re an outsider,” he said. “There are times for outsiders. There are times that we need somebody to come in and rattle up the system. This is not this time. This moment requires precision. It requires institutional knowledge, and it involves understanding the real levers of power.”

Jim Pillen touts $10 million campaign war chest ahead of 2026 reelection bid,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/nebraska-gov-jim-pillen-touts-10-million-campaign-war-chest-ahead-of-2026-reelection-bid/,Pillen's haul sets steep cost of challenging sitting governor as potential GOP rematch with Charles Herbster looms.,"Gov. Jim Pillen at Nebraska’s National Guard Air Base on Jan 5, 2026. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Fresh off securing President Donald Trump’s endorsement, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced his campaign has raised $7.6 million, bringing the governor’s political war chest to $10 million ahead of his 2026 reelection bid. 
The incumbent governor’s fundraising haul comes as a potential Republican primary election rematch is on the horizon with multi-state agribusinessman Charles Herbster, a longtime Trump donor. 
The Pillen campaign said the amount is “almost seven times” that of any previous incumbent governor going into reelection. Pillen finished 2024 with more than $3 million in cash on hand, according to state campaign finance reports.
Dona-Gene Barton, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who studies political behavior, said, “This massive war chest creates a David vs. Goliath situation for potential challengers.”

Herbster and his team declined to comment. He and Pillen combined in 2022 for the most expensive gubernatorial primary contest and governor’s race in state history, with both raising and spending more than $11 million. 
Herbster lost to Pillen in that 2022 GOP primary, finishing second in a three-way race that also included then-State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, who is running for the U.S. House in the Omaha-based 2nd District. 
Pillen then cruised to a general election victory against then-Democratic State Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue. If a GOP primary rematch happens, Herbster will have to run without Trump’s endorsement this time, which he had in 2022.
Trump backing Pillen is a dramatic change from the last time Herbster faced the former University of Nebraska regent in a GOP-led state where Republicans hold a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage.
Herbster is expected to decide whether to run as early as this month. He continued his social media attacks on Pillen last week, saying Pillen is “running the state into the ground,” referring to the state budget shortfall. 
Currently, Jacy Todd and Sheila Korth-Focken, who announced late Monday, are the other two GOP candidates for governor. They haven’t yet filed fundraising tallies with the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission, which are required after candidates raise more than $5,000.
On the Democratic side, former state Sen. Lynne Walz is exploring a bid for governor. Walz spokesman Brandon Bayer said Pillen’s fundraising totals would have no impact on her decision to run. 
The GOP primary for governor is May 12. The general election is Nov. 3.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 15:40:10+00:00,CT Mirror,Latin Americans in CT have mixed emotions about Maduro’s capture,Eddy Martinez | Connecticut Public and Daniela Doncel | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/latin-americans-in-ct-have-mixed-emotions-about-maduros-capture/,"In CT's small Venezuelan American community, some are cautiously optimistic about the U.S. apprehension of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.","Some members of Connecticut’s small Venezuelan American community are cautiously optimistic about the U.S. military’s apprehension of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.
Norwalk resident Fabian Durango, originally from Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, said he’s relieved Maduro has been removed from power.
“This was long overdue, glad it was done,” Durango said. “I’m glad it was done clean and swiftly.”
Durango, who emigrated from Venezuela with his parents at the age of 10, has not been to the country in years. He said he has multiple family members in Caracas, several of whom saw low-flying aircraft as Saturday’s raid unfolded. Durango said his family left the country during a period of civil strife in 1990, years before Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, won a presidential election.
Now Durango hopes Venezuela, which suffers from a faltering economy as a result of international sanctions and government mismanagement, can chart a new course. He remains optimistic despite his concerns over the U.S. government’s intentions, which President Donald Trump openly said was about regaining access to the country’s vast oil reserves.
“Our president is an aggressive businessman … they’re neither good or bad, but they prey on the weak … and I do worry that this is just going to be a rush for natural resources and minerals,” Durango said.
Clodomiro Falcón, president of Asoven CT, the Association of Venezuelans in Connecticut, said he’s optimistic. Falcón noted his opinions were not the official position of Asoven.
“I am very hopeful, but I understand at the same time taking Maduro away is part of a process that is very complex, a process that is not overnight,” Falcón said.
Falcón entered the United States in 1986, to pursue higher education. He said he did not leave Venezuela due to economic or political reasons, but ended up staying in the United States after he completed his education.
But Falcón kept close ties with family in the country, traveling regularly to visit until 2016, and cited his passport expiring at the time, and later, travel advisories to the country preventing him from returning.
“There is a lot of narrative, a lot of lies in Venezuela, in the narrative from the regime saying that Venezuela was at peace, that Venezuela was perfect, was heaven, that’s all lies,” Falcón said.
Venezuela’s economic troubles, according to previous reporting from NPR, turned many into refugees, fleeing soaring inflation in recent years, and violent political repression as the economy suffered from growing income inequality. Some of those refugees entered the United States in recent years, facing xenophobia due to alleged connections with organized crime and drug trafficking, although the New York Times contested those connections in its reporting.
While many Venezuelan refugees are not criminals, Falcon said his homeland is governed by them, and took issue with demonstrations criticizing American involvement in Venezuela.
“I think these people don’t understand that they are not attacking Venezuela,” Falcón said. “This is attacking a criminal organization.”
Falcón hopes he can travel to the country, provided the Maduro government is completely removed from power.
“I pray to the Lord that I am alive, and healthy to be able to see Venezuela again,” Falcón said.
Mixed emotions beyond Venezuela
Trump has alluded to the possibility of more U.S. military action against other Latin American countries, including Mexico and Colombia.
The implications have left Colombian American Amy Carmona feeling uncertain about what the future may hold for her family in Medellín, the Colombian “City of Eternal Spring.”
Carmona is a sophomore at the University of Connecticut and the PR Chair of PorColombia, UConn’s Colombian Student Association.
“Obviously, [Colombian President Gustavo] Petro has a very unfortunate reign over the country right now, but I think that it’s super unethical to go about and do the same thing,” Carmona said.
She said she can’t overlook the repercussions that may come to Venezuela after the extraction, comparing the situation to the lack of structure and stability in Iraq after Saddam Hussein.
Carmona said she also can’t ignore the Trump Administration’s intentions with Venezuela’s oil. U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy has pointed to that as well, stating that the operation on Venezuela is about “enriching Trump’s oil industry backers.”
Carmona’s biggest worry, however, is the lack of concern for the situation among her family and other Colombians.
She was in Medellín during the operation on Saturday, visiting family for the holidays. As she watched the story of Maduro’s removal unfold on social media, Carmona said her family was celebrating.
“My family is very happy. They’re rejoicing about it. I haven’t really heard any critics say anything. It’s mainly just people from the United States that have seen this before with other invasions of countries, but obviously a third world country is going to be appreciative of the fact that prices would go down, or there’s opportunity for another leader,” Carmona said.
Petro’s response to Trump, in which he warns Trump that he will retaliate should Trump attack, also has Carmona feeling like Colombians aren’t really worried about a strike from the U.S.
“I feel like people aren’t really taking it as seriously as it is, mainly because I don’t think people know about the implications,” Carmona said.
Those implications being what could happen to Colombia if Petro is taken the same way Maduro was.
“I’m unsure if the country would go into the right hands in this situation, because the Guerrilla presence is so strong here. I think that it could honestly go either way,” she said.
Reports have come out that the National Liberation Army (ELN), a left-wing rebel group in Colombia, is preparing for a possible military intervention from the U.S.
The idea already has Carmona feeling jumpy.
“Honestly, [Sunday] night, I can tell you that I heard a loud noise. I was like, ‘Oh my God. This is it?’” Carmona said.
Carmona is encouraging others who share the same fears to stay informed and keep the faith.
“Having faith right now in such a troubling time is so important, because if you don’t believe in something, you can very easily be steered in the wrong direction,” Carmona said.

Students of all ages are putting in the effort to bring their goals to fruition. Education continues to shape pathways for learners at every stage, and 2026 brings new possibilities for learning of all kinds. The stories revisited below highlight seven student experiences.
Full-time firefighting is in Bailey’s future
Bailey Shepard’s goal grew from the sense of belonging he felt the minute he put on a firefighter’s helmet as a child. As he matured, he knew he would turn his volunteer service into a full-time career as a firefighter and EMT. “I’d love to do it full time. I’m just waiting for a job to open up somewhere,” he says. 
In high school, Bailey attended a student leadership retreat organized by VSAC. It turned out to be a transformative experience, giving him the skills he needed to cement his lifelong commitment to helping others. He joined a volunteer fire department as soon as he turned 16 and attributes his dedication to the guidance and leadership experience he gained from his VSAC program. “A big part of the job is taking charge in emergency response situations. I use those leadership skills I built with VSAC almost every day,” he shared.
As he looks to his future, Bailey is determined to continue making a difference for others. 
OJ Dreams of Hollywood or opening his own business
OJ Daring is open to where his path will take him, including Hollywood. A senior at Champlain College, OJ says, “I have a lot of different ideas. Hollywood has always been the dream, but I could also see myself going the niche route—working in marketing for a company or starting a business of my own. Most important is being able to support myself,” he says.  
OJ is studying film and finance. He goes deeply into editing videos and working on a variety of film projects. An alumni of VSAC’s GEAR UP college and career readiness program, OJ says the support he received getting into and getting started at Champlain made all the difference. “The process was smooth for me because of VSAC. If I didn’t have that, I would have had a harder time. They helped me through the confusion, answered my questions, and made me feel confident.”
He’s finishing his senior year this semester. As to whether his path will take him to Hollywood, to owning his own business, working in marketing, or something else? Only time will tell. Either way, OJ is excited for a bright future. 
On the farm or in the field is where Hailey wants to be 
Hailey Bartlett is certain about one thing: she’s not interested in a desk job. Instead, she’s preparing for a hands-on career working with animals—as a veterinarian, veterinary technician, or animal nutritionist. What matters most to her is being directly involved with animal care and putting her animal science studies to practical use.
Hailey is currently in her first year at SUNY Cobleskill. She grew up around agriculture, showing animals through 4-H and spending much of her time with animal companions. During some of the most challenging periods of her high school years, working with animals—especially calves—became a positive and grounding outlet. She applied to college as an independent student and relied on VSAC for guidance in navigating the financial aid process, including completing the FAFSA and applying for scholarships.
Her experiences with animals and farm life have helped clarify the path she wants to pursue. Hailey’s journey is an exciting one, shaped by her interests.
Maria is building an engineering career, one proton at a time
Maria Tye first heard the words “chemical engineering” in high school, after excelling in chemistry and being encouraged to explore the field. She knew she wanted a stable future and set out to make it happen, despite challenges at home and financial hurdles. Maria spent hours researching colleges, completing applications, and applying for scholarships and grants. She balanced schoolwork with track, summer jobs in manufacturing, and internships, gaining hands-on experience while building the skills needed for her career.
When financial barriers threatened to derail her plans, she sought creative solutions, relying on family and mentors to help with loans. College demanded persistence, teamwork, and self-advocacy, and Maria leaned on peers and support systems to navigate a rigorous program and personal challenges.
Today, as a project engineer at Amphenol Aerospace, she bridges disciplines and works on innovative projects—proof that dedication, resourcefulness, and hard work can turn aspirations into reality.
Ailyn is headed toward the ocean
Ailyn Langley is confident her future lies with the ocean. “It’s fascinating and beautiful and I want to be able to look deeper into it,” she shares. 
A first-generation student, she’s in her first year at Dartmouth College where she’s focusing on marine biology and neuroscience. She grew up in West Fairlee and always gravitated toward nature and especially the world underwater. “Many parts of the ocean are misunderstood,” she says. Ailyn is determined to explore those things and has set great goals for herself in life and for her time at Dartmouth, including learning how to dive. 
She’s well on the way to achieving her dreams, one class at a time. 
Amara and Nick share roots, but have different goals
Twins Amara Chester and Nick Armstrong grew up in Pownal. Encouraged by their mother to explore beyond their hometown, both understood early that education could open doors—but reaching their goals required effort.
Amara discovered her passion for speech pathology through a high school human services class and a career skills assessment. She researched colleges, applied widely, and spent hours completing scholarship applications and financial aid forms to make attending Biola University in California possible. Today, she works in cognitive therapy, helping individuals recover from brain injuries while balancing life as a new mom.
Nick explored multiple interests before finding real estate through a college internship and hands-on home renovation experience. He carefully weighed schools, navigated applications and financial aid, and now works as a broker, manages investment properties, and plans to expand his business.
Amara and Nick’s dedication shows that ambition, hard work, and the right support can turn goals into reality.

(Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Public Information Services)In the latest blow to Minnesota’s once vaunted reputation for good governance, the Office of the Legislative Auditor has identified “continued and pervasive concerns” with grant-making practices at the Behavioral Health Administration, an arm of the Department of Human Services that assists people who struggle with substance abuse and mental health.
Appearing before a panel of lawmakers on Tuesday, Legislative Auditor Judy Randall outlined the findings of her office’s partial review of approximately $192 million of grants issued to 590 non-governmental entities between 2022 and 2024.
During the course of the investigation, she said, auditors “identified a number of documents that the Behavioral Health Administration either backdated or created after our audit began in response to our request for information.”
“Frankly, in the 27 years I’ve been with the OLA, we’ve never seen this before,” Randall said. “It’s very troubling. It wasn’t just one individual that created or backdated the documents. We do believe it was a systemic effort.”
Randall said such practices raise questions about the validity of the information provided by the agency, thus “undermining the integrity of the audit.”
Shireen Gandhi, acting commissioner of the DHS, told lawmakers on the Legislative Audit Commission that she was “shocked to hear this information.”
“It is absolutely unacceptable that any staff would provide anything other than accurate information of the work done to the auditor,” Gandhi said.
The audit identified other worrisome issues with the BHA’s grant-making practices, including a widespread and improper reliance on non-competitive “single source” bids; poor oversight of grantees; failure to conduct site visits; and lax documentation.
The most eye-catching detail in the report is suggestive of outright graft.
According to the audit, one unnamed grant manager with BHA approved a payment of $672,647 to a new vendor for a single month’s work, then left state employment a few days later. That grant manager subsequently provided consulting services to the provider.
“We asked BHA management whether they questioned such a large reimbursement request for just one month of work.  BHA management said that due to limited information in the grant management system and the grant manager no longer being available, they could not answer this question,” the report states.
When auditors contacted two subcontractors of the aforementioned provider, the report continues, neither subcontractor was able to “provide sufficient documentation regarding who they served with the money they received from the grantee.”
One subcontractor told auditors that the grantee “told them they did not need to keep detailed participant records, such as sign-up sheets.” Absent such documentation, the report states, auditors “could not determine whether subcontractors provided the services for which they were paid.”
Lawmakers reacted to the findings with disbelief.
“I’m floored. This is incredible,” said Rep. Patti Anderson, R-Dellwood, who noted that “half the grants had some sort of backdating or falsification of the documents.”
 “It wasn’t just one or two people. It was a big chunk of the staff. Someone must have told them to do that. Who told the staff to do that?” Anderson asked.
Gandhi responded that “if someone directed staff to falsify documents, it’s absolutely wrong.”
“It’s an HR matter for sure, it may be more than that,” Gandhi said.
In response to lawmakers’ queries about whether any of the issues identified in the report constituted criminal fraud, Gandhi said one internal audit conducted by DHS has been referred to law enforcement, but she provided no more details. 
While Republicans on the committee were harsher in their assessment of the agency’s failures, calls for reforms were bipartisan.
Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, the committee chair, said she expected there will be a change in law that will mandate “a cooling off period” for former department employees before they can be hired by grant recipients. 
For her part, Gandhi told lawmakers that the agency was working to improve training for grant managers and increase oversight. 
“I take the report seriously,” she said. “Strong internal controls are essential to protect taxpayers’ funds.”

With the agency, more commonly referred to as EGLE, overseeing issues like environmental contamination, clean water, and working alongside several partners to protect the Great Lakes and the species that call them home, its year end report for 2025 and its State of the Great Lakes report point to accomplishments like the delisting of Muskegon Lake as a Great Lakes Area of Concern while detailing its continued efforts in fighting algal blooms in Lake Erie, among other issues.
While there are more than 27,000 environmentally contaminated sites across the state, EGLE reported increased cleanup efforts, with the department working on 940 sites in 2025 compared to 870 in 2024. EGLE also addressed a larger number of leaking underground storage tanks, closing 561 sites in the 2025 fiscal year compared to 409 the year prior.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Since 2020, EGLE has tripled the amount of storage tank leaks it addresses in a given year, agency director Phil Roos told Michigan Advance in an interview Tuesday.
The department has also plugged 292 of the 570 orphan wells in the state, sites used for oil, gas or brine disposal that were not closed properly and where the owner is either insolvent or cannot be identified.
The state also continued to identify sites contaminated by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, man-made chemicals used in fire fighting foam, nonstick cookware and a number of other products that have been tied to negative health impacts including increased risks for multiple types of cancer.
In 2026, the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team – established in 2017 by seven state agencies including the Department of Environmental Quality, EGLE’s predecessor – will award and administer grants to airports where firefighting foam has contaminated groundwater and surface water. The grants will be used for testing, studying best ways to address contamination, and cleaning out fire trucks to use newer firefighting foam.

EGLE has also taken steps to prevent the chemicals from being discharged into Michigan waterways with the department’s industrial pretreatment programs producing a 59% reduction of PFOS – a type of PFAS – on average and 99% reduction at some locations.
In addition to addressing PFAS, the department has also leveraged one-time funding from the Legislature to research microplastics in waters throughout the state. While the health impacts of these small pieces of plastic are still being researched, microplastics have been found throughout the human body and are suspected to harm reproductive, digestive and respiratory health. 
The three EGLE departments overseeing microplastics research are focused on four main areas: establishing a better understanding of concentrations of microplastics in surface waters; improving understanding of microplastics in public drinking water supplies; identifying critical areas for future microplastics research; and developing a comprehensive statewide microplastics strategy beginning in 2026.
“I think it’s going to be really eye opening, and give us clarity at least about where to start, where the problem’s the biggest, what do we need to focus on,” Roos said. “It’s similar to the early days of PFAS, you know. There we had communities that were being directly impacted with significant health impacts and water contamination. Here, it’s been sort of a silent issue that we’re all concerned about.”
The state is also playing a part in addressing harmful algal blooms in the Western Lake Erie Basin, with EGLE working alongside the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to reduce the flow of nutrients that cause algal blooms from farmland into the basin over the next five years. 
In addition to its work on pollution and environmental quality, EGLE is also working alongside partners from state and federal agencies and tribal governments on species management, including efforts to address threats to whitefish populations, protect the endangered piping plover and keep invasive sea lampreys in check.
The Michigan Wild Rice Initiative – which is composed of the 12 federally recognized Anishinaabe Nations that share geography with Michigan, and several state agencies including EGLE – also released a stewardship guide on manoomin, or wild rice. The guide tells the story of manoomin from an Anishinaabe perspective centered on building a relationship with the grain as a central part of restoration and revitalization efforts. 
“I cannot stress the importance of that resource for our friends in the tribal communities in the state. Literally, it’s such a central point of their culture and also their livelihood,” Roos said.

Moving into this year, Roos said drinking water will continue to be a main priority for EGLE, especially the state’s efforts to replace lead water lines. 
“I think we’re going to have access to a bit more money in terms of lead service line replacement money this year,” Roos said. “And the reason is that we met a requirement a lot of other states didn’t necessarily meet, which is we were the first state to achieve a statewide inventory of lead service lines.”
The department will also remain focused on making progress on contaminated sites, Roos said, with plans to improve how it staffs sites and how it categorizes the environmental risk at each site.
Another piece of that effort is EGLE’s brownfield redevelopment program, which cleans up contaminated sites so they can be used for housing, business and community needs like parks or recreation centers. 
“We’re going to try to step that up another level in the next year,” Roos said. “We have legislation Rep. [Alabas] Farhat (D-Dearborn) has sponsored which would remove some of the red tape and give us more flexibility in what sites we can use the Brownfield program for.”
Under the current system, grants and loans for each site are capped at $1 million, which Roos said has limited the sites they are able to redevelop. One of the changes within Farhat’s legislation would double that cap to $2 million, marking the first increase since the program began in 1998. 
Building on previous efforts, Roos said the department will also be placing an increased focus on storm water management and dam safety. 
There are a number of dams throughout the state that are in bad shape, Roos said, some of which have owners who have not invested in necessary maintenance and some that have either outlived or are approaching the end of their useful lives.
“You’re going to see a lot of efforts for us to get out in front of that,” Roos said “We’ve had a very successful dam safety fund that we’re just about out of money on. We’re going to hope to get a little help from the Legislature on that.”

The department will also continue to focus on clean and affordable energy Roos said, noting that it will be expanding its home energy rebate program, which provides funding to address the upfront costs of energy efficiency upgrades like insulation, air sealing and heating and cooling, as well as the purchase of electrical appliances, wiring upgrades or buying a heat pump for heating and cooling their household.
Roos also pointed to EGLE’s Renewables Ready Communities program, which provides funding to communities that adopt large-scale solar energy, wind or battery storage. 
While Michigan Attorney General is pursuing a lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration over the decision to revoke funding for the Solar For All Program, Roos noted that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s MI Healthy Climate Plan, which set Michigan’s goal of reaching 100% carbon neutrality by 2050 predates the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which brought an influx of funding and incentives to support the transition to clean energy, including the Solar For All program.

Although EGLE plans to “fight like hell” to get its Solar For All funding back, Roos said, there are other funding mechanisms for programs like Renewables Ready Communities that will help the state to reach its clean energy and climate goals. 
Between a 40% pause in its funding as a result of the Trump Administration’s attempted pause on federal grants and loans, and modest cuts to its budget, EGLE has weathered a lot in the past year, Roos said. Despite those challenges, Roos said he’s proud and thankful the department has been able to continue to provide its core functions alongside meeting its commitments.
However, further cuts could begin to threaten EGLE’s ability to deliver on protections for the residents of Michigan, Roos said.
“Despite everything we’re on our feet, we’re living our mission,” Roos said. “We’re doing everything we can to protect everybody in the state according to what we can under the law. But there’s not a lot of room to mess around here.”

(Getty Images)In the middle of December, a “grateful” John Sununu shared a list of new endorsers for his U.S. Senate campaign, through which he plans to “bring New Hampshire common-sense” to Washington.
Among those new supporters, as the memo’s headline trumpets, is New Hampshire House Majority Leader Jason Osborne.
Despite the Sununu family’s persistent desire to be embraced as moderate conservatives in this immoderate age, and Osborne’s entrenched position in the far right of the state’s Republican Party, the two aren’t exactly strange bedfellows. With Osborne’s endorsement, Sununu will receive a necessary primary bump with New Hampshire right-wingers and, in return, Osborne gets to dip a toe in the mainstream and gain a direct line of communication to a potential U.S. senator. Maybe the fringe, anti-government, Free State Project philosophy of a transplant from Defiance, Ohio, is what passes as “New Hampshire common-sense” these days. 
Ain’t politics grand?
A review of Osborne’s sponsored bills for 2026 sheds some light on his political commonality with former Gov. Chris Sununu’s big brother. The House majority leader would love to see, for example, another rate reduction for the business enterprise tax and the repeal of the communications services tax. I suspect Sununu would be on board with both bills if he had his sights set on the State House rather than the Capitol. And because of the overall Republican fervor for any and all methods of dismantling public education, it’s not hard to imagine Sununu nodding his approval of Osborne’s efforts to “establish a local education freedom account program,” launch a study committee for “transitioning all public schools to public charter schools,” and create a system of open enrollment that would almost certainly close countless community schools in property-poor districts.
But what about some of Osborne’s other pieces of proposed legislation, such as his jingoistic outline for how teachers should be directed to talk about inequality, race, and sexuality, or a bill to repeal the refugee resettlement program? Or how about Osborne’s use of racial slurs and his general callousness?
It almost certainly doesn’t matter to Republican voters. To be a modern Republican is to declare that there is very little you won’t endorse, whether through applause or silence, to accomplish whatever it was that made you a conservative to begin with.
What’s a little violent persecution of certain immigrant populations, based on skin color, if it means the furtherance of “school choice”? 
What’s a bit of brazen profiteering by the nation’s First Family if it means tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest Americans?
What does a clear violation of foreign sovereignty, and another plunge into the morass of nation-building, matter if it means cheaper fossil fuels in the short term for Americans?
Around the same time Sununu sent out his memo of new endorsements, I received an email from a reader who disagreed with something I had written about the state’s approach to taxation. It was a critical but cordial letter, but in a follow-up the writer reprimanded me in a way that has been sloshing around in my brain ever since: “I would prefer that you refer to Republican Leadership rather than Republicans,” he wrote. “There is a difference. Not all Republicans agree with the Leadership.”
That Republican voters would consider politicians that they elected to serve and lead to be somehow disconnected from their own political desires is remarkable to me. It’s one thing if a politician pulled a 180 after an election, in which case the voter is a victim of fraud, with restitution to be paid in the form of an election defeat the next time around. But nothing that’s happening now at the hands of Republican majorities is a surprise, here in Concord or in Washington. The administrations in power never missed an opportunity on the trail to articulate just how black and white they viewed the world, nor did they underplay the inhuman lengths to which they would go to prosecute and punish the people they consider unworthy of an American existence.
The slowly unraveling narrator of Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man” asks, amid his deep disillusionment in a postwar America incapable of bridging its violent divisions, whether politics could ever be “an expression of love.” I’m not sure how readers answered that question in 1952, but here in 2026 a “hell no” echoes through policy after policy drafted by a ruling party that is fully committed to broadly inflicting love’s opposite.
I get the sense from Republicans like Sununu and my letter writer that many in the party still see the president as some kind of an outlier, a useful but impermanent disfigurement of the party’s core principles. But this president’s role isn’t as some kind of singular architect but rather as a performer who effectively channels the many currents that electrify his party. That job is a walk in the park for a man who desires power above all else and pays no mind to the means by which that power is acquired, secured, and exercised. To believe that Republican leaders will return to some level of restraint once he’s gone is to disregard the historic allure of unfettered control of political levers. 
Do the moderate Republicans and right-leaning independents who are quietly riding out the present darkness (while privately celebrating any ideological victories that darkness has delivered) really believe that things will eventually snap back to some kind of more palatable centrism? Do they think the president’s personal ambition is somehow unique, that others aren’t lined up to grasp the same reins in exactly the same manner the very second this president releases them, by fate or by force?
Or maybe I’m overthinking it and the key to living as a modern old-school Republican in these cold days is just to pocket what you can while disavowing the sins of the motley coalition it took to get it. And then maybe a small prayer, of fluctuating urgency, that the genie will put itself back in the bottle before things go too far.
If that’s the case, I’m afraid I have some bad news.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/modernGOP-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-07 09:57:43.167042

(Photo on left by WEWS, photo on right provided.)David Pepper, the former chair of the Ohio Democrats, has been tapped as Dr. Amy Acton’s running mate in the 2026 governor race.
Pepper, an attorney from Cincinnati, Ohio, was predicted by both Democratic and Republican strategists as Acton’s running mate.
“I am proud to select David Pepper as my Lieutenant Governor. We both share a lifelong commitment to fighting for Ohio’s working families and making our state a more affordable place to live for all of us. David is an innovative and pragmatic leader who has been laser-focused on delivering for Ohioans for his entire career, from reducing the property tax rate for Cincinnatians to tackling foreclosures during the 2008 recession,” Acton said in a statement.
“I am thrilled to have David by my side in the fight to lower costs, tackle corruption and special interests, and ensure that every Ohio family can thrive and enjoy the quality of life we all deserve.”
Pepper, 54, has been supporting Acton, 59, for years. In our coverage of her campaign, Pepper has been the Democratic strategist cheering her on.
“Someone starting from no political background in such a short amount of time built such a massive base that only grows,” Pepper said back in July.
He also defended Acton’s work during the pandemic back in 2020.
Pepper served on the Cincinnati City Council and Hamilton County Board of Commissioners for years.
While on the Commission, he helped cut spending by $60 million, according to the campaign. He introduced a prescription drug discount program for Hamilton County, helped create a foreclosure prevention program and led an earned income tax credit initiative.
During his tenure on Council, he focused on affordability and public safety.
“I am honored and humbled to be joining Amy’s ticket and partnering with her in the fight to deliver for Ohio’s working families. Amy is the only candidate in this race who will tackle our affordability crisis and work to lower costs, tackle corruption, and invest in our public schools, so we can finally put working families first, not billionaires or special interests,” Pepper said in a statement.
“While our opponent is flying around our state in his private jet and moving his business from Cincinnati to Texas, we’re working to tackle the affordability crisis and create an Ohio where we can all get ahead.”
Pepper is a well-known name in Ohio politics, and one of the reasons is his outspoken nature. His X account boasts nearly 110,000 followers. He has also written several books about democracy.
He has been called by other strategists an essential political donor to Democratic causes.
“Ohio families are struggling to make ends meet, and Amy and David are the right choice to take on lowering costs, tackle the rampant corruption and special interests in our state and ensure that every Ohio family can thrive. The Acton campaign is the only choice in this race to fight for Ohio and put our state first,” Ted Strickland, Ohio’s former governor, said.
Pepper’s background
After growing up in Southwest Ohio, he graduated from Yale University and went to Yale Law School.
Pepper and his wife live in Cincinnati with their two children.

Chynah Tyler of Boston misspent campaign funds on personal uses such as Uber Eats orders, and failed to document details behind about $4,500 in other spending.","THE STATE’S CAMPAIGN FINANCE laws are notoriously generous when it comes to the kinds of things politicians can spend money on from their campaign accounts. They can use donations to their campaign on anything that furthers their political interests, a mile-wide definition that has seen state regulators give the green light to expenditures on everything from pricey steak dinners with colleagues to suites at the Beanpot college hockey tournament.
Despite rules that stretch allowable spending to include sometimes eyebrow-raising uses, Beacon Hill officials still seem to regularly manage to find themselves dinged by regulators for stepping beyond those limits.
The latest pol in the unwanted spotlight: state Rep. Chynah Tyler of Boston. Uber Eats, audiobooks, and thousands of dollars in unexplained spending have landed the Roxbury pol in hot water with state political finance regulators.
The Office of Campaign and Political Finance alleged that Tyler misused money from her campaign account for personal expenses in violation of state law, plus ran afoul of other reporting deadlines and record-keeping requirements.
Under the terms of an agreement made public Tuesday, Tyler will pay a $6,000 civil forfeiture to the state and to submit to greater campaign-finance scrutiny by OCPF for the next six months.
Regulators said Tyler made more than $800 in personal expenses “in error” from her campaign account between April 1 and October 20, which she repaid after OCPF inquired.
The office said Tyler’s team did not provide records to explain nearly $4,500 in additional expenses. State law presumes that any campaign spending without supporting documentation is made for personal use.
Tyler did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
In an eight-paragraph statement included in the disposition agreement, Tyler said she gave birth in early 2025 — several months before the alleged personal spending from her campaign account — “and experienced limited mobility during that time, which impacted my ability to personally oversee certain campaign finance activities.”
On August 29, Tyler repaid her campaign committee $726 for personal expenses, and she repaid another $101 on November 2025.
While Tyler wrote in her OCPF statement that she reimbursed her campaign for personal spending “to ensure full compliance,” she did not provide any explanation of the $4,500 that regulators say was not properly documented.
Revised campaign finance reports now include multiple entries labeled “personal expense made in error,” such as a pair of Uber Eats orders, two separate $16.99 “recurring” charges for audiobook service Audible, and a $223 expense at Aicha’s African Hair Braiding in Dorchester.
Regulators dinged Tyler for several other reasons, too. They said her campaign failed to file reports in a timely manner detailing more than $13,000 in deposits between May 31, 2024 and June 28, 2024, which have since been submitted.
Tyler also allegedly received about $900 in combined contributions above the allowable limit from three people. While the campaign said it refunded the excess donations, OCPF wrote that Tyler’s camp did not submit any documentation to support that claim.
The five-term rep, who previously led the Legislature’s Black and Latino Legislative Caucus, owes $1,000 to the state immediately and will repay the remainder of the balance over a period of up to 10 months.
Tyler also agreed for her committee to provide OCPF with invoices, receipts, and other documentation covering all expenditures each month to undergo private regulatory review for six months.
It’s not the first time OCPF has chided Tyler for putting campaign dollars toward personal uses. In 2018, Tyler used $1,600 from her committee account as a “personal loan,” which she later repaid to her campaign.
Several lawmakers in recent years have triggered federal scrutiny through their spending habits. Former state rep David Nangle of Lowell served more than a year in prison after pleading guilty to charges that he used campaign funds on golf club memberships and casino bets.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chynah-Tyler.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 09:57:43.167042

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas House higher education budget committee didn’t wait for start of the 2026 legislative session to take a dive into millions of dollars in pending budget requests for public universities.
Rep. Adam Turk, a Shawnee Republican who chairs the committee, convened Republicans and Democrats during what he referred to as “zero week” rather than await start of the session Monday. The objective was to get a jumpstart on presentations and discussions about budget earmarks for Wichita State University, Kansas State University, University of Kansas, Fort Hays State University, Pittsburg State University and Emporia State University.
The Legislature’s interim budget committee previously rejected in late 2024 a series of proposals for university budget enhancements and hiring new campus personnel. In addition, that joint House and Senate budget committee said unused funding in current budgets could be seized and reappropriated in the new budget.
At this stage, administrators at the six state universities in Kansas began making sales pitches to the Republican-led House higher education budget committee for possible restoration of their requests.
“It is my intent to bring a quality product to the next level,” Turk said. “We can’t afford it to be unclear or indecisive or arbitrary in any way. I graduated from none of these institutions. I’ve got no dog in this hunt. You won’t see me playing favorites. Nothing is personal in here. It is math.”
Lawrence Rep. Mike Amyx, the ranking Democrat on the higher education committee, said he would focus on developing a budget plan that invested in delivery of a high-quality college education.
“Do everything we can to come out with the best budget,” Amyx said.
During the day’s committee meeting, PSU President Thomas Newsom, FHSU President Tia Mason and interim ESU President Taylor Kriley shared budget and enrollment information with legislators. They outlined arguments for legislative support of individual budget requests.
Comments from several lawmakers indicated the focus of the House committee would be on decreasing state government spending on higher education.
“I see a lot of expansion, new stuff,” said Turk, the chairman. “It’s real easy to build something new. Really hard … to find the things that are not working anymore, cut them off.”
Newsom, who started in September at PSU after leading Southeastern Oklahoma State University for five years, said higher education needed to do a better job of deleting weak programs as it went about directing resources into promising programs. He said regional public universities such as PSU had to concentrate on making efficient use of public and private funding as well as being responsive to student and industry demands.
“We tend to add new toys to the toy box a lot without getting rid of old toys,” Newsom said.
He said PSU’s goal was to attract 700 new students over the next five years, which could infuse $6 million in tuition revenue into the university.
Mason, who has served as president of FHSU since 2018, said the university had the lowest tuition and fee rate among public universities in Kansas. FHSU successfully launched affiliation agreements with North Central Kansas Technical College and Northwest Kansas Technical College to create better academic pathways for students, find operational efficiencies and better serve the region’s economy.
“We view ourselves as an engine for social mobility,” she said. “Proving that a premium education doesn’t have to come with a premium price tag.”
Mason was asked for enrollment and financial information about FHSU’s online degree programs with two universities in China. FHSU last fall enrolled 3,000 students from China in English, business, leadership and health studies programs. The international students generated about $9 million in annual revenue, she said, but net revenue runs about $5 million per year. The funds were plowed into the FHSU campus in Hays, she said.
Rep. Bill Rhiley, a Republican from Wellington, said influx of tuition dollars from international programs had successfully subsidized tuition rates for Kansans attending FHSU. Mason concurred with Rhiley, and called that revenue a “game changer” in terms of tuition affordability.
Mason said FHSU students in China were linked to an IT system based in Singapore. A cybersecurity firm was hired FHSU to improve online computer systems, she said. Participants in the China program didn’t engage in academic research that could be the subject of espionage, she said.
“They’re highly vetted and they’re very established partnerships,” Mason said. “The geopolitical environment has changed in 30 years. I appreciate the question.”
Turk said nobody on the House committee was questioning the commitment at FHSU to guarantee security of the program with China. He told Mason it was impossible to predict how international relationships could unfold years from now.
“I don’t mean to beat you up about this China thing,” he said. “The nature of my question is simply how to plan for the worst. We wouldn’t be doing our job if we weren’t projecting, as budget members, into the future.”
The House committee also heard budget presentations from representatives of the Behavioral Sciences Regulatory Board, Kansas State Board of Healing Arts, Kansas State Historical Society and Kansas State Library.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/thomas-Newsom-psu-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 09:57:43.167042

“I’m not a career politician; I come from a background of showing up early, working hard, and getting the job done,” Scott said, in a news release. “I’m running for the State Senate to make life better for retirees, families, and workers by keeping costs down, making sure people can access quality healthcare, and supporting the people who keep our communities running.”

(Photo provided by Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities)Future assessments of U.S. landslide hazards could include the study of risks posed by atmospheric rivers, which caused extreme precipitation that was linked to recent deadly slides in Southeast Alaska.
The added focus on atmospheric rivers is one of the main updates in a bill that would reauthorize the National Landslide Preparedness Act. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, passed the U.S. Senate on Monday and is now to be considered by the U.S. House.
The initial National Landslide Preparedness Act was signed into law five years ago. That bill broadened the National Landslide Hazards Program led by the U.S. Geological Survey and established a multiagency system to coordinate landslide preparedness and response.
Atmospheric rivers are long and transitory bands of moisture and heat, likened to rivers in the sky. They carry that moisture northward from more southern latitudes, and they can dump vast amounts of rain for several hours or even days.
“You can very rapidly saturate soils in the right conditions,” said Rick Thoman, a scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
When such large amounts of warm southern moisture hit the steep mountainous regions of Southeast Alaska, they can cause sudden downhill flows, Thoman said.
“It’s really that intense amount of rain that atmospheric rivers deliver that’s the link to landslides,” he said.
Numerous landslides in the United States have been triggered by atmospheric rivers’ extreme precipitation. Those events include the 2023 slide in Wrangell that killed six people, the 2020 slide in Haines that killed two people and the 2015 slide in Sitka that killed three people.
The National Landslide Preparedness Act Reauthorization Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent. It is co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, whose state was the site of the 2014 Oso landslide that killed 43 people.
Extreme precipitation events from atmospheric rivers are tied to shallow-seated landslides such as the deadly events that struck Southeast Alaska in recent years. Other types of Alaska landslides are caused by more deep-seated slope failures triggered by glacial retreat, permafrost thaw or a combination of those forces.
Also passed on Monday by unanimous consent in the Senate was another Murkowski-sponsored and disaster-focused bill, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act. That bill, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-California, supports the federal program that maintains earthquake measurement resources and equipment and equipment and early warning systems.
“Earthquakes and landslides are active threats that have taken lives and damaged property across Alaska in recent years,” Murkowski said in a statement issued Tuesday. “Our passage of these bills puts us on track to ensure that federal agencies have the resources they need to help keep communities safe both back home and around the country. I thank my colleagues for working cooperatively to pass these measures and urge the House to take them up and send them to the President as soon as possible.”

One year ago today, the Palisades and Eaton wildfires erupted in Los Angeles County. Together they burned more than 58 square miles of land — destroying over 16,000 structures, displacing thousands of households and claiming at least 31 lives. As one of the costliest wildfires in history, the estimated economic losses caused by the blazes range from $65 billion to as much as $275 billion.
Most residents are still struggling to put their lives together: A survey by the nonprofit group Department of Angels found that about 90% of Pacific Palisades residents and 80% of Altadena residents remain displaced as of October. 
Survivors also continue to face frustrations with insurance companies — including delayed or denied claims — underscoring how California’s property insurance market remains rife with problems, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay. 
Premiums are likely to rise for policyholders across the state, and customers of California’s two largest insurers, State Farm and the last-resort FAIR Plan, were the most dissatisfied with their insurers’ response, according to the Department of Angels.

Angela Giacchetti, a spokesperson for the nonprofit whose Altadena home was damaged by the Eaton Fire: “We’ve paid almost $200,000 out of pocket to repair our home because of the FAIR Plan’s blanket denials of our remediation.”

But there have been some wins. California passed a law last year requiring insurers to pay claims without first seeing detailed inventories from policyholders. On Tuesday Gov. Gavin Newsom also issued an executive order expanding price gouging protections for people recovering from the fires. 
Permits for new homes in the affected regions have also been issued at a relatively fast clip compared to historic state standards, reports CalMatters’ Ben Christopher. As of this week, more than 2,600 residential permits have been distributed — a rate that’s “three times faster” than the five years leading up to the fires, Newsom’s administration noted.

After being rushed to a Chico hospital the night before, U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa died on Tuesday at the age of 65. For more than a decade the Republican represented California’s 1st Congressional District, which stretches from the Oregon-California border through Shasta and Sutter counties, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
LaMalfa died in emergency surgery after experiencing a “medical emergency” in his home, according to the Butte County Sheriff’s Office. Lamalfa was known as a pragmatic congressmember who was committed to issues affecting his rural Northern California district, including water access and forestry management.
His death narrows the GOP’s slim majority in the House, which now stands at 218. By state law, Gov. Newsom has 14 days to call a special election to fill the rest of LaMalfa’s term, which will take place under the existing district boundaries, rather than the new lines voters approved of through Proposition 50.

Limón starts as Pro Tem

Seven months after being elected Senate President Pro Tem in June, Democratic Sen. Monique Limón of Santa Barbara begins her tenure as leader of the California Senate — the first Latina ever to do so, reports Maya.
Backed by labor unions, the 46-year-old progressive’s career in the chamber includes successfully pushing legislation to make workers’ pay more transparent, shield medical debt from credit reports and require setbacks around new oil and gas wells. Prior to that, Limón was an Assemblymember for four years, and served on the board of trustees for the Santa Barbara Unified School District for six years.
As Senate Pro Tem, Limón faces the state’s $18 billion budget deficit and deep federal cuts under President Donald Trump. Though she did not disclose many details about how she’ll steer the caucus through budget talks, she told CalMatters that the caucus “will continue to prioritize issues that our communities prioritize.” She also declined to identify any specific legislative measures that the caucus would prioritize.

The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office released a report Tuesday, examining whether the funding formula for California’s K-12 schools should switch from attendance to enrollment, which could bring billions of more dollars to schools. Read what the LAO recommends from CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Critics of Newsom and California Democrats are making an iffy link between a state audit on fraud and a scandal in Minnesota, highlighting the amped-up rhetoric during an election year.
The California Department of Insurance is too lax regulating insurance companies’ behavior, yet too strict controlling their market access, writes Patrick Wolff, a Democrat who is running for insurance commissioner.
Local and state governments failed to lead within months of the L.A.-area fires, and candidates now running for various L.A. offices must present serious plans to address these failures, writes Max Lubin, CEO of Kismet Research.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-07 13:39:56+00:00,Mississippi Today,83 witnesses could enter the ring in Mississippi welfare scandal trial,Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/07/83-witnesses-mississippi-welfare-scandal-trial/,The federal courthouse in Jackson,"Ten of roughly 80 potential jurors raised their hands in a downtown Jackson courtroom Tuesday when a federal judge asked: “How many professional wrestling fans do we have in here?”
Juror #4 stood and responded to U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves, “You wanna ask my favorite or something?”
It was John Cena, a WWE star of the mid-2000s t0 2010s.
“You’re a youngster,” Reeves joked.
Others were fond of The Undertaker, The Spoiler, or Bruiser and Crusher – performers dating back to as early as the 60s. But nearly all called themselves “former” fans of the sport. They watched no longer. “Too bloody and too violent,” Juror #19 mused.
None of these answers were necessarily disqualifying since each of the participants vowed that their affinity – or lack thereof – for athletic theater would not affect their impartiality as a juror in the criminal trial of retired WWE wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr.
Jury selection in the trial began Tuesday morning and lasted until after 7 p.m. The federal government will begin presenting its case against DiBiase Wednesday morning. 
DiBiase is accused of conspiracy, wire fraud, theft concerning programs receiving federal funds and money laundering surrounding payments two nonprofits made to him in 2018 at the direction of the Mississippi Department of Human Services. 
The money he’s accused of taking came from two federal public assistance programs, including the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant.
The charges against DiBiase represent just a fraction of what is known as the Mississippi welfare scandal, in which auditors have questioned the spending of roughly $100 million in anti-poverty funds. But he is the only criminal defendant to challenge the government, insisting he was a lawful contractor. Seven others, including his brother Brett DiBiase, have pleaded guilty.
During the proceedings Tuesday, jurors were asked if they had heard anything about the welfare scandal in the news or on social media – around half said yes – or if they had read State Auditor Shad White’s supposed tell-all, “Mississippi Swindle,” about the case. None had.
“I heard about the book, but I care nothing about reading it,” Juror #66 said. “I don’t want to read anything he writes.”
But when Reeves asked if anyone in the courtroom believed everything TV stations or newspapers had to say about the scandal, the room went silent. Like with their WWE nostalgia, the jurors promised that any information they’d consumed previously would not sway their judgement.
Perhaps the most revelatory inquiry came when Reeves asked the jurors if they had a relationship with any of the potential witnesses in the case, reading out a list of a whopping 83 names.
The list predictably included characters with direct involvement in the financial transactions alleged in the indictment against DiBiase – such as the former welfare director John Davis or the directors of the two nonprofits that paid funds to the wrestler, Mississippi Community Education Center founder Nancy New and former Family Resource Center of North Mississippi director Christi Webb. Davis, New and Webb have pleaded guilty for their roles in the larger scheme to divert funding away from needy families. 
But the list of witnesses goes much further, reaching high up into state government, including both White, who first investigated and made initial arrests in the case, and former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant. Bryant was Davis’ boss during the scandal. And Bryant appointed White to his position of state auditor.
From the Mississippi Department of Human Services, the witness list includes the agency’s top official, current director Bob Anderson, former director Chris Freeze, and roughly 20 cabinet or lower-ranking employees, such as former attorneys Jacob Black and William Garrig Shields, two former communications directors, and Davis’ old secretary. It includes members of the team that audited or investigated the scandal for the State Auditor’s Office, the lead FBI agent and a representative from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General.
The list also features a director at the regional office of HHS’s Administration for Children and Families in Atlanta, the agency responsible for providing federal guidance to Mississippi about TANF. 
Potential witnesses include DiBiase’s inner circle – his wife, his brother, multiple business associates and fellow motivational speakers – but also a who’s who of local celebrities and entrepreneurs that had become entangled in the wider state-sanctioned welfare delivery model called Families First for Mississippi from 2016 to 2020. 
One seemingly tangential witness, retired star running back Marcus Dupree, for example, received payments from the two nonprofits through a foundation he created to provide “equestrian activities for underprivileged children.” The witness list did not include former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. 
The trial is expected to take up to three weeks, and not all of the listed figures may be called.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/07092145/courthouse_jackson.jpg,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034
,California,2026-01-07 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,This change could deliver billions of more dollars to California schools. Here’s the tradeoff,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2026/01/school-enrollment-california/,"By basing funding on enrollment, not attendance numbers, schools would lose the incentive to get students to show up every day, a new report finds.","In summary
By basing funding on enrollment, not attendance numbers, schools would lose the incentive to get students to show up every day, a new report finds.


For years, California schools have pushed to change the way the state pays for K-12 education: by basing funding on enrollment, instead of attendance. That’s the way 45 other states do it, and it would mean an extra $6 billion annually in school coffers.
But such a move might cause more harm than good in the long run, because linking funding to enrollment means schools have little incentive to lure students to class every day, according to a report released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. Without that incentive, attendance would drop, and students would suffer. 
If the Legislature wants to boost school funding, analysts argued, it should use the existing attendance-based model and funnel more money to schools with high numbers of low-income students, students in foster care and English learners.
When it comes to attendance, money talks, the report noted. For more than a century, California has funded schools based on average daily attendance – how many students show up every day. In the 1980s and ’90s, the state started to look at alternatives. A pilot study from that time period showed that attendance at high schools rose 5.4% and attendance at elementary schools rose 3.1% when those schools had a financial incentive to boost attendance. 
This is not the time to ease up on attendance matters, the report said. Although attendance has improved somewhat since campuses closed during the pandemic, it remains well below pre-COVID-19 levels. In 2019, nearly 96% of students showed up to school every day. The number dropped to about 90% during COVID-19, when most schools switched to remote learning, but still remains about 2 percentage points below its previous high. 
Attendance is tied to a host of student success measurements. Students with strong attendance tend to have higher test scores, higher levels of reading proficiency and higher graduation rates.
“It’s a thoughtful analysis that weighs the pros and cons,” said Hedy Chang, president of the nonprofit research and advocacy organization Attendance Works. “For some districts there might be benefits to a funding switch, but it also helps when districts have a concrete incentive for encouraging kids to show up.”
True cost of educating kids
Schools have long asked the Legislature to change the funding formula, which they say doesn’t cover the actual costs of educating students, especially those with high needs. The issue came up repeatedly at a recent conference of the California School Boards Association, and there’s been at least one recent bill that addressed the issue.
The bill, by former Sen. Anthony Portantino, a Democrat from the La Cañada Flintridge area, initially called for a change to the funding formula, but the final version merely asked the Legislative Analyst’s Office to study the issue. The bill passed in 2024.
A 2022 report by Policy Analysis for California Education also noted the risks of removing schools’ financial incentive to prioritize attendance. But it also said that increasing school funding overall would give districts more stability.
Enrollment is a better funding metric because schools have to plan for the number of students who sign up, not the number who show up, said Troy Flint, spokesman for the California School Boards Association. 
He also noted that schools with higher rates of absenteeism also tend to have higher numbers of students who need extra help, such as English learners, migrant students and low-income students. Tying funding to daily attendance — which in some districts is as low as 60% — brings less money to those schools, ultimately hurting the students who need the most assistance, he said.  
“It just compounds the problem, creating a vicious cycle,” Flint said.
To really boost attendance, schools need extra funding to serve those students.
Switching to an enrollment-based funding model would increase K-12 funding by more than $6 billion, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office. Currently, schools receive about $15,000 annually per student through the state’s main funding mechanism, the Local Control Funding Formula, with an additional $7,000 coming from the federal government, block grants, lottery money, special education funds and other sources. Overall, California spent more than $100 billion on schools last year, according to the Legislative Analyst.
Motivated by money?
Flint’s group also questioned whether schools are solely motivated by money to entice students to class.
“Most people in education desperately want kids in class every day,” Flint said. “These are some of the most dedicated, motivated people I’ve met, and they care greatly about students’ welfare.”
Josh Schultz, superintendent of the Napa County Office of Education, agreed. Napa schools that are funded through attendance actually have lower attendance than schools that are considered “basic aid,” and funded through local property taxes. Both types of schools have high numbers of English learners and migrant students.
“I can understand the logic (of the LAO’s assertion) but I don’t know if it bears out in reality, at least here,” Schultz said. “Both kinds of schools see great value in having kids show up to school every day.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/030122_High_School_1297_SW_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

While few victims of last year’s fires are back in their homes, that’s not unusual following natural disasters; permitting changes appear to be helping. 


In the days immediately after last January’s Los Angeles firestorm, state lawmakers and civic leaders promised to turbocharge the rebuilding effort. For California, where the permitting and construction of homes is infamously slow and costly, the scale of destruction stood as a singular challenge.
A year later, the charred homes, the melted appliances and the toxic ash have mostly been removed, the dirt beneath scraped and then carted away. Many of the residents whose houses were spared have returned. Permits for reconstruction have been filed, architects and contractors hired. Battles with insurance companies, utilities and banks persist, vacant lots and blackened trees abound, but look around and — here and there — you’ll find new construction.
As of this week, more than 2,600 residential permits have been issued between the Palisades and Altadena — roughly one for every five of the nearly 13,000 homes lost. Another 3,340 are under review.
For many displaced and traumatized homeowners, that represents an intolerably slow return to what was. But by historic standards, the Los Angeles recovery has been on the speedy side so far.
In a press release commemorating the first anniversary of the disaster, Gov. Gavin Newsom lauded the permitting figures as “historic.”
Last year local governments — the City and County of Los Angeles, as well as Malibu and Pasadena — issued permits for single-family homes and accessory dwelling units “three times faster” than they were in the five years leading up to the fire, the administration noted. 
Rebuilding after disaster is almost always a grueling, slow process. Of the more than 22,500 homes destroyed in five of California’s most destructive fires between 2017 and 2020, fewer than four-in-ten had been rebuilt by 2025, a Los Angeles Times analysis from late last summer found.
A year after major fires ripped through Maui, Paradise, Redding and the outskirts of Boulder, Colo., 2%, 3%, 15% and 30% of the destroyed homes, respectively, had been permitted for reconstruction, according to a separate Urban Institute analysis. 
 Based on the pace of permitting, Los Angeles’ reconstruction is on a relatively fast track. But freshly-pulled permits aren’t completed homes.
“People can pull permits, but you know, if they don’t have their costs sorted out — we’ve had folks abandon their plans,” said Devang Shah with Genesis Builders, which is selling pre-approved, fixed-priced rebuilds in Altadena. Using permits as a metric of progress may be premature, he said.
Some of the speedy progress that Los Angeles has seen may be due to  regulatory changes imposed by fiat in the aftermath of the fire. In early 2025, both Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass mandated speedier permitting of like-for-like rebuilds — construction that stuck to the rough dimensions and design specification of the home that was there before. Los Angeles county rolled out a self-certification building plan approval pilot program for certain simple projects. Newsom waived building code requirements intended to ease the cost of reconstruction.
“We’ve got planning approvals in three days that would have normally taken three months,” said Tim Vordtriede, an architect who also lost his home in Altadena. The county has “done a remarkable job at making things as efficient and streamlined as a bureaucratic entity can.”
In the weeks after the fire, Vordtriede co-founded the Altadena Collective, a network of designers and architects that provides discounted design services, permitting advice and contractor recommendations to local survivors. He and his co-founders Chris Driscoll and Chris Corbett have also launched a nonprofit called Collective OR that is meant to represent inexperienced and anxious homeowners in negotiations with builders and architects. 
“It’s impossible to say, ‘they were here by this date so we should also be there.’ The data set is just too variable.”Colette Curtis, recovery and economic development director, Paradise 
The pace of reconstruction may simply benefit from the fact that it’s taking place in Los Angeles County: A mammoth economic hub flush with financial resources and political connections.
“We have access to a really good supply chain, there’s a lot of capital, there’s a lot of infrastructure,“ said Ben Stapleton, director of U.S. Green Building Council California. 
That’s in contrast to a town like Paradise. 
Since the majority of homes were destroyed in the 2018 Camp Fire, fewer than one-in-five have since been rebuilt, said Colette Curtis, the Butte County town’s recovery and economic development director. 
She cautioned against comparing the pace of rebuilding efforts across communities struck by disaster.
“It’s impossible to say, ‘they were here by this date so we should also be there,’” she said. “The data set is just too variable.”
Paradise, a remote town with relatively low income, lacked the local services and philanthropic draw of places like Lahaina and the Palisades, she said. But lower land values and the fact that displaced homeowners haven’t had to compete with investors setting aside new units for tourist rentals was a net positive. 
Another thing that may give Los Angeles a leg up: It’s a region that’s also heavy on expertise. 
At around the same time that Vordtriede was setting up the Altadena Collective, nearby architect couple Cynthia Sigler and Alex Athenson launched the Foothill Catalog, a packet of ready-made architectural and structural plans that have been pre-approved by L.A. County. 
With roughly 15 projects either under construction or gearing up to break ground, Athenson said the pre-approval process can shave at least 10% off the total development cost of a custom single-family home.
That’s in part by trimming the approval process. But that’s also because prior to the fire, a “custom single-family home” in ALtadena was a luxury product. 
The local industry is “set up to serve that client who is building their dream home from scratch, with a very large if not unlimited budget,” said Athenson. Long-time homeowners displaced by fire, many of them on fixed incomes, represent a very different kind of buyer. 
As builders, designers and policymakers scramble to rebuild in faster, cheaper and more fire-resilient ways, they may stumble upon a solution that could be of use long after the last home is rebuilt in Altadena, he added.
“Ultimately, we’re providing a system for more efficient, affordable housing development,” said Athenson. “I’m excited about proving it in Altadena, and then seeing where it goes beyond.”
So far the county has approved more than two dozen of the catalog’s plans. Athenson said they are now discussing rolling out a similar batch for the Palisades with the City of Los Angeles.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/083025-Palisades-Fire-Rebuild-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

Last January, immediately after the fires, there was a moment of optimism for the future of Los Angeles. Fire survivors, policymakers, philanthropists, CEOs and regular Angelenos came together to plan Los Angeles’ recovery. 
But today, 12 months later, the failed leadership of California politicians has set back recovery efforts. 
I am a born and raised Angeleno, and like so many others after the fires, I wanted to help. My career leading mission-driven work led me to connect with Evan Spiegel, founder of Snapchat, and Miguel Santana, president of the California Community Foundation. They launched the Department of Angels, a nonprofit that supports LA wildfire survivors, elevating their leadership in the recovery process. 
Today the group is one of many organizations dedicated to the recovery effort. But community-driven work can only accomplish so much. Recovery efforts for disasters of this scale require the government to lead. 
Signs of the government’s systemic failure to lead began emerging within months of the fires. Away from Los Angeles when the fires first ignited — on an international trip she had pledged not to take — Mayor Karen Bass began the recovery effort behind the 8-ball and has seemingly never recovered. She has openly feuded with critics of her performance, including the Palisades Fire recovery czar that she herself appointed. 
At the county level, the board of supervisors still has not fixed the county’s broken emergency notification system, a failure that likely contributed to many of the 19 deaths in the Eaton Fire.
And at the state level, Gov. Gavin Newsom jockeyed to be the central figure in the campaign for federal funding, but his rivalry with President Donald Trump has doomed the possibility of federal aid for Los Angeles. 
The consequences have been devastating for survivors. 
Today, more than 8 in 10 Altadena residents and 9 in 10 Palisades residents are still out of their homes. Thousands of houses that survived the flames remain unsafe or uninhabitable because of contamination. And only about 15% of the 10,000-plus destroyed homes have received rebuilding permits from LA city or county. 
In other words, a year later, the rebuilding process has barely begun.
Perhaps worst of all, no concrete steps have been taken to prevent future wildfires in the Los Angeles area, where conflagrations are all but guaranteed.  If nothing changes about the government’s approach, most survivors of January’s fires will never return to their neighborhoods, and future fires will claim even more lives, homes and businesses. 
Despite the gravity of these challenges, there are reasons for optimism. This year Californians have the opportunity to elect officials who can plot a better way forward, including a new governor and statewide insurance commissioner. 
In Los Angeles, we will have elections for county supervisors, City Council, Congress, mayor and more. 
What are candidates’ plans for fire recovery?
The myriad candidates in the running need to present serious plans to address the failures of the first year of recovery. They must communicate clear ideas to address environmental toxins that remain, failed emergency response systems, future wildfire prevention and the painfully slow pace of permitting and rebuilding — among many other related issues. 
Philanthropy can play a role, too, by organizing nonpartisan candidate forums for candidates to hear from survivors directly. In the first year of the fire recovery, LA’s robust institutional philanthropies tried to help elected leaders behind the scenes. Looking ahead, philanthropies would be better served backing the public accountability work necessary for politicians to deliver on their promises. 
The failures of the first year of wildfire recovery rests at the feet of politicians, but that does not mean that the many years of recovery work ahead are doomed. Survivors and regular Angelenos have the chance to hold elected officials accountable for their shortcomings and elect new ones who are up to the job.

Despite billions in dollars of claims paid out, fires exposed problems in California’s beleaguered insurance market. All policyholders are likely to see premiums rise.


A year after the deadly Los Angeles County fires, California’s property insurance market remains problematic; survivors are suing insurers over delayed or denied claims; and most of the state’s policyholders are likely to see their premiums rise.
Seven in 10 L.A. fire survivors have yet to return home, some in part because of insurance claim delays, according to a new survey released this week by Department of Angels, a nonprofit group that was formed after the fires.
The survey also found that 4 in 10 insurance policyholders have experienced insurability issues, such as huge premium increases and dropped coverage, although state law mandates a one-year moratorium on insurers canceling or not renewing customers’ policies after the governor declares a state of emergency. Those with homes that did not burn down but are still standing are especially likely to have seen big increases in their premiums, according to the survey of 2,443 adults from Nov. 18 to Dec. 2, 2025.
Insurance premiums for everyone, not just fire survivors, were already expected to rise under new rules by Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. The commissioner, under pressure to improve availability of insurance in the state, last January implemented a plan that aims for quicker rate reviews and allows insurers to use catastrophe modeling and reinsurance costs in setting their rates. The plan took effect just days before the L.A. fires.
Now the response to the fires could also lead to even higher insurance premiums across the board, said Amy Bach, executive director of consumer advocacy group United Policyholders. 
“I advocate for disaster survivors, but also for the entire community of policyholders,” Bach said. “For every ‘Eliminate the List’ bill, for every improvement we make to prevent post-disaster trauma around under-insurance, there’s a cost.” She said such actions will have ramifications for both insurance affordability and availability.
“Eliminate the List,” which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law last year, requires insurance companies to pay 60% of personal property coverage limits, up to $350,000, to policyholders who experience a total loss without requiring them to submit a detailed inventory for at least 100 days.
Still, Bach knows that such mandates are necessary to improve survivors’ experiences after a fire, and lawmakers are introducing new bills to address their concerns. Her own group released a survey in November, reporting policyholder complaints that included insurer communication delays, claims payment delays and being assigned multiple claims adjusters. 
The Department of Angels survey found that customers of State Farm and the last-resort FAIR Plan — the two largest insurers in California — were the most dissatisfied with their insurers’ response. California’s insurance department is investigating State Farm’s response to the fires, and has taken legal action against the FAIR Plan over its response as well, especially to smoke-damage claims. Those insurers, along with other companies, are also facing policyholder lawsuits. 
“Our customer feedback reflects a different experience than what is being reported,” said Tom Hartmann, a State Farm spokesperson, in an email. “We’re supporting more than 13,500 customers affected by the wildfires, more than any other carrier, and have already paid over $5 billion to help them recover.”

“We’ve paid almost $200,000 out of pocket to repair our home because of the FAIR Plan’s blanket denials of our remediation,” said Angela Giacchetti, a spokesperson for the Department of Angels who worked on the survey. She’s also a fire survivor whose Altadena home did not burn down but was badly damaged. 
“While we are unable to comment on individual policyholders’ claims, the California FAIR Plan does not direct where policyholders reside,” said Hilary McLean, a spokesperson for the plan. “The FAIR Plan evaluates every claim on its own merits and pays all covered claims up to the individual policy limits.”  
The FAIR Plan said in a press release this week that it has handled about 5,400 claims and paid almost $3.5 billion to policyholders. It also said it “has taken steps to enhance its ability to serve policyholders” by securing a line of credit and reinsurance, helped by a $750 million catastrophe bond made possible by a new law allowing the FAIR Plan to get bond financing through the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank.
The American Property Casualty Insurance Association says insurance companies have paid $22.4 billion of the expected $40 billion in total claims from the L.A. fires. 
The Department of Angels survey also found 79% of survivors are facing financial hardships, with more Black, Asian and Latino survivors falling behind on their rent or mortgage payments. In addition, 40% of those surveyed said they were very dissatisfied with the local, state and federal response to their needs.
Newsom said Tuesday that he is working with state lawmakers, the banking industry and others on new loans for rebuilding, and that the state will expand eligibility for the CalAssist Mortgage Fund. The governor’s office did not respond to CalMatters’ questions about whether he plans to propose any aid for renters who survived the fires, and about what else he is doing to continue to press the federal government for long-term disaster funding.
“This report says exactly what we’ve been hearing,” said Michael Soller, spokesperson for the insurance department. “Wildfire survivors want action and they want results.” He said the issues in the survey are top priorities for the department, and among other things pointed to a task force on smoke damage that the department has convened.
A bill sponsored by Lara and introduced by newly appointed Senate Insurance Committee Chair Steve Padilla, the Democrat from San Diego, late Tuesday would require insurance companies to submit to the state their disaster-recovery plans related to handling claims; double penalties for violations of fair claims practices during an emergency; expand upfront claims payments; give policyholders status updates within five days whenever their adjuster is replaced; and more.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/021425_EatonFireMudslides_JAJ_CM_23.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

A tough budget year will test her ability to keep the caucus united while whittling its spending priorities.","In summary
New Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón is the first Latina, first mother and only second woman to lead California’s upper legislative chamber. A tough budget year will test her ability to keep the caucus united while whittling its spending priorities.


As California legislators return to Sacramento and prepare to tackle a budget deficit, all eyes are on new Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón of Santa Barbara and what tone she sets for her chamber.
Limón, 46, a progressive backed by labor unions and the first Latina to lead the Senate, will face arguably her greatest legislative challenge yet as she and her diverse caucus grapple with a daunting projected $18 billion state budget deficit and historic federal funding cuts from the Trump administration.
While Limón has yet to announce any cost-cutting strategies or impose any limits on lawmakers introducing bills that require new money, the scarcity of funds will likely force the new leader to focus on a few key priorities, a premise she resisted in a recent interview with CalMatters. 
“Our caucus will continue to prioritize issues that our communities prioritize,” Limón said, rattling off a laundry list of policy areas including access to health care, cost of living, education, housing affordability and child care. The new Senate leader also emphasized the importance of finding policy solutions that are “encompassing of our caucus — that reflect 58 counties, 483 cities.” 
But how she’ll do that, while keeping the budget under control, remains to be seen.
For Limón, who has developed a reputation as an egalitarian consensus builder who wants everyone to feel heard, whittling down those priorities will test her ability to say “no” as the caucus tries to both rein in spending and fund programs that help vulnerable Californians. 
She told reporters at the Capitol on Monday that she expects senators to understand that “spending big is not something that is within our means at this moment” and said she would reiterate that message at their first caucus meeting.
Colleagues past and present give her their vote of confidence to lead the chamber through a difficult budget year.
“She’s a good person to have in place when there’s a challenge,” said Kate Parker, who served alongside Limón on the Santa Barbara school board, including as president. “Obviously the budget is going to be horrendous, and she’s somebody that I would really trust to move the state forward in a really difficult time.”
From school board to Senate leader
Limón points to her nine-year tenure in the Legislature and relationships with legislative colleagues as the foundation for her inevitably tough conversations about how to prioritize a mountain of pressing issues.
The new Senate leader is best known for pursuing pay transparency legislation, consumer protections such as shielding medical debt from credit reports, and efforts to regulate the oil industry. She authored a 2022 law that requires setbacks around new oil and gas wells and steps to protect residents who live near old wells, and pushed for an unsuccessful 2021 bill to ban oil fracking. Gov. Gavin Newsom later ordered the ban.

In the Assembly she chaired the Banking and Finance committee and until recently led the Senate committee on natural resources and water. Under two former Senate leaders, Toni Atkins and Mike McGuire, Limón was second-in-command as majority leader for Senate Democrats and helped craft legislative strategy. 
Limón was elected pro tem in June after joining forces with supporters of Sen. Angelique Ashby, a Sacramento Democrat also seeking the role, to amass a majority of the caucus and shut down a competing bid from Sen. Lena Gonzalez of Long Beach. The power jockeying came amid a chaotic week as a federal standoff over immigration enforcement exploded in Los Angeles and the Legislature scrambled to finalize a budget. Limón has since named Ashby as her majority leader.
Prior to running for the Legislature, Limón served six years on the board of trustees for the Santa Barbara Unified School District, the public school system she attended before she immersed herself in public service and policy studies at UC Berkeley and later, graduated from Columbia University with a master’s degree in education. 
Her first election for public office came in 2009 when Limón ran for an open spot on the Santa Barbara school board. Former board president Kate Parker, who overlapped with Limón during the now-senator’s six-year tenure, said she had never heard of Limón before the election and was even a bit skeptical about her leadership ability. 
“It was kind of out of left field that she was running, and she didn’t have a kid in the district,” said Parker. “She seemed so young to me at the time. You know, I think she was probably like 30 or something. And I just wasn’t sure if she had the experience to be a strong leader in the district.”
But from their first meeting, Limón impressed Parker with her ability to listen to all sides and draw consensus from a group with a wide range of opinions. 
“She was really good at crafting productive compromise,” Parker said. “She had a policy of meeting with anybody that wanted to talk to her.”
Limón has been tight-lipped about how she’ll steer the caucus through budget negotiations. But Parker said Limón is no stranger to difficult spending discussions. Nearly every year they served together, the school board faced budget challenges. 
“Her guiding principle, in that context, was always putting the student first,” Parker said, adding that Limón always tried to keep funding cuts as far away from the classroom as possible.

“I imagine that at the state level, you’ll find that she has guiding principles as well that help with her decision-making process,” Parker said. “It’s not random, it’s not piece by piece. It’s systematic.”
Limón has yet to divulge precisely what those guiding principles will be for the Senate under her leadership. In an interview with CalMatters, she declined to identify any specific legislative measures that the caucus would prioritize. 
But she hasn’t ruled anything out, either. When asked specifically whether her caucus should consider raising taxes or cutting state services, Limón didn’t reject either idea, both considered politically radioactive options.
“Everything’s on the table until we choose, or make a decision that it shouldn’t be on the table,” Limón said. “But having a deliberative and thoughtful conversation about the options in front of us doesn’t mean that we necessarily move forward with all options. It just means that you consider them.”
No bad blood with McGuire
Limón’s reputation as a collaborator and consensus builder contrasts starkly with that of her predecessor, McGuire, who some members, staff and lobbyists have privately called a micromanager.
During last year’s eleventh-hour negotiations over reauthorizing the state’s cap-and-trade program, McGuire reportedly kept the Senate’s draft bill language under lock and key and refused to let members take copies with them to review with staff, instead requiring them to come in person to view the text and banning photos. Advocates said they felt iced out of discussions and had little to no opportunity to give input. 
“We are hopeful that this change in leadership means the beginning of a new and more transparent process,” said Asha Sharma, state policy manager for the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability.
Frustrations boiled over in a September budget subcommittee hearing when lawmakers debated a budget bill that contained more than $85 million in earmarks for projects in McGuire’s northern coastal district. That power play prompted Democratic Napa Sen. Chris Cabaldon to quip in front of the whole committee, “There are more than just a handful of disadvantaged communities, plus the North Coast, in California.”
Limón has tried to tamp down any criticism of her predecessor.

“There was never a moment that this was a comparison of leadership,” Limón insisted. “At the end of the day, this is really about what the caucus wants, the direction the caucus wants to go, the experiences that the caucus feels are needed at this moment in time.”
Limón led the Senate’s working group on the reauthorization of the state’s cap and trade program, a fight at the heart of negotiations on a climate and energy policy deal that dragged out the final days of last year’s legislative session. 
Her greatest challenge, said Sen. John Laird, a Santa Cruz Democrat and fellow member of the working group who she has named as her budget chair, was bridging the gaps between members who wanted to maintain the existing cap-and-trade program largely as-is and the climate hawks, who wanted to ditch some of the concessions former Gov. Jerry Brown gave to polluting industries to win votes during the last reauthorization.
“That was a real test because that was like riding a f-ing bronco,” Laird said. “And yet she worked hard to hold the Senate together. She worked hard to understand what individuals really wanted. And a lot of what we desired was part of the final results because of her work.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010625-Limon-Senate-Pro-Tem-MG-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)State school trust lands officials announced this week that Utah public schools will get a record $134 million distribution from trust land investments in the 2026-2027 school year. 
That marks a 20% bump from last year’s previous record of $111.3 million. 
The increased distribution from the state’s longstanding trust lands system “reflects strong financial performance from trust land management” and the Permanent State School Fund’s investment portfolio, the Utah Land Trusts Protections & Advocacy Office said in a news release Monday. 
The jump also reflects the first year of additional money after Utah voters in 2024 approved a constitutional amendment, Amendment B, which increased how much can be distributed each year from the Permanent State School Fund, an endowment created at statehood to support public schools. Amendment B increased the limit of the annual distributions from 4% to 5% of the fund. 
Utah officials celebrate back to school with a record $111.3M from land investments

Had voters not passed Amendment B, schools this year would have received about $118 million during the 2026-2027 school year — meaning the 1 percentage point higher distribution cap allowed $16 million more to be distributed to schools this year. 
“This marks a significant milestone for Utah’s Trust System and the growing impact on all trust beneficiaries,” Kim Christy, director of the Land Trusts Protection and Advocacy Office, said in a prepared statement. “The Trust Lands Administration and (the Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office) are doing great things to uphold trust principles and sustain maximum performance of the trust assets.”
Utah Treasurer Marlo Oaks, who chairs the Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office board, also issued a statement applauding the record-breaking distribution. 
“Utah students benefit from a trust system that delivers strong results and protects both current and future beneficiaries,” Oaks said. “Careful land management and prudent investment decisions strengthen schools today and preserve the fund for generations to come.”
 School trust funds are generated from trust lands that were granted to Utah at statehood to support public education and other state institutions. The vast majority of the funds benefit school children, but other trust beneficiaries including higher education and other designated state institutions will also receive higher allocations. 
The revenue is generated from leases, sales and development of trust lands then deposited into the Permanent State School Fund. Since 1994, Utah’s combined permanent funds have grown from $50 million to $4.1 billion, according to trust lands officials. 
 How much will schools get? 
Yearly distributions from the School LAND Trust program are made to every public school in the state based on a per-pupil formula. State trust lands officials said individual schools will be notified later this week about their specific allocations. 
However, on Monday state trust lands officials offered a sneak peak by sharing a breakdown of what school districts in Salt Lake County will receive:

Jordan School District will get $10.5 million
Granite School District will get $10.2 million 
Canyons School District will get $6 million
Salt Lake City School District will get $3.5 million
Murray School District will get $1.3 million

The Salt Lake County school district allocations total $31.5 million. The remaining $102.5 million of this year’s $134 million allocation will be distributed to other public schools across the state based on student population. 
The funds, according to state trust lands officials, “support academic intervention and innovation, help reduce class size, expand access to technology, and enhance professional development.”

Decisions on how each school will use the money are made by local school community council members and land trust councils. Every school has a council that determines its greatest academic need, subject to approval by the school’s local school board. 
“Utah’s School LAND Trust distributions are the best form of local control,” Rep. Tracy Miller, R-South Jordan. “Parents, teachers, and principals work together to decide how to best use these funds to improve student learning and meet the unique needs of every community.”
How does Utah’s school land trust system work?
Four agencies make up Utah’s School and Institutional Trust System. 
The Trust Lands Administration manages about 3.3 million acres of trust lands in Utah, granted by Congress at statehood in 1896 with the requirement that revenue earned from the sale or lease of the land be placed into permanent endowment for public schools. The revenue is generated from activities like energy development, real estate and grazing. 
The School LAND Trust program, housed in the State Board of Education, distributes annual investment earnings directly to local K-12 schools and empowers communities to decide how best to meet their needs through land trust councils that decide how to spend the money. 
The Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office is made up of an independent team of investors tasked with investing the revenue in the Permanent State School Fund to grow the endowment. And the Utah Land Trusts Protection & Advocacy Office is tasked with monitoring trust lands management to ensure returns are maximized while ensuring the fund’s beneficiaries’ interests are protected and represented.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector) Alabama’s tax collections remain among the lowest in the nation, making it harder for local governments to fund education and other services, according to a recent report from the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama (PARCA).
The report found that while Alabama’s overall tax collections grew in 2023, it was still near the bottom of the nation for collections, beaten only by Tennessee and Mississippi, which have cut taxes in recent years. 
Thomas Spencer, one of the authors of the report, said in an interview Tuesday centuries-old tax restrictions and poverty both played a role.

“We have citizens that don’t have as much income, so higher rates of poverty in our state and so we have less wealth to tax,” he said.
The state also has the lowest property tax rate in the nation due to property tax caps first introduced in the 1875 Constitution and tightened in the 1901 Constitution, which took the vote away from Black Alabamians and poor whites. Collections were further limited by the lid bills in the 1970s, which capped property assessments. 
The report said that low property taxes help farmers, homeowners and timberland owners but makes it harder to fund education, public safety and health.
In fiscal year 2023, Alabama’s state and local governments collected over $4,900 per individual in taxes, including sales, property and income among other taxes. In comparison, the average total tax collected per individual for the southeastern states — where taxes are relatively low compared to the rest of the nation — was $5,198. 
The report noted that Arkansas, “a state with less wealth and economic activity than Alabama,” collected $354 more per person in taxes.
“If Alabama collected taxes at Arkansas’ rate, state and local governments would have an additional $1.8 billion in state dollars to fund education, health care, highways, public safety, and the broad spectrum of state and local services governments provide,” the report said.
In 2023, Mississippi began phasing out individual income taxes while Tennessee completely phased it out in the same year. Alabama’s income tax was established by constitutional amendment in 1933, an amendment that also included income tax thresholds and rates, with a top rate of 5% for married couples making $6,000 a year or more. While progressive for its time, the report notes that nearly a century of inflation means that they are “almost meaningless” today and subject low-income earners to the income tax.  
According to the report, nearly half of the revenue collected by Alabama’s local and state governments comes from sales taxes, in comparison to the rest of the nation where sales taxes make up one third of state and local taxes.
“We have a lot of constitutional protections built in that preclude local governments from raising taxes in above certain limits on property in particular, but there’s pretty much no restriction on sales tax, and so we have some of the highest sales tax rates in the country,” Spencer said.
Sales taxes are more costly to poorer residents, resulting in burdens on their earning power and less overall revenue. 
Alabama reduced the grocery tax from 3% to 2% last year. But this tax cut means less money for the Education Trust Fund, which is used to fund much of K-12 and higher education in the state.
“We’re going to have to keep an eye on our education funding to make sure it stays at a competitive level, so that we’re able to pay teachers and the other things that we’re continuing to do,” Spencer said.
Spencer also noted that the CHOOSE Act, a voucher-like program that can be used for education based expenses, including private school tuition, could pose a threat to the Education Trust Fund budget later on.
“We’re basically funding it with surplus money from prior years. But eventually, down the road, that could be, you know, a competent competition for education dollars,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Alabama-State-Capitol-Nov-14-2025-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 08:12:21.793680
,California,2026-01-07 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Critics draw iffy link between Gavin Newsom’s record and Minnesota’s food fraud scandal,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/gavin-newsom-critics-link-minnesota-fraud/,Republicans and at least one Democrat claim fraud and mismanagement during Newsom’s governorship are similar to Minnesota's debacle.,"Last month, as required by law, State Auditor Grant Parks published an annual report on state programs and agencies that his office deems to be at “high risk” of costly inefficiency, waste or fraud.
The report reiterated concerns about seven situations, two of which have been on the list since 2007, including the bureaucracy’s chronic inability to successfully employ information technology — embarrassing for a state that is the global center for digital tools.
Parks has added a new program in his latest overview, the Department of Social Service’s food aid for poor families, once called food stamps but now known as CalFresh.
The federal government primarily finances supplemental food benefits, but the state’s share is determined, in part, by its management, as indicated by its rate of error when determining people’s eligibility.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill tightens the error rate thresholds. Thus, Parks notes, California’s 11% error rate, if not improved, could require the state to “spend about $2 billion annually to maintain CalFresh benefits.”
The most disturbing item on Parks’ list is the continuing inability of the Employment Development Department to effectively manage unemployment insurance benefits, which first came to light during the COVID-19 pandemic. Billions of dollars in fraudulent benefit claims were approved, almost all of which came in a federally financed expansion of the program.
By happenstance, the high risk report was released just as a scandal was erupting in Minnesota over widespread fraud in a program meant to keep children fed during the pandemic.
Dozens of people, mostly in Minnesota’s substantial Somali population, have been charged with looting the program by setting up companies that billed the state for supplying food that was never delivered.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Kamala Harris chose as her running mate in her campaign for president in 2024, felt the political fallout from the scandal — generated mostly in right-leaning media outlets — and this week dropped his bid for re-election.
Meanwhile, those same outlets — blogs, podcasts and YouTube videos — have been making an accusatory connection between the Minnesota scandal and the Parks report, suggesting the report proves the same kind of fraud was even more rampant in California and laying the blame on Gov. Gavin Newsom, who’s a likely 2028 candidate for president.
This week, Steve Hilton, a Republican candidate for California governor, and Herb Morgan, a Republican running for state controller, cited the Parks report, their own research and tips from whistleblowers in a broad assertion, dubbed “CALIFRAUDIA,” that “California’s exposure to fraud, waste, and abuse across major state programs is likely to reach $250 billion,” adding that it “underscores the urgent need for formal investigation and audit, as a matter of basic fiscal responsibility.”
However, the allegations of widespread fraud and mismanagement during Newsom’s governorship is not confined to those on the starboard side of the political balance beam.
Ro Khanna, a progressive Democratic member of Congress from Silicon Valley who could be a rival to Newsom in the 2028 presidential sweepstakes, issued a similar blast in a posting on X, albeit with a smaller $72 billion pricetag, citing Parks’ report and other data.
Khanna told Politico, “I don’t know what the specific number is” of dollars lost to fraud or mismanagement. “It’s not particular to any person,” Khanna said. “It’s making government more effective. Tackling the mismanagement and waste and some fraud will build more credibility for asking for higher taxes.”
Newsom’s staff responded by accusing Khanna of making a “MAGA made-up claim.”

The state will receive $203 million under the Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA). The money is meant to partially offset cuts to Medicaid in the coming years. 
The state plans to distribute the money between 11 initiatives: Collaborative Electronic Health Record (EHR), IT and Cybersecurity; Rural Health; Maternal and Fetal Health; Rural Workforce; Cancer Digital Regionalization; Simulation Training; Statewide EMS Trauma and Stroke; EMS Treat-In-Place; Mental Health; Community Medicine; and Rural Health Practice. 
The state has not said how it plans to distribute the federal money among the initiatives.
The federal program will distribute $50 billion to states over five years, half of which will be evenly distributed and the other half will be under the discretion of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Alabama received $3.4 million in addition to the guaranteed $200 million.
According to the United Health Foundation, Alabama in September 2024 had 241 primary care physicians per 100,000 people, ranking 45th in the United States.
“Regardless of the cause, the solution is clear: Alabama must train, recruit and retain more physicians,” Dr. Mark LeQuire, president of MASA, said in a statement. 
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. 
Many of Alabama’s existing hospitals are struggling. The state’s hospitals have long pushed for Medicaid expansion, saying it would provide needed funding to keep doors open. 
While Alabama Republican House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program. 
Jackson suggested using some of the money from the Rural Health Transformation Program for incentive programs to retain medical students in Alabama after they complete their residencies. 
“Those existing programs have been successful, but their success is fairly limited, because it’s been limited to the amount of money they’ve had to spend,” Jackson said. 
 LeQuire suggested the money be used to create state-funded residency programs, especially in primary care.
“Doctors are far more likely to practice where they complete their residency training,” he said. “By investing in residency programs, Alabama can grow its physician workforce, improve access to care and strengthen the quality of life in rural communities.”
Jackson said that most residency programs are federally-funded, but there are a few that are state-funded. According to Marco Villagrana, a congressional policy analyst, CMS spent $6.1 billion on direct Graduate Medical Education in fiscal year 2023 nationwide. Those costs include the resident’s roughly $55,000 salary and the hospital’s cost to educate them.
“If the state can use some of this money to create additional residency slots in the state, then your chances of being able to retain those physicians in the state greatly increase,” Jackson said.
Jackson also suggested using the money to invest in telehealth programs, which would make it easier for patients in rural Alabama to get care from doctors from larger hospitals.
“If we could have some money dedicated towards that, I think that’s a kind of a new idea that I think could be beneficial,” he said.
The money will be administered through the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA), according to the Dec. 29 statement from Ivey’s office.

(UMC photo)A federally-funded pilot program conducted by Clark County found a crisis intervention team is effective in keeping people with substance abuse and mental health issues out of local emergency rooms and is likely a cost savings for University Medical Center, the county’s public hospital, Clark County Commissioners learned Tuesday.
Nationally, up to 31% of 911 calls involve a police department response to individuals with mental health issues, according to a report on the pilot program presented to commissioners Tuesday. 
Crisis Response Teams (CRTs) are often panned by those who conflate them with efforts to defund the police. Law enforcement officials, however, generally welcome CRTs and the opportunity they give police and fire emergency responders to return to other duties. 
During his 2023 campaign for governor, then-Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said people “don’t get the nuance” and observed that officers are often asked “to solve all these social problems by virtue of people dialing 911. We have to show up because we’re duty bound to show up but we’re not given the resources to address the issue and we can’t walk away. That’s the tragedy behind it. Our incarceration system is the largest mental health system in the state.” 
“So if they want to defund to develop teams per se, or a social worker – that type of profession – to address those types of calls, I’m in full support because we’re not the answer,” he said. 
In addition to assisting in reducing the burden on emergency responders, CRTs provide specialized care that helps individuals avoid emergency rooms and in many cases, the routine 72-hour mandatory hold for mental health evaluation known as Legal 2000.  
The $535,000 grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration allowed the county to field a 12-hour crew for six months – from April through September of 2025. The team, composed of a paramedic, an emergency medical technician, and a licensed social worker, is trained to identify diseases that can mimic mental illness. 
The CRT responded to 758 incidents involving 678 patients. Only 30% were taken to emergency rooms, compared with 82% of individuals involved in similar calls in 2024. 
The CRT referred 34% of patients to treatment for substance use, while 27% were transported directly to a behavioral health hospital, and 14% were transported to other community service providers.
The team de-escalated 94% of the incidents and prevented 572 patients from entering Legal 2000 holds. Additionally, 65% of the individuals restrained at the time the CRT arrived on scene no longer needed restraints after the team’s intervention, and only 8% arrived at their destinations in restraints, the report says.
Commissioner Justin Jones says Clark County is the only jurisdiction in Southern Nevada without a CRT. He’s spearheading the effort to permanently fund the program, projected to cost $1.5 million a year for a 12-hour operation, seven days a week. State grants are available for 24-hour operations. 
It would be offset by a potential $1.9 million savings in reimbursements for medical transport. 
Additionally, Medicaid reimbursement is available to help cover the cost of licensed social workers. 
“I would be very nervous about relying on the Medicaid reimbursement dollars, considering what’s going on as a whole,” Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick warned, referring to more restrictive Medicaid eligibility requirements included in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Commissioner Jim Gibbons noted the CRT provides an opportunity for UMC, which is also expected to face financial challenges posed by Medicaid cuts, to save money by reducing ER admissions. 
The commission took no action Tuesday but is expected to return with proposals for funding a permanent CRT.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/UM-1024x548.jpg,,,2026-01-07 07:58:24.944362

Wired for Profit: Third in a series about Alabama Power’s influence over electric rates, renewable energy, pollution and politics in the Yellowhammer State.
BUCKS — South Alabama is where it all washes out.
Here, in the nation’s second-largest delta, the waters of the Deep South wind through the pines and cypresses of the Yellowhammer State, snaking their way into Mobile Bay and on to the Gulf. Among the most biodiverse regions in the country, the Mobile-Tensaw Delta drains 44,000 square miles of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. It’s where the rivers—the Mobile, Tensaw, Blakely, Apalachee, Middle and Spanish Rivers—meet in land dubbed the “American Amazon” by E.O. Wilson, a renowned naturalist born in the state.
The Delta’s history is America’s. At its heart are the island mounds of Bottle Creek, the “principal political and religious center” for the Indigenous Pensacola culture for 300 years before European contact.
About a dozen miles south, beneath the surface of the Mobile River’s muddy waters, lies the wreckage of the Clotilda, widely regarded as the last slave ship to enter the United States. And farther south, still, the Mobile River empties into Mobile Bay, itself a veritable biodiversity hotspot and the cornerstone of a vibrant coastal culture and ecosystem.

But all of that, many residents, experts and environmentalists say, is at risk, because of Alabama Power’s coal ash waste, a toxic leftover from decades of burning coal for electricity.
One 600-acre pit of the toxic coal ash lies along the banks of the Mobile River in the Upper Delta, about 25 miles north of Mobile Bay. There, smokestacks from the James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant rise like a sore thumb from a horizon of green, towering over an unlined pond filled with more than 21 million tons of the toxic residue. Holding back the toxic waste from the Mobile River? Earthen dikes.
Alyson Tucker, media relations manager for Alabama Power, one of the nation’s most profitable electric utilities and one of the state’s most powerful companies, said in an email that the company “remains committed to operating in full compliance with environmental regulations. Our plans for closure and groundwater protection fully comply with current state and federal law, are approved by [the Alabama Department of Environmental Management] and are certified by professional engineers.”
“Due to ongoing litigation related to Plant Barry coal ash, we are unable to comment further at this time,” Tucker said.
Leaving coal waste in place under engineered caps, company representatives have long argued, is safe and protective of groundwater—claims that state regulators have accepted but both environmental groups and federal regulators dispute.
Alabama’s American Amazon isn’t the only area placed at risk by Alabama Power’s ghosts of energy past. An Inside Climate News review of the utility’s legally mandated emergency action plans shows that hundreds of square miles of land and waterways would be at risk of inundation in the event of a breach of the barriers holding back toxic waste at its six coal ash pond sites across the state. In total, more than 117 million tons of coal sludge are at issue, stored along Alabama’s waterways.
What to do with all that polluted material has become a controversial question, with federal and state officials at odds over the issue. In 2015, the federal government finalized a rule tightening restriction around how coal waste could be stored. EPA left implementation of the new standards to states, but in May 2024, the agency denied the state of Alabama’s plan to allow Alabama Power and other utilities to continue storing toxic coal ash in unlined pits at sites across the state. Federal officials said the plan would not adequately protect the state’s groundwater from contamination by coal ash residuals following “cap-in-place” closure.
“Under federal regulations, coal ash units cannot be closed in a way that allows coal ash to continue to spread contamination in groundwater after closure. In contrast, Alabama’s permit program does not require that groundwater contamination be adequately addressed during the closure of these coal ash units,” the decision said.
More than a year after the EPA denied Alabama’s coal ash plan, with the Trump administration now running the federal environmental agency, it’s unclear what comes next for the toxic ponds and the government’s now decade-old effort to safely close them.
But one thing is certain, according to Cade Kistler, who leads Mobile Baykeeper, an environmental nonprofit currently in litigation with Alabama Power over the coal ash lagoon at Plant Barry. Until the toxic leftovers of the company’s fossil fuel commitments are moved out of groundwater and away from waterways, the delta and Mobile Bay are an Eden on the edge of disaster.
“The delta is an elegant labyrinth, full of bayous and sloughs and backwaters. If it is flooded with ash, it would be polluting forever,” Kistler said. “There would be no way to effectively clean it up.”
The cost of Kingston
The failure of a dirt dike at a coal ash pond isn’t theoretical. In 2008, a coal ash impoundment in Kingston, Tennessee, breached, spilling more than a billion gallons of toxic sludge across 300 acres of land and into the Emory River channel. The result was one of the largest environmental disasters in U.S. history. The spill cost the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which owned the coal impoundment, over $1 billion to clean up. Ten years after the spill, dozens of the roughly 900 workers employed during the cleanup were already dead. More than 250 were chronically ill. According to the EPA, coal ash contains heavy metal contaminants like mercury, cadmium and arsenic known to cause cancer and other serious effects on the nervous system, heart, kidneys and development.
Both Alabama Power’s own groundwater monitoring reports and measurements taken by researchers from the Mobile River adjacent to Plant Barry confirm heavy metal contamination at the site.
“We identified a significant contribution of toxic metals linked to coal ash near Sister’s Creek, the man-made cooling discharge channel of Plant Barry, particularly during the dry season,” one 2025 study by scientists at the University of Alabama and Texas A&M Universities concluded.  The peer-reviewed paper also pointed to the impacts of climate change as another reason to be wary of Alabama Power’s storage of coal ash on waterways.

– Cade Kistler, Mobile Baykeeper



	“There is a plausible concern for acute and chronic toxic metals environmental pollution from the Alabama ash pond, considering rising seawater levels and more frequent severe storm surges in the region since its initial construction,” the study said.
The volume of coal ash material stored at Plant Barry alone is more than four times that of the sludge that spilled in Kingston in 2008, according to company figures. That fact alone should worry anyone concerned about Alabama’s environment, said Diane Thomas, one of three self-proclaimed “coal ash grannies” featured in a new documentary about Plant Barry’s coal lagoons, Sallie’s Ashes.
Thomas spent three decades living on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay.
“I have kayaked and sailed,” she said. “I swam. I crabbed. I fished. My love for the bay and what you can do on the bay runs deep.”

It was an easy “yes,” then, when her decades-long friend Sallie Smith asked Thomas and another friend, Savan Wilson, to help her fight against Alabama Power’s plans to leave coal ash beside the Mobile River. Smith had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and felt she needed to spend her remaining time advocating to protect the bay she’d grown to adore. The trio founded the Coal Ash Action Group, a grassroots organization committed to educating Alabamians about an issue unknown to many.
Thomas, a retired clinical psychologist, said it’s easy to fight for something so dear to so many. For decades, the delta and the bay have been an integral part of her family’s lives.

She smiled as she recalled her first jubilee, a naturally occurring event where low oxygen levels in Mobile Bay cause marine life to flee toward shore.
“There is nothing like catching your own crabs,” Thomas said. “Have you ever cleaned 200 crabs? Your thumbs are just raw.”
After her husband was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, no longer able to work, he began to fish almost daily. With aggressive treatment, he survived the disease.
“We ate fresh fish for about eight years—four times a week,” Thomas said.
That type of close connection with the water is something Thomas feels shouldn’t be put at risk unnecessarily by an electric utility.
‘    
A knife to your throat’

Alabama Power’s legally-mandated emergency action plan for Plant Barry shows that if earthen dikes separating the coal ash from the Mobile River were to breach, around 25 square miles of the Mobile-Tensaw Delta would be inundated with coal slurry, covering dozens of miles of the Mobile, Middle and Tensaw Rivers, just upstream of Mobile Bay. From there, the toxic sludge would diffuse throughout the region, with the state’s rivers acting as a heart, pumping the liquid farther and farther from Plant Barry.
“But instead of lifeblood, it’s pumping coal waste that would kill the environment,” Thomas said.
David Bronner, the prominent CEO of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, recently called Plant Barry’s coal ash pond “a huge environmental bomb” in a newsletter sent to state retirees.

“We need your cooperation again for South Alabama,” Bronner wrote in an open appeal to Alabama’s congressional delegation. “Not for new jobs, but for solving an old problem that still exists. That problem hangs over all of Alabama, like a knife to your throat: the coal ash dump that sits next to Mobile Bay. No one should forget what the Tennessee coal ash dump did to that state. A breach of the Mobile site would clearly damage Mobile Bay for decades.”
Thomas believes Bronner’s assessment is on target.


Cade Kistler, Mobile’s Baykeeper, said it’s important to remember that environmental harm can lead to economic pain, too, for individuals and businesses alike.
“There would be a huge impact on the people that want to fish in Mobile Bay and use it for their livelihoods,” he said. “And there are also those people that live on its shores—a lot of beautiful homes and properties. Those Zillow listings won’t look quite so good if a coal ash breach occurs.”

Kistler also pointed out that BP’s 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which crippled the Gulf Coast environmentally and economically, involved about 134 million gallons of oil, 20 times less than the volume of coal slurry disposed of at Plant Barry. Those who lived through the aftermath of the oil spill on the Gulf Coast remember the deep impact it had on coastal communities.


A coal ash breach could be even worse, Thomas said.
“If a breach occurred, we would be the most industrially polluted site in the nation, and we know that pollution wouldn’t just go away,” she said.
That’s why she and Wilson have committed themselves to informing others across the state about the dangers of the waste, something they now do in memory of Smith, who died of cancer in October 2023.
“Sallie’s focus was on connecting people in search of our common humanity, and in seeking to deepen our understanding and compassion for one another,” her obituary read. “This ardent effort was an outgrowth and demonstration of her deep faith. She loved her family, Mobile Bay, country music, her many friends, including her hiking group of intrepid college friends, and all God’s people.”

‘Pray we don’t have a hurricane’

While there’s still much to be done to contain the coal ash threat, Thomas said, there have been at least some glimmers of hope. In early 2024, Alabama Power confirmed a plan to contract a company called Eco Materials to remove and recycle some of the coal waste stored at Plant Barry.
Since then, however, there has been little in the way of substantive public updates about the project, which company officials previously said would begin recycling coal ash into construction materials like concrete in January 2026. In response to an inquiry from Inside Climate News, a representative for Alabama Power said the recycling facility is “expected to be in service by early 2026.”
Eco Materials was acquired by materials company CRH in July 2025, according to an announcement. Neither Eco Materials nor CRH responded to a request for a detailed update on the recycling plans.

Still, Thomas said that even the conception of a plan is a step in the right direction.
“We need to recycle as much as possible and just pray we don’t have a hurricane,” she said.
Kistler said he fears just that. An extreme weather event or other emergency could leave a world-renowned environmental gem drowned in polluted sludge.
Alabama Power’s emergency action plans, bare-bones documents required by federal law, provide only limited information about what could occur if a breach happened at its coal ash sites across the state. The documents also provide little real-world information about how the company would approach mitigation, clean up and remediation.
Regarding extreme weather, the 39-page emergency plan for Plant Barry mentions only that if severe weather causes road closures during an emergency dam breach, company response times may be delayed. Despite Plant Barry’s location in south Alabama, the word “hurricane” does not appear in the emergency action plan.
“It’s foolhardy,” Kistler said. “There needs to be more detail.”
Regulators have agreed. In January 2023, the EPA issued Alabama Power a notice of potential violation informing the company that, in the agency’s view, it had violated federal regulations because its groundwater monitoring program and emergency action plan were not adequate.
The agency settled that dispute with Alabama Power in 2024 when the company agreed to “evaluate and expand its groundwater monitoring program at Plant Barry, to review and upgrade its Emergency Action Plan, and to pay a civil penalty of $278,000,” according to the EPA.
More than a year later, a representative of the utility told members of Alabama’s Public Service Commission that an updated emergency action plan is still in the works.
“The emergency action plan will be modified to include additional wording and descriptions to clarify the company’s preparedness for extreme weather conditions,” Dustin Brooks, land compliance manager for Alabama Power, told commissioners on Dec. 9.
“I just hope that outside this public document, they’ve got better plans somewhere,” Kistler said.
A previously available copy of the EPA’s settlement agreement with Alabama Power has been removed from the agency’s website, though the press release announcing the agreement remains. “This Initiative is needed given the breadth and scope of observed noncompliance with the federal coal ash regulations,” the agency said.
An executive of Alabama Power, which owns most of the state’s coal ash units, claimed at a September 2023 EPA hearing that the utility’s storage ponds are “structurally sound.” Susan Comensky, Alabama Power’s then-vice president of environmental affairs, told EPA officials that allowing the company to “cap” coal ash waste in place, even in unlined pits, will not present significant risks to human or environmental health.
“Even today, before closure is complete, we know of no impact to any source of drinking water at or around any Alabama Power ash pond,” Comensky said at the time.

However, Alabama Power has been repeatedly fined for leaking coal ash waste into groundwater.
In 2019, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) fined the utility $250,000 after groundwater monitoring at a disposal site on the Coosa River in Gadsden showed elevated levels of arsenic and radium, according to regulatory documents.
In 2018, ADEM fined Alabama Power a total of $1.25 million for groundwater contamination, records show. In its order issuing the fine, the agency cited the utility’s own groundwater testing data, which showed elevated levels of arsenic, lead, selenium and beryllium.
Plant Barry is just one of Alabama Power’s six plant sites across the state that store coal ash. In all, the slurry lagoons cover a footprint of around 2,000 acres and pose unique risks to groundwater and waterways around them.
A now capped-in-place coal ash impoundment at Plant Gadsden, for example, is still contaminating groundwater more than seven years after its closure, according to Alabama Power’s groundwater monitoring reports and a lawsuit filed against the utility by Coosa Riverkeeper, an environmental nonprofit.
“The citizens of Gadsden and folks who depend on Neely Henry Lake deserve so much better than Alabama Power’s legacy of pollution,” Justinn Overton, executive director and riverkeeper at Coosa Riverkeeper, said in a news release after the lawsuit was filed. “Drinking water supply, booming ecotourism, and hard-working Alabamians are all threatened by Alabama Power’s recklessness.”
In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit over groundwater contamination at Plant Gadsden, lawyers for Alabama Power emphasized that state regulators approved the company’s plans for coal ash waste at the site.
When groundwater monitoring identified elevated levels of contaminants, the lawyers wrote, “Alabama Power worked with professional engineers and the public to design and implement a corrective action program to address those exceedances—a program certified as compliant with the federal CCR rule and that will continue as part of ‘post-closure care.’”
While the suit should be dismissed due to an expired statute of limitations, Alabama Power’s attorneys argued, the court should also decline to second guess the decision of state regulators to approve the company’s actions.
“[Coosa Riverkeeper] asks the Court to turn back the clock, to before 2020, to second-guess the groundwater monitoring system and closure decisions—work completed long ago, approved by state regulators, and certified by professional engineers as compliant,” the motion said.
Plants Barry, Gorgas, Greene County and Miller have been designated as having “significant hazard potential” under federal law. Plant Gaston, located near the town of Wilsonville in Shelby County, has been designated as having “high hazard potential.”
Following an emergency dam break at that site, which the company deems “unlikely,” Alabama Power’s initial hazard potential assessment concluded that “water and [coal ash] could potentially impact the residential neighborhood to the west, and the Coosa River to the south…failure or misoperation of the [coal ash] unit could potentially result in a loss of human life.”
Kistler said that it’s notable that Alabama Power is unique among southern utilities in leaving all of its coal waste in unlined pits along waterways. Georgia Power, another subsidiary of Southern Company, has already shifted toward more appropriate disposal of at least some of its coal ash in lined landfills. It’s not a question then, Kistler said, of whether Alabama Power can do the same. It’s only a question of if it will.
“It feels like we’re paying premium prices, and we’re getting bargain-bin environmental protections,” he said, making a reference to Alabama Power’s highest average residential electric bills in the nation. “If Georgia can do it, why not us?”

A coal legacy and a fossil-fueled future

Barry Brock, with the Southern Environmental Law Center, is part of the team of lawyers suing Alabama Power over its coal ash impoundment at Plant Barry. Initially dismissed by a Trump-appointed U.S. district court judge on technical grounds, the case is now pending before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, where Brock said he is hopeful the team will secure a victory.
Oral arguments in the case were held in Atlanta in November, and some of Alabama Power’s arguments were unusually revealing, Brock said.
“Alabama Power admits that a lot of the coal ash is going to be left in contact with groundwater under their closure plan,” he said. “That’s particularly galling.”
Coal ash isn’t SELC’s first legal tussle with Alabama Power, however. Lawyers for the environmental nonprofit are also representing customers suing Alabama Power over residential solar fees they argue violate the law and discourage the use of renewable energy. In response, the company has said that it “support[s] customers interested in using onsite generation, such as solar” but that its rate structure for those customers must avoid “unfairly shifting” costs to other ratepayers.
Meanwhile, the company has doubled down on its fossil fuel investments, purchasing a natural gas plant in Autauga County for around $622 million, effectively locking the company into the continued use of fossil fuels for years to come, though the company said in an email that its investments are data-driven, forward-looking and “are not based on a preference for any one fuel source.”
All of these developments are individually concerning, Brock said, and together, they demonstrate a pattern.
“It sends a pretty clear message that Alabama Power is really concerned about their financial well-being and the rate of return they get on fossil fuel infrastructure,” he said. “It says they have a pretty compliant regulatory environment that is not going to scrutinize them when they want to raise rates for customers to do it.”
While the company clearly has the resources to line its coal ash ponds and recycle much of the waste, there’s also little doubt that the state can count on much more sympathetic federal regulators under the Trump EPA than it did under Democratic leadership. At present, the state and federal governments seem closely aligned: Twinkle Cavanaugh recently resigned after 13 years as president of the state’s Public Service Commission, the agency charged with regulating Alabama Power.

Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, discusses his Senate Bill 11, which would allow Indiana to use a firing squad to carry out executions, during a committee meeting on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill that would allow executions by firing squad if lethal injection drugs are unavailable or at an inmate’s request is fueling ongoing debates over secrecy, drug costs and “humane” methods of capital punishment.
Senators on the Corrections and Criminal Law Committee spent an hour probing Republican Sen. Mike Young’s Senate Bill 11 — and some questioned whether it’s necessary at all — but no vote was held.
Committee Chairman Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said the committee would consider amendments and a possible vote next week. Proposed amendments are due on Friday.
“This is not a debate about the death penalty,” Young, of Indianapolis, told the committee. “We have it in the state of Indiana. So, it’s not whether you think it’s good or whether you think it’s bad. The question here is, ‘What do we do if we only have one option in which to carry out a legal order by the courts in the state of Indiana?’”
Over the past year, Indiana officials have paid as much as $300,000 for a single dose, spending at least $1 million total to procure execution drugs. Gov. Mike Braun disclosed in June that at least $600,000 was spent on pentobarbital that expired before use, citing the drug’s short shelf life and difficulties obtaining it. Braun has since declined to disclose how much the state paid for the most recent doses, including at least one used in the October execution of Roy Ward.










Indiana should not be considering expanding its execution methods while significant issues of public accountability still exist.


– Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Policy Project and former executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center


Young’s bill is one of several death penalty-related measures pending in the 2026 session.
He argued that his proposal is designed to prevent Indiana from being forced into last-minute decisions if lethal injection drugs become unusable.
“If we have an order to carry out an execution, we go get the chemicals, and then we find out, ‘Well, those are out of date and they’re not going to work,’” the senator said. “There’s no way to really test to see if they work, other than apply them, and we don’t want to put a person’s life in anguish to find out whether or not the drugs work.”
Young also told lawmakers that manufacturers and pharmacies can refuse to sell execution drugs on moral grounds, further creating a need for an alternative method. 
“We can’t force them to sell it to us,” he said. “We can’t force them to manufacture it.”
A ‘fail safe’ option
Under current Indiana law, executions can only be carried out by lethal injection. 
Young’s bill details procedures for firing squad executions, requiring a five-member team made up of Department of Correction officers selected by the prison warden.
Four officers would fire weapons containing live ammunition, while one would fire a weapon containing a blank round, with firearms loaded in a way that prevents squad members from knowing which ammunition they are firing. The bill would also shield the identities of firing squad members from public disclosure and legal discovery.
Currently, five states authorize the use of firing squads under certain circumstances: Idaho, Utah, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and South Carolina.
Young emphasized that the bill does not mandate the firing squad, but instead creates what he repeatedly described as a “fail-safe” option if lethal injection cannot be carried out.
Indiana lawmakers tee up new death penalty bills ahead of short 2026 session

He also cited the federal prison in Terre Haute, where the U.S. Bureau of Prisons has long carried out executions.
“If the federal government needs to carry out an execution here in Indiana and they can’t obtain the drugs, we shouldn’t be the reason that can’t happen,” Young said.
Before public testimony began, Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, asked whether firing squads could pose similar constitutional problems as the electric chair decades ago if an execution did not result in immediate death.
“The idea that we were using the electric chair — it was inhumane,” Pol said. “Oftentimes, somebody would not perish … and you could have a situation in which, during the firing squad, somebody has not perished. … You’re laying witness to what potentially could be cruel and unusual punishment.”
But Young maintained that the central issue with any method is accuracy and avoiding such suffering.
“The question is whether or not the shots that are fired are accurate enough to end the life immediately instead of letting the person suffer,” Young said. “That’s the concern.”
Committee members also raised questions about who would be required to participate in a firing squad and whether staff could object on religious or moral grounds. 
Young said he supports “conscience protections” and would not compel participation. 
“I wouldn’t force somebody to take somebody else’s life,” he said. “If I was the warden, I’d probably take volunteers.”
Specifics still in the works
Five men currently sit on Indiana’s death row at the state prison in Michigan City, though one has been deemed incompetent to be executed. 
Three other men have been executed in Indiana over the past year. In that time, scrutiny has mounted around the state’s execution process and the Department of Correction’s acquisition and handling of lethal injection drugs.

Many of the questions center on the cost, sourcing, storage and effectiveness of pentobarbital. The one-drug method is a departure from the state’s protocol used since 1995, involving a series of three chemicals.
Tuesday’s testimony highlighted concerns that chemical executions can fail or cause prolonged suffering if drugs degrade or are improperly administered. Questions have lingered, for example, around the quality of the drugs used in last year’s execution of Benjamin Ritchie.
Bill co-author Sen. Jim Tomes, R-Wadesville, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that the firing squad could be structured to “minimize the risk of error.” He described a system using five shooters and rifles fixed in place by technicians so that all rounds strike the same point. The senator said he preferred live rounds and no blanks for all shooters.
“A technician would set the rifles up so all of the barrels are pointed at the same point of impact,” Tomes said. “They’re fixed. There’s no movement. The guns have been set so that the impact is all going to be at the same center of mass.”
Young was supportive, saying the goal is to ensure executions are carried out “efficiently and effectively so no person suffers.”
Opposition centers on secrecy, oversight
Opponents warned, though, that the bill would expand capital punishment while shielding “critical” details from public scrutiny.
Samantha Bresnahan of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana said Senate Bill 11 would impose “unprecedented secrecy” around executions by making confidential the identities of firing squad members and any information that could reasonably lead to their identification.
“That language is extraordinarily broad,” she said. “It could shield basic facts about training, qualifications, selection criteria and safeguards — precisely the information the public needs to evaluate whether this process is lawful, competent and free from misconduct.”
Even so, current Indiana law protects much of that information already, including the identities of the state prison’s execution team. 
Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Policy Project and former executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, additionally testified in opposition, calling the bill “a solution in search of a problem.”
“Indiana should not be considering expanding its execution methods while significant issues of public accountability still exist,” Dunham said. “Executions are among the most serious acts a government can undertake, yet this bill would allow this method to be implemented behind a veil of secrecy.”
DOC silent, amendments ahead
Public defenders also questioned whether Young’s bill would meaningfully address the cost or availability of executions. 
Zach Stock with the Indiana Public Defender Council said execution drugs are not a major cost driver compared with decades of litigation. He noted that since 1990, Indiana has spent more than $30 million on constitutionally-required defenses in capital cases.
“Trading expensive drugs for inexpensive bullets is not going to meaningfully reduce the cost,” Stock said. “Method of execution has never been the problem.”
Faith-based groups raised concerns about the moral and psychological toll on those involved.
Roarke LaCoursiere of the Indiana Catholic Conference warned that participation in executions can cause long-term trauma for witnesses and staff.
“Under this bill, we would be asking five people to pull the trigger, not for the purpose of saving life, but for the purpose of ending it,” LaCoursiere said.
DOC officials were present at Tuesday’s hearing but did not testify publicly.
Young’s bill is one of several death-penalty-related measures so far filed in the short 2026 session.
House Bill 1119, authored by Reps. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, and Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, would also allow executions by firing squad — or nitrogen hypoxia — while keeping lethal injection as the default method unless an inmate requests otherwise.
Another filed by Ireland, House Bill 1314, seeks to speed up post-conviction relief proceedings, likely reducing the time inmates spend on death row before execution.
Separately, House Bill 1287, filed by Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, would require members of the General Assembly to volunteer to serve on execution teams and make their names public records.
Last session, Morris unsuccessfully pushed to abolish Indiana’s death penalty entirely or, alternatively, to increase transparency around execution protocols.
Young said he expects multiple amendments to be filed to his bill before Friday’s deadline, including potential changes related to firing squad procedures.
“This is about making sure the state can carry out the law in a way that is orderly, constitutional and humane,” Young said. “We’re going to continue to work through the details.”

Dils Medical Center in Caliente, Nevada. (Photo: Nevada Rural Hospital Partners) While health authority officials updated state lawmakers on Tuesday on how the state will use $180 million in federal rural hospital funding provided by the One Big Beautiful Bill, they’re also trying to gauge how the allocation compares to the projected loss in funds rural Nevada will face due to pending Medicaid cuts scheduled go into effect in in less than a year.
President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax cut bill passed last year included a $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program to offset part of the bill’s substantial cuts to Medicaid. Half of the rural health money will be distributed equally among each state between fiscal years 2026 and 2030, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
The remaining $25 billion is being allocated to states based on several factors, such as steps states are taking to improve access to care in rural communities.
The administration unveiled the breakdown of initial state funding last week, which showed the amount of funding Nevada receives from the Trump administration program will rank among the lowest 10 of the 50 states.
Nationally, the rural funding program would only offset a little more than one-third of the bill’s estimated $137 billion cuts to federal Medicaid spending in rural areas over the next decade, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan health research organization KFF. 
Nevada could lose an estimated $553 million according to that analysis.
The state’s Medicaid office is waiting for federal guidance on changes affecting one substantial funding stream, the state’s hospital provider tax program, which provides “significant funding to roughly 45 private hospitals” including six private rural hospitals, said Allison Genco Herzik, the chief of staff with Nevada Health Authority, in an email Tuesday.
“Early estimates of the impact of these changes show … $600-$800 million a year in reduced provider tax related payments to hospitals by the end of 2028,” she said in an email. “Based on the current distribution of provider tax funds in Nevada, the impact of these losses will fall primarily on the state’s urban acute hospitals, and not rural hospitals.”
Officials with the Nevada Health Authority gave members of the legislative Interim Committee on Health and Human Services a general overview of how the $179.9 million federal grant funding will be prioritized Tuesday.
The federal funding is expected to support four initiatives with the largest portion, roughly 40%, targeted at attracting health care providers to rural parts of the state, said Stacie Weeks, director of the Nevada Health Authority. 
However, one idea the state initially proposed was rejected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and its administrator, physician and former media celebrity Mehmet Oz. 
“We wanted to do a loan repayment program, a very large one,” Weeks said. “We heard very loud and clear from Dr. Oz and others — they were not interested in that.”
The plan, instead, proposes using funds to for incentives such as signing bonuses or housing assistance to entice health care providers to move to rural areas. 
Other initiatives prioritized by Nevada health officials include a “rural health outcomes accelerator” to address root causes of chronic diseases, and a rural health care “flex fund.”
“We heard a lot from our rural hospitals that can’t afford to buy an ambulance or can’t afford the new x-ray machine or mammogram, all the things they need to support their community,” Weeks said. “This flex fund is to support those one-time infrastructure needs.” 
Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill also directs 15% of the rural health funding program toward health innovation and technology, which Weeks said “was something CMS really wanted to see in our applications.” The idea would be to fund new technologies around telehealth or “artificial intelligence” tools in health care. 
“We had multiple vendors wanting this money, and that is not always bad,” Weeks said. “I want to be mindful that this money is sustainable for communities and actually is going to improve health care. We want to be careful it’s not just a slush fund for every new idea, and that these are meaningful and evidence-based solutions.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/caliente-1024x623.jpg,,,2026-01-07 07:12:28.586858

Tim Walz announces he will step down from the 2026 gubernatorial election Monday, Jan. 5, 2026 at the Minnesota State Capitol. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota trailed the nation in economic growth during Gov. Tim Walz’s tenure, but Minnesotans continued to enjoy higher wages than most states, lower unemployment and a decrease in crime.
Walz announced the end of his campaign for a third term on Monday in the face of increasing pressure from his own party and attacks from Republicans over widespread fraud in state-run social services programs.
He said he takes accountability for the fraud that happened on his watch as well as the successes of his administration through the remarkable lows and highs of his tenure: the COVID-19 pandemic, the murder of George Floyd, Democrats winning control of state government and passing a sweeping progressive agenda, and the assassination of his friend and colleague Melissa Hortman.
“If the buck stops with me on when there’s problems, the buck stops with me on successes,” Walz said at a Tuesday news conference celebrating the rollout of the state’s paid family leave program.
Here are eight charts exploring how the state has been doing over the course of Walz’s tenure since 2019.


Minnesota’s economy grew slower than the nation’s, as measured by gross domestic product — the state’s output of goods and services. The U.S. economy grew around 16% since 2019, while Minnesota’s grew 10% in the same time frame.
The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, which represents companies in Minnesota, published a report in November finding that job growth and income growth in the state is also not keeping pace with the nation’s.


Unemployment is creeping back up after a low in 2022 according to the September data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Unemployment in Minnesota remains lower compared to the U.S. as a whole, but higher than some other states in the region.
In an August release, Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development Commissioner Matt Varilek said that employment trends might be the result of federal layoffs, funding freezes and tariff policies under the Trump administration, along with shrinking immigration.


Minnesotans still earn the highest average hourly wages in the Midwest. The average Minnesota worker earned $37.58 per hour in 2024, compared to $32.66 nationally, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Wages have generally matched or outpaced inflation over the past several decades. Although high inflation coming out of the pandemic eroded many workers’ buying power, wage growth has since caught up. Low-wage workers — particularly those in nursing homes and food service — benefited the most from a tight labor market, which has pushed wages up much more quickly than inflation in recent years.


Index crimes — a group of eight serious crimes that law enforcement agencies use to track crime over time — were lower in 2024 than at the start of Walz’s term in 2019, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
The total crime rate in 2024 was at a multi-decade low, driven by a drop in property crimes. Meanwhile, homicide rates dropped from a COVID-era spike but still remained high.


Minnesota students’ performance on state-wide standardized tests have stagnated since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic closed schools in 2020. Proficiency rates in reading and math in 2025 were 10 percentage points lower than they were in 2019. In 2025, fewer than half of Minnesota students met grade-level expectations for reading and math.


More Minnesota families are getting their kids out of routine vaccinations, reflecting growing vaccine skepticism across the nation bolstered by President Donald Trump’s appointment of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.
Nearly 6% of Minnesota kindergartners received non-medical vaccine exemptions in 2024, compared to 3.4% in 2019.


Even so, Minnesotans can expect to live longer than people in other states in the Midwest, according to the National Center for Health Statistics’ life expectancy estimates for a person born in 2022.


State Fair attendance — an important metric of Minnesotans’ pride in their Minnesotan-ness — was a record high in 2019. The pandemic put a damper on sales of pronto pups and other sticked foods, with the 2020 state fair cancelled and the 2021 state fair only hosting 1.3 million people, compared to 2.1 million in 2019.
Attendance has been rising since then, though, with numbers back up to 1.9 million in the past two years.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_9332-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 07:12:28.586858

Tom Barrett in the November election, is putting anti-corruption reforms at the forefront of her first big policy rollout as the 2026 election cycle begins.
Brink, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who resigned in opposition to the Trump administration’s policies in the region, on Wednesday announced her plans for cleaning up Washington, D.C. across all three branches of the federal government.
“The chaos and corruption coming out of Washington is costing Michiganders,” Brink said in a statement. “We need a principled, pragmatic reform agenda and leaders willing to fight like hell to restore faith in government and clean up Washington.”
First on the list is to officially ban the offices of the president and vice president, members of Congress, all executive branch employees and U.S. Supreme Court justices from trading individual stocks. Brink is also proposing a permanent, lifetime ban on members of Congress from becoming lobbyists, and prohibiting their immediate family members from serving as registered lobbyists during their time in office.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Brink said she would push for a constitutional amendment creating term limits for Congress, while also advocating for measures to block pay to members during government shutdowns.
Legislation clarifying and limiting the powers of the president to issue pardons would also be top of mind for Brink should she win the August primary and defeat Barrett (R-Charlotte) in the fall general election.
Also on the proposed policy list are:

A ban on all branches receiving gifts of more than $20;
A  constitutional amendment overturning the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United, effectively banning the unlimited spending of dark money by corporations and wealthy individuals; and
A new, binding code of ethics for the president, vice president, Congress, executive appointees, and the high court’s justices, which would include a requirement for full financial and tax disclosures.

Brink said the policy proposals were aimed at restoring people’s faith in government. 
“That means standing up for what’s right, speaking truth to power, and delivering real results — even if it means risking one’s career. I’ve done that throughout my 28 years of service to our country and I’ll do it again in Congress,” Brink said.
The Democratic primary race for the 7th District also includes retired Navy SEAL Matt Maasdam, Elyon Badger, William Lawrence, Alexandra Prieditis and Muhammad Salman Rais.

Not if you’re the Mississippi House speaker,Emily Wagster Pettus,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/07/mississippi-house-speaker-press-restriction/,"The door of House Speaker Jason White's office in the Mississippi Capitol on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
For journalists, getting into a politician’s press conference at the Mississippi Capitol shouldn’t be like trying to get into a fancy party at a country club.
Not on the invitation list? You’re out of luck.
House Speaker Jason White and his staff made a bumble-headed decision by blocking a Mississippi Today reporter from attending White’s pre-legislative session Q&A on Monday – a decision that violates the principles of government transparency. 
The invitation-only press conference was open to most news organizations that regularly cover the Legislature, and it took place in White’s office in the Capitol. The Republican from West occupies the space because his House colleagues chose him as their leader and because taxpayers are footing the bill to keep the office running.
Mississippi Today published an investigative report last April about Speaker White, members of his staff and some of their spouses taking a trip to the Super Bowl in New Orleans. Expenses for the trip were paid, at least in part, by DraftKings, a gaming company that has invested heavily in lobbying for legal online betting. After Mississippi Today posted its report, the speaker’s office stopped sending Mississippi Today advisories about press conferences and stopped responding to the newsroom’s requests for comments.
Mississippi Speaker of the House Jason White and some of his staff and spouses attended the Super Bowl.
Monday’s closed-door press conference happened the day before Mississippi legislators started their three-month session. It was the only opportunity White provided for journalists – on behalf of the public – to question him about the all-important issues he will push during this third year of a four-year term, including an effort to let some people spend public money in private schools.
Legislators make decisions each session that can change the lives of everyday Mississippians. Members of the House and Senate distribute billions of taxpayer dollars and set policies that could alter access to education and health care, roads and bridges, public welfare and public safety.
Mississippi Today and other news organizations send journalists to the Capitol to report on what elected officials are discussing and doing. It’s vital work that journalists take seriously because – let’s face it – most Mississippians are busy with their own lives and can’t drop everything to keep an eye on elected officials.
Some of the most substantial Capitol news coverage is rooted in source development. Journalists build relationships of trust with legislators, lobbyists or others who provide inside information about what’s happening that might not be readily apparent to the general public. Good journalists don’t regurgitate unvetted information. Instead, they verify it and put it in context.
Press conferences often provide ready-made news on a plate and sometimes provide no news at all. They are generally open to all credentialed journalists. For decades, standard practice has been for politicians’ staffers to notify Mississippi Capitol reporters about these events, whether they are in open-access areas such as the building’s marble-lined rotunda or in an office or a conference room. 
Even politicians who grumble about news coverage or editorials have generally avoided taking overt steps to exclude certain news organizations from press conferences. That includes, notably, Kirk Fordice, the state’s first Republican governor in modern times.
Fordice served two terms in the 1990s and was the first governor I covered during my 31 years as a Capitol journalist. Fordice constantly groused about the media. One of his favorite complaints was about editorial writers at The Clarion-Ledger, or as he derisively called them, “pencil pushers on Pearl Street.” (To get the full effect, say that out loud and emphasis each P so much that you nearly spit.) Fordice generally gave the Capitol reporters access to his events, even as he chewed us out for asking questions he didn’t like.
White acknowledged Monday that he engaged in picking and choosing which journalists could show up and ask him questions during his pre-session gathering. 
“The Media Q+A hosted in my office today was an invitation-only media opportunity, not an open, public press conference,” he said in a statement to the Clarion Ledger.
That’s a weird attempt to differentiate between “media Q&A” and “press conference,” which are the same thing. And it’s the kind of statement that comes from a public official who’s not committed to government transparency.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/06160556/829A0689.jpg,,,2026-01-07 07:12:28.586858

They take an oath to do just that.
Unfortunately, it seems some of our statewide officials have decided that they simply can declare what the law is and we are all expected to follow. They did not learn the rule from kindergarten: just because you say something does not make it so.
In early December, more than 300,000 signatures were submitted to the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office to put the question of whether the state legislature’s mid-decade redistricting congressional map should be adopted. These Missourians spoke with a common voice, loud and clear, that they wanted a statewide vote, a right which is guaranteed to them by the Missouri Constitution.
The Missouri Constitution is quite clear on the referendum process, backed by more than a century of case law: the voters have a right to vote on legislation passed by the Missouri General Assembly, and the legislation in question takes effect only when approved by voters.
Previous secretaries of state and attorneys general, both Republican and Democratic, have followed the law, which was the case in 2017, when then Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft suspended the legislature’s “right to work” law when the required number of signatures were gathered to put the measure on the ballot.
Yet current Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, with the assistance of Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, has decided to ignore established precedent and black letter law by declaring that the law is not stopped until a vote of the people occurs, and instead the new map is now in effect. They are waving off the will of the hundreds of thousands of Missourians who signed the petition and attempting to thwart the ability of millions more to vote on the measure.
Hoskins should stop and consider what his job is. As part of his duties, he has the right to determine that the submitted signatures are insufficient, which is subject to a quick judicial review. He has not chosen to do this. What he does not have is the authority to decide which bill, will, or will not, get enacted into law pending the outcome of a vote of the people.
By choosing to simply declare the new map in effect, Hoskins and Hanaway are not only disregarding the law, they are sowing chaos. Both candidates and elected officials have no idea which congressional districts will be in effect. Furthermore, by this attempt to impose the maps by his will alone, they are further delaying the ability of the referendum process to move forward.
All of this undermines Missourians’ confidence in their democracy and damages both our legal and political systems.
Now Missouri voters have had to file a lawsuit just to require Hoskins and Hanaway to follow the law. This latest court battle is one of many that have been generated by the opposition of our statewide officials. It is disturbing our secretary of state and attorney general have dedicated so much time and taxpayer money to keep the people from having a voice. They need to respect that the more than 300,000 petition signers have spoken and asked for a vote regarding fair and equal representation in the United States Congress. They need to stop with the delaying tactics and support this right of voters.
The people of Missouri reserved the right in our state Constitution to have the final say over legislation. Hoskins cannot just wish that away.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally3-1024x615.jpg,,,2026-01-07 06:58:13.856938

Barbara Dittrich (R-Oconomowoc) argued that a measure regulating the use of student names and pronouns was needed to standardize policies across the state. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)A bill that would require school districts to inform parents when students want to use pronouns and names that differ from the ones given to them at birth received significant pushback Tuesday during a Senate Education Committee hearing.
The committee also took testimony on a bill to add video requirements to human growth and development curriculum as well as to opt the state into a federal school choice tax credit program.
Under SB 120, Wisconsin schools would be required to adopt a policy on name and pronoun changes by July 1, 2026. Policies would not require written authorization if school staff are using a shortened version of a student’s first or middle name.
Sen. André Jacque (R-New Franken) and Rep. Barbara Dittrich (R-Oconomowoc) argued that the measure was needed to standardize policies across the state and ensure parents are involved in conversations related to pronoun and name changes for students. Many testified in opposition to the bill, saying it would do harm to students and infringe on local decision making. 
“It is deeply troubling to me that school staff are being encouraged to keep parents out of major life decisions concerning their children, while at the same time these same officials cannot give them aspirin without parental approval. Why would schools promote secrecy in such a way?” Jacque said. “Something has gone terribly wrong in our education system if officials inherently perceive parents as harmful to their own children. Parents are legally accountable for the health and welfare of their own children… Hiding from us important things that are going on in their lives is not only disrespectful to parents, it is harmful to our children.” 
Jacque said the legislation would be consistent with a 2023 ruling by a Waukesha County Circuit Court judge, which found that a policy that allowed students in the Kettle Moraine School District to change their names and pronouns in school violated the rights of parents to make medical decisions for their children. The school district now has a policy that requires express parental consent for staff to use different names and pronouns. 
“To me, if there’s going to be a name and pronoun change the school should be working together with parents and students to advance that together,” Dittrich said. 
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) pushed back on the Republican bill, saying it would infringe on local communities’ ability to make decisions about policies and would harm students.
“You could sub out the words ‘parental decision making’ and say that the Legislature is going to have the best authority of what should happen — instead of parents, instead of local governments, instead of local school boards. You’re saying that you guys know better,” Larson said. 
“That’s a total distortion of what the bill does,” Dittrich said.
Larson asked the bill authors to consider a situation where parents may not be accepting of a student who wants to use a different name and pronouns. 
“You are expediting that situation by making it come to a head when there are parents who are less than understanding, who are brought up under a very strict and very incorrect… and you are forcing the question in a vulnerable population that is already overly targeted with transphobia with this, which is already overly targeted for bullying, which is already higher than the average rates of suicide and mental health. You are bullying them by bringing this bill forward,” Larson said.
“You are saying we should hide information and not facilitate those conversations,” Jacque replied. Dittrich added that Larson was “trampling all over parental rights.”
Paul Bartlett, a father of two transgender children, said the bill works to “prioritize the unfounded fears of conservative parents over the well-being of children.” 
“Like any parent, I want my children to thrive and be happy. They are well supported against these continued legislative attacks, but many trans and nonbinary kids are not,” Bartlett said. He said that school should be a refuge for unsupported students, “not a place where teachers are obligated to out and humiliate them.” 
Bartlett pointed out that lawmakers recently approved a law, known as Bradyn’s Law, that seeks to protect young people from being sexually extorted online. 
“That everyone agreed on [that bill] was important because what we were doing was preventing teenagers from killing themselves basically from humiliation… and yet these bills, they do the opposite,” Bartlett said. 
Bartlett noted that anti-trans laws have a negative effect on young transgender people. 
According to a 2024 survey by the Trevor Project, 45% of transgender and nonbinary youth have reported that they or their family have considered moving to a different state due to anti-LGBTQ+ politics and laws, and about 90% have said that their wellbeing was negatively affected by  recent politics. 
The Trevor Project survey, which pulled from the experiences of over 18,000 LGBTQ+ youth, also found that 39% of LGBTQ+ young people, including 46% of transgender and nonbinary young people, had seriously considered attempting suicide. 
“I just don’t understand, like, why do we keep doing this?” Bartlett said.
Abigail Swetz, executive director of FAIR Wisconsin, said bills that target transgender youth contribute to the mental health struggles they face. 
The bill is part of a slate of bills that Wisconsin Republicans introduced related to transgender people, including children, last year. According to the 2025 anti-trans bills tracker, there were over 1,020 bills introduced across the country including 20 in Wisconsin. 
“Inclusive policies, like making it possible for students to use an affirming name and the pronouns that best represent their identity in school in an easily accessible way — those policies are a pressure valve making it possible for [youth] to live fully and healthily,” Swetz said. 
Swetz said when she previously worked as a teacher she helped support students that were preparing to share information about themselves with their family and said it was important to follow the child’s lead. 
“The youth themselves are the experts in their own experience and have a better understanding than anyone about the challenges they might face when it comes to acceptance and safety at home. I have witnessed that conversation go well, and I have seen it go badly,” Swetz said. She said the bill that lawmakers were pushing “aims to traffic in distrust while a process like this, one that is directed by a well-supported young person, is actually how we can build trust between parents, children and school staff.” 
Peggy Wirtz-Olson, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council (WEAC), said she was speaking out against the bill on behalf of the students who would be “devastated” by the bill. 
“All students deserve safe and welcoming schools, not only some of them, every single one of them, and that includes our trans students,” Wirtz-Olsen said. “The simple use of preferred names and pronouns is associated with a large decrease in depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and even suicidal attempts. Respecting preferred names and pronouns is a proven measure to show respect, earn trust, affirm our students, so they can feel safe, and they can focus on learning.”
Requiring videos of fetal development
Lawmakers also took testimony on a bill to add requirements for schools that offer human growth and development education. 
Human growth and development is optional for Wisconsin school districts, but for those that do opt in, state law includes some requirements including encouraging abstinence for students who are unmarried. 
SB 371 would add requirements that explanations of pregnancy, prenatal development and childbirth include a high definition video that shows the development of the brain, heart, sex organs and other organs, a rendering of the fertilization process and fetal development as well as a presentation on each trimester of pregnancy and the physical and emotional health of the mother. 
The bill would also require that instruction on parental responsibility include information on the importance of secure interpersonal relationships for infant mental health and on the value of reading to young children. 
Bill coauthors Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) and Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) rejected the assertion that the bill is a mandate, noting that school districts do not have to teach human growth and development. 
“Today’s youth are technologically and visually inclined learners. We should lean into this to better convey this important information,” Felzkowski said. She also added that there should be bipartisan agreement around “preparing the young women of today with all the knowledge they could need to prepare for motherhood and young men for fatherhood.” 
“Being able to actually see the real life process of fetal development in action will be more tangible to students than textbooks or seeing it in a still diagram or a drawing. We have a resource at our disposal to bring science into our classroom and we should use it to our advantage to give students a stronger educational experience,” Nedweski said.
Nedweski also said it “might not be obvious to some people that using an iPad as a babysitter is not healthy” and that it is “far more important for their health to read to children and to bond with them.”
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) asked the lawmakers what type of research they had to back up the change to state law.
“There’s not one specific scientific research that we’re relating this to,” Felzkowski said. “Just Google it and numerous things will pop up, or we can have our staff do that for you.”
No one spoke against the bill. 
The Wisconsin Public Health Association (WPHA) and the Wisconsin Association of Local Health Departments and Boards are registered against the bill, according to the Wisconsin Lobbying website. The organizations outlined their concerns with the Assembly version of the bill in a statement to the Wisconsin Examiner. 
The organizations said it opposed the legislation in part because it doesn’t do anything to restore the educational standards that were in place under the Healthy Youth Act. The former state law, which included a more comprehensive policy that required providing age-appropriate instruction in human growth and development, was adopted in 2010 but was later repealed in 2012 during a special session under former Gov. Scott Walker, who reestablished abstinence-only education. 
“Evidence-based, comprehensive instruction is essential to equip students with accurate information and skills necessary to make informed decisions about their sexual health, reducing rates of unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. It also promotes healthy relationships, consent, and emotional well-being, contributing to overall public health and safety,” the organizations said in the statement.
DPI spokesperson Chris Bucher told the Examiner in an email that the state already has similar guidelines for human development instruction in state law and said the bill is an example of infringing on local control. 
“It is up to districts to determine human development curriculum for what best fits their community. This is also another unfunded mandate for districts choosing to offer human development. District budgets are already stretched thin,” Bucher said. “If the Legislature wants to mandate specific instruction, they should provide funding for curriculum.”
Federal choice tax credit program 
SB 600 would instruct Gov. Tony Evers to opt Wisconsin into a federal school choice tax credit program.
Gov. Tony Evers has previously said he will not opt Wisconsin into the program, and if the bill were passed by the Senate and Assembly instructing Evers to take action, he could veto the legislation. 
A provision in the federal law signed by President Donald Trump in July, which goes into effect in 2027, will provide a dollar-for-dollar tax credit of up to $1,700 to people who donate to a qualifying “scholarship granting program” to support certain educational expenses including tuition and board at private schools, tutoring and books. 
However, governors in each state must decide whether to opt in and have until Jan. 1, 2027 to do so.
Felzkowski said it would be “shortsighted and self-defeating” to not opt into the tax credit, noting that other states including North Carolina, Tennessee, Nebraska, Texas, South Dakota and Iowa, are already opting in. 
If Wisconsinites opt into the federal tax credit, the money will be directed to private schools outside the state if the law does not pass, Felzkowski said. “Our dollars will be going to those states… instead of our students here in the state of Wisconsin.”

Vaneta Becker's legislation would criminalize doxing threats. She is pictured in the Senate chamber on Dec. 10, 2025. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana lawmakers hope to crack down on doxing after more than a dozen of their own became victims of threats amid a turbulent but unsuccessful redistricting campaign.
Doxing is the public release of someone’s personal information, without their consent, as a threat.
Senate Bill 140 would make that a Class A misdemeanor, or a felony if the doxing results in serious injury or death.
“Basically it’s what Sen. (Spencer) Deery and Sen. (Greg) Goode and Sen. (Jean) Leising and several others over the redistricting … experienced,” said bill author Sen. Vaneta Becker, R-Evansville, told the Senate’s Corrections and Criminal Law committee Tuesday.
Targeted lawmakers included those for and against President Donald Trump’s failed push to eliminate Indiana’s two Democratic congressional seats in favor of a 9-0 Republican delegation, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
As threats escalate against Indiana lawmakers, Braun says his family also targeted

The Indiana Senate voted the maps down mid-December, after months of intense pressure and weeks of threats.
Those included swatting attempts at lawmakers’ homes — hoax reports to emergency services intended to trigger armed responses — plus bomb threats and more.
“I was threatened to have my family killed in front of me, whereafter I would be killed,” redistricting bill author Rep. Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn, revealed mid-meeting last month.
Indiana State Police are leading an ongoing investigation into the intimidation against lawmakers.
While Tuesday’s discussion centered on lawmakers impacted during redistricting, everyday Americans are increasingly seeing their personal information spread across social media as retaliation for a wide range of disagreements.
Becker’s legislation would criminalize intentionally posting the personal information of a targeted person — or close connections — as a threat, in retaliation for something legal the targeted person did.
Personal information would include someone’s Social Security number, address or phone number, along with the name or address of their employer or places they frequent.
The definition for threat pulls from the state’s intimidation statute. Posts to social media would count, as would emails and other forms of electronic communication.
Tweaks to some of the bill’s definitions are expected.
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, said the bill’s definition of a “closely connected” person was too vague. It would include the target’s spouse, sibling, child, parent and grandparent, but also an unrelated person living in the same household, a dating partner or a coworker.
Committee Chair Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, assured her he would clarify the “broad” language in an amendment on Friday, before a vote on the bill.

“There’s a lot of benefit to people that disagree getting together and talking about it, and we do that all the time,” Freeman said later.
“How anybody is 45 years old, living in their mother’s basement and never having a relationship with anybody, and getting on a computer and doing this stuff? ” Freeman said. “… My God, can we be adults about this?”
He especially bemoaned the targeting of families with children.
The Class A misdemeanor created in Becker’s bill could rise to a Level 6 felony if a post results in serious bodily injury, or a Level 5 felony if it results in catastrophic injury or death.
Included are protections for those who make reports to law enforcement, prosecutors, and the Department of Child Services “reasonably and in good faith.”
The bill additionally appears to protect constituent communication and organizing, protecting those who engage in “lawful and constitutionally protected activity as it pertains to speech, assembly, and petition.”

A bill to change the unemployment insurance rules has divided lawmakers despite being offered by the joint labor-management Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)A bill that would boost Wisconsin’s top weekly jobless pay while penalizing people who receive federal disability pay is heading to the Assembly floor — so far with only GOP support.
The legislation, AB 652, would also impose several previously vetoed changes to the state’s unemployment insurance (UI) law. It passed the Assembly’s labor committee Tuesday on a 6-3 vote, with all committee Democrats voting no.
The bill came from the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council. With equal participation of labor and management, the council negotiates changes to the state’s unemployment insurance law every two years.
The council historically has been credited with giving neither side a lopsided advantage in revisions to the unemployment insurance system. The bill that the body offered for the current legislative session, however, has become problematic for some of the council’s staunchest advocates.

“I simply cannot vote for this particular bill as written,” said Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) at Tuesday’s vote by the Assembly Committee on Workforce Development, Labor and Integrated Employment.
The measure would increase the maximum jobless pay for the first time in 12 years — to $395 a week from $370.
It would also formally repeal a 12-year-old ban on unemployment benefits for people who receive federal Social Security Disability Income. At the same time, however, it would cut an SSDI recipient’s jobless payments by the equivalent of half their weekly disability income.
A federal judge ruled in July 2024 that Wisconsin’s ban violated federal laws protecting people with disabilities.
In 2025 the judge ordered the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development to stop denying jobless pay for SSDI recipients. The department was also ordered to review the cases going back to 2015 of people denied unemployment insurance due to the ban and make payments to those who were otherwise eligible.
Sinicki has long championed the role of the UI advisory council in revising the state’s UI laws, criticizing changes Republicans have proposed that didn’t go through the joint labor-management body.
Despite that, she’s been an outspoken critic of the UI advisory council’s current bill since it was introduced in November, and reiterated her opposition Tuesday because of the SSDI penalty.
Sinicki described an autistic constituent who works “a few hours a day” at a library. “She counts on that money. If she loses that job, she’s out that money,” Sinicki said. “We’re talking about a very small amount of money. It’s not saving the state millions and millions of dollars” to claw it back.
She predicted the bill would run afoul of the court order blocking the SSDI ban.
Sinicki also criticized “the paltry $25 increase” in the maximum weekly benefit.
“When you look around at the states around us, most of them are paying out twice as much as we do here,” she said. “And I just think it’s a slap in the face.”
Rep. Paul Melotik (R-Grafton) chairs the Assembly Committee on Workforce Development, Labor and Integrated Employment. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)
State Rep. Paul Melotik (R-Grafton), the committee chair, defended the legislation.
“This is increasing what people are getting when they claim [unemployment],” Melotik said. “And it also is legal based on what the agreed-upon deal has been.”
In addition to its SSDI penalty, AB 652 would write into the state’s UI law changes that were in previous bills Gov. Tony Evers has vetoed — two of them in the current legislative session.
Those provisions would penalize unemployment insurance recipients accused of “ghosting” job interviews or failing to show up for an offered job; increase the scrutiny of recipients’ work searches; impose new requirements for applicants to prove their identities; and require DWD to follow specific steps, including checking databases that track death records, employment records, citizenship and immigration records, to confirm the identity of a UI applicant.
Evers’ office did not respond Tuesday to an inquiry about whether he planned to sign or veto the UI council legislation if it reaches his desk. In vetoing previous UI-related bills, Evers has cited in part the failure to put them through the advisory council process.
DWD, however, “has a number of concerns with the UIAC agreed upon bill package,” according to written testimony the department filed with the committee at a November public hearing on the bill.
Rachel Harvey, DWD’s legislative director, wrote that the bill’s $25 increase in the top weekly benefit from the maximum set in 2013 amounts to less than 7%. The increase “remains far below the maximum weekly benefit rate in neighboring states,” she wrote.
Harvey wrote that the testimony was provided “for information only,” but showed no enthusiasm for the legislation.
“The bill package includes reductions of Ul benefits for recipients of SSDI, multiple provisions previously vetoed by Gov. Evers, costly work search audit requirements, redundant measures already in effect at DWD to ensure program integrity, and new barriers for individuals receiving benefits,” she wrote
It makes those changes, she added, “all while failing to provide adequate resources for the department to implement these provisions in their entirety.”



Worker’s compensation changes get unanimous support
By contrast Tuesday, the Assembly committee unanimously endorsed legislation that would update Wisconsin’s worker’s compensation laws. That bill was also the product of a separate joint labor-management body, the The Worker’s Compensation Advisory Council.
AB 651 increases the maximum weekly compensation for a permanent, partial disability, currently $446, to $454 for workplace injuries before Jan. 1, 2027 and to $462 for injuries on or after that date.
It also increases supplemental benefits for permanent total disability. Those benefits had applied to people injured at work before Jan. 1, 2003, but the new bill extends them to cover workplace injuries before Jan. 1, 2020.
The legislation gives volunteer firefighters, emergency medical responders and emergency medical practitioners coverage for post-traumatic stress disorders that is in line with the coverage already available to law enforcement officers and non-volunteer firefighters.
The bill also makes numerous other procedural and administrative changes.

The kingdom of God is within, should we so choose, but not in the Capitol or the courthouse, writes columnist Rod Miller. 
The post Jesus, Jefferson and the separation of church and state appeared first on WyoFile .","When I hear anyone claim that separation of church and state doesn’t exist, and that the United States is a Christian nation, I have to chuckle at their lack of understanding. There are lots of Christian citizens, for certain, just as there are many Americans of other faiths. But we are not a Christian nation, nor were we founded to be a religious state.

Opinion

We were founded to be a nation in which all citizens are free to believe in any god they want, or to not believe. Emphasis on free.
The original 13 colonies were religious colonies to be sure, and there was no separation between church and state. But the First Amendment to our Constitution changed that forever.
Here’s an example. In the Virginia Colony in the mid-1700s, the Anglican Church was the official state religion. A Virginian could not hold public office unless he was a member of the state-sanctioned church.
The colony also levied taxes on all citizens, regardless of religion, that went directly to the Church of England clergy, to the church hierarchy and to support church property, a wealth transfer that the Wyoming Constitution strictly prohibits today.
State and church were so intertwined that colonial government enforced church law. Heresy was a capital crime under colonial law. If a Virginian disagreed with Anglican Church doctrine, or bad-mouthed the Archbishop of Canterbury, it was the colony that prosecuted and punished the offense because church and state were virtually the same entity.
Those church laws were not voted upon by the citizens, but were handed down by clerics who were themselves not elected. Yet, citizens, regardless of denomination, were punished if they did not obey those laws. When there is no separation of church and state, that is what citizens can expect.
Thomas Jefferson came of age under Virginia’s repressive church/state thumb. When he was elected to the Virginia General Assembly, he drafted and passed the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom in 1786, a year before our Constitution was drafted.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)

The Virginia Statute was an Enlightenment Age document and clearly expressed the primacy of human freedom over religious dogma. Under that secular law, all people were free to express their religious beliefs without interference from the state. All religious beliefs, not just Christianity, were liberated from state control. It was among the first expressions of the separation between church and state in human history.
And it was the model for James Madison’s First Amendment.
This is the constitutional framework that exists today, regardless of what Christian nationalists or hair-on-fire mercantile evangelists preach. Human spirituality is free from the greedy hands of the political state. What is Caesar’s is rendered unto Caesar, and what is God’s is rendered unto God. That’s regardless of what God is worshiped or which political party holds power.
The First Amendment, in fact, the very first part of it, guarantees government cannot establish a religion or prevent anyone from practicing their own religion. That guarantee leaves no room for government in the world of faith, and vice versa. It is a clear separation.
In the United States, under our Constitution, religion is free of government control and government is free of religious control. I would have it no other way.
Absent that separation, theocracies emerge where governments impose and enforce religious laws, as in countries subject to Sharia Law, on all of the citizens. And governments are free to engage in bloody atrocities like the Spanish Inquisition or the Crusades to force their religious belief on others.
A jaundiced view of things might conclude that this is the intent of the politically active religious zealots in today’s America. If so, it runs counter to everything this country was founded upon.
To avoid any misunderstanding, I’ll testify here and now that I believe in God and love Jesus as much as anyone. But I’ll resist any attempt by my government to force me to believe or tell me how to worship. Nor will I try to force the same on anyone else.
Both a life of faith and a decision not to believe are deeply personal and individual choices, and our system of government protects our right to choose. Realistically, no law can be written that will force the innermost human heart to believe, not to believe or how to believe. That is simply not government’s dominion.
Jesus himself articulated this separation of church and state best in Luke 17:21 when he told the Pharisees, “The kingdom of God is within you.”
It is not in the courthouse, nor in the Capitol building, the kingdom of God is within you. Thank you, Jesus and Jefferson for drawing that clear line!

Tim Walz announces he will step down from the 2026 gubernatorial election Monday, Jan. 5, 2026 at the Minnesota State Capitol. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The moment Gov. Tim Walz was cooked was little remarked upon at the time, but in retrospect illustrates how he and his administration were sleeping through an enveloping crisis.
At the late 2024 budget forecast, he said disability and autism services were driving state government spending beyond expectations. When he was asked about potential fraud in the autism program — about which we’d reported an FBI investigation six months prior — he seemed unfamiliar. I traded texts with an incredulous reporter who was there and wound up publishing a column called, “Minnesota: an easy mark.” 
More recently, Walz faced the full force of the right-wing propaganda machine in the past two months. It was a frightening sight to behold, and a healthier democracy would never be host to such a parasitical malignancy.
Although restoring American democratic habits of mind to eviscerate that propaganda machine should be on our lengthy, long-term to-do list, the lesson here for me is that the most underrated tool in the political toolbox is … governing.
Deadly dull, I know, but the word governor even has the word “govern” in it: competently administering programs to help people who need it; ensuring Minnesota’s children are learning literacy and numeracy; and managing the state’s vast infrastructure assets. That’s the job.
Former St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, another one-time rising star in Minnesota politics, recently faced the same sort of governing reckoning as Walz, when Mayor Kaohly Her pulled off an upset November victory promising to make stuff work again. May Democratic elected officials everywhere take notice.
We live in perilous times, no question, but Minnesotans are right to expect a minimum level of competency in these matters of public administration. It’s especially important for the party of government, i.e., the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, to pay attention to details, like whether a 3,000% increase in spending on the autism program is reasonable, especially when some of the providers had ties to Feeding Our Future.
Tim Walz is at heart a decent man, and he doesn’t deserve what’s been thrown at him in recent weeks — especially a despicable allegation leveled by the president of the United States and the odious propagandist Nick Shirley that Walz was involved in the assassination of former House Speaker Melissa Hortman.
He made some mistakes, but he’s not evil, unlike some of the loudest and most influential voices in American politics today, whose greed and lust for power are boundless.
Walz’s first term was marked by almost constant crisis, none of it his doing. He was a mostly steady hand, even as Republicans came to despise him during the pandemic and the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd.
His second term comprised major legislative accomplishments — for which the credit mostly belongs to Hortman and the late Sen. Kari Dziedzic — as well as his (again, in retrospect) disastrous candidacy for vice president. All the while, thieves were stealing the people’s money with gusto.
Walz has served the community of Mankato, the people of Minnesota and his country.
And now he has saved us from what would have been a deeply divisive campaign, and which would have put the state of Minnesota under federal siege.
Unlike former President Joe Biden, who doomed his party and the country with his insistence on running for a second term, Walz is stepping aside before any more damage is done to his state and the DFL. He says he’ll focus all his energies on cleaning up the mess.
He deserves our thanks for that service and for making this decision.

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)One of the biggest topics of 2025 for farmers, consumers and healthcare providers in North Carolina was whether raw milk should be legal to sell for human consumption. The battle, which  has been going on for years, could well resurface during the 2026 legislative session.
Raw milk has not undergone pasteurization, which is a process of heating the milk to a high temperature for a certain amount of time to kill pathogens like tuberculosis, which for centuries was frequently caused by drinking milk from cows with tuberculosis.   
Public health officials say foodborne illnesses like salmonella can also spread through consuming unpasteurized milk. Symptoms of these can include vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. They can be especially severe in children.
Some people, however, say raw milk is healthier — a theory that’s been debunked by hundreds of studies — or that it tastes better. Others argue it’s an issue of personal liberty, claiming consumers have a fundamental freedom to decide what they and their families consume.  
Robert Benor owns Benor Farm in Cedar Grove, N.C. (Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)
Robert Benor owns Benor Farm in Orange County’s Cedar Grove, a regenerative dairy with 12 cows and a herdshare.
Herdsharing is a practice similar to a CSA or farmshare, but it’s specific to dairy products. Consumers who want raw milk can buy a “share” of a dairy herd’s production, which sidesteps the legal issues over selling the milk itself. 
Benor says some of his customers have moved here from other states where the sale of raw milk is legal. “[They] say they can’t get used to the taste of pasteurized milk,” he said. “There’s others who are all natural and prefer raw milk.”
The cows, each bearing the name of something that goes with milk — for example, Milkshake, Nutmeg, Chocolate Chip, and Biscuit — live on the pasture at Benor Farm year round.
The number of herdshare members fluctuates throughout the year, but Benor says he provides raw milk to roughly a few hundred families and individuals. He also offers add-ons like butter, ricotta, yogurt, heavy cream, and fresh eggs from his chickens.

Benor milks the dairy cows every morning, sanitizing the equipment and storing the milk in a bulk tank that’s cleaned every 72 hours. 
“We focus a lot on sanitation and hygiene, so that we can make sure the milk is as safe as possible,” Benor told NC Newsline. 
But even the best sanitation can’t remove pathogens from unpasteurized milk -– a fact Davidson resident Pamela Breeckner knows from personal experience.
Breeckner told NC Newsline her father passed away years ago from tuberculosis contracted from drinking raw milk from a neighbor’s diseased cow. At the time, dangers related to unpasteurized milk weren’t as well known, and there were fewer regulations on its sale and consumption. 
“He was hospitalized or homebound for about 12 years before his death,” Breeckner said. “He was ill my whole life.”
The cow’s owners also passed away from tuberculosis, she said.
North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler is in favor of banning the sale of raw milk outright. He said the topic has been an ongoing issue for many years. Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza — a very infectious strain of bird flu — led to the latest push to ban raw milk. 
Bird flu has moved from wild birds and poultry to farm animals like dairy cattle. From there, it can spread to humans, leading to conditions like respiratory symptoms and pinkeye.
As of Dec. 17, a total of 71 human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been identified in the U.S. since 2024, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. 
“[There were] dangers that had existed in the past, especially with bacterial growth in raw milk,” Troxler said. “But then when you throw in high-path avian influenza, then that is a different ball game.”
The controversial issue took the spotlight in North Carolina during debate over the state’s 2025 Farm Act, which passed the Senate and stalled in the House. 
An earlier draft of the bill would have closed the “pet milk” loophole in state law that allows the sale of unpasteurized milk. Under current law, the sale of raw milk for human consumption is illegal, but it can legally be sold as “pet milk” for animal consumption. 
The measure was ultimately pulled from the bill because of protests from raw milk advocates. About 100 activists attended a hearing of the North Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee in May, one of whom was arrested for attempting to bring a gun into the meeting.
Bill sponsor Sen. Brent Jackson, a Republican from Sampson County, said at that hearing he’d received thousands of text messages, phone calls, and emails in favor of raw milk consumption in North Carolina. 
“Until we filed this bill, sometimes you don’t know what’s out there,” he said. “But I’ve learned there is a tremendous amount of herdsharing going on in this state.”
Sampson did not allow the public to comment on the bill that day. But the committee voted against a total ban on the sale of raw milk.
Jackson’s staff did not respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment. 
Troxler isn’t giving up, though. He points to research like a 2017 study showing that unpasteurized dairy products can cause 840 times more illnesses and 45 times more hospitalizations than pasteurized products.
“From a public health standpoint, there is no reason to take that risk of contracting these illnesses when all you’ve got to do is have pasteurized milk,” Troxler told NC Newsline.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0630-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 06:12:45.684998

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A Tennessee Senate panel wants officers at a privately-run prison rocked by a 2025 riot to wear body cameras despite opposition from the state’s correction commissioner.
The State and Local Government Corrections Subcommittee recommended a pilot program Tuesday for the state’s private-prison contractor, CoreCivic, to equip detention officers at Trousdale Turner Correctional Center with body cameras in an effort to protect officers and inmates and provide clearer evidence for criminal investigations.
State Sen. Ed Jackson of Jackson pointed out that prisons can be “extremely dangerous” because of a shortage of prison officers.
“Body cameras would keep everybody honest,” Jackson said.
CoreCivic President and CEO Patrick Swindle estimated the cost of putting cameras on Trousdale Turner officers at $350,000. 
Senators surmised that CoreCivic was willing to pay for the hardware, but a spokesperson said afterward the company hadn’t agreed to fund the equipment, only that it would work with the state on the policies it adopts.
Correction Commissioner Frank Strada, though, balked at the notion of putting body cameras on every prison officer in the state, saying it would cost $6 million for the equipment and $2 million to handle public records requests, including the expense of hiring attorneys and technology specialists to go through video frame by frame and blur people’s faces for privacy reasons. He did not have a cost estimate for a pilot project at Trousdale Turner.

Instead, Strada told lawmakers the Department of Correction is putting together a central intelligence center in Nashville with nearly 30 employees using artificial intelligence to monitor prisoners. The department’s proposed budget for fiscal 2026-27 includes $8.6 million for technology upgrades.
The department also plans to spend $1.7 million to fly drones over facilities to stop contraband and phones from being smuggled into prisons. 
Strada raised privacy questions about video surveillance, mainly the constitutionality of having officers and inmates on video in cells, restrooms and other areas.
Lawmakers and a state attorney, though, said inmates lose some of their privacy rights when sent to prison.
Correction officials and CoreCivic leaders also challenged the concept of keeping body cameras turned on at all times, saying the amount of video is overwhelming for those who would monitor it or search for incidents. 
Swindle told lawmakers the company uses body cams at an Ohio prison but changed policy to allow officers to activate them only when they sense the need rather than keeping them on at all times.
Strada and a Correction Department lawyer also advised lawmakers the cost of hiring attorneys and technology experts would be extensive if cameras are rolling throughout an officer’s shift.
Lawmakers based their decision, in part, on the testimony of Wilson County District Attorney Jason Lawson, whose office handles Trousdale County cases, including those at the prison. 
U.S. Department of Justice opens investigation into CoreCivic Trousdale County prison

Lawson told the committee body cameras would help with prosecution of prison cases by providing better evidence. He showed pictures of inmates attacking an officer at Trousdale and explained that cameras in the prison’s pods are located at each end of a hall and when video is enlarged it doesn’t give a clear look at people’s faces to identify them in court.
“This is one of those situations where a picture is worth a thousand words,” Lawson said.
Swindle told lawmakers that CoreCivic invested in safety and security measures and increased officers’ pay, which reduced vacancies and cut the turnover rate. In addition, the state moved gang members out of Trousdale Turner to state-run prisons.
A Trousdale Turner officer was stabbed and three inmates were treated for injuries in June 2025 when prisoners left their cells and gained access to an inner yard, destroyed property, set small fires and refused to take orders from staff.
The U.S. Department of Justice initiated a civil rights investigation at Trousdale Turner in 2024, citing a record of assaults, murders and understaffing at the facility since it opened in 2016. It is unclear whether the investigation is continuing.
The Department of Correction is seeking a $13 million contract increase for CoreCivic next year that would push the company’s total contracts to $243 million for running four prisons. The department also wants $3.5 million to go toward an increase in CoreCivic’s officer pay.

Officials with the Wood River Land Trust announced Dec. 30 they were part of a large, community effort to acquire the 2,700-acre Hailey Hot Springs Ranch for permanent conservation. 
The ranch, which was once the site of the historic Hailey Hot Springs Hotel in the 1800s, adds to the Hailey Greenway, a 3,000-acre, six mile stretch of protected land, officials said. 
“When the For Sale sign went up at the property, people were coming to us hoping that we could do something,” Wood River Land Trust Executive Director Amy Trujillo said in a written statement. “We knew it was going to take more than one organization to make this happen. Again and again over the course of the year, we have been amazed at the way people have come together – it’s a testament to how much people love this place and what we can do together.”
 Wood River Land Trust will now work to develop master plan for property

In its announcement, the Wood River Land Trust said more than 900 partners teamed up to acquire and protect the property. The list includes The Nature Conservancy, Blaine County Recreation District, Heart of the Rockies Initiative, Atira Conservation, 100 Men Who Care, the Wood River Women’s Foundation, Hailey Rotary Club, Spur Community Foundation, the Idaho Fish and Wildlife Foundation, The Rixon-Cronin Charitable Trust, Power Engineers, the Kid Stand charitable initiative and numerous families. 
In 2025, officials with the Wood River Land Trust had announced they launched a campaign to raise $16 million to buy the property.

With the property acquisition complete, officials with the Wood River Land Trust said they will begin working on a master plan for the property and anticipate seeking public comment and involvement in developing the master plan in the spring. 
Supporters are seeking to protect wildlife habitat for sage grouse, moose, mule deer, pronghorn, sandhill cranes and elk on the land, as well as preserve public access, the Wood River Land Trust said. 
“Protecting Hailey Hot Springs Ranch has been the top priority of the Land Trust since its founding by community members over 30 years ago,” officials with the Wood River Land Trust wrote in a press release Dec. 30. “The acquisition adds to the Hailey Greenway, which is now a 3,000‐acre, six‐mile stretch of connected open space encompassing the Colorado Gulch Preserve, Draper Wood River Preserve, Simons/Bauer Preserve, and the new Hailey Hot Springs Ranch Preserve. The protected land now extends through riverfronts and riparian forests, wetlands, sagebrush steppe, and high-desert alpine ecosystems, where it links with thousands of acres of public land beyond.”
  Plans call for reopening Hailey Hot Springs to the public 

Although there is public access to the ranch, access to the hot springs itself remains closed for now, officials said. However, officials with the Wood River Land Trust said their plans call for reopening the hot springs to the public.

“An exciting part of this project is the opportunity to reopen public access to the hot springs,” the Wood River Land Trust said in its press release. “The springs are located in a sensitive area, and the land trust and the Blaine County Recreation District will be developing a plan to provide a long-term solution that provides safe and accessible hot spring access for the public away from the sensitive wildlife area. Thus, for now, the hot spring will remain closed to the public until that can be developed.”
Access to the ranch is available via Democrat Gulch Road, which is surrounded by Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service public land, officials said.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12-Wood-River-Land-Trust-Summit-of-Hailey-Hot-Springs-Ranch-looking-out-toward-Pioneer-Mtns-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 06:12:45.684998

No more “World News Tonight.” No “Dancing With the Stars.” The “9-1-1” drama franchises gone, all of them. And no – clutch the pearls – SEC football on Saturday afternoons.
Then imagine if folks at Sinclair told unhappy viewers that if they wanted to keep watching ABC, they could just stream it. And that they should be satisfied with a grab bag of less expensive programming filling the gaping holes in its schedule.
Ridiculous, you say. But that’s exactly what might happen at Arkansas PBS, where the installation of former Republican state legislator Carlton Wing as executive director has resulted in the inexplicable decision to drop its PBS affiliation and rebrand as something called Arkansas TV, which few people will watch and even fewer people will support financially.
The state of Arkansas has spent 60 years and tens of millions of dollars building a public television network with statewide reach, one of the gems of our media landscape. But starting in July, programs from PBS – which make up the bulk of the content now available on the network’s four channels – will no longer be broadcast in the state. Arkansas is the first state in the union to make that move.
No more “PBS News Hour.” No “Sesame Street.” No “Antiques Roadshow.” No “American Experience,” or Ken Burns documentaries. The PBS KIDS channel – which provides vital educational programming serving lower-income households that lack high-speed internet access needed to stream content – will go dark at the whim of Wing, who has no background in public broadcasting.
The disaffiliation, easily ratified by the Arkansas Educational Television Commission now packed with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ appointees, was one of the first moves Wing took after leaving the Legislature to take the helm of Arkansas PBS in September.
His reasoning? At $2.3 million a year, PBS programming is just too expensive because a different pack of Republican ideologues in Congress dismembered the Corporation for Public Broadcasting that underwrote the cost – an excuse that quickly dissolves when subjected to even slight scrutiny.
The notion that we can’t possibly find $2.3 million for a resource that serves 3 million Arkansans, at a cost of just 77 cents per resident per year, is rather laughable in a state now frittering away $300 million a year on voucher subsidies for private and homeschool students, a program that serves fewer than 47,000 families.
Rather than reaching out to wealthy donors to fill the gap, or seeking funding from charitable foundations, or finding more corporate underwriting, or lobbying for additional state funding, or even pushing Arkansas’ congressional delegation to reverse the decision to whack federal funding, Wing simply threw in the towel. It’s a move that was both lazy and unimaginative.
Disaffiliating from PBS should have been an absolute last resort when all other options had failed.
Contrast this with the approach of Arkansas’ three public radio stations, all of which also lost CPB support and none of which decided to drop NPR content. Indeed, they are working hard to find additional long-term, sustainable financial support to make up the gap.
Wing has said the disaffiliation decision had to be made now to avoid paying additional fees to PBS for not meeting a Jan. 1 deadline. PBS officials deny that claim, and it also ignores the fact that there would be no rationale at all for disaffiliation if other options had been successfully pursued.
Indeed, Arkansas PBS viewers showed their passion and commitment by coughing up $500,000 in the months after Congress cut CPB funding – an outpouring of support Wing has extinguished with his short-sighted decision to disaffiliate.
Wing ignores the effect this decision will have on the $3 million raised each year from viewers like you (more than the amount that he’s saving by eliminating PBS) that’s going to vanish like an Arkansas snowstorm.
Marge Betley, CEO of the Arkansas PBS Foundation, which manages donations to the network, made this point in June when she said that donations would “nosedive” without PBS because 80% of those who donate online cite its programming as their reason for giving money. The telethons that generate many of these donations are also, literally, built around PBS programming because these are the shows viewers care about and watch.
And here is where we truly go through the looking glass: Arkansas TV is telling current donors who get access to expanded content through the PBS Passport app that if they want to keep it, they will need to donate to PBS stations in surrounding states.
Thus, we are now actively encouraging money to flow out of Arkansas to support out-of-state stations. And if Wing thinks these people are also going to donate to Arkansas TV, he’s lost touch with reality.
The other aspect of this scheme is Wing’s pledge to raise the amount of locally produced programming on the network from its current level – about 5.5% of the schedule – to 70%.
Arkansas TV insists that it can replace hours and hours of PBS programming with local content for just $500,000 a year. But a budget that meager won’t come anywhere close to producing the quantity or quality of content that PBS viewers and donors have come to expect.
This decision is the culmination of a long-term Republican project, dating back to the Reagan years, to dismantle public broadcasting. This dismantling is pushed by politicians who oppose the very idea of having even one tiny, government-supported, non-commercial voice, or who believe PBS programming is too “liberal” or “woke.” 
Republicans in Congress, including Arkansas’ entire delegation, voted to put Arkansas PBS’ head on the block. Wing has now wielded the axe. Viewers will flee, fundraising will dry up, and Arkansas TV will become an irrelevant white elephant. Arkansas will be poorer for it.
Wing’s folly was perhaps best summed up in a letter sent to him by Annette Herrington, who has served on the Arkansas PBS board for 14 years and voted against disaffiliation:
“There are multiple options for how to proceed because that is what public television systems are doing all over America. And with 78% of Arkansans supporting PBS content, viewers and donors definitely deserve our best efforts to find a solution for the people we serve,” she wrote. “I cannot understand how the only option presented after your first 70 days was to deny PBS content to all Arkansans.”

Shortly after launching a dramatic raid in which U.S. forces abducted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, President Donald Trump justified the action with a promise to revive Venezuela’s moribund oil industry. The country has by far the largest claimed reserves of crude oil in the world, accounting for almost a fifth of the planet’s remaining known crude oil, but its production has plummeted under Maduro, who has ruled the country since 2013.
“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” Trump said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in which he announced Maduro’s capture.
This intervention comes at a pivotal moment for the global oil industry, which continues to stare down the prospect of a broad transition to renewable energy. For this reason, it’s not obvious that future markets can justify a surge of investment in Venezuela. On one hand, the country’s extra-heavy crude oil is perfect for diesel and jet fuel, which are helpful in hard-to-decarbonize industries. This makes it less threatened by the meteoric rise of electric vehicles displacing gasoline-powered cars. On the other hand, the world is already experiencing an overall glut of oil, and analysts expect demand to peak in the next decade. While there are buyers for additional oil that could be pumped in Venezuela — some of them on the U.S. Gulf Coast — experts say a total revival on the order that Trump is promising may not be in the cards.
“There’s a guaranteed market for it, but a market that has its limitations in size,” said Antoine Halff, the founder of the climate and data analysis firm Kayrros and a nonresident fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.
As electric vehicles and renewable energy continue to expand, the world appears to be approaching a peak in oil demand. While the exact timing of that peak is disputed — it could happen within four years or in more than 15 years — almost all analysts agree that it is coming. At that point, there may no longer be sufficient demand to keep exploiting new oil fields, no matter how large. And given that it will take many years just to update the infrastructure that will allow for increased oil production in Venezuela in the first place, investors may decide that the juice is not worth the squeeze.
Then there’s the matter of predicting future prices in a notoriously volatile industry. Oil companies only make a profit when global oil prices stay above a certain level. For the U.S. companies that produce oil from Texas shale, for example, that number is around $60 a barrel, which is close to the current benchmark price. For Saudi Arabia, it’s closer to $90 a barrel, because oil revenues back almost all the kingdom’s government spending. In the newest oil fields, such as those offshore of Guyana, it’s as low as $30. There are already concerns that an oversupply of oil worldwide could send prices tumbling over the next year, making new fields less palatable to investors. If demand plateaus, a surge of Venezuelan crude would push prices even further down. Since Venezuela is a member of OPEC, it would have to coordinate production along with Saudi and other major producers, who would likely prevent Venezuela from flooding the market.
Even so, there will likely be long-term demand for the specific kind of oil that Venezuela produces. That’s because any energy transition will not happen at equal speed across all parts of the transportation sector. The expansion of electric vehicles will first replace passenger cars and mopeds, which rely on lighter oil from fields like those of the Texas shale. Larger vehicles like airplanes and heavy-duty trucks are harder to replace — they need more power than EV batteries can feasibly provide at present — and they rely on heavy oil like Venezuela’s. A report from the oil trading firm Vitol found that “the initial pace of decline [for diesel] is expected to be slow compared to gasoline, but begins to gather pace from 2035 onwards.” Few other countries boast the same kind of extra-heavy reserves that Venezuela has, and those that do, like Canada, have much higher production costs.
“These are the hard-to-abate segments,” said Halff. “It’s the part of oil demand that looks like it’s not going to shrink quickly.”
Venezuela pumped more than 3 million barrels of oil per day at the turn of the century, but production totals have plummeted since then. After the government of Hugo Chávez nationalized major oil infrastructure in 2007, the United States imposed financial sanctions that forced Venezuela to sell its oil at steep discounts. Under the Maduro government, the state-owned oil company racked up debts and saw an exodus of skilled workers. Pumps and pipelines decayed out of service, storage tanks collapsed, and production bottomed out at around 500,000 barrels per day during the COVID-19 pandemic.
President Trump has promised that his aggressive raid on Venezuela will lead to a revival of this industry, and he has reportedly urged U.S. oil producers to aid him in the effort. In remarks following the Maduro raid, he promised that American companies would return to Venezuela and help export oil to other countries. Given how inefficient the state-run oil sector has become, analysts believe it would be easy to restore some production in the short term with outside investment and sanctions relief.
“Our assumption is that there are a lot of wells that just need a workover,” said Adrian Lara, the lead analyst for the Latin American oil industry at the research firm Wood Mackenzie, in a brief published last month before Maduro’s capture. “You can boost production through opex [operational expenditure], without needing much new capex [capital expenditure]” — in other words, a tune-up rather than a full surge of new investment.
In the short term, there is ample demand. The oil in the country’s vast Orinoco Belt is very heavy and viscous, like molasses, in contrast to U.S. shale oil, which is about as thin as vinegar. This makes it more expensive and more carbon-intensive to produce, but also makes it well suited for conversion into diesel fuel in trucks and for other uses like asphalt. There are several refineries along the Gulf Coast that were built to process this kind of heavy crude, and these refineries are operating below capacity. Right now, Venezuela exports most of its oil to China, which would also likely purchase more for its own refineries. An industry expert who spoke to The Wall Street Journal said access to those reserves could be a “game changer” in terms of increasing Gulf Coast refiners’ profits.
“Right now there’s plenty of appetite for heavy crude globally,” said Robert Auers, a refined fuels market analyst at the energy consultancy RBN Energy. “Even if Venezuelan production were to come back real strong, the global market could easily absorb that.”
But a grand revival like the one Trump has promised would be a much taller order, given that it would take decades to unfold. The energy analysis firm Rystad Energy projects that a return to pre-Maduro levels would require an investment of $110 billion, and these investments would not bear fruit for a decade or more. Even Chevron, the only U.S. oil producer that operates in the country, would need to invest an estimated $7 billion in order to add another 500,000 barrels, according to a former executive who spoke with The New York Times.
The climate pollution stemming from this crude might also play a factor in its market appeal. Right now, the heavy oil extraction in the Orinoco Belt is some of the most carbon-intensive in the world, in part because enormous amounts of methane are flared during the process. As governments continue to pursue Paris Agreement targets, however fitfully, they might shy away from such fields wherever possible and instead import lower-carbon barrels. (The European Union has already committed to do this.) Many experts believe that oil majors will hesitate before taking the plunge on a resource that is far tougher to handle than the crude in U.S. shale fields or the Middle East.
That’s all in addition to the political uncertainty that has followed Trump’s attempt to depose Maduro. It remains unclear what shape the new government of Venezuela will take. Given that other producers like Exxon Mobil lost billions of dollars when the Chávez government nationalized their assets, it’s far from obvious that these oil companies would want to invest under continued political instability. Past U.S. interventions have demonstrated similar dynamics: Oil production in Libya has still not recovered since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, and it took almost a decade for Iraqi oil production to rebound after the U.S. invaded in 2003.
“I do not believe in a significant increase in the short term,” said Rudolf Elias, chair of the supervisory board of Staatsolie, the state oil company of Suriname, which is pursuing an offshore oil project in the waters east of Venezuela. “It will take years before the industry is revived … then it is dirty oil, and heavy, so it will not be first in the row.”

(Photo by Julie O'Donoghue/LAI)More than half of adults in Louisiana have experienced physical violence during their lifetime but what those acts look like largely depends on the victim’s gender, according to an annual survey conducted last year. 
In Louisiana, gun violence is much more likely to be carried out against men, while severe  intimate partner violence — sometimes referred to as domestic abuse — is much more likely to happen to women, showed the result of a study by Tulane University, the University of California San Diego and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
“Violence is a gendered issue. It is different if you are a man or a woman or a boy or a girl,” Anita Raj, executive director of the Newcomb Institute at Tulane University and the study’s lead author, said in an interview. 
Raj’s survey, the Louisiana Study on Violence Experiences Across the Lifespan, is the only comprehensive research of its kind conducted in the state. It was administered online in English and Spanish between May 13 and June 18, 2025, to more than 1,000 Louisiana residents 18 and older. 
The survey shows Louisiana residents experience violence at an alarmingly high rate. Eight percent of people surveyed said they were subjected to physical violence in the past year, including 3% who said they were threatened with either a knife or a gun.

Who commits the violence and what form it takes largely depends on the victim’s gender. 

Over half of women (58%) who had experienced physical violence within a year of the survey reported their spouse or partner were responsible for the incidents, compared with just 14% of men. Most men (53%) who had experienced physical violence in that time period said they were targeted by a stranger, compared with just 5% of women, according to the report. 
Men were much more likely to be subjected to gun violence than women, however; 4% of men reported they had been threatened or attacked with a gun in the year before the survey was taken, compared with just 1% of women, according to the report.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Yet women (13%) were more likely to experience sexual harassment and sexual violence than men (6%). Almost one in four women (23%) surveyed also said they had been subjected to forced sex during their lifetimes, compared with 7% of men. 
Severe intimate partner violence, sometimes called domestic violence, was also much more prevalent for women. 

Almost 25% of women reported they had been subjected to potentially lethal forms of intimate partner violence — such as choking, suffocation, burns, beatings and use of a weapon — during their lifetimes. Only 6% of men reported being the victims of life-threatening violence from a spouse or dating partner. 
Mariah Wineski, executive director of the Louisiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said the study’s findings align with what domestic violence shelters and other victim advocacy groups see on a daily basis. 

“Many times, the most dangerous place for a woman is in her home or in her relationship,” Wineski said. 

Intimate partner violence is more widespread among younger people. Twelve percent of respondents who are 18-24 years old and 15% of those ages 25-34 experienced violence and controlling behavior from a partner in the year before the survey was taken. Only 1-2% over people 55 and older reported the same problem. 
Raj and Wineski said prevention programs aimed at reducing intimate partner violence need to start with adolescents in order to have the greatest impact. 
“It is much more effective to change the attitudes and beliefs of a child or adolescent,” Wineski said. “They are at a better place in their lives for learning all sorts of new things, including how to interact with other people.”
Programs that promote economic stability and lift people out of poverty also help curb violence, according to Raj’s report.

From the newsroom of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee: “U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho., and Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., recently introduced the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Price Transparency and Accountability Act to fix market distortions and increase transparency in federal prescription drug programs to lower patient costs at the pharmacy counter.”
This is a bipartisan attempt to bring down the costs of prescription medications for patients in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
As background, manufacturers do not set the final price of their drugs. Pharmaceutical pricing goes through a series of steps before drugs actually reach patients. Depending on whether people buy their prescription drugs directly from a pharmacy or through their insurance, several transactions and multiple layers of profit are built into the system.
In general, manufacturers sell to wholesalers who then sell to pharmacies. Most, if not all, insurance companies use pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate the best pricing from manufacturers. Drug wholesalers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers provide a service, but this comes at an added cost to the consumer.
Wholesalers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers will argue that they obtain better prices from manufacturers, but these contracts and the supposed benefits are not transparent. Actual contract pricing and rebates are usually closely guarded and not readily available to the public
What is known is that Pharmacy Benefit Manager companies, in general, have higher profit margins than drug manufacturers. Drug wholesalers and pharmaceutical benefit managers may have a role in the drug market, but only if they add value for patients. Their contracts and pricing should be transparent, so consumers can decide the amount of value added.
According to the U.S. Senate Finance Committee’s press release, the PBM Price Transparency and Accountability Act would:

“Delink PBM compensation from their negotiated rebates to disincentivize PBMs from promoting higher-priced medications;
Increase PBM reporting requirements to Medicare Part D plan sponsors and to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and empower Part D plan sponsors to audit their PBM for compliance with contract requirements;
Reinforce existing requirements that plan sponsors contract with any willing pharmacy that meets their standard contract terms and conditions to better protect independent pharmacies in rural areas from practices that have contributed to widespread closures;
Require participation by retail community pharmacies in the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) survey, which would ensure accurate Medicaid payments to pharmacies; and
Mandate PBMs pass Medicaid payments directly to pharmacies to ensure transparent drug costs for states and taxpayers.”

The lack of price knowledge in our health care system is a fundamental problem for patients who want to make informed medical decisions. The Senate Finance Committee is to be congratulated for attempting to make Pharmacy Benefit Managers responsible for holding down pharmaceutical costs.
Hopefully, the full Senate will take up the legislation in a timely fashion.

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Specia to the SC Daily Gazette)Republicans appear to have narrowly held a state House seat representing Dorchester County in a special election a week ahead of the Legislature’s return.
Unofficial results show Republican Greg Ford just 21 votes ahead of Democrat Sonja Ogletree Satani.
With all 22 precincts reporting late Tuesday, Ford had 50.2% of the vote to Ogletree Satani’s 49.6%, sending the race to an automatic recount. In South Carolina, a recount is required if less than 1 percentage point separates the candidates.
The 3,442 ballots cast represented 14% of the district’s registered voters. Special elections are typically low-turnout races. But the results were surprisingly close for a seat that had long been considered safely Republican.
The special election was triggered by the departure of Rep. Chris Murphy. The former House Judiciary chairman submitted his resignation in August, but it didn’t take effect until Monday. The state law he cited in his “irrevocable resignation” allowed the special election timeline to proceed while he was still technically in office.
First elected in 2010, Murphy replaced GOP Rep. Annette Young, who didn’t seek re-election after 20 years in the House.
Both Ford and Ogletree Satani defeated two opponents in their primaries.
Once certified by the state Election Commission, the winner will face re-election in November for a full term.
Ogletree Satani previously ran against Murphy in 2024. That vote wasn’t nearly as close: Murphy won re-election by 14 percentage points.
Tuesday’s special election marked the fourth for a Statehouse seat since the 2025 legislative session ended.
Three elections were held Dec. 23, all in ruby red districts. In the only race that day with a Democrat on the ballot, Lexington County pastor John Lastinger won with 62% of the vote to replace ex-Rep. RJ May, who is set to be sentenced next week after pleading guilty to distributing videos of children being sexually abused.
In the Upstate, former Sen. Lee Bright returns to the seat he lost in 2016 representing parts of Spartanburg and Greenville counties; and Dianne Mitchell, a former teacher with the backing of the hardline Freedom Caucus, will represent a Greenville County seat in the House.
If the results in the Dorchester County race are finalized this week, the legislative session will start Tuesday with all 170 seats filled.

The shelter location will rotate between six churches over the next nine weeks. (Photo courtesy of Caroline Wilson) In Martinsburg, six churches are teaming up with a local nonprofit organization to shelter homeless people during the coldest weeks of the year. 
The Cold Weather Shelter officially opened Saturday at Christ Reformed United Church of Christ in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The location of the shelter will rotate each week to a different Martinsburg church over the next nine weeks. It will be open from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. 
“Right now we’ve got six churches covering the nine weeks,” said Caroline Wilson, a social worker for WVU Medicine and one of the shelter project’s organizers. “So everything gets in the back of the truck on Saturday and goes to the next place.”
Shelter coordinator Hannah Cooper said as of Monday, the shelter had housed eight people. Staff expect more people in the coming days as word about the shelter spreads. 
“We’ve had quite a few individuals come in, and we’ve been able to help them in numerous ways, not only just having them stay there overnight, but also connecting them with the appropriate referral services for some needs they have,” Cooper said. 
The shelter will be staffed and operated by the Martinsburg Initiative. It will house up to 20 people per night. While the Eastern Panhandle has homeless shelters, Wilson said this one will be different because it won’t require people to participate in any programs in order to use the shelter. It will be open to anyone age 18 and order.

Wilson said a warming center or winter shelter was identified as a community need three years ago, and the shelter finally came to fruition this year. 
“The fact is, even though we do have some housing resources, there are still people sleeping outside,” Wilson said. “So we identified that we needed something that was low-barrier that people could go to when it was cold. Because we’ve had deaths across the state over the past few years, not a lot, but some people have died out in the cold. And we would definitely not want to see that happen here.”
Wilson said the project gained momentum when she connected with the Martinsburg Initiative and Rev. Sherry Miller, pastor of St. John’s Lutheran Church in Martinsburg. 
“Basically about six months or so ago we were able to form the right team of one nonprofit executive director, which is Margaret from the Martinsburg initiative, one pastor who was really passionate about this project, which is Sherry Miller, and then me, a social worker who was really passionate about homelessness,” Wilson said. “And so we kind of started working on this and pulling in churches and working towards funding and all of that.”
Miller said she’s wanted to find a way for her church to house homeless people since a 17-degree day during her first winter with the congregation, three years ago. 
Miller pulled in support from the churches, and the Martinsburg Initiative took on the staffing, insurance and liability needed for the shelter. 
“It really has just been amazing how this team of three have been able to get this off and running,” Miller said. 
The WATTS shelter in Winchester, Virginia and one in Charles Town — both that rotate between churches — became the models for Martinsburg’s cold weather shelter project, she said. 
The project is funded by the city of Martinsburg and has received other grants. 
Miller said the key to getting churches on board was having the nonprofit organization running the shelter take on the associated liability. Many parishes have older buildings that people put lots of time and energy into to take care of them, she said.
“The first thing is that the nonprofit status is through the Martinsburg Initiative, so that once they come into a church, then the church has no liability, because the nonprofit takes over,” Miller said. “And so that is the first hurdle for churches. And I really try to make sure that they’re aware of that.”
Miller said she also encourages churches to participate in order to fulfill Jesus’ command to care for their neighbors. Homelessness has increased in West Virginia and in the United States in recent years. Miller said the number of homeless people is only going to increase as the cost of living and rent increases, she said.

“We need to love our neighbor and support those who are marginalized, and churches need to get back to the basics on that,” she said. 
Wilson said she hopes other communities can adopt the same rotating location model. 
Cooper said it may take several volunteers to change locations each week, but she’s prepared to have as many or few who show up. 
“It’s just, how easy is it going to make it for the people that are moving the shelter every week and how fatigued they may get from doing it,” she said. “So I really want to have that nice range of volunteers so nobody gets overly fatigued trying to work it all by themselves.”
The shelter is also looking for volunteer help with laundry each week, she said.

(Photo: Gabrielle Nelson/Buffalo’s Fire)Tennessee soybean farmers are still facing tough decisions ahead of the next growing season as they await aid from the federal government meant to offset substantial losses from 2025. 
Stefan Maupin, executive director of the Tennessee Soybean Promotion Council, described 2025 as a “trifecta” of inflation, extreme weather and unstable trade amid tariff negotiations. The University of Tennessee estimated in August that the state’s soybean farmers would see a combined $110 million in losses in 2025.
Disruption of trade with China, the number one purchaser of U.S.-grown soybeans in the world, ratcheted up pressure on soybean producers nationwide. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is expected to start issuing one-time assistance payments at the end of February for commodity crop farmers who experienced trade market disruptions and increased production costs.
Eligible soybean farmers will receive $30.88 per acre, with a limit of $155,000 per producer. The USDA is also issuing payments for multiple other commodity crops based on acreage. The department released payment rates for each eligible crop on Dec. 31.
“Farmers are very appreciative of this, and we believe it’s a good first step, but overall, the payments will not make up for the losses,” Maupin said. “The inflation in the input products has still driven all of the cost to put in a crop to extremely high levels. The prices have improved on soybeans some, but certainly not to the levels they were before 2024.”
This means soybean farmers are, for now, still anticipating losing money on each acre they plant, he said.
Maupin has heard of some farmers who decided not to put in a crop this year, and many are still trying to make decisions for the upcoming season.
“The farmers, being the eternal optimists that they are, are hoping that they will have a good growing season and that the yields of their crops will be high and that they will help compensate for these high input costs and moderate prices,” Maupin said.
But another tough year may be too much to weather.
“There will be farmers that financially can try one more year, and they’ve indicated that they will, but that’s just not the case for everybody,” he said.
Farmer Bridge Assistance program
The USDA’s Farmer Bridge Assistance program will pay out up to $11 billion to producers of specific row crops at a per-acre rate:

Barley: $20.51
Canola: $23.57
Chickpeas (Large): $26.46
Chickpeas (Small): $33.36
Corn: $44.36
Cotton: $117.35

Safflower: $24.86
Sesame: $13.68
Sorghum: $48.11
Soybeans: $30.88
Sunflower: $17.32
Wheat: $39.35

The remaining $1 billion will be reserved for specialty crops, sugar and other commodities not covered in the Farmer Bridge Assistance program.
Payments are calculated using farmers’ 2025 planted acreage reports. To be eligible, producers must have an adjusted gross income less than $900,000. 
The USDA will begin issuing payments on Feb. 28.

(Photo: Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Tennessee’s infant mortality rate has dipped since 2019 but remains significantly and persistently higher than the national average, a new report published by the state’s health department found.
Black families in Tennessee continue to experience the heartbreak of losing a baby in the first year of life at twice the rate of white families, a stubborn disparity linked to maternal health, preterm births and access to prenatal care, among other factors. 
West Tennessee had some of the highest rates of infant mortality: 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births. Knox County had the lowest at 3.4 deaths per 1,000 live births. 
Overall, Tennessee’s infant mortality rate of 6.5 deaths per 1,000 live births was 16% higher than the national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000 live births. The report focuses on 2023 birth outcomes.
The 2023 infant deaths were largely a result of medical conditions, including preterm and low-birth-weight deliveries, and congenital disease. 
But unsafe sleeping practices, such as putting a baby to sleep on its belly, outside of a crib or bassinet or with blankets and stuffed animals that can potentially lead to suffocation, remained a significant factor in infant deaths. Sleep-related deaths claimed the lives of one in four babies between 2019 and 2023, the report found. Nearly four in five sleep-related deaths were deemed “preventable” by teams of experts who review child deaths.
The report makes a series of recommendations to combat Tennessee’s high rates of infant deaths. They include promoting safe sleep practices, smoking cessation programs and increasing awareness of prenatal services offered by public health departments.

(Photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)It has been a difficult year for Maryland businesses. This is especially true for the many businesses that do business with the federal government. They have faced disruptions caused by federal reductions in force (RIFs) as well as sweeping changes in federal contracting and procurement policies. Companies have also been affected by an increase in tariff rates. And some state taxes have increased as well.
I and my colleagues have just completed a detailed survey to assess where Maryland businesses stand as we head toward the end of 2025. The survey asked respondents about this past year’s performance relative to 2024, their outlook over the next six months, the impact of federal policy changes, and their views of Maryland as a place to do business. Respondents also provided open-ended comments, and these attest to the very human costs behind the topline findings.
Overall, the survey paints a picture of a business community under pressure from rising costs and shifting federal and trade policies. Performance in 2025 was weaker than in 2024 for about half the firms in our sample of more than 90 companies. Still, many are cautiously optimistic about the next six months.
Rising costs remain a major challenge: roughly 80% of respondents reported higher costs, and most expect the trend to continue. These cost pressures have translated into higher prices. When asked to identify the most significant challenge of 2025, respondents highlighted rising costs, federal policy disruptions, and weak sales. As one put it, “The Maryland economy now faces unprecedented challenges and struggle, compounded by electricity price surges and costs.”

Views of writers are their own.




Federal policy changes have been especially disruptive. Many firms – particularly those heavily involved in federal contracting – reported negative impacts from RIFs and from changes in procurement and contracting policies. Staffing cuts have delayed payments and created administrative bottlenecks. One firm noted: “Contract officers are untrained, payments for services rendered are delayed, putting financial strain on small businesses.”
In some cases, contracts, grants and anticipated solicitations have been canceled altogether: “Federal contracting has almost completely dried up for us. Option years have been canceled or significantly de-scoped for most of our multi-year contracts.” However, a small number of respondents did report positive outcomes, most often in the aerospace and defense sector.
Other policy-related impacts also surfaced in the comments. The termination of programs supporting minority and economically disadvantaged businesses, as well as environmental initiatives, was noted repeatedly. One firm wrote: “We feel as if we are now working against our own federal government, which is trying to kill the solar industry.” Another pointed to the erosion of protections for socially/economically disadvantaged and minority-owned businesses. Respondents also highlighted a trend toward contract bundling – the practice of combining multiple contracts into fewer, larger awards – which tends to favor large firms over small.
Trade policy has introduced its own set of pressures for firms. Many companies reported that new tariffs have raised the cost of imported inputs and reduced supply chain reliability, although a few cited benefits from reduced foreign competition. Firms reported shifting sourcing countries, moving from international to domestic suppliers, and stockpiling critical inputs to manage disruptions.
Finally, we asked about Maryland’s business environment. Many firms view it unfavorably, and some reported having considered relocating to another state. High taxes, high operating costs, and housing affordability were top concerns. One respondent captured the sentiment bluntly: “Maryland is not a business-friendly state. We are at the point we can no longer afford the taxes that continue to go up and up.”
The recent increase in the sales and use tax on data and IT services was cited by several firms: “The 3% Technology Tax makes it difficult to compete with firms in VA, DE, and PA that do not have such a burden.” If there is a silver lining, it is that minority-owned businesses were somewhat less likely to view Maryland as unhospitable.
The survey does not suggest a uniformly dire situation, and many firms remain optimistic about the months ahead. Maryland’s talent base and proximity to federal agencies continue to be viewed as advantages. However, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the state has pressing structural issues that require urgent attention. Maryland businesses also need to adapt to a new reality of changed federal policies and priorities. Our finding that policy disruptions are hitting some firms much harder than others points to how support can be appropriately targeted while firms adjust to the new reality.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/open-1.jpg,,,2026-01-07 09:13:08.480832

(Getty Images)The board that regulates optometrists in Kentucky has filed emergency regulations to address exemptions from licensure requirements it improperly granted some optometry graduates in recent years.
But the Dec. 31 regulations, which took effect immediately, are drawing fire from critics who say they do nothing to explain the past actions of the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners or address whether optometrists who were exempted from mandatory exams are qualified to continue providing eye care to patients.
“Our focus has always been on patient safety,” Dr. Jill Bryant, executive director of the National Board of Examiners in Optometry, or NBEO, said in an email. “We are deeply concerned that the people of Kentucky are still receiving treatment from improperly licensed optometrists who have never demonstrated that they can successfully pass national competency assessments — and, in some instances, have repeatedly failed those assessments.”
The regulation allows any optometry graduate from 2020-2023 who has not passed all required licensure exams to do so by 2027. 
The board began granting waivers to testing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing travel and other restrictions. It continued to approve exemptions after the COVID emergency had ended, including in December 2023.
The NBEO administers licensure exams for optometry graduates in all 50 states. The Kentucky Lantern reported in December that the national board had identified 21 optometrists in Kentucky who had gained licenses from 2020 through 2023 without passing “one or more” parts of the three-part national exam then required by state law.
Among them was Dr. Hannah Ellis, the daughter of former board president Dr. Joe Ellis, a prominent Kentucky optometrist active in state and national optometry circles. He abruptly resigned from the board last month and has not responded to requests for comment.
Several of the optometrists who had not met all requirements, including Hannah Ellis, were graduates of the University of Pikeville College of Optometry, which opened in 2016 as Kentucky’s only optometry school.
Patient safety ‘forgotten?’
The state board has not responded to multiple requests for comment from the Lantern and has made little public comment apart from two brief statements on its website, the most recent  announcing the emergency regulations.
The board “feels strongly that all licensees should possess the skills and knowledge to be granted a license,” the Dec. 31 statement said in part.
Questionable testing waivers put KY’s licensing of optometrists under scrutiny

But the emergency regulations fall short of that goal, according to the Kentucky Academy of Eye Physicians and Surgeons, which represents medical doctors who specialize in eye care. In a statement, it called for “full transparency” from the state board in addressing the matter.
“We are concerned that they do not have a plan to address the educational shortfalls of those optometrists who could not pass the nationally standardized licensure tests — at least some of whom are performing surgical procedures on Kentucky patients,” the academy said in a statement.
Optometrists hold a four-year doctorate of optometry degree and following a 2011 lobbying blitz at the Kentucky General Assembly, won a broad expansion of their scope of practice including the right to perform some eye surgeries. The NBEO has described it as “one of the broadest scopes of practice in the United States.”
Dr. William “Chip” Richardson, a Georgetown ophthalmologist and former president of the academy, said he is “frankly disheartened” by the board’s proposed solution that appears to allow optometrists who have not met professional standards to continue treating patients. He also believes the new regulations water down requirements.
“What’s sadly forgotten here is patient safety,” he said in an email.
‘Kind of puzzled’
A key legislator also wants further information from the state board, including why it granted exemptions for some candidates and whether they hold a valid license to treat patients.
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, (LRC Public Information)
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield and chair of the Senate Health Services Committee, said he expects to seek answers from the board through his committee during the legislative session that convened Tuesday.
“I’m still kind of puzzled by it all,” Meredith said. “We need to know what’s going on.”
Meredith sought the Oct. 1 Kentucky attorney general’s opinion that found the state board circumvented state law by authorizing exemptions for licensure through board actions rather than through enacting new regulations.
It directed the board to review the licensure of all optometrists granted licenses with such exemptions.
Meredith said he’s also concerned that the former board president’s daughter was among those granted exemptions and plans to inquire about that.
“That’s obviously a conflict of interest,” he said.
The emergency regulations state they are in response to the attorney general’s opinion. 
It found that the board “acted beyond its authority” in waiving some requirements for licensure, instead allowing “alternative testing” it did not detail. The opinion added that “any person who applied for a license to practice optometry using the waiver and alternative testing did not comply with the relevant regulations.”
While the board has acknowledged waiving Part 3 of the exam, an in-person testing of clinical skills with patients — citing restrictions of the pandemic — it has remained silent about any other exemptions.
The Lantern identified at least six instances when the board acted on exemptions to testing — including an apparent decision in December 2023, after the COVID emergency had ended — to waive Part 1 of the exam.
Board minutes state without elaboration that some optometry school graduates unable to pass Part 1 “will be allowed licensure with additional educational requirements.” Part 1, which focuses on science and medical knowledge, is considered the hardest of the exam’s three parts.
Last year, the state board enacted a regulation allowing Kentucky licensure candidates to substitute the Canadian exam, considered easier to pass, saying in written comments that some optometry graduates were unable to pass Part 1 of the national exam.
 Duty to ‘protect the public’

The new regulations state that optometry graduates from 2020 through 2023 must show that they have passed either Part 1 of the national exam or the Canadian exam before they renew their licenses in 2027.

Also, they must pass Part 2 of the national exam, which tests a candidate’s skills at diagnosis and treatment.
And they must pass either Part 3 of the national exam, which tests how well a candidate performs in treating people posing as patients — or it allows for candidates to pass a new, Kentucky version of the test to be developed specifically for those candidates previously exempted.
 The emergency regulations say that all affected licensees will be notified by Jan. 15 of the requirements.
The Kentucky Optometric Association released a statement in support of the new regulation but called for the changes to be implemented “in a transparent manner to ensure that public safety and licensee qualifications are never called into question.”
The board’s Dec. 31 statement provides no details of how the board reached a decision, developed the emergency regulations or whether it took a vote on them.
The board met in December but made no public comment or what members discussed in a closed session. 
It has never responded to the NBEO which in a May 23, 2025 letter said that it had identified 21 optometrists in Kentucky who appear to have been granted a license without having passed “one or more” parts of the three-part national exam.
The Dec. 31 statement on the Kentucky board’s website said the board acknowledged it did not use the “correct regulatory process” during the COVID-19 emergency when it temporarily waived the requirement that candidates pass Part 3 of the national exam. It makes no mention of waiving Part 1.
However, all candidates seeking to renew licenses must show by 2027 that they have met all requirements, it said, stating:
“The duty of the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners is to license qualified optometrists as well as protect the public, and the current board members are committed to executing this responsibility.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2210182104-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 05:56:55.245249

(Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources)A Wisconsin Assembly committee held a public hearing Tuesday on a bill that would require the state to hold an annual hunt of sandhill cranes. 
The sandhill crane was once nearly extinct and its recovery is seen as a conservation success story. Similar to the return of the wolf, the growth of the sandhill crane population has caused a long running political debate in Wisconsin. For years, Republicans in the Legislature have been pushing for a sandhill crane hunt — arguing the opening of recreational opportunities would benefit the state’s hunting industry and advocating for eating the birds’ meat. 
The proposal this session stems from a legislative study committee commissioned last summer which examined how to mitigate damage caused by the birds to the state’s farm fields and the possibility of holding a hunt. Estimates say that each year the birds cause almost $2 million in crop damage, mostly to corn seeds that are eaten before they can sprout. 
In the initial version of the bill proposed by the study committee, a number of provisions were included that would have directly addressed the crop damage. If a sandhill crane hunt is authorized, that would allow farmers to access money through an existing Department of Natural Resources damage abatement program, but otherwise all the farm-specific provisions have been removed from the version of the bill now being considered by the Assembly. 
If a bird is frequently damaging a farmer’s crops, a depredation permit is obtainable from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, however federal law requires that the bird’s carcass not be consumed. 
Rep. Paul Tittl (R-Manitowoc), the bill’s author, said the bill is a “well thought out proposal to relieve farmers and promote new opportunities for hunters.” 
But Democrats on the committee and critics of the bill questioned why the specific farmer assistance programs were cut out, how a hunt would affect the crane population and how much establishing a hunt would cost the DNR. 
Rep. Vincent Miresse (D-Stevens Point) noted that the Republicans were simultaneously arguing that holding a hunt wouldn’t significantly impact the state’s crane population and that holding a hunt would help mitigate the crop damage caused by the birds. 
“If it’s not going to impact the population very much, then how do we protect farmers’ investment in seed and corn sprouts and potatoes and cranberries, if we’re not going to actually impact the population to the benefit of the farmer,” Miresse said. 
Taylor Finger, the DNR’s game bird specialist, said in his testimony that opening the existing crop damage abatement program up to sandhill crane damage without adding additional funds to the program would result in “worse outcomes for farmers seeking assistance.” 
Republicans on the committee largely questioned the testimony of sandhill crane researchers. Anne Lacy, director of eastern flyway programs at the Baraboo-based International Crane Foundation, said she is concerned about holding a hunt in Wisconsin because it is one of the few places on the continent where sandhill cranes breed. 
“I don’t think there is a [population] number that justifies a hunt,” Lacy said. “There are many states that hunt sandhill cranes, and they do it successfully. They’ve been managed for years, including this population. But Wisconsin is a breeding state, so that puts a different spin on a hunting season … So it’s not so much a number. It is how a hunt affects this bird because of its ecology.”
In an extended back and forth in which he raised his voice, Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) pushed Lacy to say she is supportive of sandhill crane hunts elsewhere. 
“All right, so I catch you dodging me, so therefore you do not personally support a hunt in any other state,” Sortwell said.

(Photo by Jesus Vargas/Getty Images)As Virginia lawmakers prepare to return to Richmond next week for the start of the 2026 General Assembly, Democratic officials across the state and congressional delegation are mounting a unified pushback against the U.S. military strike on Venezuela and the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro, while Republicans have largely praised the operation as a long-overdue show of force.
Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, plans to file legislation ahead of the session that would restrict the federal government from deploying the Virginia National Guard to overseas conflicts like Venezuela — or using Guard troops in American cities — without clear legal authorization. 
“I’m a big believer that the Virginia National Guard should be used to support U.S. national security, but not to suppress the will of Americans or to support reckless adventurers overseas,” Helmer told The Mercury Tuesday. 
Helmer’s proposal comes as Democrats argue the strike represents an unconstitutional expansion of presidential war powers, even as Republicans contend it removed a dangerous authoritarian leader and strengthened U.S. security.
President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that U.S. forces had captured Maduro during a military operation inside Venezuela and that the United States would oversee a transition period in the country. 
Trump said the U.S. would “run the country” during the transition, remarks that drew immediate scrutiny from lawmakers concerned about executive overreach.
The operation involved U.S. military strikes and a special forces mission to detain Maduro, who has long been indicted in the United States on drug trafficking and narco-terrorism charges.  
Administration officials defended the action as necessary to disrupt drug networks and hold Maduro accountable after years of authoritarian rule.
 Helmer cites Guard authority, Venezuelan community as concerns mount

Trump’s announcement sent shockwaves through Washington and state capitals alike, including in Virginia, which is home to more than 9,000 Venezuelans, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau estimates. 
Many in that community fled political repression, economic collapse and violence under Maduro’s government, and have been closely following developments in their home country. Over 7.9 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants have left the country “in search of protection and a better life,” according to UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.
Helmer, a former Army officer who served multiple tours in Iraq, said the strike underscores the need for states to assert their own authority when federal officials bypass Congress and governors in deploying National Guard troops.

His legislation, he said, is rooted in personal experience and concern about unchecked military deployments. 
“I lost friends in a war twice in Iraq because politicians lack the courage to stand up and stop a war of choice,” Helmer said, adding that Congress has too often failed to assert its authority before service members are put in harm’s way.
Helmer emphasized that his proposal would require a legal review of certain National Guard deployments, demand disclosure of their scope and justification, and allow the Virginia attorney general to intervene if a deployment is deemed unlawful. 
The bill would also prohibit the use of state resources to mobilize the Virginia National Guard against Virginians, against other states, or to influence elections, while stopping short of blocking Guard missions that clearly serve U.S. national security interests.
He said the measure is designed to place guardrails within existing federal law and Supreme Court precedent, giving states greater leverage to challenge what he called reckless or politically motivated uses of military force.
 Democrats cite constitutional limits, warn of escalation

Virginia’s congressional Democrats echoed Helmer’s concerns, framing the Venezuela strike as part of a broader pattern of unilateral military action.
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, who has spent years pressing Congress to reclaim its constitutional role in authorizing war, condemned the strike as a return to failed interventionist policies.
“President Trump’s unauthorized military attack on Venezuela to arrest Maduro — however terrible he is — is a sickening return to a day when the United States asserted the right to dominate the internal political affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere,” Kaine said in a statement.
Kaine warned that bypassing Congress makes it harder for the United States to demand respect for its own sovereignty and questioned where such actions could lead. He said it was “long past time” for Congress to reassert its authority over matters of war and peace.
Alongside Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Ca., Kaine filed a War Powers Resolution last month, seeking to block U.S. military hostilities against Venezuela without congressional authorization. That resolution is expected to come up for a vote next week.
U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said the decision to use military force for regime change demands “the closest scrutiny,” particularly given the global implications.
Warner said that while Maduro is a corrupt authoritarian who has repressed his people and overseen stolen elections and mass displacement, those facts do not grant the president authority to ignore constitutional limits.
“If the United States asserts the right to use military force to invade and capture foreign leaders it accuses of criminal conduct, what prevents China from claiming the same authority over Taiwan’s leadership?” Warner said, warning that such precedents invite instability and abuse by authoritarian regimes.

Warner also criticized what he called hypocrisy in the administration’s approach, noting that Trump recently pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted in a U.S. court on serious drug trafficking charges, while claiming similar allegations justified military force in Venezuela.
In the House, U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, said he was “deeply concerned” by reports of U.S. military strikes and the capture of a foreign head of state.
Scott said the administration has yet to identify a clear legal basis for its actions in Venezuela or explain how long U.S. involvement could last.
“Escalating military action inside a sovereign country without congressional authorization raises serious questions under both U.S. and international law,” Scott said, adding that military force is among the least effective ways to address drug trafficking compared with education, prevention and addiction treatment.
U.S. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, a ranking member of the Military and Foreign Affairs Oversight Subcommittee, said the administration’s actions amounted to illegal regime change rather than a legitimate counter-drug effort.
“President Trump said he’d be the ‘Peace President’ and wouldn’t start any new wars, and yet here he is illegally invading another country and kidnapping its President,” Subramanyam said, warning the move could lead to prolonged instability and another “forever war.”
 Republicans praise strike, with some urging caution

Republicans in Virginia largely offered a sharply different assessment, praising the operation as decisive and long overdue.
U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, whose district includes a large military population, said the operation demonstrated American resolve.
“The strength of the United States is rooted in the courage and dedication of the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces. That strength was on full display,” Kiggans said, thanking U.S. service members for carrying out what she described as a precise and successful mission to apprehend Maduro and disrupt narcotics trafficking.
U.S. Rep. John McGuire, R-Goochland, a former Navy SEAL, also celebrated the strike, linking it to domestic concerns about drug overdoses and border security. He said Venezuela had become a proxy for U.S. adversaries and a source of instability that harmed American communities.

Outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin praised Trump’s leadership in a post on X, formerly Twitter, saying accountability for Maduro’s abuses “protects Americans first and foremost” and strengthens democracy and security across the Western Hemisphere.
Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is also set to leave office next week, welcomed Maduro’s arrest, writing that it was “wonderful for the Venezuelan people” to see their leader detained after years of economic collapse under socialist rule.
But not all Republicans were unequivocal in their support. 
U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, compared the situation to the 1990 U.S. capture of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega but cautioned against open-ended military engagement.
“I am concerned about U.S. military intervention in foreign countries because of its potential to lead to protracted U.S. engagement,” Griffith said, adding that he would seek more information about future U.S. involvement and insist on congressional oversight.
With the General Assembly set to convene and Congress preparing to vote on war powers, Helmer’s legislation and Kaine’s resolution are set to test how much appetite there is to rein in presidential authority, amid Republican praise for what they describe as a decisive show of American strength.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)As state lawmakers prepare to reconvene in Richmond for the 2026 legislative session next week, Virginia is also working to reduce its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) error rate or risk losing its federal funding, while also now verifying recipients’ eligibility — which levies more work onto already-strained health and social service systems. They also must contend with forthcoming changes to Medicaid eligibility. 
Social services staffers around Virginia have for years grappled with outdated technology and are now preparing for extra workloads; a new bill could spur upgrades that might help.
Here’s what Virginia is doing so far to reduce its SNAP error rate

House Bill 66 by Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, would direct the Department of Medical Assistance Services and the Department of Social Services to modernize the information technology they use to provide social and medical programs to Virginians. 
While the federal shifts make it timely, the departments’ old tech isn’t a new issue. The Virginia Case Management System (VaCMS) — first built in the 1990s — is outdated, a 2024 state-commissioned study revealed.
It’s also a concern Feggans heard last year from constituents as he served on a bipartisan committee to assess how the state could respond to federal cuts. 
The 2024 study noted delays or timeouts if more than a few hundred social services workers were processing cases simultaneously on VaCMS — a common occurrence, considering eligibility determination work is handled by hundreds of local social services workers around Virginia. 
“Poor user experience with VaCMS leads to the use of workarounds, further increasing variability in the process,” the report stated. 
The note of constraints with VaCMS was among “strong concerns” relayed by the Virginia League of Social Services Executives in feedback last summer to the state government, records obtained by The Mercury show. 
Smaller staff at local offices have also expressed worry about the extra work outlined in the reconciliation bill Congress passed last summer. The federal legislation spurs states to reduce their error rates for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits along with eligibility determination changes for both SNAP and Medicaid. 
While SNAP helps low-income people afford groceries, states that fail to reduce their error rates could be on the hook for millions that the federal government typically provides. Error rates — an overpayment or underpayment to beneficiaries — can stem from paperwork mistakes by social service workers or outdated information from recipients. About 850,000 Virginians rely on the program to feed their families. 
Medicaid is a joint state and federal program that provides health insurance coverage to about 1.9 million Virginians who live with disabilities, are pregnant or low-income earners without employer-provided coverage. Changes to Medicaid eligibility could likely affect about 630,000 of Virginians at risk of losing it and the expanded work load for social services workers, which Virginia’s Medicaid director told state lawmakers last summer will “be hard on them.” 
Slower and outdated technology can  increase margins for human error and make it harder for Virginia to meet the federal mandates. 
Feggans said it’s important for state lawmakers to “make sure that we can take care of as many people as we can in the state with so many cuts coming from the federal government.”
The state government should invest in a new IT system to counteract these challenges, Feggans added. Prior to his service in the legislature, Feggans worked in health care technology for the U.S. Air Force. He “knows what it means” to have systems that are efficient. 
As the bill must advance through the legislature in order to end up on Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s desk, Feggans said he plans to work with his fellow lawmakers to sort out how feasible the upgrades may be and at what cost. Amid continued federal funding and service cuts, Feggans emphasized how careful Virginia must be with its resources while still being able to “take care” of constituents.
“The next few years are going to be about austerity,” he said.

Mike DeWine and the head of the state’s Department of Children and Youth say they’ve engaged with the Trump administration to prove Ohio’s child care system is heavily safeguarded and worthy of federal funding.
DeWine and department Director Kara Wente said they haven’t received final word that they will continue receiving federal funding for the Publicly Funded Child Care program, but the state has eight to 10 weeks before “that would be problematic for the program we have now,” according to Wente.
“Certainly we know that we need the federal funds to maintain our program as is,” Wente said in a Monday news conference with DeWine.
“We know that we are moving on every measure that (the Trump administration) has outlined.”
The state leaders spoke to the media after allegations of child care fraud in Minnesota resulted in federal funding freezes for the state, ordered by Trump administration officials.
The allegations came from a right-wing social media influencer and focused on facilities run by Somali immigrants in the state. While the issue was covered extensively in 2022, the social media influencer’s latest allegations have brought it back to the forefront.
Minnesota child care providers say Trump’s funding freeze will shut down their businesses

Ohio, like Minnesota, has one of the largest Somali populations in the country, but DeWine said the conversation should be steered away from the type of citizens running the centers, and toward protecting the public from fraud.
“We need to look at this as not a Somali problem, we need to look at this as a fraud problem,” DeWine said.
The governor said the “vast majority” of the Somali population in Ohio “have been here for a long time.”
He wouldn’t speculate on whether race or ethnicity was playing into the accusations of fraud at child care facilities.
“Many of them are citizens, many of them run businesses,” DeWine said. “So we need to not fixate on any one population, we need to fixate on the problem.”

The state leaders responded to calls from Republican state Rep. Josh Williams, who took to social media to demand that the Ohio Department of Children and Youth “investigate all Columbus-area daycares suspected of potential fraud.”
“We need round-the-clock, unannounced inspections of all child care facilities receiving public dollars to make sure not a single Ohioan’s tax dollars are being stolen,” Williams wrote in a post on X.
Wente said on Monday that her office has been in contact with Williams, telling him the measures he asked for are already methods the department uses to oversee child care centers.
DeWine also decried efforts by public citizens to enter child care facilities, saying the safeguards that are in place at facilities include keeping those who don’t work there or have children in the care of the facility from coming in.
“The facts are there’s a reason that citizens who are going up to video something and trying to see what’s going on inside the doors aren’t being allowed in,” DeWine said, adding that it shouldn’t be a shock that those people are barred from entry.
“Well hell no, no one should let them in,” he said.
At Monday’s press conference, DeWine and Wente provided a lot of the information provided by the governor’s office last week in a press release responding to the Minnesota headlines, including specific measures the state takes to try to prevent and identify fraud in child care centers.
That includes attendance-based funding, identity verification at individual facilities via PINs and QR codes, and regular inspections.
Child care advocates also defended the state’s child care sector last week, and affirmed the governor’s defense that facilities undergo strict scrutiny.
Wente also provided data on 61 child care facilities who were ordered by the department to return overpayments.
In total, the overpayments amounted to “just over $2 million,” the director told reporters.
In 2025, the department received 124 reports from citizens alleging child care fraud.
DeWine remains confident that the Trump administration will review Ohio’s child care program and continue sending federal funding to the state.
“We have about eight weeks and we have every confidence this will get resolved, and the federal government will be satisfied with what we’re doing,” DeWine said.

There’s more to come in 2026. The lawsuits are part of a coordinated legal strategy by Democratic AGs in 22 states and the District of Columbia to resist the ever-widening power of the executive branch.
It’s not unusual for states to sue an administration; the party not in the White House has often turned to the courts. But it’s one of the few pathways for Democrats now, since Republicans hold the presidency, both chambers of Congress and have appointed a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court. And Trump in his second term has taken a much broader view of presidential power than previous administrations, asserting far more authority than his predecessors.
Democrats hope to retake at least one chamber of Congress in November’s midterm elections. But for most of the coming year, the party will be relying on AG court challenges as their main venue to take on Trump.
‘A boundless power’: Democratic states ask Supreme Court to halt Trump troop deployment to Chicago

One of the most prolific AGs is Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who has led or joined 52 lawsuits against this Trump administration.
“It’s not a slogan or a political brand,” Rayfield said of the coalition in an email interview with Stateline. “It’s a working partnership. When we coordinate, we’re able to defend the constitutional balance, push back when a president overreaches, and make sure our residents aren’t left paying the price for unlawful decisions coming out of Washington.”
The state AGs have brought cases over Trump’s tariffs and National Guard deployments. They’ve also fought cuts to federal research, education programs, food assistance, disaster recovery, health care and housing. And they say it’s their job to maintain core civil rights protections as well as stick up for the people in their state who, they argue, are harmed by the whims of the president’s executive orders.
“None of the institutions in our government have been built to respond and react to the scale and speed of the destruction that’s being wrought by the Trump administration,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez told Source New Mexico.
Since the beginning of 2025, the attorneys general have toured the country on multistate listening tours and have touted their accomplishments on progressive legal podcasts. They’ve won 40 of the 51 resolved cases, according to a tracker from the Progressive State Leaders Committee.
The AGs are not alone in taking legal action. Individuals, businesses, labor unions, associations, universities, local governments and other entities have filed 554 cases against the president’s expansion of executive branch powers, according to Just Security, a daily digital law policy journal with a litigation tracker that monitors challenges to Trump administration executive actions.
But the attorney general coalition serves as “a coordinated, quick-moving and high-capacity force protecting the rule of law, federal funding streams, and people’s rights,” said Jonathan Miller, chief program officer of the Public Rights Project, which helps state and local governments partner on litigation that protects and advances civil rights.










That’s the foundation for restoring faith in democratic institutions: making the legal system work the way it’s supposed to for the people it’s supposed to serve.


– Jonathan Miller, chief program officer of the Public Rights Project


The attorneys general have proven such a successful coalition that the Public Rights Project is adopting a similar approach that makes it easier for cities and counties to pool expertise, coordinate legal theories and act collectively, Miller said.
“The rule of law is ultimately about people,” Miller said. “When courts enforce the law, families stay housed, public health and emergency services stay open, and local leaders can govern without political coercion. That’s the foundation for restoring faith in democratic institutions: making the legal system work the way it’s supposed to for the people it’s supposed to serve.”
Immediate action
Democratic AGs began filing their multistate lawsuits the day after Trump took office, challenging the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The immediate legal action was intended to send a clear message to the Trump administration that state attorneys general will “stand up for our residents and their basic constitutional rights,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement at the time. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in the case this spring.
Rayfield said some days their work aims to build an emergency firewall to halt unlawful presidential actions — such as deploying the National Guard. Other days, it’s more targeted, fact-driven litigation designed to keep money, benefits and services flowing to states.
In December, Rayfield, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown led a coalition of 19 attorneys general and the governor of Pennsylvania in challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for threatening to punish doctors, hospitals and clinics that provide gender-affirming care.
Democratic AGs sue DOJ to receive federal funding for victims of violent crimes

In early November, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments from Oregon’s then-solicitor general, Benjamin Gutman, who argued on behalf of a coalition of a dozen states that sued over Trump’s sweeping tariff policy on most goods entering the United States. Rayfield and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes began discussing a tariff lawsuit in April, before a joint appearance at a town hall in Oregon. Both had been considering it, but it was their in-person discussion that led to the collaboration, Mayes said during a panel discussion hosted by the “Legal AF” podcast on the MeidasTouch Network.
“This is not what I get up every day wanting to do,” Mayes told Cronkite News outside the Supreme Court, after Gutman argued the tariff case. “But if Donald Trump decides to violate the Constitution, violate statute, or harm the people of Arizona, I’m going to file that lawsuit.”
After Trump’s 2024 election, Democratic attorneys general began meeting almost daily over Zoom to prepare their legal approach for a second term. This time around, they had a better sense for what was coming because it was outlined in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has shaped much of the Trump administration’s agenda so far.
As they enter their second year of legal collaboration, the AGs continue to meet regularly, but because they’ve developed close working relationships, it’s at a “more sustainable cadence,” Rayfield said.
Republicans sue, too
Republican attorneys general say they, too, are taking action to protect state sovereignty. Alaska Attorney General Stephen Cox wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post in November that lawsuits emerging from progressive states, particularly state- and municipal-driven cases in state courts over climate change, are “as much of a threat to state sovereignty as the federal government” as well as an attempt to “remake the nation in the image of progressive enclaves such as San Francisco and Portland, Oregon.”
“They reach into states like Alaska with their rules and regulations,” Cox wrote. “They push misguided legal theories targeting ordinary Americans. And they file lawsuits that would give state courts in ideologically aligned jurisdictions the chance to control the economies of states like mine.”
Republican attorneys general have been largely supportive of the president’s second-term agenda, including supporting the deployment of out-of-state National Guard troops to protect federal facilities. Led by Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, Republican attorneys general in 26 states sent a letter in support of such a mobilization in June in Los Angeles, describing it as “the right response — and one we fully support.” And as recently as October, Republican attorneys general in 16 states wrote a letter supporting the Trump administration’s attacks on boats it says are smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.
State attorneys general have long taken on the executive branch, no matter who was in power.
Democratic attorneys general filed 138 multistate lawsuits against federal agencies during Trump’s first administration, according to a 2020 assessment by Paul Nolette, a political scientist at Marquette University in Milwaukee.
And some Republican attorneys general were especially litigious during the Biden administration. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton famously sued the Biden administration 106 times, including a suit challenging the administration’s offshore drilling policy in the final days of the presidency. Paxton followed in the footsteps of his Republican predecessor, now-Gov. Greg Abbott, who sued the Obama administration 31 times as a Republican attorney general: “I go to the office. I sue the federal government. Then I go home,” he told The Dallas Morning News in 2012.
20 state AGs sue feds for tying transportation and disaster funding to immigration enforcement

Attorneys general in more progressive states say their actions during the current administration have kept their states from losing billions of dollars in federal funds that would have otherwise been blocked for schools, public health, domestic violence prevention and other services. In Oregon, it’s an estimated $4.5 billion, Rayfield said. Arizona estimates it has held on to $1.5 billion. In California, it’s $168 billion.
In Oregon, one of the lawsuit hearings this fall drew an audience so large that an overflow courtroom adjacent to a packed main federal courtroom was needed. A crowd quietly watched arguments on a video display as lawyers for the state of Oregon and the city of Portland argued that the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops was not only a vast federal overreach, but also a threat to state sovereignty and public safety.
The administration said it deployed the Guard to protect federal agents, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But when an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department described protesters as “vicious and cruel radicals” for their demonstrations outside of an ICE facility in Portland, the phrase elicited muffled snickers from the otherwise decorous courtroom observers.
Among the protesters dominating news reports and social media feeds was a 20-something in a chicken costume. Other peaceful protesters spawned a new symbol of resistance: inflatable frog costumes. And naked bike riders rolled up en masse to the ICE facility, too, braving a cold, wet day and exposure on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.”
But the issue in front of U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut was no laughing matter.
Oregon’s lawsuit challenging Trump’s National Guard deployment was a critical public safety outcome for the state, Rayfield said. It prevented troops from mobilizing in Portland, forestalling what he described as “the kind of escalation that could have caused real harm.”
Attorneys general are prepared in 2026 to monitor and enforce their courtroom victories, Rayfield said. He and other state officials and local prosecutors have warned U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that excessive force by DHS officers won’t be tolerated during immigration enforcement activities. If warranted, they’ll refer them for prosecution, he said.
“That isn’t just a legal win — it’s a safety win,” Rayfield said. “The president cannot use federalization as a shortcut to move troops into American cities without lawful cause. That matters for Portland, and it matters for every state watching what happened here.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Flu cases, hospitalizations are rising sharply in CT",Jenna Carlesso and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/ct-flu-cases-hospitalizations-rising/,"Flu cases in CT have increased dramatically over the last month, and officials say the surge in illnesses is happening earlier this year.","Flu cases in Connecticut have increased dramatically over the last month, and health officials say the surge in illnesses is happening earlier this season.
For the week ending Nov. 29, 831 cases were reported. A month later, during the week ending Dec. 27, the state recorded 4,755 cases.
The numbers are far higher than what was reported in December of last year. During the final week of 2024, the state logged 611 flu cases.
Hospitalizations are also on the rise. Seventy-three were reported during the week that ended on Nov. 29; a month later, the state reported 432 hospitalizations.
“Looking at the trajectory of our curve for the flu right now, it’s up,” Dr. Manisha Juthani, the state’s public health commissioner. “Unfortunately, I predict it’s going to be a tough winter. I don’t know where we’ll top out.”
“It’s definitely far earlier than last year,” she said of the surge in cases. “And would I say it’s maybe a little bit earlier than a typical flu season.”
The increase is not unique to Connecticut. Several other states have seen big jumps in cases this month. New York’s health department said the week ending Dec. 20 marked the most flu cases the state had recorded in a single week since 2004: 71,000.
“What everybody’s alarmed about right now is the rapid rise,” said Dr. Ulysses Wu, chief epidemiologist and system director for infectious diseases at Hartford HealthCare. “The mountain was much steeper in the sense that we went from basically zero to 60 in a matter of weeks.”
Why are cases and hospitalizations up?
Health officials say the rise in cases and hospitalizations is being driven by a new flu variant known as subclade K.
There are two subtypes of Type A flu, and subclade K is a mutated version of one of them, called H3N2. The H3N2 strain is harsh, especially for older adults.
“Any year where H3N2 predominates tends to be a worse year,” Juthani said.
Subclade K’s mutations aren’t enough of a change to be considered an entirely new kind of flu. But they’re different enough to evade some of the protection from this year’s vaccine, medical providers said.
“The mutations have made it more communicable. It’s basically new to our immune system, so that’s why it’s evading our immune system,” Wu said.
While the new variant appears to spread more quickly, it’s not yet known if it is more severe than others.
“It’s definitely more transmissible,” said Dr. Karl Hellstrand, chair of the emergency department at Saint Mary’s Hospital in Waterbury. “The strain is new, so people don’t really have any kind of protection from seeing it in the past.”
The symptoms of subclade K are similar to other variants, he said. They include fever, body aches, sore throat, lethargy and sometimes vomiting and abdominal pain.
Still, Juthani said, the flu vaccine is effective against hospitalization and death. 
“In data that we’re seeing published around the world, the flu shot is 70% protective for hospitalization and death in adults,” she said.
What concerns do health officials have?
Health officials said they worry about increasing vaccine hesitancy and capacity at hospitals this flu season.
“My biggest concern is capacity at the hospitals,” Juthani said. “I worry about hospital capacity, [intensive care unit] capacity, and the overall strain on the health care system.
“Whenever there is less confidence in prevention efforts and less uptake of prevention efforts, health care will see the consequences down the road. That’s what I’m bracing for — what we’re going to continue to see as the weeks unfold.”
With the flu surge arriving earlier this season, physicians said they are concerned that not enough people have been vaccinated.
“It kind of snuck up on us. And there is a significant percentage of people who have not gotten vaccinated,” said Dr. Christopher Davison, chair of emergency medicine at Greenwich Hospital. “If you have not gotten vaccinated, now is the time to do that.”
“The annual, seasonal concern we deal with, almost like clockwork, is busy emergency rooms in combination with hospitals at capacity,” he added. “It’s a challenging combination, but we work through it.”

What can people do to protect themselves?
Getting a flu shot, practicing good hygiene — frequently washing hands and covering coughs and sneezes — and masking in crowded spaces can help prevent illness, health officials said.
“The influenza vaccine, it may not be perfect, but it will help you,” Wu said. “We measure vaccine effectiveness for some of these diseases by keeping people out of the hospital. So, its job is to keep people out of the hospital. Even though people may think there’s a bit of a flu mismatch with the vaccine, it’s still very important to get it.”
While this year’s vaccine isn’t a perfect match to the subclade K strain, a preliminary analysis from the U.K. found it offered at least partial protection, lowering people’s risk of hospitalization.
The CDC and major medical societies recommend a flu vaccine for almost everyone age 6 months and older. Despite recent misinformation and confusion about vaccines, the flu recommendations haven’t changed.
Flu is particularly dangerous for people 65 and older, pregnant women, young children and people of any age who have chronic health problems, including asthma, diabetes, heart disease and weak immune systems.
Health officials are urging people to stay home if sick.
“If you’re sick, don’t get other people sick,” Wu said. “When people are sick and they’re going into work or going to a party or going to school, and they’re getting other people sick, that may be fine for some of the general population. But when you spread it to somebody who may not do well — let’s say I got you sick … you gave it to somebody else, and then that person gave it to their grandmother, who passed away — people don’t see that downstream effect.”
Most people can treat the symptoms of the flu at home, but issues like breathing problems and chest pain should be evaluated by medical providers, physicians said.
“If you’re having generalized symptoms but you’re able to stay hydrated and control fever and body aches with over-the-counter medications, you can probably continue to do that in conjunction with a primary care doctor,” Hellstrand said. “But once you start having worsening of symptoms, including not being able to drink and stay hydrated, significant respiratory distress or feelings like you can’t breathe, chest pain, vomiting — those are times when you probably need to escalate care by being seen in the hospital.”

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)A federal judge has allowed four New Hampshire residents to join a legal fight with the Trump administration over access to the state’s voter file.
Magistrate Judge Andrea Johnstone of the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire ruled Monday that the residents could join the Secretary of State’s Office in opposing efforts by the U.S. Department of Justice to force a handover of state voter information.
Moving forward, the residents — liberal activist Louise Spencer; former Republican state Rep. Neal Kurk; former Democratic state Rep. Bob Perry; and Portsmouth attorney Christopher Cole — will be treated as co-defendants against the federal lawsuit.
“Even assuming that the proposed intervenors’ interest is adequately represented by defendants, their presence in this suit will assist the court in the just and equitable adjudication of this matter,” Johnstone wrote. 
The Trump administration has been requesting states’ voter files this year, with the federal Department of Justice arguing it needs to make sure states are properly vetting voter eligibility. Justice Department attorneys say they are entitled to the information due to the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and the Civil Rights Act of 1960. 
But despite multiple requests by the Trump administration, New Hampshire Secretary of State Dave Scanlan has refused to provide the voter file, pointing to state law that restricts the file to political parties and candidates. 
In September, the Justice Department challenged Scanlan’s refusal in federal court in Concord. 
The lawsuit is still pending. But days after it was first filed, Spencer, Kurk, Perry, and Cole filed a motion seeking to intervene. 
The residents argued their privacy rights as voters were being directly threatened by the federal government’s attempt to obtain the voter file, which includes voters’ addresses and party affiliation and can include confidential information like Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers. And they said they needed to be represented as defendants because New Hampshire officials might otherwise attempt to strike a deal with the Trump administration that could violate residents’ privacy interests. 
After initially opposing the residents’ inclusion as co-defendants, Justice Department lawyers reversed course in December, telling the court it had “no position” on the matter. That reversal came days after the U.S. District Court of Michigan approved a similar request for two voters and the Michigan Alliance for Retired Americans to intervene as co-defendants with the state. 
In a statement Tuesday, Spencer said she was “pleased.” 
“It is important for New Hampshire voters to have an opportunity in court to advocate for our privacy rights and the security of our sensitive personal information,” she said. “We should not have to sacrifice our privacy rights when exercising our fundamental right to vote.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)In yet another sign of exploding inequality, a new data analysis finds that while affordability is an urgent issue for average Ohioans, the richest Americans keep getting richer. A lot richer.
The analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies said that the 935 billionaires in the United States saw their combined wealth grow by nearly 21% in 2025, to $8.1 trillion. The group used data from the Forbes Real Time Billionaires list to do the analysis. 
For comparison, the median family of four in Ohio saw its income increase less than 6% in part of 2025 when compared to the same period a year earlier, according to Census Bureau figures used by the U.S. Justice Department in bankruptcy proceedings.
Meanwhile, prices for consumers have charged ahead, leaving them further behind. 
The analysis referred to a poll conducted for Politico in December. Among other woes, it found that half of those surveyed found it difficult to afford food, 27% skipped a medical checkup due to financial worries, and 23% skipped taking prescription medications for the same reason.

While millions struggle, the analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies found that the richest billionaires have been doing particularly well. 
The 15 richest billionaires saw their combined wealth jump from $2.4 trillion at the beginning of 2025 to $3.2 trillion a year later. That’s a 33% increase in wealth.
When President Donald Trump signed the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” last summer, it likely accelerated growing inequality, researchers have found. 
The bill made the 2017 tax cuts permanent, adding $4.1 trillion to the federal debt by 2035, while providing $1 trillion in benefits to the richest 1% of Americans over the same period. The bill also cut more than $1 trillion in programs for the poor, including Medicaid and federal food assistance.
Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the Program on Inequality and the Common Good at the Institute for Policy Studies, said the very rich are already paying taxes at much lower rates than average Americans.
“It’s not just that U.S. billionaires are entering 2026 with record-breaking increases in extreme wealth: it’s that they are also paying far less in taxes compared to the huge amount of wealth they amass,” he said in a written statement. 
“Average taxpayers like you and I pay income tax at triple the rate of the wealthiest Americans. Not only are a small number of Americans holding more wealth than the rest of America, but they’re also not paying their fair share of taxes.”
Perhaps not surprisingly, some of the very richest American billionaires did especially well last year, according to the analysis:

Elon Musk of Tesla, X and SpaceX, had $726 billion, up from $421 billion at the beginning of 2025. That’s a 72% increase.
Larry Page, Google co-founder, had $257 billion, up from $156 billion a year ago. That’s a 65% increase.
Sergey Brin, another Google co-founder, saw a 60% increase to $237 billion.
Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, saw a 17% increase to $245 billion.
Jeff Bezos of Amazon saw a 4% increase, to $242 billion.

All of the top five are heavily involved in artificial intelligence. 
Ohio and many other states are providing huge tax subsidies to build data centers to support AI despite the fact that the centers work with skeleton staff and support few jobs. At the same time, the centers’ huge power demands have caused average consumers’ utility rates to spike.

(Photo from Google Maps.)This story was originally published by Canary Media.

In landmark rulings in November, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio ordered FirstEnergy’s three regulated companies to pay roughly $250 million for violations linked to the state’s largest-ever utility corruption scandal. More than $186 million of that will be refunded or credited to consumers.


It’s one of the biggest such penalties in U.S. history. The rulings in three cases represent ​“an important milestone in fixing the harms FirstEnergy caused,” said Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis — even though the relief comes more than five years after her office first asked regulators for accountability and falls well short of what she and others pushed for.


The utility corruption scandal surrounding FirstEnergy and House Bill 6 isn’t just the largest in Ohio history — it also ranks up there nationwide, where such occurrences have happened more often than regulators or consumers would want.


As part of the scheme, FirstEnergy paid roughly $60 million in bribes to pass the law bailing out unprofitable nuclear and coal plants, and then to thwart Ohioans’ constitutional right to a referendum on it. FirstEnergy also admitted that it paid $4.3 million to Sam Randazzo shortly before he became chair of Ohio’s utilities commission in 2019, with the understanding that he would provide favorable treatment for the company.


A lawsuit and subsequent legislation halted HB 6’s nuclear subsidies before they began. But the law’s coal subsidies lasted five and a half years, up until this August, costing consumers approximately half a billion dollars in all.


On July 21, 2020, just about a year after Gov. Mike DeWine (R) signed HB 6 into law, federal agents arrested former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder (R), former Ohio Republican Party Chair Matt Borges, and others in connection with the bribery scheme. Householder and Borges were found guilty of federal racketeering charges in 2023.


The Nov. 19 rulings by the utilities commission, also known as the PUCO, mark the first time FirstEnergy’s utilities will pay anything to Ohio and its consumers for regulatory violations related to HB 6.


The company previously paid $230 million under an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve a criminal charge, plus another $100 million to settle federal securities claims, and $20 million to avoid state criminal charges. The company also paid nearly $50 million to settle a class action lawsuit.


 Ripples in the rate cases

On the same day as its HB 6 rulings, the PUCO also approved a rate hike for some of FirstEnergy’s customers, albeit one much smaller than what the company initially requested. Regulators granted an annual increase of nearly $76 million for approximately 745,000 customers served by the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.


Meanwhile, rates will fall for customers of Toledo Edison and Ohio Edison by $24.4 million and $17.4 million per year, respectively. All told, regulators approved a net rate increase of about $34 million — far less than the combined $183 million FirstEnergy asked for.


Consumer advocates had pushed for regulators to go further. The Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel — the state advocate for utility consumers — sought rate decreases totaling roughly $132 million for FirstEnergy customers, including a cut in the company’s rate of return to account for the poor management that enabled the HB 6 corruption scheme.


“FirstEnergy’s executive decisions contributed to increased financial risk, and it is unfair for its consumers to bear this burden through higher electric bills,” Willis said, adding that shareholders should shoulder the cost. ​“Reducing the profits built into rates is also a way to ensure accountability.”


Regulators ultimately rejected that approach.
Yet another battle over FirstEnergy’s rates will probably play out this year, and the HB 6 scandal will likely loom over that process, too.


The day after the PUCO rulings came out, FirstEnergy announced that its three Ohio utilities will file their next rate case in early 2026. So, different rates from the ones just approved will likely kick in as early as 2027.


“FirstEnergy’s announcement does not come as a surprise,” Willis said. That’s because legislation passed earlier this year calls for an end to most bill riders and speeds up rate cases. At least one company has already filed a new rate case under the law.


FirstEnergy’s utilities could use their new rate case to revisit some issues from the recently decided one.


All in all, ​“customers of Ohio Edison and Toledo Edison should be wary of the lower bills” they’ll get after last month’s rulings, said Dave Anderson, policy and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group.

They’re an improvement for now, he said, but may not last.


 The book is not yet shut on HB 6

The PUCO’s rulings in the HB 6 cases also stopped far short of the relief sought by consumer and industry groups, which would have topped half a billion dollars.


And while regulators held that another corporate-separation audit should begin within the next three years, they refrained from providing a full review of FirstEnergy’s management practices, which advocates have sought since 2020.


Nonetheless, the $250.7 million in penalties and refunds imposed by regulators ​“are significant and welcome,” said Tom Bullock, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Ohio, a nonprofit watchdog group.


For their part, PUCO Chair Jenifer French and Commissioner Lawrence Friedeman each conveyed relief that the three HB 6 cases had wrapped up. ​“As this journey began, the commission has expressed an unequivocal intent to follow the facts wherever they led, and today we reached the destination,” Friedeman said at the Nov. 19 meeting.


But, as one of the commission’s rulings notes, another case has yet to be addressed. Five years ago, in response to calls for investigations following the initial arrests of Householder, Borges, and others, the PUCO — then led by Randazzo — took the ​“baby step” of ordering FirstEnergy to show that it did not use money from Ohio customers for its HB 6 efforts.


FirstEnergy’s utilities bear the burden of proof in the case. It may be difficult for them to prove the negative, because FirstEnergy had mixed funds from different sources in a money pool. It’s also unclear how much of a penalty regulators will impose if the companies can’t demonstrate that they followed a state law banning use of customers’ money for political or charitable purposes.


Written testimony in that case is due next month, and an administrative trial, called an evidentiary hearing, is set to start on Feb. 24.


Overall, Ohio’s rulings on the HB 6 saga so far have been a mix of good news and bad news when it comes to holding utilities accountable, consumer advocates say.


“What we’ve learned from the whole HB 6 affair was that there was an extremely lax attitude towards regulation [at] FirstEnergy and the other majority utilities in Ohio … that enabled the scheme to be played out,” Anderson said.


He is encouraged by the commission’s decisions last month, which reflected less deference to utilities and more serious financial consequences than past rulings.


“What the PUCO did do here that was quite strong was find FirstEnergy broke multiple Ohio laws,” Anderson said. The assessed penalties also include several instances where the commission levied fines of $10,000, $16,000, or $25,000 per day for different violations, which added up to tens of millions of dollars. If regulators in Ohio applied that approach all the time, not only in the wake of scandal, ​“it would provide utilities with a strong disincentive to take things as far as FirstEnergy did,” he added.


Beyond that, criminal charges remain pending in state and federal court against two former FirstEnergy executives. Whether the outcome of those cases will reduce the incidence of future utility scandals remains to be seen.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Maine lawmakers are again considering whether to create a separate department to handle child welfare matters after years of turmoil within the office. 
On Tuesday, Sen. Jeff Timberlake (R-Androscoggin) introduced LD 555 to create a new Department of Child and Family Services during a public hearing before the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee.
The proposal would set the stage to transfer the state’s child welfare system, which currently operates as the Office of Child and Family Services under the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, to its own department. It would have a commissioner appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature.
Timberlake introduced a similar bill two years ago that was passed by the Maine Senate, but ultimately died. He said he is proposing it again because “the underlying problems it seeks to address have not gone away.”
Oversight panel suggests more than two dozen reforms for Maine child welfare system

In an October 2023 radio address, Timberlake said at the time he saw no other way forward than to separate child welfare from DHHS and reform it “into its own department to properly execute its focused mission of protecting Maine’s families.”
He isn’t the only one who has pushed for this change. The late Bill Diamond, a former Democratic senator from Windham, proposed legislation about five years ago to separate the agency from DHHS after similar conversations around the state’s failing to keep children safe from known abuse and neglect.  
Although DHHS had expressed openness to the idea the last time Timberlake proposed it, the department testified against LD 555, saying it is unaware of evidence that this would be in best interest for children. Instead, it argued that separating child welfare from the larger department would offer less cohesive support for children in state custody. 
Melissa Hackett, coordinator of the Maine Child Welfare Action Network, did not testify for or against the proposal, but said her concerns outweigh her support of the measure, adding that a new department is “not a silver-bullet solution.” She also said she hasn’t seen any research indicating that restructuring would benefit children and families and added that these changes could be challenging to implement at a time when the agency is already strained.
Between 2021 and 2024, roughly 30 children died each year, according to state data. That includes children who died as a result of homicide or whose families had involvement with the state child welfare system, including accidental deaths. Prior to those years, 2019 saw the most child deaths dating back to 2007 with 19.
The proposal has bipartisan support with two Democrats and another six Republicans as co-sponsors, including Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot), who told the committee Tuesday that this is a human, not partisan issue.
Having served on the Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee for many years, Timberlake said few other issues have consumed as much time and attention as the shortcomings of the state’s child welfare system.
The legislative watchdog scrutinized the Office of Child and Family Services during the 131st Legislative session and came up with more than two dozen suggested reforms for the agency in May 2024. 
Since then, the Office of Child and Family Services has reported to work on implementing those policy changes and recommendations from lawmakers. The agency’s director has been providing quarterly updates to the Health and Human Services committee to keep them updated on the progress.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/state-signs-16-Large-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 04:57:55.670460

She died Dec. 31. (Photo by Mark McCormick)Josephine Vonceal Pace “Jo” Brown visited my high school back in the 1980s. The administration at good ol’ North High invited her to speak about her historic career as the first Black woman to chair Wichita School Board. 
We learned that day that the Mrs. Jo spoke hard, even painful truths wrapped in her unique brand of sophistication. No one had the status nor the courage to censor her. Her voice carried. 
She told the auditorium about the Wichita she’d lived through, including a practice of allowing Black students to swim only late on Fridays, after white students. Staff then drained and refilled the pool, to save white students from swimming in the same water. 
That story landed hard. We were the last generation of youth whose parents were shaped in a pre-civil rights America. We understood this historically, but Mrs. Jo made us feel it. 
That will moor much of her legacy: standing 10-toes or high-heels down on truth and giving people the kind of cultural equilibrium to speak loud and true about what hurts.
She died New Year’s Eve at 96, unwilling to let the year end before having her final say. 
Years later, as a columnist, my reference to that pool story in a column ignited a reader firestorm. White, Jim Crow-era graduates claimed that the pools weren’t segregated.  
Letters begat calls for a retraction and for me to be fired. I dug in as the newspaper brass pressed me to relent. 
Enter Mrs. Jo. 
“They’re after you, aren’t they baby?” 
“Yes, ma’am.” 
She said, “Humph,” with a resolve in her voice. The cavalry had arrived. 
“Here’s what you do,” she said. “You go down to the Central Branch Library. Go into the Special Collections desk and ask for a book written by Sandra Van Meter.”
Mrs. Jo explained that as board chair, she’d commissioned a book documenting the district’s history and that in one of the chapters, we’d all learn the truth, and it proved worse than anything I’d shared. 
The district literally had convened discussions about building a separate school to keep Black students and white students out of the same water. The district never built that separate building but maintained the strange water-purity practice. 
Similar stories existed from Wichita to Salina to progressive Lawrence and into the South. Heather McGhee, in her 2021 book, “The Sum of Us,” shared how Montgomery, Alabama, paved over its municipal pool — that Black taxes help build — rather than integrate it. 
It’s precisely this kind of history many Americans today would banish rather than face. Their revulsion at this black-and-white image of themselves offers a brutal contrast to the lived experience of Black residents only allowed to skate or visit dentists on certain days. 
Mrs. Jo fought against such practices, and she’s partly the reason I prioritize telling various historic and social truths regardless of the often-frightening backlash. 
The point was not for her to forever stand behind me but to show me how to stand on my own. Much of the courage I stood on, whether calling out a school bus company or a police website humiliating women, came from her. 
Imagine what she lived through, not just as an educator following the Brown decision, but in a district that considered foregoing federal funds rather than integrating. Letters from white parents who didn’t want “n-words” teaching their children. 
Despite that, she offered a warm smile and regal kindness. She never seemed bitter, just resolutely unbothered. When I read this stanza in “Still I Rise” — 
 “Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don’t you take it awful hard,
‘Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines
Diggin’ in my own back yard.” —
 it reminded me of Mrs. Jo. In a society expecting her to dim her light, Mrs. Jo set the night sky ablaze with searchlights. 
 When she confronted the yet lingering vestiges of that era, at a bank or a store, she would correct them as she might one of her tiny students. Firmly but gracefully. 
 “You don’t pay and beg, baby,” she told me once. 
She could be blunt, but not cruel. Her advice pinched your heart but fixed your vision. She often attributed her ability to speak so boldly to her husband, the late Dr. Val J. Brown Sr., whose medical practice sheltered her from reprisals. 
That voice. It bridged eras and will outlast us all. She used that voice to help so many people and guided still more toward finding their own.

Ohio is at an energy crossroads. It forged America with steel and manufacturing, but our state is now facing the challenge of how to meet soaring electricity demand from AI facilities, data centers, and a growing central Ohio population, while also achieving state-level energy independence. And that’s all without driving up costs for working families.
One answer lies, quite literally, overhead.
Solar power represents one of the most practical, cost-effective, and job-creating opportunities available to Ohio.
It strengthens the grid, lowers long-term energy bills, and supports our manufacturing base.
From Mansfield to Toledo to Columbus, our steelworkers already produce the racking and components that support solar arrays across the country. This industry is where American labor meets Ohio ingenuity.
When electricity is produced near the point of consumption — whether homes, businesses, or factories — it eliminates the need for costly transmission upgrades that end up on ratepayers’ bills and avoids importing energy from other states.
One advantage solar installations offer is offsetting demand during peaks, like hot summer afternoons when utilities rely on expensive “peaker” plants to fill the gap.
By offsetting that demand, solar reduces grid strain and keeps energy costs down for everyone.
The need is urgent.
Ohio’s data center and AI boom has placed enormous pressure on local grids, water systems, and energy bills. A key study showed that these facilities now contribute around 95,000 jobs and $11.8 billion to our state’s economy.

At the same time, the electricity demand from these facilities continues to surge, with electric bills doubling for many Ohioans.
In places like New Albany and Dublin, local leaders are already weighing how to balance economic growth with infrastructure capacity.
Solar is the fastest and most cost-efficient way to meet that demand responsibly.
We’re up to the task. More than 26,000 Ohio families have already invested in solar.
Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that aids solar owners and supporters, has helped hundreds transition to solar through state-wide bulk purchase programs.
This local investment in solar is saving families money and fueling a growing homegrown industry.
Meanwhile, Ohio’s clean-energy workforce now boasts more than 100,000 jobs and 268 companies operating, specifically, in the state’s solar supply chain.
Terrasmart is one of those companies. It’s a leading solar racking manufacturer and installer that collaborates with 14 Ohio-based companies that supply steel, tubes, fasteners, galvanization, shipping, and installation services.
This is an example of how solar is feeding a state-focused supply chain while also employing more than 250 people in the Cincinnati area.
Every new array supports welders, fabricators, and electricians — the craftsmen who have long defined Ohio’s industrial spirit.
Expanding that workforce creates energy, strengthens small towns, and keeps prosperity within our borders.


That’s why state lawmakers are taking action.
In November, the Ohio House overwhelmingly passed a bill to expand community energy programs, which let Ohioans buy or lease shares in a shared solar project and get credits on their electric bills as if the panels were on their own homes.
For renters, apartment dwellers, and homeowners with shaded roofs, this reform offers a real way to take part in the energy economy. It expands ownership and helps local communities take charge of their power. The bill is now in the Ohio Senate.


Meanwhile, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio will soon determine how to share the costs of powering the state’s expanding data-center industry. Yet without additional local generation, those costs risk being passed along to everyday consumers.
This is a matter of economic foresight, not ideology.
Passing a community energy bill, supporting domestic supply chains, and aligning state and federal incentives will both protect ratepayers and secure Ohio’s role as a manufacturing leader in the 21st century.
The sun shines on every community in Ohio. Harnessing its power is practical and rightly typifies the belief that the nation’s energy future should be built here at home.

Wes Moore and Kenneth Naylor with Atlantic Pacific Cos., discuss future development in the Capitol Heights area near its Metro station. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)After his proposed housing legislation stumbled in the 2025 General Assembly, Gov. Wes Moore (D) unveiled a package of bills for the 2026 session that last year’s critics were giving a tentative thumbs-up Tuesday.
While there is likely “compromise waiting to happen” on parts of the package, an official with a lobbying group for Maryland county leaders, a key opponent last year, said county officials hope to come to agreement with the Moore administration on this year’s housing legislation.
“I think 2026 will be a different story,” said Michael Sanderson, executive director for the Maryland Association of Counties. “We’ve had a lot of conversations leading up to this year, and I think that’s been productive.”
Sanderson’s comments follow Moore’s unveiling Tuesday of his 2026 housing legislative package, a slate of housing development bills that he says will help reduce the state’s 94,000 housing unit shortage.
The presentation came at the Capitol Heights Metro station in Prince George’s County, to highlight part of his plan that includes a priority to encourage new development around high transit areas, including mixed-use housing, among other measures.
In 2026, affordable housing is needed ‘now more than ever,’ but getting there is the challenge

“We know that outdated zoning laws and bureaucratic red tape – they will limit housing supply, that they will cause a lack of affordability,” Moore said. “That’s why you will see on Jan. 14, our administration will continue to implement the most aggressive housing policies this state has seen in a generation, and we will do it unapologetically.”
His Maryland Transit & Housing Opportunity Act would eliminate parking minimums for housing developments within a quarter mile of transit, focusing on rail services. The bill would also delay collection of impact fees or excise taxes until after housing construction near transit is complete, among other measures.
Moore’s event coincided with the announcement of a contractor to redevelop the area around the Capitol Heights Metro station, and early renderings of the project.
“Today represents a new way that we are going to have these conversations, because this station represents the heart of the Blue Line corridor,” Moore said, referring to the Metro line in Prince George’s County that runs from the District line to the Downtown Largo station.
“For too long, we have seen how this has been acres of asphalt, a parking lot that just sits empty while the demand for housing skyrockets,” he said.
The state selected Atlantic Pacific Cos. to redevelop the area with approximately 300 new homes and 10,000 square feet of retail. Moore said that the development around the Capitol Heights station should serve as an example for the type of development his transit-oriented housing legislation would support.

Another one of the bills, called the Starter and Silver Homes act, would prohibit local jurisdictions from issuing minimum lot size requirements, allowing  developers to create smaller properties that serve as starter homes and homes for elderly people looking to downsize.
“Right now, local mandates require lot sizes that are so large, the only thing you can build is a huge home,” Moore said. “Not everybody needs a huge home, nor wants one.”
“It offers a measure of flexibility and freedom to stop shutting out Maryland’s working families and stop shutting out Maryland seniors from having the opportunity for home ownership,” he said.
The last piece of Moore’s housing package would reignite a battle around “vesting rights” for developers, meaning they would have a guarantee they can build on a property once a project is approved and that the project would be subject to the laws and policies in place at the time of its application. Vesting rights were part of Moore’s unsuccessful effort to push housing development legislation in the last session.
The 2025 legislation, which initially aimed to tie housing development to areas with high job growth, immediately came under fire from MACo because it limited county government say over some housing decisions.
The bill did not get its first hearing until March, in the back half of Maryland’s 90-day legislative session. It was heavily rewritten, replacing the administration’s proposal with language that granted vesting rights for developers, among other measures. It ultimately died in the Senate Energy, Education and Environment Committee as time ran out on the session.
Sanderson said that last year’s vesting right legislation “fell apart.”
“I feel like there is a compromise waiting to happen,” he said on vesting rights. “We’ve been talking very aggressively over the last several months, all pointing toward ‘let’s get something done.’ So I’m optimistic that we’re going to find a path to ‘yes’ on a lot of issues that have been elusive up to this point.”

Patrick Wolff
Patrick Wolff, a Democrat, is running for insurance commissioner. He is a financial analyst and investor and was a U.S. chess champion and an international grandmaster. 


With the first anniversary of the devastating Southern California wildfires approaching, CalMatters asked candidates for the 2026 state Insurance Commissioner race to share thoughts on what the state can do to help victims and stabilize insurers. This is the first of several candidate responses.
California’s insurance regulation is dysfunctional because politicians with no relevant qualifications keep running for Insurance Commissioner as a stepping stone.
I am a lifelong Democrat with over two decades of insurance and financial experience, first building an auto and home insurance brokerage business, then working as a financial analyst. This is my first run for elected office, and I will not run for any other office if elected. 
My only ambition is to fix what Sacramento has broken.
Solving our insurance crisis starts with reorienting the California Department of Insurance. It is too lax regulating insurance companies’ behavior, yet too strict controlling their market access. Customers lose both ways. My plan flips the script, holding insurance companies accountable while increasing choice and competition. 
The recently formed Smoke Claims & Remediation Task Force is an example of failing to hold insurance companies accountable. Modern wildfires cause unprecedented smoke damage, requiring new coverage standards. But reporting reveals the task force unacceptably favors insurance companies over science. I will create a new, unbiased task force to issue trustworthy standards and then make insurance companies follow them.
Another failure of accountability is claims payments. The state insurance department collects Market Conduct Annual Statements, identifying insurers who unfairly delay or deny claims. However, the insurance industry has lobbied to anonymize this data, shielding individual companies. I will have the insurance department release company-specific data and publish a claims performance report card for each insurance company, empowering customers to reward good actors and punish bad actors.
Customer empowerment requires robust choice and competition, yet the insurance department strangles both with bureaucratic red tape. Insurance companies filing product or rate changes wait 300 days for review versus 60 days in other states, and with much less predictable decisions than any other state because the department micromanages every case.
These endless delays and capricious rulings are disastrous, leading to insurers canceling policies and leaving California. I will streamline filing timelines and reserve strict reviews only for special cases as needed. Insurance companies will flock to our gigantic market once they have clear rules providing the reasonable certainty and flexibility they need to operate economically. 
As more companies come, more choice and competition will follow.
With strong regulation holding insurance companies accountable and empowering customers, ample choice and competition will prevent price gouging. But to hold ourselves accountable that the market is working and pricing is fair, I will publish an annual benchmarking report comparing California to all other western, fire-affected states.
As insurance becomes plentiful in California again, people will no longer need to turn to the FAIR Plan in desperation. Nevertheless, the FAIR Plan remains necessary and must be bolstered. I will require all insurance companies doing business in California to invest in improving FAIR Plan service. In return, we must allow FAIR Plan rates to become fully actuarially sound, as required by statute. This will stabilize FAIR Plan finances and incentivize customers to get better and cheaper coverage in the regular market.
Fixing insurance regulation can hold insurance companies accountable, provide transparency, make insurance widely available, prevent price gouging and stabilize the FAIR Plan. But to bring costs down to where they belong, we must aggressively reduce wildfire risk.
To protect homes, the state must provide clear home hardening guidance that aligns with insurance company underwriting and comes with accompanying discounts. Since home hardening helps everyone but burdens the homeowner, the insurance department must develop financial assistance programs homeowners need and deserve. 
Statewide, the way to sustainably lower the cost of wildfire risk — plus save lives and property — is to take better care of our forests. It is outrageous that our state government has allowed wildfire risk to get so bad. As Insurance Commissioner, I will fight relentlessly for better forest management.
California needs and deserves a functioning insurance system. With the right leadership, we can finally make insurance work the way it should for everyone in California.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A House Republican is charging back into a continuing fight over vaccines and doctors that created a huge rift during last year’s legislative session.
Rep. Jeff Holcomb late last month filed HB 917, a proposal that takes aim at doctors who refuse to treat patients based on their vaccination schedule while also delving into other contentious health care treatment disputes.
The administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis backed a similar bill last year championed by Department of Health Secretary and State Health Officer Dr. Joseph Ladapo, but the vaccine provision was stripped from the bill.
In an email to the Florida Phoenix, Holcomb said he “feels strongly” the bill will pass this year.
Spring Hill Republican Rep. Jeff Holcomb (Photo/Florida House of Representatives)
“We saw during the Covid pandemic that medical decisions were made without proper safety measures. We have a similar situation with the childhood vaccine schedule. The vaccines our children are mandated to have do not have sufficient safety studies. This was confirmed yesterday with CDC shrinking the recommended childhood vaccine schedule,” he said, referencing the decision Monday to shrink the recommended number of childhood vaccines from 17 to 11.
Holcomb’s bill doesn’t eliminate any vaccine mandate now in Florida statute or rule. 
The bill does amend Florida’s Patient’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities to make clear that a health care provider or facility cannot discriminate against a patient based upon the patient’s vaccination status. 
Additionally, Holcomb’s bill would add “vaccine status” to the list of reasons protected in law why patients cannot be discriminated against. That list now includes race, national origin, handicap, and source of payment.
The bill would allow the DOH or the appropriate licensing board to discipline providers who discriminate against patients based on vaccine status. The penalties in law vary from restricting, suspending, or revoking a license to imposing administrative fines or both.
Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics President Rana Alissa, a Jacksonville physician, said the association does not support HB 917.
“When you have somebody that is unvaccinated and coming with fever, what if that patient has measles? If they are going to come and be in the waiting room with people who have leukemia, or for any reason they do have a lower immune system, they are going to expose them to measles,” Alissa said.

Physician’s offices aren’t designed to safely accommodate unvaccinated patients, she said.
“You have to change the way clinics are built. You have to have a different waiting room, you have to have a different stairs, you have to have a different elevator. You have to have negative-pressure rooms to accommodate these unvaccinated kids when they have signs and symptoms of the illness,” she said. 
“You want to force them to take unvaccinated kids? Then you have to help them reconstruct their clinics and you have to basically accommodate them accordingly.”
The language is identical to what the DeSantis administration pushed for last year in a far-reaching bill that addressed an array of Department of Health-related issues, from background screening requirements for staff at medical marijuana treatment centers to physician licensure requirements.
While HB 1299 ultimately passed and was signed into law by the governor, it didn’t contain the anti-discrimination language the DeSantis administration wanted.
Another vaccine-related provision in HB 917 left over from the 2025 session addresses messenger ribonucelic acid (mRNA) vaccines.
The Legislature in 2023 passed a law that banned governmental entities, business establishments, and educational institutions from discriminating against someone based on mRNA vaccination status. Essentially, the law banned the use of vaccine passports in Florida. But it was valid only through June 2025.
 The DeSantis administration tried unsuccessfully last year to make the ban permanent in HB 1299, but the Legislature refused to go along. Lawmakers did agree, however, to extend the ban through June 2027. HB 917 would make the ban permanent.
No vax, no mask, but still service

DeSantis in September criticized the Legislature for refusing to go along with his health-care proposals. Specifically regarding the mRNA provisions, DeSantis said: “That’s got to be made permanent. I mean, everyone is glad that we did that. Even the far left, I don’t hear them, at least publicly they won’t admit they’re for vaccine passports. It doesn’t make sense. So, they need to do that.”

The governor and Ladapo said over the summer that they want to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes. That would require legislative buy-in that isn’t clear the governor and Ladapo, his state health czar, can expect.
In the meantime, the DOH has proposed changing its rules regarding vaccine requirement for school and day care, specifically removing requirements for children to receive the hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), and haemophilus influenza B or Hib vaccine. The DOH is proposing to also eliminate those vaccines, along with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for admission to a licensed day care facility.
It held a lengthy public meeting on the proposed rule changes in December.
Vaccines maintained, disclosure added 
HB 917 wouldn’t eliminate any vaccine mandate from statute. But the legislation would require every licensed health care provider authorized to vaccinate children to advise parents and legal guardians of the “unique risks, benefits, safety, and efficacy of each vaccine included on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule.”
Holcomb’s bill would require health care providers to give parents and legal guardians the option of following “alternative vaccination schedules that may consist of not more than one injection or oral administration at each encounter.”
Parent and legal guardians would be required to sign a document attesting they have been provided the requisite immunization information.
 Behind-the-counter ivermectin

HB 917 would authorize pharmacists to sell ivermectin “behind the counter,” which means pharmacy assistance wouldn’t needed to obtain the product.
Ivermectin is an effective treatment for parasites in animals and for use by humans to treat parasites such as head lice and scabies, according to the National Institutes of Health. The FDA has not approved  Ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID-19, and so far recommends against taking it for COVID-19, instead suggesting people get vaccinated for protection.
Nevertheless, there was buzz during the pandemic about using it for treatment for COVID-19.
HB 917 provides pharmacists who sell ivermectin from behind the counter with immunity from civil and criminal liability as well as disciplinary protections.
Specifically, HB 917 would authorize pharmacists to provide ivermectin to patients and customers as long as the pharmacist provides written information about the indications and contraindications of the use of ivermectin and the appropriate dosage for using ivermectin. The information must advise the person to seek follow up care from a primary care physician.
There is no age restriction in HB 917 for the purchase of ivermectin. Holcomb has also filed HB 29, to legalize over-the-counter sale of ivermectin. That means it wouldn’t be limited but freely accessible.
HB 29 has been referred to three House committees. There is no Senate companion.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FL-hospital.jpg,,,2026-01-07 00:12:15.716874

Yet, in his Nov. 24 opinion, “Time for Connecticut to rethink its climate strategies,” Noah Kaufman includes this quote: “The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas but in escaping from old ones. ” The opinion’s subtitle, “A lot has changed in climate policy over the last few years — meriting a new path,” tips off the reader to the “old is new, up is down” nature of his essay.
Kaufman’s “new idea” is for Connecticut to be less ambitious in its climate strategies and goals that are described in the Governor’s 2021 Executive Order but are now, apparently, an “old idea.”  It’s hard to believe that plans laid out less than five years ago are old.  But the approach becomes clearer in Kaufman’s statements:  “Under Trump, the U.S. is retreating from domestic decarbonization and actively undermining global efforts,” and Connecticut should “recalibrate its goals to better align with today’s economic and political realities.”  
In other words, retreat from the path forward because it has encountered bumps in the road.  Instead, Kaufman recommends that Connecticut stick with the actual old and familiar habit of using fossil fuels no matter how sick they make us (cancer, asthma, worsening of other respiratory diseases) and what the cost (destruction of forests and wildlife, pipeline leaks, increased cost of natural gas).
Should Connecticut, along with Rhode Island, have accepted the stop-work order from the Trump administration for the Revolution Wind project, a 704-megawatt wind farm, even though the project was fully permitted and 80 percent complete?  Would the loss of wind energy and all the construction and operating jobs have been a wise decision?  Does Kaufman disagree with the state’s evaluation that “Strategic investment in our port assets, a history of advanced manufacturing, innovative technology and research and development capabilities, have uniquely positioned Connecticut to serve as a first-mover in this new industry, already serving as a launchpad for three offshore wind projects supporting three states?”
No, to Connecticut’s credit (for example), it didn’t fall for Trump’s “I hate wind,” approach and instead pursued and won a federal judge’s decision ordering work to resume on the Revolution Wind project.  Work resumed on September 22, and the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management did not appeal the restart.  Connecticut refusing to bow to today’s supposed economic and political realities. On December 22, the Trump administration again halted construction of the project, along with pauses against four other offshore wind farms on the East Coast, for the reported purpose of evaluating national security concerns.
Once again, Connecticut is fighting back. The governors of Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island “are demanding either a briefing on purported security threats or an immediate lifting of stop work orders on five offshore wind projects under construction, including the Revolution Wind project.” In addition, Attorney General William Tong released a statement objecting to the stop work order and declaring that, “We are evaluating all legal options, and this will be stopped just like last time.” These actions show what the “new idea” really is – for Connecticut to be bold and courageous in pursuing a clean energy future.
The state should move rapidly to adopt other clean technologies that are being aggressively pursued by other states, such as solar in many forms, solar plus battery storage and geothermal networks.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that solar is expected to contribute more than half of new electric generating capacity planned for 2025, with battery storage accounting for almost 20% of the remaining capacity additions.  These increases reported year over year will build the solar and battery capacity quickly.
Connecticut should also move promptly to build its geothermal network capacity.  Connecticut has been cautious and slow to move forward with geothermal networks, which are considered one of the most efficient ways to heat and cool buildings.  Our neighboring states are ahead of us, and we can learn from their experiences.  In fact, even in “today’s economic and political realities,” Massachusetts and New York are moving forward on several geothermal projects.  The nation’s first utility-led geothermal heating and cooling network in Framingham, MA, whose first section was completed in 2024, recently announced that an $8.6 million grant from the US Department of Energy will provide funding for the network to double in size.  A Boston-based nonprofit is the lead recipient of the funding, and Eversource and the city of Framingham are co-recipients.
Connecticut should also move rapidly from “studying” solar canopies (required by 2025 legislation) to building them.  Tremendous capacity is available on parking lots and other usable spaces near transmission connections.  Solar canopies can provide other benefits such as battery storage, reducing heat islands, protecting cars, and directing the flow of rainwater.
So yes, we should be clear about what are “new” ideas and what are “old” ideas, and we should work hard to develop the true new ideas for clean and renewable energy instead of backsliding on our climate goals and commitments.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,American Democracy needs religion — not less,Andrew Fowler,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/american-democracy-needs-religion-not-less/,"The United States may not have been founded strictly as a Christian nation, but Christian values are intrinsically linked to American democracy.","In a recent editorial, John Hall suggests  that religion is an obstacle to American democracy — a relic of “magical thinking” that breeds conflict, division, and impedes progress, driven by modern “angry, defensive Christians.” His perspective echoes the utopian vision evoked in John Lennon’s “Imagine:” if only there was “no religion too,” humanity could finally live in peace.
However, this dismissive argument misunderstands both American history and the culture’s present realities. Far from threatening democracy, as the headline “Can religion harm democracy?,” implies, religion has been the impetus for constructing the nation’s moral, legal, and civic fabric — and must be a cornerstone of civil society.
Indeed, the core American principles — that “all men are created equal” and limited government — were not borne from Thomas Jefferson’s pen in 1776, but rooted in a classical and Judeo-Christian tradition: that every person, from the powerful to the lowly, has an inherent dignity (or inalienable rights) because they were made in God’s image and likeness.
Although the United States may not have been founded strictly as a Christian nation, nevertheless, Christian values are intrinsically linked to American democracy. In the colonial period, many settlers emigrated  to the New World to escape faith-based persecution and, thus, enshrined the freedom of religious expression  into their charters, which would later appear in the First Amendment. Religiosity also compelled settlers to craft governmental frameworks and list rights in written documents like the Fundamental Orders of 1639 — one of the earliest, and perhaps first written constitutions of a democratic government, which had been adopted  in Connecticut.
As Matthew Spalding notes in The Making of the American Mind, it was “Christianity that largely transmitted the classical tradition, which meant natural-law reasoning, to the modern world.” Indeed, that there are “divine laws that exist prior to, outside of, and above the laws of the state” means the state’s laws are “limited and controlled by a higher or transpolitical authority.”
To an extent, Hall is accurate when expressing the Founding Fathers’ skepticism of religious fanaticism and deistic leanings. Yet they were not irreligious — or even opposed to religious practice. In fact, John Adams clearly  emphasized  the U.S. Constitution was “made only for a moral and religious people,” emphasizing, “It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”
Moreover, the Founders’ predominant concern was not with religious fanaticism, but countering direct democracy, which they  equated  to mob rule and tyranny. As a result, the American republic did not merely implement checks and balances on various government branches, but  humanity’s fallen nature  — and proclivity to abuse power to bludgeon the opposition.
Decades after the Constitutional Convention, Alexis de Tocqueville — who also favored a separation of church and state — concurred with the Founders. Writing in Democracy in America, he saw religion “no less the companion of liberty in all its battles and its triumphs; the cradle of its infancy, and the divine source of its claims,” adding, “The safeguard of morality is religion, and morality is the best security of law and the surest pledge of freedom.”
The virtues of peaceful coexistence, social justice, and the Golden Rule also stem from religious fervor and tradition. Historically, these values have fueled  charitable giving; equality under the law; the abolition of slavery; the construction of hospitals, universities, and schools; scientific discovery; to even the establishment of free market economic practices, which raised more out of poverty  than its antecedents.
More than simply binding a people together, as Ian Speir argues  in Mere Orthodoxy, religion has been the means of cultivating virtue by governing one’s passions, and fostering a robust civil society. On the latter, a plethora of organizations were inspired by faith like the Salvation Army, Knights of Columbus, the American Red Cross, Samaritan’s Purse, and even the YMCA. As a nation, the U.S. government has a long-storied history  of granting public funding toward humanitarian aid and nonprofits. This impulse, no doubt, was spurred on by a Christian sense of duty to thy neighbor.
In short, the West has been, and continues to be, “utterly saturated by Christian concepts and assumptions,” as Tom Holland notes in Dominion:  How the Christian Revolution Remade the World. And when an injustice does occur, like racism, greed, murder, sexual assaults, or other crimes, we predominantly view it through this moralistic lens.
Yet, in recent decades, religion’s withdrawal  from the public square has not yielded good fruit sociologically. Coupled with the rise of secularization, New Atheism, and modern therapeutic deism, Americans are — coincidentally (or perhaps, consequently) — gripped by a persistent “happiness crisis ,” particularly among younger demographics. However, scientific evidence suggests that religious people are generally happier  and live longer. Indeed, prayer produces psychological benefits: reducing stress, loneliness, and fear, as well as increased connection to community 
But in the past few years, more Americans are religiously unaffiliated  (“nones”) than in previous decades. This poses a significant risk to the health of American democracy since “nones” are “less civically engaged and socially connected than people who identify with a religion,” according to a Pew Research Center survey  released in January 2025.As churches and civic associations close, there will be fewer opportunities to volunteer and collaborate — and, therefore, fewer interactions devoid of politics. The timing could not be worse. Polarization has intensified: most Americans disagree on “ basic facts;” nearly two-thirds  believe the country’s political culture is incapable of solving problems; and about a third  believe violence “may be necessary to set the country on track.”

These realities should give us pause. The erosion of religiosity in American democracy presents an existential crisis. Nonetheless, Hall ascribes the tense political landscape to Protestant fundamentalists’ “disdain” for secular liberals, progressive gender ideology, women’s rights, and the sciences, like vaccines and evolution. Moreover, he criticizes the right’s moral lapse in supporting Donald Trump, who he calls a “political demagogue.” Yet he is unfair to those on the religious right who have felt persecuted over the years, embodied by cases like Masterpiece Cakeshop, the Little Sisters of the Poor, the FBI spying on traditional Catholics, and even Coach Joe Kennedy’s public prayer.
And in a twist of spiritual irony, during the pandemic, the government deemed liquor stores to be essential , but not houses of worship. Point being, the religious right’s frustration is not without cause — and Trump has appealed to their plight more so than Democrats. This has not gone unnoticed by prominent Democrats, like U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock from Georgia, who believe the party has “ceded  ” religion to Republicans.
Ironic, still, is that Hall views these policy disagreements as a threat to democracy — yet disagreement is inherent in America’s republican government. It is a “messy, difficult, and essential struggle,” which he astutely recognizes. After all, no two people think exactly alike. Everyone possesses a unique, individual mind. However, prior to the United States of America, most governments failed to elevate individuality, favoring the authoritarian ‘might makes right’ rule.
Ultimately, any utopia, like the one imagined in John Lennon’s famous song, is impossible. Nevertheless, Lennon’s idealism persists in reducing belief into a coping mechanism for death, while promoting a new age deism. Yet faith-based hope, more so than secularization, has been a powerful force when earnestly lived, accomplishing incalculable good for untold millions be it the poor, marginalized, sick, dying, the uneducated, and the unborn.
The inherent dignity of others, enshrined in our founding documents and born from a religious tradition, has made possible the potential to pursue happiness more so than most persons throughout human history. That is worth protecting and safeguarding.
In truth, a nation unmoored from these values would be catastrophic to sustaining American democracy as we know it. The proof is in the empirical evidence.
So, no — religion is not harmful to democracy; in fact, it’s imperative.

What makes this moment different is the speed, scale, and breadth of change, and the absence of a coordinated response. If we fail to act, we are not witnessing inevitable progress; we are permitting displacement by design.","I WAS RECENTLY watching “Landman,” a television drama set in the oil fields of Texas, where generations of families have made their living on the rig. In one scene, workers attend an industry showcase filled with cutting-edge equipment meant to represent the future of drilling.
One machine stood out. It was a robotic drilling system, precise, tireless, and exact. It performed the same work these men had done for decades, the same work their fathers and grandfathers had done before them.
One worker looked at it and asked, “What is that?”
Another answered quietly, “That’s the machine that replaces us.”
That line has stayed with me because it captures a reality we are only beginning to confront. Artificial intelligence and automation are no longer abstract concepts or distant threats. They are actively reshaping the labor market, often faster than workers, educators, and policymakers can respond.
For years, much of our economic anxiety has been directed outward, toward globalization or immigration. But the most disruptive newcomer to the workforce does not cross borders or need housing. It works around the clock, does not get sick, does not take family leave, and never asks for a raise.
Artificial intelligence is already transforming how, and whether, people work.
Recent reporting underscores this shift. Major employers including Best Buy, American Airlines, Amazon, and Adidas have announced layoffs or restructuring tied to automation and efficiency efforts. These are not isolated incidents. They reflect a broader corporate strategy to improve margins by reducing labor costs through technology.
To be clear, innovation and efficiency are not inherently bad. Businesses must evolve to remain competitive. But there is a growing gap between technological advancement and the responsibility companies owe to the workers who helped build them. Long-time employees are increasingly treated as expendable, replaced by systems that promise savings but remain largely unproven at scale.
This pattern is not just economically disruptive; it is socially destabilizing.
As a teacher, I see the consequences of economic insecurity up close. Many of my students’ families depend on multiple jobs to survive. Losing even one source of income can trigger a cascade of consequences, missed rent, utility shutoffs, food insecurity, and, in extreme cases, homelessness. When jobs disappear suddenly, families do not have time to adapt.
The risks extend well beyond traditionally “replaceable” work. Technology ethicist Tristan Harris, who helped sound the alarm about the harms of unchecked social media, has warned that AI-driven displacement will hit entry-level workers especially hard. These are recent college graduates and young adults who rely on early career jobs as their entry point into economic stability. If those rungs disappear, upward mobility disappears with them.
Even highly skilled professions may not be immune. In medicine, for example, AI-assisted precision is already being explored in surgical settings. Faced with a choice between a machine that never tires and a human surgeon operating after long hours with little rest, insurers and patients alike may gravitate toward automation. The logic is understandable, but the workforce implications are profound.
This is not an argument to halt innovation. It is an argument for guardrails.
Massachusetts has long prided itself on being a leader in both technology and labor standards. That tradition now demands action. Policymakers must ensure that automation does not simply externalize costs onto workers and communities. That means requiring transition planning, investing in retraining that leads to real jobs, strengthening unemployment protections, and holding corporations accountable when automation results in large-scale displacement.
Without such safeguards, we risk allowing efficiency to become a euphemism for abandonment.
Technology has always changed work. What makes this moment different is the speed, scale, and breadth of change, and the absence of a coordinated response. If we fail to act, we are not witnessing inevitable progress; we are permitting displacement by design.
The machine I saw on that oil rig did more than drill holes. It exposed a question Massachusetts must now answer: Will innovation serve the public good, or will it erode the very workforce our economy depends on?
The answer will shape not just our labor market, but the stability of our communities for generations to come.

With votes still being counted in one of the four counties that comprise Senate District 26, Wade Dunn, a retired businessman who received the endorsement of the late Sen. Gary Stubblefield’s family, was in the lead. Brad Simon, a businessman who outspent all of his opponents, was in second. However, if current margins hold, neither candidate will the majority needed to win the nomination outright.
Franklin County posted unofficial final vote tallies by publication time on its Facebook page, and Logan County provided unofficial final vote counts directly to the Advocate. Johnson County reported partial results on the Arkansas Secretary of State’s website.  Sebastian County posted final unofficial results on its website.
“We feel this race is headed to a run-off and that we are well positioned to be in that run-off,” Dunn wrote on his campaign’s Facebook page Tuesday night.
Brad Simon (Courtesy of the Arkansas Secretary of State)
Simon said in a text message to the Arkansas Advocate that he was going to “wait on the final numbers, digest everything, and sleep on it.” He did not immediately respond to follow-up questions.
The five Republicans in the race were vying to replace Stubblefield, who died in September. Stubblefield was an outspoken opponent of the prison, which is set to be built in the district on a 815-acre property the state purchased in 2024, and was one of several senators who repeatedly voted against appropriating $750 million in state funds for its construction in 2025. The winner of the Feb. 3 Republican runoff will face independent candidate Adam Watson in the March 3 special election for Stubblefield’s seat.
Dunn, Simon and the other three candidates — former state Rep. Mark Berry, Stacie Smith and Ted Tritt — were united in opposing building a prison project in Franklin County and other issues such as cutting taxes, though their positions on alternatives to building the prison in the county were less unified. Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in 2024 announced the state had bought 815 acres in the county for the planned 3,000-bed facility.
Sanders has said the prison is needed to address state prisons being over capacity. Critics say the state didn’t consult locals about the plan and that the site doesn’t have the infrastructure needed for such a project.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5973-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-06 23:57:19.644206
,Mississippi Today,2026-01-07 04:11:18+00:00,Mississippi Today,Miami Hurricanes have two Mississippi connections – and one is quite large,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/06/miami-hurricanes-mississippi-connections/,"Miami tight end Elijah Arroyo, left, celebrates with offensive lineman Markel Bell, second from left, after after scoring a touchdown during the first half of an NCAA football game, Saturday, Sept. 7, 2024, in Miami Gardens, Fla.","SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – There are few connections where the Miami Hurricanes and the state of Mississippi are concerned other than Miami plays Ole Miss Thursday in the Fiesta Bowl.
But there are two interesting ones:

Delta native Markel Bell, former Cleveland Central and Holmes Community College standout, plays left tackle for Miami and protects quarterback Carson Beck’s blind side. Bell is, in a word, gigantic: 6 feet, 9 inches and 345 pounds. He will wear jersey number 70. Trust me, you cannot miss him. He will be the largest human being on the State Farm Stadium field Thursday night. And he’s more than just big. He’s really good. Through 14 games this season, Bell has not allowed a single quarterback sack and has allowed only one quarterback hit.
Miami offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson has Mississippi connections. No. 1, his first job as an offensive coordinator was at Millsaps College, right there on State Street in Jackson, back in 2006-07. There he worked for former Alabama head coach Mike Dubose and mentored the late Juan Joseph, the quarterback who eventually won the C Spire Conerly Trophy, the only Division III player to ever win the honor. No. 2, Dawson spent three years at Southern Miss, where he mentored Nick Mullens, who broke many of Brett Favre’s passing records and has gone on to a 10-years-and-counting NFL career.

Rick Cleveland
Unfortunately, Bell was not made available to the media here during Miami’s press conference Tuesday, but Dawson was. So naturally this Mississippi reporter asked Dawson about the only Mississippi native on the Miami team. Instantly, Dawson’s eyes lit up.
“Well, first of all, he is one large human being, and he is one helluva football player,” Dawson said. “Our offense is built around that offensive line. Those guys are our engine, and he’s one of our best. He is also a terrific young man, who has grown in so many ways in his two years at Miami.”
Bell is a prototypical rags-to-riches story. Most Division I football players are either 3-star, 4-star or 5-star recruits. Bell came out of Cleveland Central with zero stars. That’s right: zero, none, null set.
So Bell went to Holmes CC, where he began to attract attention. Let’s face it, when a 6-9, 345-pound player walks into a room – or onto a field – he gets noticed. Apparently, Bell’s rapid improvement in Goodman – and his obvious potential for more improvement – attracted a whole lot of attention. He made first-team all-star and first-team all-region and received offers from Ole Miss, Mississippi State, Auburn, Arkansas, Louisville and others.
How did he end up at Miami?
“He flew on a plane,” Dawson said, laughing at his own joke. “No, seriously, he came to us on a visit and loved the place. He picked us, and I’m glad he did.”
Ole Miss defensive coordinator Bryan Brown said when you turn on tape of the Miami offense you can’t help but notice Bell. “He is one gigantic human,” Brown said. “I mean, he is long and thick. And for a guy his size, he can really move. He’s a load.”
Dawson, a native of Clinton, Louisiana, fondly remembers his stints at Millsaps and Southern Miss. 
“I was a graduate assistant at New Mexico State when I got the call from Millsaps,” Dawson said. “It was my first chance to be an offensive coordinator. They had really struggled offensively. We got pretty good, won nine games one year. It helped to have a guy like Juan Joseph at quarterback.”
Dawson says he learned a lot about running an offense at Millsaps, and one of the lessons was quite painful. Remember the game that became known as “Lateralpalooza.” If you were there or have seen the tape, you will never forget it. Trinity and Millsaps were both nationally ranked. Millsaps led Trinity led 24-22 late and was trying to run out the clock. But the Majors turned the ball over on downs with two seconds left at the Trinity 40. And that’s when Trinity lateraled the ball 15 times en route to a 60-yard game-winning touchdown. The play became nationally famous on “ESPN SportsCenter” and all the various highlights shows.

“Everybody remembers all those laterals,” Dawson said. “What I remember is that if I had managed the clock a little better, they would have never gotten the ball back to run that play.”
From Millsaps, Dawson’s career took him Stephen F. Austin, then to West Virginia and then to Kentucky. Fired as the offensive coordinator at Kentucky after one season in 2015, Dawson took the same job on Jay Hopson’s first staff at Southern Miss. USM’s first game of the 2016 season: at Kentucky. Dawson’s offense went up and down the Commonwealth Stadium Feld and the Golden Eagles won 44-35. Some revenges are sweeter than others.
After three seasons in Hattiesburg, Dawson moved to Houston for four seasons and then to Miami. This is his third season there.
Said Dawson of Ole Miss’s defense: “Those guys  play exceptionally hard. They are very athletic. Their edge guys can bend the edge, and they are very disruptive up front. They do a lot of movement, a lot of things that give people trouble. They probably do a little bit more of that movement lately and why they were so successful against Georgia.”
Dawson continued, “I think Ole Miss is a lot like us. They play hard, they get after it and they have really gotten hot at the right time. Should be a heckuva matchup.”
Ole Miss and Miami have played only three times, all before players began wearing facemarks on their helmets and none with anywhere the importance of this Fiesta Bowl.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/06173725/AP24251849921265.jpg,,,2026-01-06 23:12:21.326719

Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) and Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) introduced the bill late last year after a report from the Capital Times found that there were over 200 investigations into teacher licenses stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct or grooming from 2018 to 2023. 
Nedweski spoke about the case of Christian Enwright, a former Kenosha teacher who pleaded guilty last year to over a dozen misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct after he had an inappropriate relationship with a 14-year-old student, during the Assembly Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee hearing. 
“Unfortunately, the Christian Enwright story is all too common. For too long, these cases have been swept under the rug and child victims were put through a lifetime trauma, often knowing that the person who preyed upon them is likely out there doing it to another child,” Nedweski said. “The strong penalties in AB 677 serve as a stern warning and deterrent to bad actors. The bill ensures that adults who exploit positions of trust to manipulate and prey upon children can no longer hide behind misdemeanor charges or technical gaps in state law.” 
Under the AB 677, grooming would be defined as “a course of conduct, pattern of behavior, or series of acts with the intention to condition, seduce, solicit, lure, or entice a child for the purpose of producing distributing or possessing depictions of the child engaged in sexually explicit conduct.” 
Examples of behavior that would constitute grooming include verbal comments or conversations of a sexual nature directed at a child, inappropriate or sexualized physical contact; communication over text and social media to lure or entice a child; promising gifts, privileges, or special attention to lower a child’s inhibitions or create emotional dependence; and acts intended to isolate a child from family or peers.
While the bill was spurred in part due to cases involving teachers, the bill authors told the Assembly Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee that the bill would not just address grooming happening in the school arena. 
“It is important to remember that grooming can happen anywhere — grooming can happen anywhere, not just in our schools. This bill is not targeted at schools, but at grooming whenever and wherever it might happen,” James said. “I believe that it will have a strong deterrence effect. Clear criminalization of grooming behavior sends a strong message that predatory conduct will not be tolerated in Wisconsin.” 
A person convicted of a grooming charge, under the bill, would be guilty of a Class G felony. The charge would increase to a Class F felony if the person is in a position of trust or authority, and to a Class E felony if the child has a disability and to a Class D felony if the violation involves two or more children. A convicted person would need to register as a sex offender.
During the hearing, Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) said she thinks the bill is important, but expressed some concerns about whether it could result in a “chilling effect” that would discourage people from taking on mentorship roles or interacting with children. She said she wanted to ensure that lawmakers got the definition of grooming correct.  
“I think that this is a bill that if we get it right, we are going to protect so many kids and if we get it wrong, we are going to put a lot of people at risk,” Emerson said. 
Nedweski said legislators should remember that the bill would be related to a pattern of behavior, not a one-time occurrence, that there would need to be the intention to “entice” a child and it would be up to a prosecutor to decide whether a person’s behavior fits the crime. 
“That’s why we work so hard to get the definition as right as we can,” Nedweski said, adding that she and her colleagues  have worked with law enforcement and prosecutors to develop the bill and looked at what other states have done. “Nothing is ever going to be 100% perfect, but I think we’re pretty darn close.” 
Rich Judge, DPI assistant state superintendent for the division of government and public affairs, registered in favor of the bill on behalf of the agency, though he did not provide testimony. DPI Superintendent Jill Underly has previously said defining grooming is one of the top steps the state can take to work to address the issue.

The winner of the primary will face Republican Bo Renshaw of North Little Rock in the March 3 general election.
Smith-Johnson and Holladay will have a rematch in the district’s regular primary, also on March 3, and the winner will face Renshaw again in the general election on Nov. 3. The winner of the November election will serve a two-year term in the Arkansas House beginning in January 2027. 
Data from the Pulaski County Election Commission showed 228 votes cast for Holladay and 59 for Smith-Johnson during the early voting period from Dec. 30 to Monday.
Early vote returns released Tuesday night by the Pulaski County Election Commission showed Holladay leading, but numbers from other precincts were not yet available.
Holladay lost to Wing in the November 2024 election by 316 votes. Smith-Johnson had never run for office before Wing’s resignation triggered the special election.

Both candidates told the Arkansas Advocate they support well-funded public education, affordable health care and expanding access to pre-K.
Holladay recruits health care professionals for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Smith-Johnson is an Air Force veteran and a prevention coordinator for the Army National Guard.
The winner of March’s general election will take office before April’s fiscal legislative session, which focuses on the state budget.
If the Democratic candidate wins in March or November, parts of North Little Rock and Sherwood will be represented by a Democrat in the House for the first time in 12 years.
Voters in the Arkansas River Valley’s Senate District 26 also went to the polls Tuesday to choose between five Republican candidates in their own special primary election. The winner will face independent candidate Adam Watson on March 3.

(File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A senior aide to former House Speaker Adrienne Jones has landed a new job just steps away from his old one.
Matt Jackson, who served for a year as chief of staff to Jones, will be named senior policy adviser to Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City).
The announcement is expected as soon Wednesday. Jackson will fill a vacancy created after Ross Seidman was elevated to senior counsel to Ferguson.
Jackson brings a deep knowledge of the budget to a staff that already includes Deputy Chief of Staff Jody Sprinkle. Gov. Wes Moore (D) and the General Assembly face a difficult budget year that includes a $1.5 billion structural budget deficit. The Senate will get first crack at the budget after Moore introduces it later this month.
Jackson was one of three senior aides fired, along with Jones’ Director of Legislative Affairs Michele Lambert and Communications Director Marty McGowan, by House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk just days after she was elected to succeed former House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County). Prior to becoming chief of staff in 2024, Jackson served as deputy chief of staff.
In addition to making leadership and committee appointments, Peña-Melnyk has spent the last four weeks rebuilding her staff in advance of next week’s start of the 2026 General Assembly, including the appointment Monday of Heather Mizeur as her communications director.
Healey hangs it up after 36 years
Del. Anne Healey (D-Prince George’s), the second-longest tenured member of the House of Delegates, announced Tuesday that she will not seek reelection this fall but will step down when her term ends next January, after 36 years in office.
In a lengthy statement, Healey gave no specific reason for stepping down, but recounted a tenure that saw historic firsts and sweeping change, in the county and the state.

“Over my 35 years in the legislature, I have seen our community grow more diverse, and I am proud to support policies that reflect and respect that diversity,” her statement said. “Bringing people together across differences has been among the most meaningful parts of my work, and it has been an honor to serve this community.”
Healey, first elected in 1990 after three years on the Hyattsville City Council, has been in Annapolis for six governors — William Donald Schaefer, Parris Glendening, Robert Ehrlich, Martin O’Malley, Larry Hogan and Wes Moore — and has served under five House speakers — Clayton Mitchell, Casper Taylor, Michael Busch, Adrienne Jones and, now, her “close friend and supporter” Joseline Peña-Melnyk.
She currently serves as chair of the House Rules and Executive Nominations Committee and previously served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive and Legislative Review and vice chair of the Ways and Means Committee. She was president of the Women Legislators of Maryland in 2022.
Healey cited a number of historic votes during her tenure, including the repeal of the death penalty and the recognition of same-sex civil union, as well as her honor in casting votes to elect Jones as the first woman and African American to lead either chamber of the General Assembly, and Peña-Melnyk as the first Afro-Latina and first immigrant to hold the job.
“My work in the General Assembly consistently focuses on opportunity and dignity for all,” she wrote. “I am a strong advocate for working people — supporting increases to the minimum wage, enacting paid sick leave, and standing with state employees, tradespeople, union members and low-income workers.”
“Serving the people of District 22 has been the honor of my life. I am grateful for the trust placed in me, proud of the work we have accomplished together, and confident in the future of our district, the Maryland House of Delegates, and the State of Maryland,” Healey said in her statement.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska is expected to have moderate statewide job growth this year, led by continued expansion in the oil and gas industry and the health care sector, according to a new state forecast.
The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development’s 2026 jobs forecast predicts an additional 3,000 jobs, amounting to 0.9% growth in employment for the coming year. That is  slightly lower than last year’s growth of 1.2%, according to the forecast.
“Alaska’s economic drivers are mostly strong going into 2026,” said the statewide forecast, written by state labor economist Karinne Wiebold and published in Alaska Economic Trends, the department’s monthly research magazine.
By percentage, the oil and gas sector is expected to be the state leader in job growth; the 1,000 new jobs expected this year would amount to an 11.1% increase over 2025 total.
Much of the expected growth is from Santos’ Pikka oil field, where construction is now completed and production is set to start this year. Additionally, there is a general upswing in industry activity, the forecast said.
Growth in the oil and gas industry is expected to bring job totals in that sector to an average of 10,000 for the year – still below the peak of 14,800 achieved in 2014 but about back to the level in 2019, the last year before the COVID-19 pandemic. Oil and gas employment fell to its lowest point in the pandemic year of 2021, at 6,700.
Lower oil prices are not expected to have much effect on job numbers, Wiebold said by email. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, oil prices have fluctuated widely, even as production in Alaska has been fairly stable, she said.

	An unknown factor that could dampen job growth, she said, has been created by ongoing ConocoPhillips layoffs. The layoffs are global and not targeted at the company’s Alaska operations specifically, so effects on the North Slope and elsewhere remain unclear.
Health care, construction still growing, but some sectors still losing jobs
The health care sector is expected to add the biggest number of jobs in 2026. The anticipated  1,100 new jobs amount to a 2.5% increase from 2025, according to the forecast. Health care has been a perennial employment growth leader, in part because of needs created by the aging of Alaska’s population, Wiebold said.
The construction sector is still expected to gain jobs, but not at the booming pace of the past two years. For four of the past five years, Alaska has received over $2 billion in federal capital funds, among the highest annual totals ever, the forecast ports out.
One of the major federally funded projects that is poised to start this year is the Port of Nome expansion. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in August awarded a $399.4 million contract for the first phase of the project, a 1,200-foot causeway extension with about 600 feet of new dock space. Further causeway and dock expansion, along with harbor deepening and other work, is planned in coming years.
Another big federally funded construction project, the new bridge and road reconfiguration at the Pretty Rocks landslide area at the midway point of the 92-mile Denali National Park road, is nearing completion, the forecast points out.
The transportation, warehousing and utilities sector, which is often related to construction activity, is expected to gain jobs, as well.
But some Alaska industries have yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels and are expected to continue to shed jobs this year.

	One of those is seafood processing, which accounts for most of Alaska’s manufacturing sector. The seafood industry has been in a long-term decline, but the coming year’s losses are expected to be modest compared to the past few years. A bright spot is the 2025 salmon harvest, which was much improved from the 2024 harvest.
A trouble spot is federal employment outside of the U.S. Department of Defense.
The state lost 300 non-military federal jobs last year, and the forecast predicts that another 400 will be lost in 2026.
Southeast Alaska, where a smaller percentage of the federal jobs are military, “is likely a bit more vulnerable to federal job cuts than other parts of the state,” Wiebold said.
Overall, Southeast Alaska is expected to lag behind other parts of the state in employment. The region is expected to actually lose about 100 jobs this year, amounting to a 0.3% decrease, according to a regional analysis that accompanied the statewide analysis.
Elsewhere, state analysts expect increases. Expected job growth in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough is 1.3% and 0.8% in both Anchorage and Fairbanks, according to regional projections.
One statewide factor that poses uncertainty is the failure by Congress so far to continue subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, the forecast said. If there is no action to change that situation, as many as 25,000 Alaskans will face sharply increasing health insurance costs, the forecast said. “Beyond dampening demand for health care, this could significantly reduce households’ ability to spend on other needs, with spillover effects across sectors,” the forecast said.

Advocates, including ballot co-sponsor Jo Giles at podium, host a launch event in Omaha. Jan. 5, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Advocates seeking an amendment to the Nebraska Constitution to “protect” and make it harder to tweak citizen-initiated laws, such as those around payday lending, gambling, minimum wage, paid sick leave and medical cannabis, will start gathering signatures this week for the 2026 ballot.
Proponents see the changes as necessary in light of recent legislative action or inaction on voter-backed laws. But some advocates of recent ballot measures and a few state senators said they worry about unintended consequences.
The new group, “Respect Nebraska Voters,” kicked off its 2026 campaign this week in Omaha. If successful, the effort would increase the threshold of lawmakers required to change voter-approved laws from 33 state senators (two-thirds) to 40 (four-fifths).

Nebraska’s officially nonpartisan one-house Legislature has 49 state lawmakers.
Former State Sen. Al Davis, a Sandhills rancher, helped lead a 2020 measure to cap payday lending rates. It passed with about 83% of the vote. He is now a co-sponsor of Respect Nebraska Voters and said the push could be important for the future of ballot measures.
“I fear we’re now in the unfortunate place where many everyday Nebraskans are left wondering if initiatives matter at all, or if lawmakers will simply reach for the eraser after every election,” Davis said. “I believe we can restore trust and do better by putting more power in voters’ hands.”
Petition specifics
If successful, the higher threshold for changes would apply to any ballot-passed laws approved since 2004 or beyond.
In 2004, voters set a threshold to tweak voter-enacted laws at 33 for any changes, no matter the magnitude, rather than 25 (a simple majority). The ballot measure passed with 55% of the vote. Thirty-three votes is the same threshold to shut off debate on contentious issues.
Constitutional amendments, which can’t be changed by the Legislature without a statewide vote, would largely remain unaffected. That includes a 2024 ballot measure banning most abortions after 12 weeks. Petitioners seeking constitutional amendments must secure more signatures than efforts around state statutes.

Attorneys with Respect Nebraska Voters confirmed the Legislature, under that amendment, could further restrict abortion with 25 or 33 votes, regardless of whether the 40-vote threshold is approved.
‘Didn’t come out of nowhere’
Dawn Essink, another sponsor of Respect Nebraska Voters and a previous volunteer for the minimum wage and paid sick leave campaigns in 2022 and 2024, said the effort “didn’t come out of nowhere.” She pointed to 2025 legislation to weaken both laws she fought for.
“They think Nebraskans don’t understand,” Essink said of senators. “They have said that we didn’t really know what we were voting for, or, even better, that the ballot language was confusing. That says a lot about what they think of the people they’re supposed to be representing.”
Under the group’s proposal, only legislation to facilitate and “safeguard” voter-enacted laws, and which “advance a compelling state interest by the least restrictive means,” could be passed by the Legislature after a successful ballot measure. That could set up new legal challenges.
The effort also constitutionally seeks to prevent the Legislature from making ballot measures tougher to run with new state laws. It would not address constitutional requirements for signature gathering.
“Such laws may include neutral, ministerial and administrative laws necessary to facilitate the fair, orderly and efficient administration of these powers, but no law shall be valid that conditions, restricts, burdens or otherwise impairs the exercise of these powers,” the proposed constitutional amendment states.

Jo Giles, executive director of the Women’s Fund of Omaha and the third of the group’s sponsors, said the effort is needed to protect Nebraskans’ rights to decide for themselves. Giles was one of the ballot sponsors for the paid sick leave campaign in 2024, which would have guaranteed paid sick leave for all workers beginning Oct. 1, 2025, until lawmakers stepped in.
Raising the threshold, Giles said, is a “common-sense safeguard that will ensure elected officials respect the will of voters.”
“The bottom line is simple: Nebraskans know what’s best for our communities. We make thoughtful decisions at the ballot box,” Giles said. “This amendment will ensure those decisions are respected.”
‘Responsible implementation’
Shelley Gillen, a medical cannabis advocate for more than a decade with Nebraska Families 4 Medical Cannabis, said she worries the effort could instead lock in legislative gridlock on complex issues. She helped the successful 2024 push to legalize and regulate the medicine.
Supporters of medical cannabis joined together in support of two related ballot measures for the 2024 general election at a public hearing for Initiative Measures 437 and 438 at the University of Nebraska at Omaha on Oct. 25, 2024. Among those in the photo are Dominic Gillen, far left, and Shelley Gillen, left front row, who is kneeling by their son, Will Gillen. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
She said when voters are unhappy, the answer isn’t to “freeze” policy or create additional barriers that could slow progress for patients and voters.
“We believe in respecting voters, but respecting voters also means ensuring their decisions can actually be implemented,” Gillen said. “On issues like medical cannabis, this amendment would make responsible implementation and necessary adjustments far more difficult.”
State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln had worked with paid sick leave supporters and some businesses for “minor adjustments” in 2025. A spokesperson for the paid sick leave campaign said the group was “not concerned with” Ballard’s original proposal.
Broader changes from State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney that he said were needed to make the law “workable” later merged with Ballard’s bill. The package passed 33-16 and ultimately helped spur Respect Nebraska Voters.
‘Double-edged sword’
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair continues to work with medical cannabis advocates to try to aid implementation of the 2024 laws. A 2025 bill fell short 23-22, well short of the current 33-vote threshold.

In 2026, Hansen said he’s still working to get to 33 for some tweaks, such as ensuring the voter-created Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission has a proper rollout and doesn’t further hinder Nebraskans’ ability to get medicine. Hansen’s 2025 efforts faced stiff opposition from Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., among others.
“It’d be hard enough to get 33 people to vote for it, let alone 40,” Hansen said of medical cannabis proposals. “It’s kind of a little bit of a double-edged sword.”
Giles, asked specifically about medical cannabis, said she and other coalition members feel similar frustration over medical cannabis implementation and hope legislators act.
“We know that elected officials can do the right thing at any time, and so we hope, for them, that there is an easier process to upholding the will of voters,” Giles said.
80% threshold for voters?
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, chair of the Legislature’s Business and Labor Committee, which forwarded the proposed changes to the minimum wage and paid sick leave initiatives to the full Legislature in 2025, said lawmakers are watching the Respect Nebraska Voters campaign.

If an 80% threshold is good for lawmakers, Kauth wondered Tuesday whether lawmakers should require ballot measures to pass with at least 80% of the vote, too.
Since 2004, just one ballot measure exceeded 80%. That was in 2020, to cap payday lending costs.
A ‘single subject’
Legalized gambling advocate Lance Morgan, the president and CEO of Ho-Chuck, Inc., the economic development wing of the Winnebago Tribe, said he also had concerns about the Respect Nebraska Voters effort. 
Morgan’s company helped fund 2020 ballot measures to authorize casino gambling and games of chance. He said it was one of the most economically impactful ballot measures for the state, but there was room for tweaks.
Changes to voter-approved laws might also be necessary with the Nebraska Constitution’s requirement that ballot measures, as well as legislative bills, can only deal with a “single subject,” Morgan said.

In 2020, there were three gambling measures on the ballot — one constitutional amendment and two state laws — and the Nebraska Supreme Court invalidated a medical cannabis constitutional amendment on “single-subject” grounds. 
The justices have given greater deference in defining a “single subject” with legislation than with initiatives.
As a result, ballot measures are often broader than legislative bills likely would be, absent the legislative negotiations and compromises and facing an up-or-down statewide vote at the ballot.
“I think that, given the situation in Nebraska, the fact that you have a really hard single-question rule, you’re going to need to have some sort of flexibility built into the system,” Morgan said Monday. “Or you’ll have trouble actually implementing what you want to do.”
State Sens. Eliot Bostar, Jason Prokop and Stan Clouse pushed for the Legislature to act in 2025 on sports betting for a narrower bill, and earlier legislative proposals for paid sick leave and medical cannabis that stalled were similarly narrow at first.
If the Legislature doesn’t act in the next few months, Morgan said he and supporters of legalizing online sports betting will pursue the 2026 ballot.

Morgan said the Respect Nebraska Voters effort might be a “step too far” and acknowledged making tweaks “shouldn’t be easy, but it shouldn’t be impossible, either.”
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln told 10/11 News in December she’s unsure whether Respect Nebraska Voters could be targeted over the single-subject clause. Giles had said she thinks the group is OK, as the focus is on increasing the vote threshold for ballot initiatives.
Referendums, legislative operations
Conrad had also said an existing “remedy” is a referendum campaign or voting out lawmakers. She told 10/11 she worries Respect Nebraska Voters could make it harder to fix technical flaws or address implementation, or spur competing initiatives.
Paid Sick Leave for Nebraskans, for example, elected not to pursue a referendum in 2025.

The Respect Nebraska Voters changes would not prevent lawmakers from reinstating measures that voters repealed in referendum campaigns. Voters have reversed three legislatively passed laws since 2004: bills to dissolve Class I schools (2006), end the death penalty (2016) and set aside tax dollars for private school costs (2024).
Hansen said he wonders about a “slippery slope” in ballot measures dictating legislative operations, such as moves to prohibit secret ballots for legislative leadership or change the threshold needed to pass contentious legislation over minority opposition.
‘Unexpected consequences’
Davis, a one-term senator from Hyannis, said a legislator’s job is to write laws, though he said there are “rare circumstances” where it might be appropriate to amend past voter-enacted laws.
“But only after seeing them take effect and noticing unexpected consequences,” Davis said.
Giles and supporters estimated the changes under the Ballard-Strommen bill removed voter-approved paid sick leave protections for roughly 140,000 workers, including 14 and 15 year olds, workers in businesses with fewer than 10 employees and temporary or seasonal agricultural workers.
Employers can still choose to offer paid sick leave to those employees.

Giles said it’s “pretty clear” there was not a compelling interest in a bill that “gutted” earned time off.
Asked whether the 40-vote threshold was a risk worth taking, as it would require another ballot measure or 40 votes to expand paid sick leave, Giles said, “I don’t think it’s a sacrifice. I think it is respecting the will of the people.”
Giles and Essink said opponents of the 2024 paid sick leave campaign didn’t fund an opposition campaign, and the measure passed with 75% support among voters. Giles said business and “special” interests then went to “friends” in the Legislature to fight. 
Minimum wage and campaign finance
Giles acknowledged the group’s effort would likely increase campaign spending on the front end, a prospect that worries State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. 
Raybould, a former grocery store executive now in her 16th and final year of public service, is lead sponsor of a bill to cap annual increases to the minimum wage, changing what voters approved and set to begin next year and aimed at matching increases in the cost of living. Raybould’s bill would instead lock in minimum wage bumps at 1.75%, smaller than average inflation in recent years, though a guaranteed increase, saying it would make the increases easier for businesses to handle.

The bill remains one vote away from passing and, if it maintains its supporters, would have 33 votes to pass in 2026. She described her bill as having an “incredibly compelling economic impact.”
Speaking with the Examiner on Monday, Raybould said she worries the new ballot initiative “ties the hands of the Legislature,” which works with voters who are often described as Nebraska’s “second house.” 
“I thought we were a co-equal branch of government,” Raybould said, “working together, collaboratively and cooperatively, for the benefit of the majority of our fellow Nebraskans.”
Raybould said no senator disrespects the “will of our voters,” whose choices at the ballot box also empower Nebraska’s 49 senators to govern. She worried about future harmful ballot measures lawmakers might have a harder time counteracting, if needed. 
‘Proteger nuestra libertad de votar’
Lu Turco, a current junior at Millard North High School, asked voters Monday to get out and help young workers through Respect Nebraska Voters, teens he said are “first” on lawmakers’ list to roll back pay. Raybould’s minimum wage bill would create a “youth training wage” for workers aged 14 or 15.

Turco said the ballot measure could make a difference for the next generation.
“Labor is labor, regardless of who is doing it,” he said. “Unfairly undercutting young workers is harmful, especially after voters made it clear that they wanted these rights and wages for everyone.”
Perla Ochoa, a South Omaha community organizer with Heartland Workers Center, said Tuesday: “Estar recolectando firmas para proteger nuestra libertad de votar sobre los temas que afectan a nuestras comunidades. Esto se trata de proteger los derechos y los salarios de los trabajadores y mucho más.”
It means, “We are collecting signatures to protect our freedom to vote on the issues that affect our communities. This is about protecting workers’ rights and wages, and much more.”
Other supporters of the campaign include the Nebraska State AFL-CIO, League of Women Voters of Nebraska, Nebraska Appleseed, Civic Nebraska, Voices for Children in Nebraska, Nebraska Civic Engagement Table and Second House Collaborative.
Respect Nebraska Voters would need valid signatures from 10% of registered voters by July 2, or at least 125,000. The signatures must include at least 5% of registered voters in 38 of Nebraska’s 93 counties.
Asked why the 40-vote threshold plus additional constitutional language is the solution, Giles said it’s already a “huge lift” to reach the ballot.
“It should also be a huge lift for lawmakers to undo the will of voters.”
 




Reaching the ballot in Nebraska
Nebraska has two types of statewide ballot measures: initiatives and referendums. Initiatives create or amend state laws and constitutional amendments, while referendums repeal all or part of recently passed state laws. Both types are voted on during general elections in November.
Signatures for initiatives are due four months before the election, while signatures for referendums must be gathered within 90 days of the end of a legislative session in which a targeted law was passed.
Minimum signature thresholds are different for referendums and initiatives:

To repeal state laws: 5% of registered voters (if 10% or more, the law is suspended until the election).
To amend or create state laws: 7% of registered voters.
To amend or create state constitutional provisions: 10% of registered voters.

All ballot measures also require geographic distribution of gathered signatures, from 5% of registered voters in 38 of Nebraska’s 93 counties, in addition to the bulk requirement.
As of Jan. 1, there were 1.25 million registered voters in Nebraska. The total signatures needed are calculated when signatures are due. That’s July 2 for 2026 initiatives, for state laws or constitutional amendments.

Sanchez, 50, a five-term member of the city’s Common Council, will succeed Bobby Sanchez, a Democrat who resigned the House seat after winning the open race for mayor in November.
Results collected by the Democrats showed her winning by nearly a 2-1 margin in a district held by Democrats for more than half a century. Turnout was low, with fewer than 600 votes cast.
The representative-elect emigrated from Carolina, Puerto Rico to New Britain in 1994, settling in a House district that now is 56% Latino. Her predecessor, who is no relation, recruited her to run for council a decade ago.
Vaughan, 51, had first run for the seat in 2024, winning 29.9% of the vote against Bobby Sanchez. The showing was the best by a Republican in recent cycles.
Once the results are certified and she is sworn in, Democrats will outnumber Republicans in the House, 101 to 49, with one vacancy to be filled in a special election next week in the 139th District of Ledyard, Montville and Norwich.
The vacancy was left by the death of Rep. Kevin Ryan, D-Montiville, on Nov. 23.

Tim Walz speaks at a news conference touting the launch of Minnesota's paid family leave program in Minneapolis on Jan. 6, 2026. (Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer) A day after ending his campaign for a historic third term — and possibly his political career — an animated Gov. Tim Walz offered a preview of how he plans to spend the remainder of his term: defending his record, shoring up his legacy and hammering Republicans with the abandon of a man no longer chasing votes.
“For Republicans here, I have more energy than I’ve ever had. I am committed to this state more than I’ve ever been,” Walz said. “Expect for the next 11 months for me to ride you like you’ve never been ridden to make sure you’re doing your job.”
And then, “Republicans want to tear the state down. Republicans want to tell you it’s too dangerous to walk down the streets. Republicans want to tell you there’s nothing good comes out of Minneapolis (and) St. Paul. Republicans want to tell you everybody with brown skin is stealing money or that they’re not welcome here. They want to do nothing to improve this state.”
Walz was speaking at a news conference in the Coliseum Building in south Minneapolis to celebrate the launch of the state’s new paid family leave program — on time and under budget, according to his Department of Employment and Economic Development.
The program will be a defining accomplishment of his tenure as long as it isn’t enveloped in fraud and abuse like that which has plagued other state-run programs under his watch.
He said he had faith in the safeguards against paid leave fraud and would take accountability for any failures of the program — as well as its successes.
“If the buck stops with me on when there’s problems, the buck stops with me on successes,” Walz said. “Not a single Republican supported this. So every Minnesotan from here on forward, whoever uses this program, there is no bit of thanks that would go to Republican legislators.”
He chastised President Trump for leading a “petty, vile administration that doesn’t care about the well-being of Minnesotans,” in the wake of a freeze on federal child care funding and the deployment of thousands of immigration officers in what the Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest operation ever.
He condemned Republican candidates for remaining silent after Trump shared a video to Truth Social promoting a wretched conspiracy theory that Walz ordered the assassination of his friend and colleague, former House Speaker Melissa Hortman. (The Hortmans’ grown children issued a statement Sunday pleading with Trump to remove the video.)
“They are unwilling to stand with Melissa Hortman’s children, and I want to tell you this for those legislators who went and shed crocodile tears at her funeral, shame on you,” Walz said.
The return of the Walz of the euphoric, early days of the 2024 presidential campaign as Kamala Harris’ running mate might seem surprisingly defiant coming a day after what was surely one of the worst days of the worst years of his political career.
But with the indefatigable optimism that has long been his trademark, Walz said he has plenty of time to shore up his legacy by rooting out the fraud and helping a Democrat win in November.
“I have a year to continue to improve on a record that I think will stand up against anybody’s, a record that has made Minnesota better, a record that makes people want to come here, and a record that (has) respected not only the dignity of people, but the idea of rule of law,” Walz said.
After he leaves office next year at 62 years old — still young for a politician — Walz hinted he might leave public life to return to his roots.
“What I’m really good at is I’m a really good geography teacher,” Walz said. “I would find the joy in getting back in there.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1230796-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 21:57:28.481198

Ballot Initiative 4 would revoke all the powers given to “artificial persons,” namely taking aim at corporations, which are granted legal status by the state. Then, the initiative would “regrant” powers, but prohibit corporations from political activities and politicking for ballot issues.
However, in the ruling, written by Justice Jim Rice, the court said that the initiative makes too many changes and doesn’t allow voters to decide on each one separately. The 13-page ruling leans into several challenges brought by groups recently involving constitutional changes and the power of the Attorney General, Austin Knudsen, a Republican.
But the state’s highest court didn’t decide several of the issues the group, Transparent Election Initiative, raised, saying that the one-subject rule was fatal to the initiative, and if supporters of the measure want to present them to voters, they must do it with at least two separate ballot initiatives.
Jeff Mangan, a former Montana Commissioner of Political Practices, has spearheaded the effort to curb the amount of money that flows into the political cycle and Montana elections through the Transparent Election Initiative.
“Montana has a citizens’ initiative process that we can all be proud of, one that allows Montanans to roll up their sleeves to enact positive change for the betterment of family, friends, and neighbors.  I hear from Montanans every day how much corporate and dark money is damaging our political process. It is a privilege to work on a matter that is so important, and that is exactly what we will continue to do,” Mangan told the Daily Montanan on Tuesday. “We appreciate and respect the work of the court. We are grateful for the guidance and understand what the court is saying. We will re-file by the end of this week. Now, I need to get back to work!”
Montana politics in 2024, with a critical U.S. Senate race that saw incumbent Democrat Jon Tester beaten by political newcomer, Tim Sheehy, brought in more than $200 million in a state of around 1.2 million. Just the Tester-Sheehy race alone topped $169 million. 
The court said that while it understood the arguments of the group, its primary concern was protecting the voters of Montana and the constitution.
“The separate-vote requirement was designed to aid voters in casting their votes on constitutional issues, and as a check on the possible action of grouping several issues under one innocuous title,” the opinion said.
The decision explained that the language of the proposed amendment first revoked all powers of existing corporations, then regrants most of them, while prohibiting corporations from exercising political power. Meanwhile, the organization argued that all of those legal maneuvers were part of one overarching plan to change how corporations are treated in Montana.
The court dismissed that argument.
“We agree with the Attorney General that, even if a proposed initiative has an overarching goal, voters must be allowed to vote on each substantive change that is not closely related,” the court said.
The court said that it counted at least two items the proposed ballot initiative changes.
“Here, Transparent Election Initiative designated a target — the power to spend in politics — and casts a much wider net that revokes all powers,” the court said. “In this case, a voter may want to limit artificial persons’ ability to spend money on election or ballot-issue activity, but not limit any other powers that artificial persons may currently exercise in this state.”
Previously, the court has ruled against other initiatives that “log rolled” several issues into one ballot initiative. That is a technique that brings together disparate policies and tries to garner enough support from a wide swath of supporters.
“Although BI-4 does not combine unrelated amendments in an attempt to secure support from different groups, it would force voters who support abolishing corporate spending on elections or ballot issue to support … limit the rights of other entities … and potentially limited the powers of such organizations to engage in activities other than election and ballot issue activities in significant but unspecified other ways.”

The hefty sum falls below what the Trump administration gave to some other states, and the rough average of $200 million to each. But the state is in the middle of the pack when it comes to funding per rural resident. 
The return on Washington’s application for $1 billion over the next five years from the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program didn’t necessarily come as a shock.
“I don’t think anyone was surprised that we received less than 200,” said Jacqueline Barton True, the Washington State Hospital Association’s vice president of advocacy and rural health. “We certainly internally had operated under the impression that we weren’t going to get $200 million.”
To Elya Prystowsky, the executive director of the Rural Collaborative, the award was a “pleasant surprise.”
“I would have been happy if we got $100 million,” said Prystowsky, whose organization represents Washington’s rural hospitals. “So $181 million is $81 million of gravy, as far as I’m concerned.”
Texas topped the list of funding recipients with $281 million, but the state has over 30 million residents compared to 8 million in Washington. 
Alaska got the next largest share, $272 million, followed by California and Montana, both with about $233 million. 
Democratic-led states tended to fare worse than those run by Republicans. Less rural states also got less money. 
Half of the $50 billion fund will be evenly distributed to all states with approved applications. But assessing how the rest of the money is distributed is complicated because it factors in the number of rural residents and medical facilities in each state, among other things.
Washington, which is less rural than many other states, was in the bottom 10 for funding awarded last week. The state has also had a tense relationship with the Trump administration and is at odds with it on health policy issues.
Here, the hospital association will help dole out infrastructure funding the state receives as part of the federal program. The association’s Barton True expects the state to start spending the money within a couple months.
If the award stays the same over the next five years, Washington would receive about $906 million. But the money states get will be recalculated each year.
Washington aims to use the money for an array of initiatives to not just boost rural hospital finances but reshape the health care system in these communities. 
This includes investing in new technologies, growing the rural health workforce, improving health care in tribal communities, building more community-based care and expanding the rural behavioral health system. Over $300 million was earmarked for hospital infrastructure in the state’s application.
“We could do a lot of good work with $181 million,” Prystowsky said.
It’s unclear what work may be on the chopping block due to the lower-than-requested funding. 
The state Health Care Authority is working to trim its budget plan, but not eliminate any ideas entirely. That revised plan is due to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services by the end of the month.
“Although our state did not receive the full amount requested, we remain committed to improving the health and wellbeing of people living in rural Washington,” Health Care Authority spokesperson Rachelle Alongi said in an email.
Congress created the new funding stream to help make up for heavy cuts to Medicaid that are expected to disproportionately hurt rural health care providers. Advocates say the $50 billion won’t fill the gap Republicans created last year with their so-called “big, beautiful bill,” which reduced Medicaid spending to help offset the expense of lowering taxes. 
“This funding will not replace the dramatic cuts imposed by the Republican-led Congress and the White House,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement, “but these funds will help fortify rural communities against what’s to come. It is a significant investment in Washington’s rural health care.”
In Washington’s rural communities, federal spending from Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, is set to drop over $4 billion in the next decade, according to an analysis by nonpartisan health research group KFF.
The sums from the rural health fund per rural resident varied widely across states, according to a KFF analysis released Tuesday.
Despite relatively modest awards, New Jersey and Rhode Island are getting the most dollars per resident in rural communities, according to KFF.
While big states like California and Texas and some states in the Midwest are getting under $100 per resident. Washington’s award is $162 for each of its 1.1 million rural residents, the KFF data show, landing the state 29th on the list of awards when using that metric.
Zachary Levinson, the lead author of the KFF analysis, noted 10 states are receiving less than $100 per rural resident, while eight states received more than $500.

A demerit for Washington also came from its alignment — or lack thereof — with the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” policies. These policies include reestablishing the Presidential Fitness Test and restricting how federal food stamp benefits can be spent. 
A Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesperson said the funding amounts were based on a formula that includes a “combination of data-driven factors, merit review of RHT plans, and objective evaluation of state policy actions and commitments to those policies.”
“CMS did not require states to adopt any specific policy to receive funding, and politics played no role in funding decisions,” the spokesperson said Tuesday.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hospital_beds_720.jpg,,,2026-01-06 20:12:16.866968

Mike Jones is headed back to the General Assembly — this time as a state senator — after winning Tuesday’s special election in Virginia Senate District 15, a Democratic-leaning seat vacated late last year by Ghazala Hashmi.
By 8 p.m., Jones had defeated Republican John Thomas by a margin of 67.8-32% out of 15,409 votes cast, according to unofficial election results, securing a seat that stretches across much of Richmond and parts of Chesterfield County. 
The win caps a fast-moving political reshuffle sparked by November’s statewide elections and ensures Democrats retain control of the district as lawmakers prepare to convene for the 2026 General Assembly session next week.
Jones’ victory immediately triggered another result down-ballot. In House District 77 — the Richmond-based seat Jones vacated to run for the Senate — Democrat Charlie Schmidt won a special election of his own Tuesday, defeating Republican Richard Stonage by 76.5-23.4% out of 5,970 votes cast. Smith will fill the remainder of Jones’ unexpired House term.
The twin victories keep both districts in Democratic hands amid a period of unusual turnover in the legislature, driven largely by lawmakers joining the administration of incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger, who will be sworn in later next week.
State Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said Tuesday’s  results underscored Democrats’ momentum heading into the 2026 session.
“I am proud to congratulate Senator-elect Mike Jones and Delegate-elect Charlie Schmidt on their decisive victories,” Bagby said in a statement, calling the races “two more crucial wins for the Democratic Party of Virginia.” 
He said Jones has already demonstrated leadership “with results, integrity, and a deep commitment to the people he serves,” citing his work both in elected office and through his faith. 
Bagby also praised Schmidt as “an accomplished attorney and longtime community advocate” with a record of fighting for civil rights, supporting small businesses and advancing environmental justice. 
“Together,” Bagby said, “these victories send a clear message: when we remain laser-focused on making Virginia more affordable and a place where all can thrive, we can win and will keep winning.”
Tuesday’s contests were set in motion after Hashmi, a Richmond-area senator first elected in 2019, vacated her seat following her election as Virginia’s lieutenant governor. Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, in December called Tuesday’s special election to fill the vacancy, compressing campaign timelines and forcing parties to quickly settle on nominees.
Jones, who had represented House District 77 since 2020, entered the Senate race soon after Hashmi’s elevation and emerged from a closely watched Democratic nominating contest last month. That primary exposed some internal party tensions but ultimately solidified Jones as the consensus standard-bearer for Democrats in the district.
Republicans nominated Thomas, who framed the race around public safety and cost-of-living concerns, but the district’s recent voting history and high-profile Democratic turnout efforts proved difficult to overcome.
Jones resigned his House seat shortly after securing the Democratic nomination, prompting a second special election in HD-77 that also landed on Tuesday’s ballot.
Tuesday’s outcomes preserve Democrats’ numbers in both chambers at a critical moment. 
While the party increased its majority in the House following the Nov. 4 elections, several departures — particularly from safe Democratic districts — have required leadership to juggle special elections even as committee assignments and legislative priorities for 2026 are being finalized.
In recent weeks, Democratic leaders have acknowledged that the churn has created logistical challenges but said it has not altered the party’s policy agenda heading into the new session.
Jones is expected to be sworn in quickly, allowing him to participate fully when lawmakers return to Richmond next week. He has built a reputation in the House as a reliable vote for Democratic leadership, with a legislative portfolio that includes criminal justice reform, labor protections and education funding.
Schmidt, the incoming delegate from HD-77 and self-proclaimed progressive Democrat, ran on a platform emphasizing continuity with Jones’ record and local ties to the district. 
The Richmond-area races are part of a broader wave of special elections unfolding across Virginia in the wake of November’s results. Several Democratic lawmakers have stepped down after accepting administration appointments, leaving vacancies that must be filled before or during the early weeks of the 2026 session.
Three additional contests are already on the calendar or expected soon in other parts of the state.
With Tuesday’s results, Democrats enter the 2026 session having successfully defended two key Richmond-area seats, even as the pace of special elections shows little sign of slowing in the weeks ahead.

Dan McKeon of Amherst before the session begins Wednesday.

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chair of the Exec Board, sent a letter to McKeon on Monday explaining the findings of the committee’s internal investigation and outlining the processes for an expulsion hearing following its recommendation.
The board recommended expelling McKeon following allegations that he had inappropriately touched a legislative staffer, allegations he denies. But the board also noted what it described as a “demonstrated pattern of behavior.”
The alleged incident with the staffer prompted the Legislature’s investigation and separately led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency by the Nebraska State Patrol in September.
The criminal allegation has since been downgraded to a misdemeanor disturbing the peace charge, to which McKeon has pled not guilty after initially attempting to plead no contest but changing his mind.
The incident took place at an end-of-session party this spring, which is typically attended by a mix of lawmakers, staffers, friends and family. In Hansen’s letter he says the staffer claims McKeon jokingly asked her if “she was going to Hawaii to ‘get laid,’” and according to the Patrol, also accused the senator of making “inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing.”

Hansen said the Exec Board found that McKeon’s conduct during this incident violates the Nebraska Legislature’s Workplace Harassment Policy, which defines sexual harassment to include “sexually oriented jokes, stories or discussions.”

McKeon has argued there was nothing lewd about this exchange, and claimed the incident has been “exaggerated and mischaracterized.”
“The conduct alleged does not rise to the level of severity attributed to it,” McKeon wrote in response to Hansen’s letter. “I made an ill-advised pun and gave a brief, non-sexual pat on the back as I departed.”
Hansen’s letter gave more details into the alleged “pattern of behavior” the Exec Board noted as a contributor to its recommendation of expulsion. The letter noted separate allegations claimed McKeon made an inappropriate joke in the presence of a female staffer during his first week in office, and said there are more pending complaints alleging McKeon has used “unprofessional language regarding colleagues and individuals of other races.”
McKeon asserted that Hansen’s letter included “material inaccuracies and unsupported characterizations.” He said he has not received any “reports, findings or notice” of the other allegations Hansen’s letter mentioned.
As Nebraska lawmakers consider first expulsion motion, here’s how the process works

Expulsion is the strongest disciplinary measure the board can recommend, and kicking a state senator out of the Legislature requires 33 votes.
Hansen’s letter said the Executive Board has prepared a resolution for McKeon’s expulsion that is ready to be introduced Wednesday, the first day of the 60-day session. The chairman said he intends to schedule a hearing on the resolution Jan. 12, which will include only invited testifiers including McKeon or his lawyer, and outside counsel that conducted the investigation.
McKeon argued his actions do not warrant expulsion, and said removing him would set a dangerous precedent for lawmakers moving forward.
“If disputed allegations, incomplete records, or undisclosed assertions are sufficient to justify expulsion, then no member of this body is secure from removal based on shifting standards rather than established facts,” McKeon wrote.

State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst faces possible expulsion after a unanimous recommendation from the Nebraska Legislature’s Executive Board, a panel of legislative leaders that acts as the branch’s human resources department.
The board recommended expelling McKeon following allegations that he had inappropriately touched a legislative staffer. But the board also noted what it described as a “demonstrated pattern of behavior.”

McKeon has made clear he has no plans to resign. On Monday, McKeon’s lawyer Perry Pirsch sent a letter lobbying lawmakers to vote against the expulsion motion, arguing that expelling McKeon risks opening the door for other senators to be expelled with no more than a “contested narrative.”
“Expulsion should not be used as a political shortcut or as a substitute for an election absent extraordinary circumstances,” Pirsch wrote in the letter.
While the Nebraska Legislature has never officially expelled a senator, Clerk of the Legislature Brandon Metzler noted there have been cases where expulsion was considered, but the senator in question resigned or the session ended before the option could be pursued.
“It is unprecedented in the sense of, yes the Legislature has never expelled somebody,” Metzler said. “But I think to say that we’ve never had a situation that rose to this level isn’t quite the same thing.”
As with any disciplinary measure within a legislative session, Metzler said the process starts with a legislative resolution, which can be introduced as soon as the session begins Wednesday.
In a Monday letter to McKeon, State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, the Exec Board chair, said the board has drafted a resolution that is ready to be introduced Wednesday.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Past resolutions typically listed supporting evidence to back up the recommended disciplinary action. In Hansen’s letter, he details some information from the board’s investigation and noted there are separate allegations claiming McKeon made an inappropriate joke in the presence of a female staffer, and joked about people of other races.
Once the resolution is referred to a standing committee — likely the Exec Board — there must be seven days between the notice of a public hearing and the date of the legislative hearing. Hansen said he intends to schedule the hearing Jan. 12, and only include invited testifiers. He said those testifiers can include McKeon or his attorney and outside counsel who conducted the investigation.
If the committee votes to advance the resolution, floor debate can begin immediately, Metzler said. An expulsion motion requires just one round of floor debate and needs 33 votes to remove a sitting senator.
If successful, Metzler said the measure would take effect immediately. McKeon’s seat representing District 41 would become vacant until Gov. Jim Pillen appoints a replacement. Later this year, the state would hold a special election in LD 41 to decide who serves the final two years of McKeon’s term.

The freeze would affect about $10 billion for the Child Care Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, and the Social Services Block Grant program. The affected states besides Colorado are Minnesota, New York, California and Illinois, as reported by The New York Times. The states all have Democratic governors.
The freeze was first reported by the New York Post, which cited unnamed officials.

As of Tuesday afternoon, Colorado leadership had not received communication about the potential freeze from the federal government.
“Beyond reports in the media, the state has not been officially notified of any changes to these funding sources,” Shelby Wieman, a spokesperson for Gov. Jared Polis, wrote in an email. “These resources support families in need and help them access food and much more. If true, it would be awful to see the federal government targeting the most needy families and children this way.”
The freeze would affect about $7 billion in TANF funding, $2.4 billion for the CCDF and $870 million for social services grants, according to the Times.










Therefore, I urge my Republican colleagues to leverage their relationships with the administration to end this blatantly political attack against the most vulnerable families in Colorado.


– U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette of Denver


Colorado, which administers its TANF program through Colorado Works, receives about $136 million in block funding for TANF every year, according to Colorado Department of Human Services spokesperson Haysel Hernandez. In 2024, a Colorado family of three received a maximum monthly TANF benefit of $585, according to the National Center for Children in Poverty.
“The federal government has not yet notified CDHS of any changes to these funding sources. These resources support Colorado families in need and help them access job training, financial support, child care and other important social services on the road to self sufficiency,” Hernandez wrote in an email. “Should these funding sources change, we remain committed to supporting our families in Colorado and will continue to advocate for the appropriate programs and services to help our families thrive.”
Colorado was also allocated about $140 million in federal funds for child care programs last year, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That money pays for care for children in low-income families.
The funding freeze follows a surge of fraud cases in Minnesota involving misuse of government funds for safety-net programs.There have not been comparable fraud charges or allegations in Colorado, but fraud reportedly is a justification for the freeze cited by officials.
“For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,” DHHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement. “Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes. We will ensure these states are following the law and protecting hard-earned taxpayer money.”
In a statement, U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat and member of the House Litigation Task Force, said she is “exploring legal action to reverse these unlawful cuts.”
“This devastating freeze will take food from families across the state, in both red and blue areas,” she said. “Therefore, I urge my Republican colleagues to leverage their relationships with the administration to end this blatantly political attack against the most vulnerable families in Colorado.”

After the sudden death of U.S. Rep Doug LaMalfa, a CalMatters reporter who covered him for 20 years reflects on his life and legacy.


If you hadn’t met Doug LaMalfa, his campaign signs probably seemed like the sort of eye-rolling attempt at folksy charm some slick politician who’s never had dirt under his fingernails might use to appeal to rural voters.
“He’s one of us!” they read, a cartoon cowboy hat perched off an “L” in LaMalfa’s name. 
But as I covered LaMalfa’s political career over the past two decades, often critically, I came to appreciate those signs as an accurate description of LaMalfa, the rural North State’s longtime Republican member of Congress. He died in surgery after being rushed to a Butte County hospital Monday for a medical emergency.
LaMalfa was 65. 
Love or hate his hardline, far-right Republican politics – President Donald Trump praised him Tuesday for voting “for me 100% of the time” — LaMalfa was as unique a political figure as you’ll find in Washington, D.C. or in Sacramento. When he said he was “one of us,” it wasn’t an act. LaMalfa, a fourth-generation rice farmer from Butte County, was as engaged with and emblematic of the people in his district as any politician I’ve known.  
You were much more likely to see LaMalfa having a burger and a beer at a watering hole like The Tackle Box in Chico or at the gas station filling up one of his classic cars than you were to see him standing at a lectern in a suit.
From the rice fields of the Sacramento Valley to Modoc County’s border with Oregon, odds were high you’d see LaMalfa’s tall, husky frame as he mingled with his constituents at some Rotary Club luncheon, a county fair, 4-H event, community festival or car show. He was usually wearing faded jeans and scuffed cowboy boots. 
Former Republican gubernatorial candidate and ex-state Sen. Brian Dahle, a farmer from Lassen County, represented much of LaMalfa’s rural district in the Legislature. He said he was in awe of how plugged in LaMalfa was.
“He’s in Modoc. He’s in Plumas. He’s in Siskiyou, He’s in Chico. He’s everywhere and then he’s on a plane five hours back and forth (to Washington, D.C.),” Dahle said. “It was amazing. … I always used to say, ‘You can’t out-backyard barbecue Doug LaMalfa because you’ll go to a backyard barbecue, and he’ll be there.’”
I grew up in LaMalfa’s district and most of my friends and family still live there. They bumped into LaMalfa all the time. I also covered what felt like 100 events featuring LaMalfa as a reporter fresh out of college, first at the Auburn Journal in Placer County and then for six years at the Record Searchlight in Redding in Shasta County. Later, during seven years at The Sacramento Bee, my reporting on environmental issues often took me home to LaMalfa’s district.
My career as a reporter began as LaMalfa was beginning his career in state and federal politics. After graduating from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and working on his family farm, LaMalfa was elected to the Legislature in 2002 first as a Republican member of the Assembly, then as a state senator. 
A politician unlike any other
LaMalfa was elected to Congress in 2012, and held the seat ever since. He planned to try to hold onto it after California voters in November passed Proposition 50, which redrew LaMalfa’s district to skew Democratic. Former California Sen. President Pro Tem Mike McGuire has announced he’s running for LaMalfa’s seat. His death shakes up the political landscape considerably, leaving uncertainty over who will be the Republican challenger in the expected special election to replace him. 
Over the years, I covered LaMalfa, sometimes unflatteringly. At the Searchlight, I wrote about the federal subsidies his family farm received, even as Republicans like him at the time were discussing slashing “welfare” programs for the poor. I wrote about how much money he charged taxpayers for mileage as he zipped around his massive district in one of his gas-guzzling sports cars.
At the Bee, I wrote about how LaMalfa, who as a farmer knew his way around heavy equipment, got into a bulldozer in Sisikiyou County and began mowing down illegal pot farms with the local sheriff’s department.
“I love the smell of diesel power in the afternoon. It smells like victory,” LaMalfa said in a video clip he posted on social media, riffing on the line from the Vietnam War epic, “Apocalypse Now,” before breaking into a grin.
It was a remarkably tone-deaf thing to say since those pot farms were owned by Asian immigrants, some of them Hmong whose relatives fought in the Vietnam War. They were accusing local authorities of race-based harassment. The movie line came right after the military napalmed an innocent Vietnamese village. 
I skewered LaMalfa and his no-compromise style, particularly on environmental issues, in a series of essays I wrote for The Bee about intractable wildlife problems in northeastern California, whose habitats are dear to me. I called him on his cellphone, five years to the day of his death, while the violent mob of Trump’s supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. He didn’t pick up. LaMalfa would later join the group of Republicans who voted against certifying Joe Biden as president.

All that’s to say, I’m sure plenty of liberal members of LaMalfa’s district aren’t exactly shedding any tears at his loss, but I got choked up Tuesday morning when I read the news he’d died.
I always liked LaMalfa personally, though I don’t think he liked me very much thanks to some of those stories. I guess I just appreciated how Doug LaMalfa never really stopped being Doug LaMalfa, an unpolished farmer who was kind and warm in person, but who also spoke his mind, no matter who was in the room.
I remember seeing him once as I was covering the Kool April Nights car show in Redding. I’m sure he got some face time with the people he hoped would vote for him in the next election, but I could tell he wasn’t really there for that. He was checking out all the shiny old cars because he was a classic car guy and that was his jam. One of LaMalfa’s former staffers said he liked to ask potential hires “What’s your favorite car?”
I’ll also never forget LaMalfa attending an event in Redding at which my wife got an award for her job in a program that helped underprivileged kids. Only a couple of dozen people were there, there were no media cameras, and his office didn’t send out a press release saying he would be there. LaMalfa went because it was just a nice thing to do, quietly supporting those who supported Redding’s troubled youth.
And even though he was a touch frosty with me, he’d always ask how my wife and her dad were during interviews. He regularly ran into my father-in-law in Chico, where he volunteers for various service organizations. 
Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland was LaMalfa’s roommate while the two served in the Legislature. He said “Papa Doug” always took the time, no matter how busy he was, to ask him about his daughter, now in college, who he used to hold as a baby.“He just really is a deeply caring human being,” Strickland said. 
Never afraid to speak his mind
In this era of hyperpartisanship, I respected how, instead of running to cable news to offer a partisan critique, LaMalfa would wait to speak with then-President Biden after his State of the Union addresses. He politely pressed Biden personally to pay more attention to wildfire prevention and other issues important to his constituents. 
I also respected how intensely passionate LaMalfa was about the Oroville Dam spillway disaster in 2017 and the Camp Fire that burned down the town of Paradise the next year. At one point, LaMalfa got on a conference call, hosted by state officials, for the media and began lambasting the people in charge. He was livid. 
Those were his family and friends living below the shattered spillway and whose homes had burned in Paradise.
“You may not agree with his particular viewpoint or his particular stance on an issue,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea, who worked closely with LaMalfa during the dam ordeal, the Camp Fire and several other major disasters, told me. “That said, I do believe wholeheartedly, he was passionate about representing the interests of the North State residents that he served, and he did it consistent with his values and what he thought was best for the community.”

Erin Mellon feels the same, despite often being on the receiving end of blistering criticism from LaMalfa when she was spokesperson for the California Department of Water Resources, which manages Oroville Dam. 
Although she is a Democrat, Mellon said even after LaMalfa gave her an earful, she appreciated how kindly he and his team treated her afterwards. At one point, LaMalfa even took her on a personal tour of the spillway in his red Thunderbird convertible.
“In one meeting, he could be reaming you and ripping you, and then the next second, he’s taking you for a tour of Oroville Dam in his prized red convertible sports car,” she said, choking up at the memory. “For him to take that time to respect you as a person is unique. … He was very authentic. He was really himself, and he was really, he was just a great representative of that part of the state. He really fought, I think, for his constituents, and he wasn’t terribly selfish about it.”
LaMalfa is survived by his wife Jill, four children, one grandchild, two sisters and a host of cousins, according to a statement from his office.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/071622-Doug-Lamalfa-Dixie-Fire-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 19:57:57.325357

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)State Sen. Josh Boschee, D-Fargo, announced Tuesday he is running to become the next mayor of Fargo.
If elected, the former House minority leader said he would resign from the state Legislature.
“It’s a city of 137,000 people and we have a lot of needs, and it needs to have my focus,” Boschee said in an interview. “And the residents of District 44 deserve to have a senator to dedicate their full time to the district.”
Boschee represented Fargo in the North Dakota House of Representatives from 2013 to 2024, serving three sessions as House minority leader. He was elected to the North Dakota Senate in 2024, succeeding Democratic-NPL lawmaker Merrill Piepkorn, who challenged Gov. Kelly Armstrong in the gubernatorial contest. 
Boschee said he thinks it’s time for a new generation of leadership for the state’s largest city, and he believes his relationships with other state lawmakers and the governor’s office will help him continue Fargo’s growth.
“With the seat being open, without an incumbent mayor, it provides an opportunity to really set a new direction for Fargo,” Boschee said.
There is no state law preventing a lawmaker from also serving as mayor or member of a commission, said John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council.
Boschee said serving as mayor of Fargo is a full-time job, and he would not want to disenfranchise residents of Fargo in trying to do both at the same time.
Boschee’s Senate term expires in 2028. If he’s elected mayor, the Democratic-NPL district 44 committee would appoint a new lawmaker to serve the remainder of the term, said Erika White, election director for the Secretary of State’s Office. 
Denise Kolpack, Fargo’s deputy mayor and member of the city commission, launched her mayoral campaign in a social media post Monday. Kolpack and Boschee are the only candidates who have formally announced their candidacy, but others are expected to join the race.
Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney has served as mayor since 2015 and is ineligible to run for reelection due to term limits.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado continues to recommend children receive six vaccinations despite the federal government switching its guidance on them. 
The Trump administration now says the necessity of vaccinations for a raft of diseases and infections should be decided between the doctor and the parent, while previously it recommended universal vaccinations. 
President Donald Trump in December directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to review vaccine recommendations from peer nations and recommend any changes to vaccination schedules based on those findings. That review resulted in changed recommendations, announced Monday, for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, meningococcal disease, the flu and COVID-19 vaccines.

The Colorado Board of Health, in accordance with a 2025 state law, updated state vaccine guidance so that it could rely on science-based recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and other authorities, in addition to the federal government. Legislators passed that law out of fear that the Trump administration would make recommendations for vaccinations that are inconsistent with scientific evidence.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment recommends families follow the AAP’s recommended vaccination schedule, which encourages the six shots on which the federal government changed its guidance.
“Colorado’s vaccine guidance is rooted in decades of strong scientific evidence and real-world experience,” Dr. Ned Calonge, chief medical officer at CDPHE, said in a statement. “Regardless of changes at the federal level, our priority is ensuring families and providers have trusted, evidence-based guidance to keep children and communities healthy.”
Health insurance companies will continue to fully cover the six vaccines for children. School vaccine requirements in Colorado also remain the same. 
“Vaccines have an exceptional safety record and remain one of the most effective tools we have to prevent serious disease,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, deputy chief medical officer at CDPHE, said in a statement. “Colorado will continue to follow expert guidance that reflects the best available science and supports informed decision-making between families and their health care providers, as always.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis celebrated the appointment of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spent decades spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines and other health issues. Polis spokesperson Derek Dash said the new changes won’t affect vaccines in Colorado, and Polis “remains committed to ensuring that Coloradans have access to safe, effective vaccines and clear, science-based information so they can make informed decisions about their health.”
“We are protecting access, minimizing confusion, and empowering individuals to choose the protections that are right for them,” Dash said in a statement. 
U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, said all reputable health care providers say the federal change is dangerous. She said Trump and RFK Jr. are “sabotaging the future of American medicine.” 
“This reckless change in the vaccine schedule by RFK Jr. and his hand-picked team of anti-vaxxers is a direct attack on the health of every American,” DeGette said in a statement. “Without these vaccines, more children will die from preventable illnesses.”

(Photo by McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)A child in Madison County contracted measles after traveling out of state to an area with an active outbreak, eastern Idaho health officials said Tuesday.
In a news release, Eastern Idaho Public Health officials said they believe the child likely caught measles while traveling, not locally. The child was not vaccinated for measles.
Officials said Madison Health, the Rexburg-based hospital where the child was treated but not hospitalized, has contacted people who were potentially exposed to measles. Eastern Idaho Public Health says it will not publicly announce more cases within the child’s household in a news release. 
Last year, Idaho reported 13 measles cases amid the nation’s worst outbreak in decades. All Idaho measles cases last year were in unvaccinated children, or children whose vaccination status was unknown.
Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles, which is highly contagious and usually leads to hospitalization for one in five children younger than 5 years old who are infected.
Measles is highly contagious but rare. Up to 90% of non-immune people in contact with an infected person can become infected. The virus can live in the air up to two hours after someone infected leaves.
Symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. While many recover without problems, measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems.
Idaho has a spotty record for measles vaccinations, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The virus’s serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) and, in rare cases, death.
People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and they should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.
There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC.

(Photo  by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was in the Twin Cities Tuesday as the Trump administration launches what it’s calling “the largest DHS operation ever.” 
CBS News reported over the weekend that around 2,000 Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents are being deployed in Minnesota, in addition to the 700 already present in the state as part of “Operation Metro Surge,” which began in December. 
In a video posted to the Department of Homeland Security’s official X account, Noem and several heavily armed and masked agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In another video, Noem appeared to greet and thank local ICE staff. 
One photo showed Noem meeting with Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who is leading the prosecutions of people accused of defrauding Minnesota’s social services programs. 
The Trump administration’s focus on Minnesota was sparked by unsubstantiated allegations shared by right-wing media figures that Somali Americans who committed fraud were using the proceeds to fund terrorist organizations abroad.
“@POTUS Trump and @Sec_Noem have rallied DHS law enforcement personnel to keep Americans safe and ERADICATE fraud,” DHS posted on X. 
ICE did not respond to the Reformer’s requests for comment. 
Immigrant rights organizations have been fielding many reports of ICE arrests around the metro, but an exact number of arrests is difficult to confirm. Unlike a few high-profile raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul in 2025, which involved dozens of agents and attracted large crowds, ICE appears to be focused on conducting smaller and faster operations.
Walz blasted the deployment as a waste of government resources on social media, sharing a video from a little over a week ago showing dozens of agents leading a single person out of a Hennepin County government building. He said the Trump administration did not give his office advance notice or any additional information on the operation. 
“We have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us that are for a show of the cameras,” Walz said at a news conference on Tuesday. “We don’t even know they are, they’ll be wearing masks.”
Noem fired back at the governor for accusing them of misusing taxpayer dollars given the widening scandal of fraud in state-run social service programs that led him to end his campaign for a third term on Monday.
Around the country and in Minnesota, immigration agents have been accused of violating constitutional rights: detaining U.S. citizens for days, targeting individuals based on their speech; and arresting and holding people without probable cause.

In late December, ICE agents entered a private area of the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis without a judicial warrant, according to immigrant rights activists and Democratic elected officials, who urged Hennepin Healthcare to adopt a clear policy and train employees on how to interact with immigration agents. 
Janna Gewirtz O’Brien, a pediatrician and president-elect of the Minnesota Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said fear of ICE is keeping immigrant families from seeking health care. 
“There is a sense of fear that has been perpetuated by our administration, and we need hospitals to step up,” Gewirtz O’Brien said.

MONTPELIER — A Jewish group that opposes Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has lodged ethics complaints against the five members of the Vermont House who traveled to Israel last September on a trip that was sponsored by the Israeli government.
The Vermont and New Hampshire chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace argued in filings last week that by accepting invitations to go on the trip, the Democratic and Republican legislators ran afoul of state laws limiting what gifts public officials should accept.
The lawmakers are Rep. Sarita Austin, D-Colchester; Rep. Matt Birong, D-Vergennes; Rep. Gina Galfetti, R-Barre Town; Rep. Will Greer, D-Bennington; and Rep. James Gregoire, R-Fairfield. In all, 250 legislators from all 50 states attended the trip, which was described as the largest-ever gathering of U.S. state legislators in Israel.

According to an Instagram post from Israel’s government at the time, the lawmakers “witnessed the magnitude of the October 7 tragedy, experienced Israel’s innovation and cutting-edge technology, tasted our incredible cuisine, and met with Israel’s leaders — including the Prime Minister, the President, the Foreign Minister, and many others.”
At a press conference Tuesday in the Statehouse — the first day of the 2026 legislative session — members of Jewish Voice for Peace, and several other advocacy groups, lambasted the lawmakers’ decision to travel to Israel and demanded they resign.
Officials from the Israeli government valued the trip at $6,500 per person, according to records attached to the ethics complaints that Jewish Voice for Peace filed.
“As elected representatives of Vermont, they implicated our state in Israel’s atrocities,” said Ashley Smith, a member of the Vermont Coalition for Palestinian Liberation, one of the groups at the press conference, speaking to a crowd of dozens of people.
Israel’s ground and air campaign against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 70,000 people, according to local health authorities. Israeli strikes have destroyed vast swaths of buildings and other infrastructure in the enclave. At the same time, the United Nations has declared a famine there, saying that more than half a million people face “starvation, destitution and death” as a result of Israel’s war. 
An independent U.N. commission determined last year that Israel has committed four “genocidal acts” in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023. The Hamas attacks on that day that prompted the campaign killed about 1,200 people and led to 250 being taken hostage.
Three other current state legislators were also at the press conference standing among the presenters, including Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central; Rep. Kate Logan, P/D-Burlington; and Rep. Esme Cole, D-Hartford. Vyhovsky called the trip “unconscionable.”
Jewish Voice for Peace is asking Vermont’s State Ethics Commission to recommend that the Vermont House’s internal ethics panel “conduct a thorough investigation” of the group’s complaints. The State Ethics Commission has little authority to take substantive action on ethics complaints when those complaints are related to legislators’ conduct, but the body is generally required to refer such complaints when it receives them.
Christina Sivret, the commission’s executive director, said Tuesday she could not discuss publicly what actions were or were not being taken regarding the complaint.
According to Jewish Voice for Peace, most aspects of the legislators’ trip did not fall into one of the categories of gifts that state law allows public officials to accept. Moreover, the group contended in a press release, the trip amounted to a paid lobbying effort by Israel’s government “with the expectation” that the lawmakers “would support legislation in their home states favorable to Israel’s geopolitical and economic interests.” At the least, the group wrote in its complaints, that created the appearance of a quid pro quo.
The legislators did not file lobbying disclosures with the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office, as is required for some gifts, at the time of the trip. But Vermont legislators aren’t required to disclose gifted trips, anyway, Seven Days reported last year.
The group pointed to how four of the five sponsored a bill last year aimed at creating a new curriculum for Vermont students, and new training for Vermont teachers, focused on “the evolving nature of antisemitism” in the U.S. The legislation, H.310, would also create a new definition of “antisemitic harassment” in Vermont law that includes, among other pieces, “negative references to Jewish customs or the right to self-determination in the Jewish people’s ancestral and indigenous homeland,” which is Israel.
The group also noted how, during a stop in Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar urged the assembled legislators to pass laws in their states that would hinder the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. That’s the international movement aimed at using economic pressure to force Israel’s government to change its policies.
All five of the legislators pushed back against the advocacy groups’ assertions and calls for resignation in written statements and interviews on Tuesday. 
Birong chairs the House Government Operations and Military Affairs Committee and is the most powerful Vermont legislator who took the trip. 
“In a world increasingly filled with siloed media and narrowed information streams, I wanted to take the opportunity to witness for myself and ask questions,” he said in a statement. “When accepting the invitation, I was under no illusion as to the perspective of our hosts.”
Gregoire is vice chair of the House Corrections and Institutions Committee and pushed back against the assertion that the trip was a lobbying effort by a foreign government. 
“We went during the off session and there was no connection to our legislative work,” Gregoire said in a statement. “No one asked us to do anything beyond standing up against antisemitism and that was during casual conversations.”
Austin said she did not believe she or her colleagues had violated any ethics rules when traveling on the trip. Both Galfetti and Greer said they were eager to move forward with their legislative work for the year, and pointed to how they have been threatened and have feared for their safety since the details of their trip were made public last fall.
Galfetti said in a statement that the complainants and organizers of Tuesday’s press conference “have lied and continued to lie about this trip, pushing an incendiary false narrative designed to spread disinformation in these troubled times.”
In a statement, House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, said her office did not have purview over the legislators’ decision to go on the trip and that “our established, independent review process — the House Ethics Panel” — was where any issues from critics of the trip could be reviewed. The panel’s proceedings are highly secretive, with little information typically available to the public about a given complaint or how it gets resolved.
Meanwhile, Pattie McCoy, the House GOP leader, said in a statement Tuesday that she supported the legislators’ decision to go on the trip. 
“We support State Representatives who reach out and travel to engage in, and build, international relations,” the Poultney Republican said. “Through these efforts Vermont has built business partners that continue to increase our economic presence globally, allowing Vermont businesses to grow and thrive.”

Ohio Senate President Rob McColley has been tapped as GOP frontrunner Vivek Ramaswamy’s running mate in the 2026 governor race, according to their campaign spokesperson.
First reported by NBC News on Tuesday evening, Ramaswamy’s team announced that, if elected, McColley would serve as his lieutenant governor.
McColley, an attorney from Napoleon, Ohio, had long been the expected choice for the Cincinnati-born businessman.
The Senate president, 41, joined Ramaswamy, 40, for many events across the state during the lead-up to this announcement.
Ramaswamy previously told us he will be working with the legislature for all of his policy ideas.
“That’s the type of leadership we need to build upon the foundation that we’ve already set in this state to make us not just the best in the Midwest, but the best in the entire country,” McColley told me in September.
Strategists continued to suggest McColley could be Ramaswamy’s running mate because he can navigate the lawmakers.
Serving as the top leader in the Senate, he controls 23 other Republicans.
McColley was instrumental in getting Ohio’s new flat income tax passed. He also personally pushed back on the House’s more marijuana-friendly legislation on numerous occasions.
Although McColley broke out of lockstep with House Speaker Matt Huffman on several major occasions over the past year, he is the best choice to mediate between the executive branch and legislative, strategists said.
Other than his ability to work with the General Assembly, strategists have told us that McColley can help win over Christian voters.
In December, Ramaswamy wrote a guest essay for the New York Times, condemning racist and Hinduphobic attacks he has faced as he continues to campaign.
McColley’s background
After growing up in Northwest Ohio, he graduated from OSU and went to the University of Toledo for law school.
McColley started in state politics in 2017, first serving in the House and then moving over to the Senate. He has served in leadership positions in each chamber. Before being president, he served as the Senate’s majority floor leader.
He lives in Napoleon with his wife and three kids.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Supreme Court on Tuesday passed the gavel to a female chief justice for the first time in state history. 
Justice Jon Jensen formally stepped down from the role and welcomed Chief Justice Lisa Fair McEvers during a ceremony in front of a packed crowd.
“Women have been eligible to serve on this court since 1920, when women gained the full right to vote, and it took us until now to have a chief justice,” Fair McEvers said during a speech. “While I’m humbled to be the first, I certainly hope that I won’t be the last.”
Fair McEvers earned 83% of the votes cast by sitting justices and district court judges in the December election to determine who would succeed Jensen. Justice Jerod Tufte was the other candidate.

Fair McEvers said the support she has received from across the state and across the country since the election has been overwhelming. 
“I do realize the historical significance of this moment,” Fair McEvers said. “While I’m not a big deal, I’m just a Class B kid from Minto, North Dakota, it’s obvious from the number of people who have contacted me following the ballot opening that this is a big deal to many people that we have selected the first woman in North Dakota to serve in this capacity.”
Fair McEvers has served on the Supreme Court since 2014, when she was appointed by then-Gov. Jack Dalrymple to fill a position vacated by former Justice Mary Muehlen Maring. She was elected to the court to serve a two-year term in 2016 and a 10-year term in 2018.
Susan Bailey, a district court judge and a friend of Fair McEvers since they attended law school together, said she made calm confidence her hallmark. 
“In every role, the same core values shine through. Fairness, humility and an unwavering respect for the rule of law,” Bailey said during the ceremony.
Jensen, who did not seek reelection to the post of chief justice, will continue to serve as one of the Supreme Court’s five justices. 
Fair McEvers said she hopes to build on many initiatives begun by Jensen. 
“I intend to be a chief who listens, is patient and values the ideas of others, even when I might not agree with them,” Fair McEvers said.

(Photo by Audrey Carleton/Capital and Main)The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday ended appeals of a lower court’s ruling that the commonwealth’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative was illegal. 
The court’s order dismissing the cases as moot follows Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s agreement to withdraw from the multi-state climate compact as part of his deal with Republican state lawmakers to bring the five-month budget stalemate to a close in November.
It also came more than six months after the  state’s highest court heard oral arguments in the cases in May.
While many who opposed the program said it would drive up energy costs and constitute a drag on the economy, environmentalists argued a well-designed carbon cap program would reduce climate warming emissions while generating billions of dollars for the commonwealth. 
The initiative, which is ongoing in 11 states, requires major carbon dioxide emitters, such as fossil fuel-fired power plants, to purchase carbon credits in an auction. Money from the credits is invested in sustainable energy projects in the states.
Challengers argued Pennsylvania’s membership in the program violated the state constitution. 
They claimed Gov. Tom Wolf overstepped his executive authority by entering into the agreement without approval from the General Assembly and the cost of carbon credits constituted an illegal tax.
Siding with challengers, the Commonwealth Court ruled in November 2023 that to pass constitutional muster, Pennsylvania’s participation in RGGI “may only be achieved through legislation duly enacted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly.” 
In a series of eight orders, the Supreme Court dismissed appeals by Constellation Energy, Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future, Clean Air Council, the Sierra Club. It also dismissed appeals by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the Environmental Quality Board, which issued the regulations establishing RGGI in the commonwealth.
The commonwealth entered the compact during Wolf’s administration in April 2022 when the final regulation was published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin as required by state law. 
Pennsylvania joined neighboring states New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware in RGGI more than three years after the regulatory process first began and after considerable bipartisan pushback from opponents who said Wolf’s decision to join the multi-state agreement was an example of executive overreach.
In arguments before the seven-member Supreme Court last spring, environmental groups argued the state constitution guarantees the protection of public resources including clean air and that the DEP’s plan to limit carbon emissions is constitutional because it is part of its program to protect the public’s environmental rights.
“Air is a public trust resource, and the department and other trustees have to act to protect it,” Jessica O’Neil, who represented Penn Future, the Sierra Club, the Clean Air Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/homer-city-power-plant-capital-and-main-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 18:58:57.982142

Vermont confronts each cost crisis separately, even as they amplify one another and squeeze budgets year after year. What Vermont needs now is a change in mindset.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Benjamin Brickner: Vermont’s cost crises are connected. Our solutions should be, too..","This commentary is by Benjamin Brickner, of Pomfret. He is a practicing attorney and chair of the Pomfret Selectboard.



As towns and school districts across Vermont finalize their budgets, local officials are staring down a familiar question: with healthcare, housing, personnel and other non-discretionary costs out of control, what gets cut?
For Pomfret and its 916 residents, hard choices are inevitable. Road maintenance may be scaled back. Overworked staff may go without needed support. Taxes still rise. Important services take the hit — and with them, the quality of life that defines our community.
After several years in local office, here’s what troubles me: Vermont confronts each cost crisis separately, even as they amplify one another and squeeze budgets year after year.
Consider healthcare costs and their far-reaching effects on seemingly unrelated but personnel-intensive areas like road maintenance, municipal administration and education. Recent efforts to institute drug price caps (Act 55) and reference-based pricing (Act 68) are helpful, but they don’t address actuarial realities in a small state with an aging population.
Education reform faces similar headwinds. Act 73 focuses largely on consolidation. That may reduce the number of school districts, but it won’t solve what motivated reform in the first place. Even consolidated districts remain vulnerable to rising costs like health insurance, which is projected to soon consume one-fifth of school budgets.
Housing costs compound these pressures. Act 181’s recent changes to Act 250, Vermont’s Land Use Law, have altered the regulatory landscape, but they don’t address the labor and material costs that put housing out of reach for many young families, including children of lifelong Vermonters.
The result is familiar: towns with stagnating grand lists, schools with falling enrollment and residents squeezed as essential costs spiral.
The question isn’t whether Vermont should tackle these issues. We must. The real question is whether we’ll approach them as a single, interconnected challenge or continue patching leaks while the foundation shifts. Acts 55, 68, 73 and 181 are sensible in isolation. Collectively, they miss the mark.
What Vermont needs now isn’t more task forces, commissions or disconnected legislation. We’ve tried that, with mixed results. We need a change in mindset.
As lawmakers reconvene in Montpelier, we must think in systems, not silos. Health insurance premiums shape school budgets. Housing affordability shapes demographics. Each policy sends ripples far beyond its intended target. These connections aren’t always obvious, which makes on-the-ground listening essential.
Local officials are often the first to see the cascading effects of well-meaning reform: road crews short-staffed because housing costs outpace wages; school districts unable to hire because health insurance is prohibitive; towns cutting office hours to keep municipal taxes down as education taxes rise. When laws are written without input from those living these impacts, unintended consequences are inevitable.
Vermont can no longer afford that cycle.
Lawmakers should break the silos by consulting with towns and schools before drafting legislation. Ask what pressures they face, what would change if healthcare or housing costs stabilized, and what would help stretch limited dollars.
Voters should connect the dots. You don’t need budgetary expertise to see the patterns. Learn what towns control and what they don’t — and tell your representatives what you see. Informed feedback from constituents is as valuable as any expert report.
Local officials should document the realities. Towns and schools can help lawmakers see the system by presenting data showing how costs rise, what gets cut and who is affected. This gives lawmakers the information they need to craft reforms that stand a chance of working.
Vermont can address education costs, healthcare affordability and housing shortages. We have the tools and the talent. What we need is a clearer understanding of how these problems connect.
In Pomfret, we don’t have the luxury of tackling one problem at a time. We manage interdependent issues by understanding their connections and responding accordingly. Vermont must do the same.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-06 23:40:55+00:00,CT Mirror,CT assures continued insurance coverage for childhood vaccines,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/ct-assures-continued-insurance-coverage-for-childhood-vaccines/,Childhood vaccines will remain covered by insurance despite recent recommendation changes by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.,"Childhood vaccines will remain covered by insurance plans despite recent recommendation changes issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, interim state insurance commissioner Josh Hershman confirmed in a statement Tuesday evening.
“Parents should be clear on this point: childhood vaccines remain covered by insurance in Connecticut, and nothing about the CDC’s recent announcement changes insurance coverage requirements for childhood vaccinations,” Hershman stated. “Families should continue to obtain vaccinations in consultation with their health care providers.”
On Monday, the CDC announced updates to its recommendations for childhood vaccines, which came after conducting an analysis of “how peer, developed nations structure their childhood vaccination schedules” at the request of President Donald Trump. The review found that the United States “recommended more childhood vaccine doses than any peer nation” and that “countries without vaccine mandates had as high immunization rates as the U.S.”
In response, the CDC issued a new, tiered recommendation, grouping childhood vaccines into three buckets: shots recommended for all children, those recommended for certain high-risk groups and those where decisions should be left up to “shared clinical decision-making,” or conversations between people and their doctors. 
As of the end of 2024, the vaccine schedule recommended 17 immunizations for all children. The updated schedule broadly recommends just 11, including polio, whooping cough, measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox. Among the vaccines the CDC no longer recommends for all children are flu, hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
In a fact sheet published on Monday, the federal government clarified that, despite the recommendation changes, all vaccines would continue to be available to anyone who wants them through ACA plans, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and the Vaccines for Children program. 
“Families will not have to purchase them out of pocket. Among peer nations, the U.S. will continue to offer the most childhood vaccines for free to those who want them,” stated the fact sheet.
Hershman reiterated this message to Connecticut residents on Tuesday evening. 
“The vaccines referenced in the CDC announcement were not removed from the immunization schedule. Instead, they were moved from a routine recommendation to clinical decision-making recommendation,” Hershman stated. “Because these vaccines remain on the CDC schedule, they continue to be covered by health insurance plans regulated by the CID.”
Department of Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani “is solely responsible” for determining Connecticut’s vaccine schedule, and the state’s recommendations for childhood vaccines will remain unchanged, a DPH spokesperson confirmed. 
In a statement issued on Tuesday, Juthani said she had “serious concerns” about the CDC’s changes and said the move “risks creating confusion, placing more burden on parents and clinicians, and making preventive care harder to navigate.”
Juthani also addressed the federal government’s analysis comparing the U.S. vaccination schedule to peer nations.
“Other countries’ vaccine schedules reflect their own health systems and disease patterns, and a one-size-fits-another-country approach does not reflect the realities facing children in the United States,” Juthani stated.
Lawmakers have already started to discuss how Connecticut can address the uncertainty surrounding federal vaccine policy during the upcoming legislative session.
“Yesterday’s news was not surprising but absolutely shocking,” Public Health Committee co-chair Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D-Fairfield, said. “We will likely want to decouple ourselves from that federal guidance.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24248694401334-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 18:58:57.982142

Inside the Capitol, U.S. House Democrats gathered in a small meeting room, apparently unable to secure larger accommodations for an unofficial hearing that largely rehashed the findings of a House committee that spent 2022 investigating the attack.Trump, meanwhile, addressed House Republicans three miles west at the Kennedy Center. In an hour-plus address, he blamed then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the violence on Jan. 6, 2021 and recommended the GOP lawmakers pass laws to make election fraud more difficult. Trump’s claim that his 2020 election loss was due to fraud sparked the 2021 attack.“Our elections are crooked as hell,” he said, without citing evidence.House Dems blast pardons Inside the Capitol, at a morning event that U.S. House Democrats organized and in which Republicans didn’t take part, lawmakers and experts criticized Trump’s pardons of people involved in the 2021 attack, one of his first acts after returning to office last year.They also decried his continued recasting of the events of the day.White House officials launched a webpage Tuesday that blamed the attack on Democrats, again including Pelosi, and restated the lie that initiated the attack: The 2020 election that Trump lost was marred by fraud and should not have been certified.“Democrats masterfully reversed reality after January 6,” the page reads. “...In truth, it was the Democrats who staged the real insurrection by certifying a fraud-ridden election, ignoring widespread irregularities, and weaponizing federal agencies to hunt down dissenters.” Pelosi at the hearing on Tuesday condemned Trump’s version of the attack. “Today, that president who incited that insurrection continues to lie about what happened that day,” the California Democrat said.

Other Democrats and their invited witnesses also described the pardons as signaling that the president accepted — and even encouraged — his supporters to pursue illegal means of keeping him in power. Brendan Ballou, a former U.S. Justice Department prosecutor who resigned shortly after Trump’s 2025 pardons, told the panel the executive action sent Trump supporters the “clear message” they were above the law.“The January 6 pardons also fit into a broader narrative of what’s going on with this administration, that if people are sufficiently loyal and willing to support the president, either in words or financially, they will be put beyond the reach of the law,” he added. “It means that quite literally for a certain group of people right now in America, the law does not apply to them.”Former ‘MAGA granny’ testifiesHomeland Security Committee ranking Democrat Bennie Thompson of Mississippi led the panel discussion, with Judiciary Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin of Maryland and several others also sitting in on it.The first panel of witnesses included Ballou, other experts and Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter from Idaho who traveled to the nation’s capital five years ago to “be part of the mob” in support of the president before becoming an advocate for reckoning with the day’s violence.An emotional Hemphill, 72 and once known as “MAGA granny,” apologized to U.S. Capitol police officers.

“Once I got away from the MAGA cult and started educating myself about January the 6th, I knew what I did was wrong,” Hemphill told the panel. “I pleaded guilty to my crimes because I did the crime. I received due process and the DOJ was not weaponized against me. “Accepting that pardon would be lying about what happened on January the 6th,” she added.She explained her decision to decline Trump’s blanket pardon of offenders convicted of crimes related to the attack, saying it papered over the misdeeds of people involved in the riot. She implored others not to accept revisions of the narrative about what happened in the attack.Subsequent panels included current and former House members, including two, Republican Adam Kitzinger of Illinois and Democrat Elaine Luria of Virginia, who sat on the committee tasked with investigating the attack.Flowers for Ashli BabbittThe crowd of marchers, which included pardoned Jan. 6 attack participants, gathered in the late morning to retrace their path to the U.S. Capitol five years ago.Organizers billed the march as a memorial event to honor Ashli Babbitt, who was killed by U.S. Capitol Police during the riot in 2021 as she attempted to break into the House Speaker’s lobby.Far-right activists celebrating the five-year anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol marched in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026, from the Ellipse to the Capitol.

(Video by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The crowd of roughly a couple hundred walked from the Ellipse, where Trump spoke to rallygoers in 2021, to just outside the Capitol grounds, where police contained the small crowd on the lawn north of the Reflecting Pool. Law enforcement officers permitted Babbitt’s mother, Michelle Witthoeft, and a few others to walk closer to the Capitol to lay flowers at roughly 2:44 p.m. Eastern, the time they say Babbitt died.A group of counterprotesters briefly approached the demonstration, yelling “traitors.” Police quickly formed two lines between the groups, heading off any clashes.Proud Boys former leader on-site Among the crowd was former Proud Boys national leader Enrique Tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for seditious conspiracy and other charges related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. Trump commuted Tarrio’s sentence upon taking office for his second term.While looking on at marchers, Tarrio told States Newsroom he was “just supporting.”“It’s not my event. I’m just trying to help them with organizing and marching people down the street, I guess. But we're here for one purpose, and that's to honor the lives of Ashli Babbitt and those who passed away that day.”

When asked if marchers were also honoring the police officers who died in the days and months after the attack, Tarrio said he mourned “any loss of life” but added “I heard some suicides happened. I don't know. I haven't really looked into that. I've been in prison.”U.S. Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick suffered injuries during the riot, according to the Capitol Police. He died the following day from natural causes, according to the District of Columbia Office of the Medical Examiner.Four responding police officers died by suicide in the following days and months.As the march continued, a group of Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police officers on bicycles stopped Tarrio and asked him to confirm the march route to avoid any “confusion.”When counterprotesters began to heckle the Jan. 6 attack supporters, Tarrio waved the marchers forward, “C’mon, c’mon, keep moving.”

Connors said he didn’t enter the Capitol during the 2021 attack, but said he was in the district that day to protest the 2020 presidential election, which he falsely claimed was “robbed” from Trump.“Donald Trump, I'll take the bullet for that man.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts late Tuesday afternoon released transcripts from videos attributed to the suspect in the Dec. 13 mass shooting at Brown University and the Dec. 15 homicide of MIT professor Nuno Lunoeiro in Brookline, Massachusetts.
The set of four transcripts were translated into English from Portuguese, U.S. Attorney Leah Foley’s office said in a news release. The investigation between federal and local law enforcement remains ongoing, but Foley’s office said investigators were ready to share one cache of findings from a federal search warrant for the New Hampshire storage facility where Claudio Manuel Neves Valente had rented a unit and was found dead on Dec. 18 by investigators. 
“Neves Valente showed no remorse during the recordings; on the contrary, he exposed his true nature when he blamed innocent, unarmed children for their deaths at his hand and grumbled about a self-inflicted injury he suffered when he shot the MIT professor at close range,” Foley’s office stated. “Our investigation into the motives behind Neves Valente’s heinous acts will continue.” 
Neves Valente claimed to have the storage unit for three years and he imagined he had enough money to last “a few more good years, if it was in Portugal or a cheaper place.” The transcripts suggest Neves Valente had possibly been planning the shooting for six semesters.   
The FBI found “an electronic device containing a series of short videos made by Neves Valente after the shootings,” according to Foley’s office. The videos are timestamped Dec. 16, the same day investigators and an autopsy have confirmed is the day Neves Valente killed himself at the storage facility in Salem.

Neves Valente is a Portuguese national who had attended Brown as a young adult in the early 2000s before dropping out.
In the first video, which is cited as the longest at around six and a half minutes, Neves Valente says his eye was injured during the close-range shooting of Lunoeiro, his former colleague who attended the same physics program at a Portuguese university. 
Neves Valente noted that he was not “extraordinarily satisfied” with the shootings, nor was he regretful. 
He also commented on media coverage and social media chatter about the shootings, especially speculation on what he had yelled upon entering the classroom in Brown’s Barus & Holley building.  
“It seems like someone over there said that I was saying that I was… Allah Akbar or some s— like that,” the transcript reads. “I do not remember having said anything. If I did say something, it must have been some kind of an — an exclamation.”
The transcript ends with Neves Valente ridiculing the Brown students for not leaving the classroom when he opened fire.  
Foley’s office added that while Brown University was Neves Valente’s intended target, “he did not provide a motive for targeting students at Brown University or the professor at MIT.”

While it may seem like this information is simply lost in the ether, it is actually stored in data centers, which have been popping up across the United States. And we are now starting to see them in our own backyards. Data centers are being proposed in places such as Sioux Falls, Toronto (Deuel County), and even at the gate of the sacred Black Hills, in Rapid City’s new industrial complex.
AI developers state that they are targeting colder climate areas to reduce the amount of energy needed to operate these data centers. Addressing the energy needs, employment promises and overall environmental impact of data centers will allow South Dakotans to decide whether we really want this infrastructure to be developed in our state. We live here, and our voices matter.
Politicians and data center developers are downplaying the massive energy requirements that the proposed data centers will demand. Approximately 400 megawatts of power from our electric grids could be needed for one data center, consuming half of the energy that South Dakota has spent over 75 years sizing up to sustain the expanding population and economic growth we are seeing today.
Congressman speaks in support of data centers in SD, calling anti-development rhetoric ‘un-American’

These massive data centers are filled with computers to store AI and cryptocurrency data, and computers generate a lot of heat. To avoid overheating and ensure proper functioning, large amounts of water are needed to cool the systems down. Some data center developers claim that water usage for the proposed data centers here will be no more than that of the average U.S. household. However, our cold season does come to an end, and as temperatures continue to rise and display record summer highs year after year, these claims will become less valid. There is already a strain on our water resources here in South Dakota, so potential water shortages could result if the issue is aggravated.
Furthermore, claims that the demand on our energy grid will not increase our already rising energy bills are sugarcoated at best. Americans have seen about a 13% national increase in electricity prices since the beginning of 2025, and this trend is expected to continue.
Transparency is a must when it comes to grandiose promises, such as the statements that data centers will create substantial job growth for South Dakotans. While the construction of these large buildings will bring temporary employment, once construction ends, so will most of these jobs. Also, the construction of a data center requires highly skilled workers. We can’t be sure that out-of-state companies won’t be brought in for the construction.
On average, an operating data center needs between 30 and 100 full-time employees. There is currently no data to show how the hundreds of jobs promised compare to the jobs that are actually created, or what kind of jobs those even are.
Data centers also bring a slew of environmental problems in their wake. As stated previously, they will consume a large amount of water. We’re talking hundreds of thousands to millions of gallons of water per day for an evaporative-cooled system in the data center. On the low end, this water usage is equivalent to the needs of a city the size of Pierre. On the high end of consumption, it would be more comparable to the water needs of Sioux Falls. There is technology that operates on a closed-loop system where the water is cooled and recycled. However, this could increase the electricity demand by more than 20% and further burden our fragile energy grid, contributing to ratepayers’ increased energy costs.
The message is clear — communities need to have transparency around proposed data centers so they can weigh the economic and environmental impacts in order to protect hardworking South Dakotans and our beautiful lands. These impacts must be weighed against proposals to bestow tax rebates on the billion-dollar companies building these data centers (Google, Meta, Amazon).
More factual information regarding the jobs promised, the electrical and water usage, and environmental risks needs to be brought forward and discussed before any construction begins. Finding ways to mitigate the environmental and economic effects that are correlated with data centers should be a top priority for South Dakotans as we take a stand to protect our communities.

(Pool photo by Trent Nelson/The Salt Lake Tribune) Prosecutors and defense attorneys both agree the armed protest volunteer accused of shooting and killing an innocent bystander in Salt Lake City in June was trying to neutralize what he thought was a threat. They disagree on whether what he did was a crime. 
The case got underway Tuesday as Matthew Scott Alder, 43, appeared in court for the first time to answer a charge of manslaughter, more than seven months after the shooting.  
Prosecutors say he was aiming at a man carrying a rifle when he mistakenly shot Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo at the No Kings protest on June 14. They allege Alder committed a crime with one “reckless” shot that hit Ah Loo, of three total. 
Alder, wearing a gray suit, stood quietly in court Tuesday during the brief hearing, lasting less than three minutes. He did not respond to a request for comment from Utah News Dispatch as he left the courthouse.

His defense attorney Philp Wormdahl told reporters that Alder did not break any law and has a strong self-defense claim. Wormdahl said his legal team plans to make use of a 2021 Utah self-defense law requiring judges to dismiss certain cases early on if prosecutors can’t prove by “clear and convincing evidence” that the use of force was unjustified.
“Obviously, on that date in June, it was a great tragedy,” Wormdahl said. “But given the evidence that I’m aware of now, the lawyers who are involved in this are all uber-confident that no reasonable person could find that he wasn’t justified in his actions.”
Wormdahl noted charging documents quote a witness who told police she “was concerned for the lives of everyone around me” based on the actions of the man with the rifle.

On Tuesday, a 3rd District Court commissioner ordered Alder to have his fingerprints and photograph taken at the Salt Lake County Jail. The commissioner scheduled a court date in March before wishing Alder luck. 
Alder has not been jailed in the case. Prosecutors said last month he is not a flight risk and requested a court summons instead. 
In June, Alder told investigators he saw someone “charging the handle” of a rifle, making it ready to fire, and moving toward the crowd. Alder yelled for the man to stop to no avail, charging documents say, and thought the man wielding the gun was going to “mag dump into a crowd of people.” He told police that what he saw “scared the hell out of me.” 
In announcing the charge against Alder in December, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill drew distinctions between the first two shots that wounded Arturo Gamboa in the abdomen and hit his gun, and a third that had a different backdrop “within a large gathering with so many different people,” including Ah Loo. 
Gill cleared Gamboa, who was originally jailed for six days as Salt Lake City police said they were investigating him for murder. Gamboa has said his weapon was unloaded and he was exercising his First and Second Amendment rights that day.

While his actions of assembling an AR-15 under cover during a mass gathering were “alarming and irresponsible,” he didn’t commit any crime, Gill said, noting Utah law allows people to openly carry rifles at protests. 
Rep. Verona Mauga, D-Salt Lake City, said last month she’s working on a proposal to change that. If Utah were to prohibit firearms from demonstrations, it would join North Carolina and Alabama. Under Texas law, displaying a “firearm or other deadly weapon in a public place in a manner calculated to alarm” fits a misdemeanor offense of disorderly conduct. 
The June event drew an estimated 10,000 demonstrators voicing their opposition to President Donald Trump’s policies. 
Ah Loo, a celebrated fashion designer and father of two from Clearfield, was taking video of fellow protesters when he was killed. His widow, Laura Ah Loo, said in December that the months she waited for answers after his death were “long, painful and deeply frustrating.”

Her attorneys have said she plans to sue Alder and is gathering more information about what led up to the shooting. 
Gov. Spencer Cox said in June that the Department of Public Safety had warned Utah 50501
organizers ahead of their protest that arming people was a “bad idea.” The group said in response the governor was “grossly misinformed.” 
The state then released copies of correspondence with organizers that said “a ‘private security team’ is not allowed at the Utah State Capitol.” Whoever applied for the Salt Lake City protest event permit used an alias and got approval anyway, the city acknowledged in August, prompting it to strengthen its requirements. 
If convicted, Alder faces 1 to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. He returns to court March 20 for a scheduling hearing.

Kansas Fire Marshal Mark Engholm said the motors were destroyed because of all the debris hidden in the water that rose during deadly summer flash floods, causing more than $1 billion in damage.
Kansas was one of a handful of states that aided Texas agencies in recovery and rescue.
“They went through their local resources fairly quickly,” Engholm said. “Within 48 hours, they were asking other states for help.”
The effort cost the state at least $370,000. The State Finance Council, made up of the governor and legislative leadership, on Tuesday unanimously approved the funds be reimbursed. Initial estimates placed costs at $265,000.
Local firefighters from Kansas City, Kansas; Manhattan; and elsewhere in the state sent water rescue teams to Texas. 
They worked for 14 days, focusing on recovery efforts while “working through some very, very difficult situations,” Engholmsaid.

Happy first day back to school session! How was your summer? The floors are a little cleaner and the eyes are a little brighter as the both the Senate and the House of Representatives begin their second year of the biennium. 
The House gaveled back into session Tuesday morning after some seemingly requisite first-day-back technological hiccups and all-but-obligatory mentions of creemees and Carhartt, lest lawmakers forget they’re in Vermont.
As if compelled by some invisible force, the conversations in the halls and on the chamber floors all seemed to drift toward addressing the unfinished business of last year’s big education bill.

“If last year asked a lot of us, this year will ask even more,” House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, told her colleagues, nodding to some of the challenges on education, housing and health care. 
So, as lawmakers go back to the books to figure out how to organize the state’s schools, I decided to talk to the building’s school-aged visitors about how it feels on the first day of session.
Winnie Liu is an eighth-grader from Montpelier who was mere hours into her first day as a legislative page when we spoke: “It’s not as busy as I expected at first, but it’s going really smoothly and all the directions are clear,” she said of day one. We will have to see how she feels come May.
For Liliana Klimanska, a high school exchange student visiting Vermont, “it’s a really nice opportunity to see, not from the TV or from the news, but from inside, how people behave, how people interact with each other and how they create this whole community. You can actually see that they’re casual with each other, they connect, and they appreciate each other’s efforts to make Vermont better. It’s really cool.” 
That picture of a body going back to school was clear for Klimanska’s peer, Amelie Richter, a German exchange student: “Even before it started, you could see all of the House people just talking with each other, like us coming back after a holiday break.”

On the move
The House and Senate sent more than 100 bills to committee on Tuesday. Stay tuned as we track the key pieces of legislation.
Rather than attempt to override Gov. Phil Scott’s veto of last year’s attempted overhaul of Vermont’s motel housing program, Speaker Jill Krowinski sent the bill, H.91, back to committee.

On Monday, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scaled back federal vaccine guidelines for children, removing six vaccines from a “recommended” status. The House Committee on Human Services hit the ground running, reviewing the newly introduced H.545, which would reissue state-level vaccine recommendations and bolster Vermont’s ability to provide immunizations to those who want them.

In a moment of flipping the focus, so to speak, Rep. Doug Bishop, D-Colchester, recognized VTDigger’s own staff photographer Glenn Russell for the start of his 40th year covering the Vermont Legislature. “He has helped bring his keen eye and enormous skill to the stories published by the publications he’s worked with. He’s helped deliver the human side of those stories,” Bishop said. We couldn’t agree more.

Governor calls for a rehearing and urges lawmakers to draft a constitutional amendment to let Wyoming voters settle the matter. 
The post Abortion-rights advocates cheer Wyoming Supreme Court ruling; opponents plan constitutional amendment appeared first on WyoFile .","As a plaintiff in the 2022 lawsuit that kicked off years of legal sparring over Wyoming abortion rights, Dr. Giovannina Anthony had waited a long time for Tuesday’s Supreme Court decision on the state’s abortion bans.
“It has been a long road,” she said. One with ups and downs, drawbacks and delays. And even though the high court ruled against the state’s abortion bans, she’s not under the illusion that the fight for abortion access is over. 
“But at least today, we can claim a victory and say, it was really worth it,” said Anthony, a Jackson obstetrician. “It was worth it to go four years and keep it up and keep raising money and keep the awareness going. I’m really proud of our team. I’m really proud of what we accomplished.”
In reading the Supreme Court’s decision siding with plaintiffs, Anthony said, “Clearly, this is a court that holds a lot of respect for our constitution.” 
That’s because much of the decision hinged on constitutional language. 
Anthony and other plaintiffs argued that abortion is enshrined in the “right of health care access” in Article 1, Section 38 of the Wyoming Constitution. The clause states, “Each competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions.”
The state’s attorneys, meanwhile, countered that abortion isn’t health care. 
But in deciding what that language means in this case, “all five Wyoming Supreme Court justices agreed that the decision whether to terminate or continue a pregnancy is a woman’s own health care decision protected by Article 1, Section 38,” the court’s summary stated.
As abortion rights activists in Wyoming and beyond celebrated the decision, the anti-abortion camp decried it and called for legislative action. 
“This ruling is profoundly unfortunate and sadly serves to only prolong the ultimate proper resolution of this issue,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement. While the ruling may settle a legal question for the time being, Gordon said, “it does not settle the moral one, nor does it reflect where many Wyoming citizens stand, including myself.”

Gordon asked the Attorney General’s office to file a petition for rehearing the decision, which it will file within 15 days.
The voters of Wyoming should settle the matter once and for all, Gordon argued. “A constitutional amendment taken to the people of Wyoming would trump any and all judicial decisions.”
He called on the Legislature to pass such an amendment during the upcoming session and deliver it to his desk. A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate to appear on the ballot in the following general election. 
Gordon may get his wish during the Legislature’s 2026 budget session, which convenes Feb. 9.
State lawmakers are already preparing a bill to modify the Wyoming Constitution and clear a path for another attempted abortion ban. Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, a Republican from Hulett, said that he’s been workshopping language with Torrington Republican Sen. Cheri Steinmetz. 
“I’ve got to run it by a lot of other people,” Neiman said.

Ideally, he added, a single constitutional amendment would be considered, although the legislative strategy is still up for discussion. 
“We’ve got a little over a month before we have to be in session,” Neiman said. “That’ll give us time to kind of see which is maybe the best plan of action.” 
A constitutional amendment would have to navigate the legislative process in a 20-day session geared toward passing Wyoming’s budget. Then, in the 2026 general election, more than half of Wyoming voters who cast a ballot would have to agree to the constitutional change.
Neiman struck an optimistic tone about an amendment’s prospects of passing the first hurdle during the session in Cheyenne.
“I can’t speak for the other chamber,” he said, “but in my chamber I’ve got a lot of phone calls and a lot of texts from a lot of my legislators who are just beside themselves at what happened.”
Senate President Bo Biteman did not return a phone call before this story published.
Victorious 
Chelsea’s Fund, an organization that helps pay for abortion services, was another of the plaintiffs that challenged Wyoming’s abortion bans. Executive Director Janean Forsyth said Tuesday’s decision affirms what her organization has long known: “that abortion is essential health care, and Wyoming women have a constitutional right and the freedom to make their own health care decisions, and that should be without government interference.”
Forsyth was flooded with messages and calls Tuesday, she said, especially from the community of reproductive rights organizations. 
“I think that [the news is] a beacon of hope for, not only Wyoming communities and families, but also nationwide,” she said. 
Christine Lichtenfels was Chelsea’s Fund executive director when the original suit was filed and throughout much of the legal battle. Relief wasn’t quite the word to describe how she felt Tuesday, she said. 
“In reading the decision, there is just a sense that, ‘Oh, there is reason in the world,” she said. “It makes me think that, yes, Wyoming is the Equality State. We can say that now without cringing.” 
(Disclosure: Lichtenfels is currently working with WyoFile on an unrelated legal matter.)

Wyoming’s only abortion clinic, Wellspring Health Access in Casper, was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Knowing the decision would directly impact the facility’s fate, Clinic President Julie Burkhart was nervous when she opened it. Reading quickly dispelled her fears, she said, as it dawned on her that the justices sided with the plaintiffs’ legal team. 
“We are delighted,” she told WyoFile.  
Many people questioned her 2021 decision to open an abortion clinic in such a conservative state, she said. The court decision solidifies an intuition she felt back then about Wyoming residents’ sense of what’s fair and right. 
Burkhart and colleagues expect future challenges to arise, however. 
“While we celebrate today’s ruling, we know that anti-abortion politicians will continue their push to restrict access to health care in Wyoming with new, harmful proposals in the state legislature,” Burkart said in a statement. “Patients should not have to live in fear that their health care decisions will be suddenly upended at the whim of a judge or lawmaker.”
Across the state in Jackson, Dr. Anthony anticipates the Wyoming Freedom Caucus will attempt to pass laws that impose targeted restrictions against abortion providers — such as forcing patients to hear a fetal heartbeat or wait a certain time period before the procedure. 
“Unfortunately, the fight’s not over,” Anthony said, “but this is a great moment for us.”
Heartache 
Abortion opponents expressed sadness Tuesday and vehemently disagreed with the court’s opinion. 
State Rep. Rachel Rodriguez Williams was lead sponsor of one of the abortion bans. The Cody Republican and chair of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus did not respond to a request for comment, but posted about the decision on X. 
“My heart aches for Wyoming today,” Rodriguez Williams posted. “Thanks to the decision of four unelected, unchecked attorneys, it’s open season in Wyoming for innocent, preborn babies. Make no mistake: courts can get things wrong, and they sure did get this wrong. I’ll never stop fighting to protect life.”

Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray also protested the decision, which he called “outrageously wrong” and “a leftwing activist decision totally out of touch with the Wyoming Constitution.”
Natrona County anti-abortion activist Bob Brechtel, a former Wyoming House member, also expressed frustration with the courts, criticizing the nearly two-year-long wait for a decision and saying he was “ashamed” of the outcome from the high court. 
In 2011, Brechtel co-sponsored the bill authorizing a later-successful constitutional amendment ballot measure that now protects individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions. Born out of opposition to the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, what became Article 1, Section 38 caused some lawmakers to worry about potential unintended consequences. 
Fifteen years later, one unintended consequence came to fruition. Reached Tuesday, Brechtel confirmed that he did not intend to protect women’s right to have an abortion in Wyoming. 
“There was nothing in the legislation about killing innocent human beings,” he said. “This whole thing has been completely regenerated into something that it was never intended to be.”

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-06 22:55:57+00:00,Mississippi Today,FAQ: What is school choice? What are Mississippi lawmakers considering?,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/06/faq-what-is-school-choice-mississippi-legislature/,"Students walk to their classrooms on the first day of school at Callaway High School in Jackson, Miss., on Monday, July 28, 2025.","The school-choice debate has simmered for years in Mississippi. But now that the 2026 legislative session has started, the issue is expected to come to a head.
You’ve probably heard the term “school choice,” but as lawmakers on both sides of the issues have argued their cases in the weeks leading up to the session that kicked off Tuesday at noon, you may have gotten lost in the opposing points flying from both angles. Even more confusing, some politicians have renamed school choice as “education freedom” in an effort to further their agenda.
Here are answers to some frequently asked questions on what is on the table with the Mississippi Legislature on school choice and how it might impact public education. 
What is school choice? 
School choice is an umbrella term used to describe numerous policies and programs aimed at giving parents more say over where their child is educated and the kind of education they receive. That often includes using public tax dollars to fund their choices, including for private schooling. 
What are the different kinds of school choice?
Different types of school choice include charter schools, public school open enrollment or “portability” and private school-choice programs. Private programs include education savings accounts, vouchers and tax credit scholarships — ways parents can use public money for private education options.  
What are ESAs?
Education savings accounts, or ESAs, give parents public-funded government savings accounts to use toward their children’s education. Parents can put this money toward curriculum, tutoring, school tuition, among other things. Some lawmakers, including Speaker Jason White, have signaled that a universal ESA program — a program that would at least be partially open to all students, regardless of income or group — would be their ideal policy.

What are vouchers?
Vouchers differ slightly from ESAs. They allocate the public funding that would typically have been sent to a public school for a child’s education to parents to use toward tuition at a private school. 
What are tax-credit scholarships? 
There are various kinds of tax-credit programs, including tax-credit scholarships, tax-credit ESAs and refundable tax credits. All of these programs give parents a tax break for spending money on alternative education for their child. 
What are charter schools?
Charter schools are publicly funded but operate outside the regulations that apply to traditional public schools. Charter schools can be established in Mississippi in areas where the local school district is rated A, B or C if the district’s school board approves, and without board approval in areas rated D or F.  The state charter board has pushed for loosening this policy. 
What is portability?
Public school portability, or open enrollment, refers to policies that aim to make student transfers easier, or even automatic and have tax dollars follow the pupil. Currently, a student’s home school district has veto power over a student switching to a school in a different district, which could make transfers nearly impossible.  One proposal from Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, pending in the Senate, would remove the home district’s veto ability. 
Does Mississippi have school choice? 
Mississippi already has various forms of school choice, though they are limited. Mississippi has a couple of voucher programs and an education savings account program, all for students with disabilities. Mississippi also has various private schools and charter schools. Students can also transfer to public school districts outside of their area, as long as both school districts approve the move. 
How many other states have school choice?
According to Education Week, 30 states and the District of Columbia have at least one private school choice program. In the Southeast, six out of nine states have a universal school-choice program.

What do opponents say?
People against school choice often argue that the policies siphon money away from public schools, which they argue are a public good funded with taxpayer dollars, and often send that money to schools with less oversight than traditional public schools.

What do supporters say?
Proponents of school choice say that parents deserve final say over their child’s education and, as taxpayers, should get money to fund those choices.  
READ MORE: School choice debate: Should private schools have to meet state standards if they take public money?
Who supports it?
Conservative think tanks, such as Americans for Prosperity, have led the push for expanded school-choice policies across the country. Various local municipalities have passed resolutions against expanding school choice in recent months. And while school choice favor in the House has quietly grown, the Senate still appears lukewarm, which could make for a standoff this session.

(Photo by Willie B. Thomas/Getty Images)Leaders of New Mexico’s healthcare exchange are reporting a third straight year of enrollment increases, even as federal healthcare tax credits expire and average premiums are set to rise in 2026. 
As of Monday, with more than a week until open enrollment ends, more than 81,000 New Mexicans had signed up for medical and/or dental coverage through BeWell, the state’s exchange, including more than 9,400 new enrollees. 
That’s an increase from 2025, when a little more than 71,000 New Mexicans enrolled, and from 2024, when about 57,000 New Mexicans enrolled, according to BeWell data.
Alex Sanchez, the chief experience officer of BeWell, told Source New Mexico on Tuesday that the steady increases reflect the exchange’s marketing efforts and year-long community engagement. 
Six things to know about Enhanced Premium Tax Credits heading into New Mexico’s special session

Extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies Congress created in 2021 emerged as the main factor that prompted a federal government shutdown late last year. Republicans did not agree to extend the subsidies, so millions of Americans already face huge increases in annual premiums this year. 
The tax credits offered significant savings to health care costs, with some estimates suggesting annual premiums could increase by $1,500 for those who no longer get the tax credits.  
In advance of the lost tax credits, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state lawmakers during a special session in October approved $17.3 million to cover costs of tax credits the federal government previously covered for a little more than 6,000 New Mexicans whose income is more than 400% of the federal poverty level. That built on a previous allocation covering others during the regular session in January 2025.
Sanchez also credits the state coverage as a factor in the increased enrollment here, and noted the discrepancy between New Mexico and states that did not cover the lost credits, such as Pennsylvania, which saw a 16% decline in enrollees already this year. 
“It’s just terrible to see our other states who are really struggling, who didn’t have the commitment that we had from our elected officials,” Sanchez said. 
The money allocated in New Mexico  will run out by the end of the state’s fiscal year ending June 30, but Lujan Grisham has already promised the state will continue to cover the expired tax credits. 
Feds award New Mexico $211.5 M for rural health funding

In a news release from her office on Tuesday, she noted that her budget proposal from the upcoming session seeks to extend the assistance beyond June 30. 
She is seeking $81.1 million to cover the credits, according to budget documents her office released in December. 
“The Republican-controlled Congress is forcing families to endure a massive premium hike in the new year, and New Mexico won’t stand for it,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “We created the Health Care Affordability Fund for moments like this — when Washington fails to protect working families and the most vulnerable among us. 
Lujan Grisham’s statement noted that New Mexico’s congressional delegation all pushed to extend the premium tax credits, and a statement from Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo urged Congress to take up the issue.
“Congress created this cliff, and Congress can avoid it by extending enhanced premium tax credits so people in every state can keep coverage within reach,” Armijo said. “We urge immediate action to prevent families from having to choose between health care and rent, groceries or gas.”

The public school transfer bill is the first major policy proposal that a legislative committee has advanced this year enhancing school choice, the issue many expect to headline the session. 
School choice refers to numerous policies and programs to give parents more say on where and how their children are educated, often by letting them use public money. The school-choice movement, backed by national conservative groups, has grown nationally, and is being pushed by the Trump administration.
READ MORE: Lawmakers want to expand ‘school choice’ in Mississippi. Here’s what it looks like in neighboring states
The policy approved by the Senate committee would make it easier for parents to send their children to public schools outside of their home districts. Currently, both the home school district and the receiving school district have to approve a student’s transfer. The proposal removes the home district’s veto power. 
Lawmakers also took the committee’s vote on Tuesday as an opportunity to draw a line in the sand: Vouchers, which give parents public dollars to fund education outside of traditional public schools, are not on the table in the Senate, said Senate Education Chairman Dennis DeBar. That’s in opposition to the House, where support for expansive school-choice policies has been quietly growing, thanks to a full-court press from the other chamber’s leader, House Speaker Jason White. 
DeBar, a Republican from Leaksville, said loosening public school district transfer regulations would allow parents a greater voice in their child’s education. But he said the proposal will change little else from current law aside from the home district’s veto power and will not conflict with any standing school desegregation orders under which some areas of Mississippi still operate. 
The money the state allocates to districts for teaching each pupil, a little less than $7,000 a year, would follow the transferring student, but receiving districts under the Senate bill would retain their power to charge a fee for admitting these out-of-area students to offset the cost of accepting students not in their tax base. They also still would have to provide some rationale for turning students away. 
Sen. Rod Hickman, a Democrat from Macon, took issue with districts’ ability to charge public school students a fee. 
“Doesn’t it further exacerbate the socioeconomic issue?” he asked. “If we say we’re giving parents a choice to educate their children, particularly to leave a bad district … to then say you can charge a fee, doesn’t it allow one set of people to be able to do that and another set of people not to be able to do that?”
Nancy Loome, a public school advocate and leader of the Parents Campaign, was similarly concerned, but lauded the Senate Education Committee’s strong stance against school vouchers. 
“I really worry about creating a system of haves and have-nots, where children who have fewer resources also have many fewer options,” she said. 
DeBar said all of the committees’ efforts on Tuesday were in service of the state’s public schools. 
“We need to support our public schools,” he said. “To come out and say this hurts public schools, I do take offense to that. 
The committee also advanced a long-awaited teacher pay raise, amounting to $2,000 a year. DeBar said he hopes the Legislature can eventually increase that raise to $5,000 a year, assuming the state isn’t bogged down with other expenses.
The pay raise would extend to teacher assistants, as well as professors at community colleges and universities, and there are financial consequences for school districts that avoid increasing teacher assistant pay by lowering the local contribution in response to the state-funded raise. 
The last meaningful teacher pay raise, also about $5,000, was in 2022, but teachers said it was quickly eaten up by inflation and insurance premium increases. Educators say the state’s teacher shortage, which stands at 3,815 vacancies statewide according to the Mississippi Department of Education, is largely fueled by the abysmal pay. Mississippi teachers, on average, are the lowest paid in the country.
Senators also took a shot at addressing the state’s teacher shortage by making it easier for retirees to return to teaching, or teach for the first time. The new bill would allow any person in the state public employee pension system to teach without forfeiting their retirement benefits. 
Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, expressed concerns about how the bill would impact funding in the Public Employees Retirement System. He questioned whether the proposal would lead people to rush to retirement and return to the classroom the next day, getting to draw down retirement pay as well as a salary. 
“I’m just saying, it’s in the financial interest for every single person to do that,” he said. “I think we’re going to transfer the cost of paying teachers to the retirement system.”
The education committee’s affirmative vote on the retiree bill came just minutes after the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to add $1 billion over a decade into the pension system. 
All of these measures can now be considered by the full Senate chamber. The House Education Committee is set to meet Wednesday afternoon.

To recap, American troops entered Venezuela early Saturday morning and captured President Nicolás Maduro. The news reportedly caught many members of Congress, which has the authority to declare war, by surprise, as well as President Donald Trump’s pronouncement later that day that the United States will “run the country.” 
Many Democrats from across the country raised concerns that the strike violated the U.S. Constitutions’ separation of powers  — Article I gives Congress authority to declare war — and lacked foresight. 
Republicans, meanwhile, largely praised the outcome as well as the strike’s precision. And most GOP lawmakers appeared to accept the administration’s assertion that the move was not an act of war, which would require Congressional approval, but a law enforcement operation. Maduro had been indicted in 2020 on multiple charges, including narco-terrorism conspiracy, and will stand trial in federal court.
But not every lawmaker followed the party lines.
Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has emerged as arguably the most vocal Democratic cheerleader of the administration’s actions, and its approach to foreign policy more broadly.
Two swing district Republicans, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick and Ryan Mackenzie, have struck a more cautious tone than their GOP colleagues, warning against a prolonged deployment of American forces in the country. Fitzpatrick also joined Democrats in calling for Congress to reassert its war-making powers and for the administration to work more closely with lawmakers.

While a clear picture of Venezuela’s future, and America’s role in it, is still emerging, the Capital-Star reached out to each member of the commonwealth’s delegation with a list of questions and a request for each member’s response. Their replies ranged from written answers to issued statements to links to social media posts. One member, Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean, agreed to a phone interview.

Fitzpatrick is a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Chairman of its subcommittee on the CIA (the intelligence agency was reportedly involved in the Venezuela operation), and a member of the subcommittee on Open-Source Intelligence.
He released a statement on Jan. 3
“Three statements of fact regarding our foreign policy as it pertains to Venezuela:
“1. Nicolás Maduro is an illegitimate narco-terror dictator. He terrorized his people, dismantled democratic institutions, and turned the machinery of government into a state-backed criminal enterprise — exporting drugs and cartel violence into the United States, with devastating consequences for hundreds of thousands of American lives. His ouster and prosecution are long overdue. We are thankful for the incredible bravery of the men and women of the U.S. military and our national security professionals.  
“2. The only country that the United States of America should be ‘running’ is the United States of America. The United States should join the international community in monitoring and overseeing a free and fair election in Venezuela, allowing the Venezuelan people a pathway to a true democracy. 
“3. We must all place paramount importance on lawful process and constitutional responsibility. The Authorized Use of Military Force (AUMF) resolutions have been interpreted by multiple presidents, under multiple scenarios, to cover groups and situations not initially envisioned, leading to debates about the balance of power between the Article I and Article II branches of government. As the Chairman of the CIA Subcommittee on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, we will continue our coordination and collaboration with CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Important information will be shared in forthcoming briefings, and we will continue our active role of proper congressional oversight. What is already clear, however, is this: terrorists, tyrants, dictators, and drug lords must always be met by justice and the rule of law; the extraordinary men and women of our military and intelligence community are the finest in the world; and the future of a free and democratic Venezuela belongs to the Venezuelan people alone.”

Dwight Evans (D-03)
Evans answered a series of submitted questions from the Capital-Star via email.
Capital-Star: Do you support the recent removal and arrest of Nicolas Maduro by the U.S. using military force?
Evans: No!
CS: What do you think Congress’ role should have been in this action, if any, and do you believe it should have a role in approving any military activity in Venezuela or other countries going forward?
Evans : I oppose the Trump-Vance administration’s unauthorized and unconstitutional military actions in Venezuela. Once again, this administration has no regard for the rule of law, risking American lives in and near Venezuela. I voted last month for a resolution that would have barred President Trump from military action against Venezuela without authorization by Congress, but House Republicans narrowly defeated it. Trump can’t even run our country well and now he’s focused on trying to run another one – and threatening to attack other countries.
U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District)
America does not need another ill-conceived ‘forever war.’ We have serious problems here at home that Democrats in Congress will keep pushing to address, like Trump letting health-insurance premiums skyrocket Jan. 1 for 22 million Americans. I will continue to fight for Philadelphians and oppose this backwards, disastrous Trump-Vance agenda!
CS: Is there any specific action you believe Congress should take now in response to the recent actions?
Evans: Congress should pass legislation to rein Trump in like the war powers resolution I voted for last month.
CS: President Trump has said he’s open to putting “boots on the ground” or striking Venezuela again if his administration deems it necessary. He’s also suggested the U.S. should have a role in governing the country. What do you think the U.S. role in Venezuela should be going forward?
Evans: The Trump-Vance administration should NOT be taking further military action in Venezuela or the waters off its coast. These illegal actions need to STOP.
Madeleine Dean (D-04)
Rep. Madeleine Dean, a Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the co-chair of the Bipartisan Fentanyl Prevention Caucus, agreed to an interview with the Capital-Star on Monday. The following excerpts were edited for length and clarity.
Dean said she learned about the military action along with the public when she woke up Saturday, seeing news of the attack on her TV. In subsequent discussions with Democratic colleagues, she learned that neither House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), nor Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Gregory Meeks (D-NY) were alerted by the administration either. 
U.S. Rep Madeleine Dean (D-4th District)
“That to me is a grotesque abuse of power by this president and his administration,” Dean told the Capital-Star. “They had an obligation to come to Congress first. They had actually said the words that before they would go into Venezuela, they would come to Congress, as required.”
She rejected the administration’s argument that the capture of Maduro was a “law enforcement” operation. 
“Listen to the president,” she said “He spoke first and he said this was a military operation. And he followed that with ‘And we are going to run Venezuela.’ When you go in with a number of air vehicles, and military, and CIA, and whoever else was involved in what was apparently a remarkably well-executed event by our military and intelligence folks — when you go in and seize the leader of a sovereign nation, this is an act of war … Secretary Rubio after [Trump] tried to change the tenor of it and said that it was a police action. Well, it wasn’t a simple arrest. The president himself said it was a military action.”
On the operation itself, Dean praised the U.S. military’s planning and execution
“I’m with [Republicans] in terms of praising the skill of the operation,” she said. “The level of planning and preparation — it’s awesome, what our military can do. I have absolute full confidence in our military. What I don’t have confidence in is the set of decisions that the Commander-in-Chief is making, and that the people in his administration are making. I am in awe of our military, of their service to this country, but I am also mindful that this president has the power and the responsibility not to put them wrongly in harm’s way.”
In particular, Dean said she’s worried about a lack of long-term plan for stability in Venezuela and Latin America.
“The danger here is they don’t have a plan,” she said. “Not only do they not have a plan, not only are they acting lawlessly and recklessly, my fear is that the president talked about the possibility of ‘boots on the ground.’ I worry about military members who are my constituents, military members who are Pennsylvanians, who might be called into this mess. So I call upon my Republican colleagues in Congress in Pennsylvania, like Scott Perry, a veteran himself, to say, ‘No way. This is not what we’re going to do — your crazy, imperialist ideas.’ And remember, allegedly, we picked [Maduro] up for drugs, narcotics trafficking. But the president revealed exactly what this is about. This is about oil. The oil wealth of that nation. So I expect Republican members to stand up alongside the Democrats and say Congress is the authority here in terms of going to war, and we have to demand that of the president and his reckless administration…”
“Don’t mistake any of my grave concern over this for any sympathy for Mr. Maduro. I’m glad he’s out of power.  I hope he’s brought to justice. But guess what? In December, as these boat strikes were going on, who did President Trump pardon? [Former president of Honduras Juan Orlando] Hernández, who was arrested, indicted and convicted for the exact same parallel charges [as Maduro] … This president isn’t serious at all about drugs.”
Dean was equally alarmed about the Trump administration suggesting more military action could be possible in countries like Cuba, Colombia and NATO ally Greenland. Along with the possibility of U.S. military deployment, she said she’s worried about the long-term effects the rhetoric will have on America’s standing and influence on the global stage.
“Look at how irresponsible the president is in signaling these things, and how juvenile,” she said. “In the press conference, he talked about the Monroe Doctrine, and said, ‘Some are calling it the Donroe Doctrine.’ He is so arrested in his development, and in his curiosity, and in his responsibility as the Commander-in-Chief. Someone has sewn these ideas of an imperialistic Donald Trump conquering the hemisphere. So the president is in, I think, a very precarious place. He sees himself as being bigger than life. I see him as shrinking. What he did with this move on Venezuela, without the consultation of Congress, without a plan for the day after, and the day after that, reduced his influence in the world. How does this president now talk to Mr. Putin and say, ‘You know what? What you did in Ukraine was wrong.’ He just reduced his own global influence in a most dangerous way. And these idol chit-chats around Greenland, around Canada, around Cuba, around Colombia, around Mexico, it’s very dangerous.”
Asked what lawmakers should do to reassert their constitutional war powers and rein in the Trump administration, Dean called on members of his own party to act.
“I expect Republican members to demand better, to actually find their spines, their backbones, and their constitutional authority under Article One, which has been drained away from them, and demand briefings … We have to absolutely together demand accountability of this administration. They need to let us decide whether we want to be at war … I am gravely concerned that this president’s seeing oil dollar signs in his eyes, and cares not enough about risking American bloodshed.”
Republicans, largely, have praised the Trump administration’s actions. And many, at least publicly, have brushed aside concerns that Trump’s action required congressional authorization.
Asked what congressional Democrats should do if they don’t receive GOP support, Dean offered few specifics.
“We caucused yesterday, so I won’t tell you what was said, but we are going to do everything in our power to stand up to the president, and to push Republican members, including the speaker of the House, to understand their responsibilities under Article One, and to reclaim them,” she said. “We will use every lever we can. Take a look at what we’re facing right now. The American people are facing increased health care premiums. Many of my constituents are losing health care because they simply cannot afford it. My constituents are livid that we would go to war and pretend that we can run that country when this president hasn’t shown he can run the one he’s in charge of.
“What I tell my constituents, my friends and family, is that it’s on all of us,” she continued. “We [Democrats] are in the minority, but we can be very noisy, we can be very vocal, and we will continue to be, and it will grow. But it’s on every citizen to say this is an unacceptable, grotesque use of power by this administration … I have confidence that people are hungry for ethical, competent government. We’re going to see this thing tip over. A lot of people are going to get hurt in the meantime.”

Chrissy Houlahan (D-06)
Houlahan did not respond to outreach from the Capital-Star, but shared  a critical statement from ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee Adam Smith (D-Wa.)  on social media.
She is one of six Democratic members of congress, all veterans, who released a video last year urging military service members not to follow unlawful orders. The move was called “seditious” by Trump, and has prompted the FBI to seek interviews with the lawmakers.
Addending Smith’s statement, Houlahan wrote:

Ryan Mackenzie (R-07)
Arnaud Armstrong, a spokesperson for Mackenzie, provided a statement in response to questions from the Capital-Star.
Like Fitzpatrick — another Republican representing a swing district — Mackenzie praised the U.S. military action, but warned against long-term involvement in Venezuela’s governance.
“Congressman Mackenzie remains opposed to foreign military interventions that lead to unnecessary, protracted conflicts abroad, like the ‘forever wars’ we have been involved with for the past few decades,” Armstrong wrote. “That’s why he led the way in Congress on repealing outdated AUMFs [Authorizations for Use of Military Force] in the most recent NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act]. 
Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, PA-07. (Official photo)
“Congressman Mackenzie understands that while the focus of this effort in Venezuela was to capture an indicted narcoterrorist who was illegitimately claiming to be the president of Venezuela through fraudulent elections, we must now ensure that the Venezuelans quickly move to self-governance and that the U.S. does not get involved in another long-term conflict.”
Mackenzie himself released the following statement: “The capture of Nicolás Maduro is a decisive victory for U.S. security and regional stability. Maduro was an illegitimate dictator and narcoterrorist who funneled drugs into the United States — killing countless young Americans. As a result of this operation, the United States, the western hemisphere, and the broader world are safer and more secure.”
“With Maduro’s reign now toppled, and American justice on the horizon, we look forward to working alongside the Venezuelan people to establish a democratic and prosperous nation that no longer poses a threat to American families. We thank American servicemembers for their bravery, ingenuity, and success, and we pray for a swift recovery for all those who were injured. We are grateful that there have not been any immediate fatalities among our armed forces.”
Rob Bresnahan (R-08)
Bresnahan responded to questions from the Capital-Star with an emailed statement:
“Nicolás Maduro is a thug who stole an election and ran a narcoterrorist regime disguised as a government that spread violence, drugs, and chaos that cost thousands of American lives. The world is safer today because the United States acted decisively and stood up to evil.”
“Our troops are the best in the world, and I am grateful to those who carried out this mission with unmatched skill and bravery.”
Dan Meuser (R-09)
A spokesperson for Meuser pointed the Capital-Star to a statement posted on social media shortly after the capture of Maduro.

Lee responded to questions from the Capital-Star with an emailed statement:
“Invading a foreign country without congressional approval and kidnapping its leader is a blatant violation of U.S. and international law. This sets a dangerous precedent that threatens international stability and security, puts Americans further at risk, and infringes on the sovereignty of foreign countries. Congress must act and reassert its authority. We must pass a War Powers Resolution and stop this unilateral executive action immediately.”

Joyce responded to questions from the Capital-Star with an emailed statement
“Nicolas Maduro’s criminal and corrupt reign is over thanks to the courage, bravery, and heroism of the service members who carried out this past weekend’s targeted operation.

Reschenthaler responded to questions from the Capital-Star with an emailed statement
“President Trump and our nation’s warfighters successfully executed an operation to bring Nicolas Maduro to justice. Maduro is an indicted narco-terrorist who enabled the ruthless Venezuelan cartels that funnel lethal drugs into the United States. This precise and decisive action demonstrates to our adversaries what happens when you place Americans in danger. President Trump has once again made our nation safer.”

Renee Gamela, a spokesperson for Thompson, responded to questions from the Capital-Star with a statement.
“Maduro has been indicted since 2020 and his regime has not been considered legitimate. An interim president is now in place, and it is Congressman Thompson’s hope that any further intervention will be minimal. This arrest should serve as a warning for other bad actors who put their personal interests ahead of their people and the rule of law.”
Mike Kelly (R-16)
A spokesperson for Kelly pointed the Capital-Star to a statement released on Jan. 3, shortly after the capture of Maduro.
“Today, President Trump has once again shown the world that the United States will defend itself from terrorism of all kinds, including narcoterrorism led by Venezuela’s illegitimate leader Nicolás Maduro,” said Rep. Kelly. “For years, I’ve sounded the alarm about foreign intervention against the United States throughout the Western Hemisphere. This includes illegal drug trafficking into our country. Today’s tactical military operation in Venezuela is the Trump Doctrine in action. This is the right time to have the right president in the White House.”
Chris Deluzio (D-17)
A spokesperson for Deluzio shared a statement released on Jan. 3. 
Deluzio drew the ire of the Trump administration as one of six Democratic members of Congress, all military service veterans, who released a video urging troops not to follow illegal orders.
“Neither the American people nor the United States Congress has authorized an invasion of Venezuela, a war with Venezuela, or a military occupation of Venezuela. We have enough problems here at home in America that President Trump is failing to fix; we do not need a reckless and unconstitutional foreign military occupation that would drain precious American blood and treasure.”
“To the young people of Pennsylvania: Should you die for regime change and an occupation of Venezuela? To Pennsylvanian parents and grandparents: Should your children or grandchildren be sent to risk their lives? More to the point — in a Constitutional Republic such as ours, no President has the power to send American troops into war and occupation like this.”
U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-17th District)
“Our Constitution is clear: the American people through our representatives in Congress have the sole power to declare war and send Americans to topple foreign governments and occupy foreign lands. Yet, Donald Trump thinks the American people have no say in any of this and that we should all foot the bill for his unconstitutional actions in Venezuela.”
“Maduro is an illegitimate and brutal dictator who stole an election to cling to power. He is hardly alone across the globe, yet it is not the American people’s responsibility to launch regime change wars against every foreign despot.”
“My generation of veterans knows the heavy costs and long-lasting wounds of unnecessary forever wars fueled by a lust for oil abroad. No more. No Americans should bleed and die in an unnecessary war and occupation that the American people have not approved. Congress needs to grow a spine and take back authority over war powers. My constitutional oath is sacred, and I will do everything in my power to defend our Constitution.”
Sen. John Fetterman
Fetterman did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star. In an interview with Fox News on Jan. 5, Fetterman reiterated that support, and support for the Trump administration’s foreign policy approach more broadly. In particular, he compared the military action in Venezuela to America’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities last year. He noted the direct approach in that instance did not appear to cause the kind of regional chaos critics warned about, and said he’s hopeful for a similar outcome in Latin America following the capture of Maduro.
Fetterman also praised the Trump administration for giving Maduro a trial, as opposed to assassinating him, and brushed off concerns raised by primarily Democratic lawmakers about the lack of transparency and consultation prior to military deployment.

The following is an excerpt from that Fox News interview, edited for length and clarity:
“[Venezuelans are] celebrating these kinds of things. We want to remember the kinds of chaos and suffering that Maduro brought to Venezuela. Why can’t we call this a good development now, and be open to better kinds of outcomes for that nation? Our nation was forced to absorb over 500,000 Venezuelans … This wasn’t a war. This wasn’t ‘boots on ground’ in that kind of way. This was surgical and very efficient. I want to celebrate our military.”
“Now they’re also putting [Maduro] on trial. They didn’t assassinate him. They didn’t disappear him. He’s actually on our TV right now, and they’re gonna give him a trial.”
“I’d like to also make a point: so many people were freaking out about the Iranian strikes last year. I absolutely called for those things, and I supported those kinds of things. The Middle East didn’t just spiral. It’s actually much more peaceful. Now, many of the members of BRICS [a group of countries designated as having emerging economies in the early 2000s, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa] are absolutely paying attention to what happened in Venezuela. If I’m in Iran, I’m thinking, ‘Woah. Maybe I won’t talk so tough anymore.’ It just reminds people that we have the capabilities to touch you wherever you are. Now I think things are going to be more stable, if anything … So, for me, I’m open for better opportunities, and I have to call it necessarily positive. I can’t just condemn it because I happen to be a Democrat.”
Sen. Dave McCormick
McCormick did not respond to outreach from the Capital-Star, but on Jan. 5, he shared a clip from a Fox News interview on social media.
“It was a great day for the Venezuelan people. It was a great day for our military … an incredible operation that was executed with great competence and great lethality. And what a great day for the President, who demonstrated once again that he’s willing to fight for America’s interests.

“And Venezuela, under Maduro, was killing Americans, killing Pennsylvanians — a major transshipment center. 4,000 Pennsylvanians died last year from drug overdoses. Venezuela is part of the reason for that. It was also a host to Iran, China and Russia — many of our adversaries, where they could essentially launch terrorist kinds of activities on American soil. So this was a fight for America’s interests, and the President, and the team and the military executed it brilliantly.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/venezuela2026-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 17:57:55.543264

One of the deaths was reported by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health earlier this week, while the second was confirmed overnight, bringing the statewide total of pediatric flu-related deaths this season to four.
“This is obviously a devastating loss for both of their families,” Boston Public Health Commissioner Dr. Bisola Ojikutu said Tuesday. “And we actually in Boston have not had a pediatric flu death since 2013 so it’s clear that we’re having a particularly bad season, particularly for children.”
When asked by reporters if the two children who died were vaccinated, especially vulnerable, or faced an aggressive flu strain, Ojikutu declined to give specific details, citing patient confidentiality.
The U.S. is experiencing a sharp increase in flu activity
In the last two weeks of December, confirmed cases among children under 5 in Boston rose 142 percent, according to ata presented by Ojikutu. Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness among that age group increased 225 percent, and hospitalizations “nearly tripled” over the same period.
Compared with last flu season, Boston has already seen twice as many pediatric flu hospitalizations, Ojikutu said, and hospitalizations among children under 5 have exceeded last season’s peak — even though flu season is “nowhere near our peak yet.”
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is reporting “very high and rising levels of influenza activity” statewide, with nearly 9,000 emergency department visits per day last week, about one-quarter of them related to acute respiratory illness. As of late December, an estimated 20.5 percent of emergency department visits were tied to acute respiratory disease, according to DPH’s respiratory illness dashboard. Hospitals in some regions have reported capacity levels exceeding 90 percent, largely driven by influenza.
Ojikutu attributed the severity of the season to the aggressiveness of the circulating strain — H3N2, subtype K — and lagging vaccination rates.
“We do have a new subvariant that’s out there that is behaving in a more aggressive way,” she said. “And then our vaccination rates for the flu are low.”
About 32.5 percent of Boston residents received a flu vaccine as of December 27, Ojikutu said, compared with roughly 34 percent statewide. She said vaccination rates are only slightly lower than last year, but remain “overall low.”
“While the flu is usually mild, it can cause hospitalization and death,” Ojikutu said. “Children under the age of two are at higher risk.”
Public health officials stressed that most flu infections in children remain mild but urged parents and caregivers to seek immediate medical attention if children develop warning signs of severe illness. Those include trouble breathing, persistently high fever, extreme lethargy, confusion or signs of dehydration such as markedly decreased urination.
In babies, parents and caregivers should look for signs of escalating irritability, Ojikutu said. She encouraged them to bring their children to a medical provider if they had any questions or concerns.
“This can happen rather quickly when children have the flu,” Ojikutu said. “So it’s being aware of these signs and symptoms and then bringing kids into the emergency department as soon as possible.”
Both the Boston Public Health Commission and the state Department of Public Health are urging residents 6 months and older to get vaccinated, noting that this year’s flu vaccine was developed before the H3N2 subtype K strain became predominant. While that makes the vaccine a potential mismatch for the strain now circulating most widely, Ojikutu said available data show the vaccine still reduces the severity of illness, lowers the risk of hospitalization, and decreases the likelihood of death, particularly for young children and others at higher risk.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Cold_Flu_Child.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 17:57:55.543264

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Assembly Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety on Tuesday held a public hearing on a pair of bills that would require homeless people on the state’s sex offender registry to wear ankle monitors and increase the penalty for selling drugs close to homeless shelters. 
Under the first bill, authored by Rep. Dave Maxey (R-New Berlin), people required to sign up for the sex offender registry and unable to provide a permanent address must be placed under GPS monitoring. An estimated 16% of Wisconsin’s homeless population is on the sex offender registry, according to Maxey, who said he wanted to make sure this population was not a blind spot for Department of Corrections monitoring of people on the list. 
“This bill is a clear and common-sense public safety measure that applies one uniform standard so every registrant is monitored at the same level, regardless of housing status,” Maxey said. “This is a straightforward way to protect every member of our society.”
A number of Democrats on the committee had concerns about putting the proposal into practice. 
Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) wondered if the cost of the monitoring would end up being paid for by the state. 
“Most times, the GPS monitoring is paid for by the person who needs to wear it eventually,” Emerson said. “And if they don’t have the resources to afford a home, I don’t know if they’re going to have the resources to pay the state back for this. And is this something that we’re just going to end up incurring extra costs on? I’m trying to balance the cost versus safety factor.”
Rep. Sequanna Taylor (D-Milwaukee) noted that the ankle monitors need to be regularly charged, which might pose a challenge for people without a home. 
“When we talk about the GPS, I know even the people that are not in this situation, who may be on it, there are sometimes tweaks or glitches with them, and also the everyday charging, if we’re talking about someone who’s homeless, is not staying anywhere, I guess I’m just trying to see, how can we encompass or ensure that it will be charged, because once it’s not able to be charged and it’s off, are they meant to go report somewhere or is that a process we haven’t thought about yet?”
Another bill heard by the committee Tuesday, authored by Rep. Bob Donovan (R-Greenfield), would add homeless shelters to the list of places including schools, government buildings and public parks that are considered drug-free zones. Convictions for selling drugs within these zones carry harsher penalties. 
“Drug-related crimes pose a severe threat to community safety, particularly in areas where at-risk populations are located, current law wisely imposes enhanced penalties for distributing illegal drugs within 1,000 feet of sensitive locations like schools and parks, adding up to five years to the maximum sentence,” Donovan said. “These Drug Free Zones deter illegal activity and safeguard those who are most vulnerable. However, homeless shelters are not included in these protections. Many, many homeless individuals face profound challenges, including addiction and mental health issues. Extending these zones is about punishing malicious drug dealers who prey upon the homeless while providing basic security for them as they attempt to reenter society.”
But advocates for addiction treatment and criminal justice reform questioned the wisdom of the proposal. 
Dr. Charles Schauberger, an Onalaska resident and president of the Wisconsin Society of Addiction Medicine, said making homeless shelters a drug-free zone could increase police presence around a shelter, which might push homeless drug users away from the area and into more dangerous situations. 
“This legislation is not only ineffective in helping homeless people, but potentially worsens the situation,” Schauberger said. “Increasing criminal penalties for substance-related offenses near shelters may lead to increased law enforcement presence around these facilities for people who use substances they may carry, or may even carry a small amount for personal use, which creates a great deal of fear, fear of harassment, fear of incarceration, fear of losing the only safe place they have yet to go.”
He added that when people are afraid to use shelters, “they don’t disappear. They move further into unsafe spaces. They sleep outside. They use substances alone. They disengage from services. They increase risk of overdose. Medical emergencies, deaths make it much harder for clinicians like me to reach them.”
Amanda Merkwae, advocacy director of the ACLU of Wisconsin, said that while the proposal has an “admirable goal” it comes with unintended consequences. She said that in the state’s larger, denser cities, so much of the land is covered by various drug-free zones that lots of drug-related activity is punished there more harshly than in rural parts of the state. 
“In densely populated urban areas, that radius around each of these integrated locations overlaps to the point where sometimes an entire city can become functionally a drug-free zone,” she said, noting that the city of Milwaukee contains 156 public schools, 101 private schools, 12 multi-unit public housing facilities, four public swimming pools, dozens of youth and community centers, hundreds of child care facilities, six correctional facilities and more than 130 public parks. 
“So studies have shown that these zones don’t necessarily track where drug activity is most prevalent, but rather where certain populations are concentrated,” she said. “So we create this kind of two-tiered justice system based on geography rather than the nature of the crime. So residents in cities can face greater exposure to enhanced maximum penalties than those in rural or suburban areas for the exact same conduct.”

The Iowa Dental Board recently charged 74-year-old James Conrad Walgren with failure to maintain adequate safe and sanitary conditions for a dental office.
The board alleges that at some unspecified time in the past, it received a complaint “alleging areas of concern related to infection control” at Walgren’s practice. An inspection revealed what the board calls “some failures with regard to the sterilization of instruments,” which the board says Walgren has since addressed.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In order to resolve the case, the parties have agreed to a settlement that involves a $500 civil penalty. The settlement also calls for Walgren to complete a board-approved educational course focusing on infection control.
In addition, Walgren’s license has been placed on probation for two years, during which he will submit to worksite monitoring.
The monitoring program will require Walgren to hire a registered dental assistant or dental hygienist to assist with infection control and serve as a worksite monitor. The monitor will then submit quarterly reports to the board detailing the infection control measures that Walgren is following — such as sanitization of instruments and Walgren wearing a face mask as recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Prior sanctions were tied to cocaine use and sales
In May 1989, the board charged Walgren with nine separate regulatory violations, including failure to maintain a reasonable standard of competency, dishonorable or unprofessional conduct in the practice of dentistry by ingesting cocaine on numerous occasions between 1979 to 1988, diverting or distributing cocaine through his dental practice from 1979 to 1982, and selling cocaine to friends on at least one occasion in 1984.
The board also charged Walgren with an inability to practice dentistry with reasonable skill and safety due to the habitual or excessive use of drugs, habitual intoxication or addiction to the use of drugs, the willful or repeated prescribing or dispensing of drugs for illegal purposes, numerous instances of failing to record required information in patient records, and the willful or repeated prescribing or dispensing of drugs for uses not directly related to dentistry.
At the time, the board alleged Walgren had started using cocaine and marijuana during college from 1969 to 1973, continued using cocaine and marijuana while in dental school from 1974 to 1978, and then began practicing dentistry in Dubuque in July 1978.
According to the board, Walgren admitted to diverting about 20% of the clinic’s pharmaceutical cocaine to his own personal use, and to his friends’ use, from 1979 to 1982.
The board alleged Walgren also admitted to frequent use of cocaine from 1984 to 1986, and alleged that Walgren stated he had last used cocaine in early 1988 while vacationing in Jamaica.
The case was resolved with a board order suspending Walgren’s dental license for two years, followed by an indefinite period of probation and board supervision.

When a handful of  Red Onion State Prison inmates burned themselves in late 2024 amid allegations of racism and abuse, the Office of the State Inspector General (OSIG) launched an investigation into inmates’ claims of physical or sexual abuse, inhumane treatment, poor food quality and prolonged periods of isolation for some inmates.
Most of the claims have been found “unsubstantiated” by OSIG’s Corrections Ombudsman team in a report obtained by The Mercury Tuesday, while allegations of racism and retaliation against inmates have been deemed “inconclusive.”
Virginia’s new corrections ombudsman to prioritize Red Onion prison probe

This means that they could not be totally proven, nor disproven. 
With a series of both announced and unannounced visits to the Southwest Virginia prison, the investigation team reviewed more than 500 complaints it’d received, along with 77 incident reports that inmates had filed along with associated camera footage. The investigation was “limited to relevant circumstances as specified in the complaints,” the report stated. 
The sporadically redacted report outlined how interviews with inmates and correctional officers, along with reviews of incident reports and other evidence, led to OSIG’s conclusions. Among the redacted information was how many inmates burned themselves — a number disputed between prison reform activists and Virginia Department of Corrections Director Chad Dotson. 
Dotson told state lawmakers that six people burned themselves “using improvised devices that were created by tampering with electrical outlets,” while activists have asserted that closer to a dozen people harmed themselves in protest of the living conditions. 
Some correctional officers interviewed as part of the investigation believed the inmates who burned themselves were seeking transfer to be closer to their families — echoing a sentiment Dotson relayed last year. 
 Complaints about racism, religious discrimination and retaliation

The Mercury has communicated with Ekong Eshiet over the past year, one of the inmates who purportedly burned himself. He expressed concerns about officers retaliating against inmates who spoke out and said he felt unsafe around officers who’d purportedly taunted him for his Muslim faith. He has since transferred to an out-of-state-facility.
Other inmates relayed similar concerns in interview, saying they feared their access to phones or kiosks to transmit electronic communications would be limited, either in retaliation or as part of the regular operations. The report noted that phone access was a problem for inmates.  
Kenneth Hunter, a former Red Onion inmate who now frequents the Virginia State Capitol as an organizer with the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, said in an interview last year he spent prolonged time confined solitarily in Red Onion during his sentence for a nonviolent drug charge. He said he is “well aware” of the racism allegations that have stemmed from the facility.
Hunter, a Black man, recalled how large portions of his fellow inmates were Black, in contrast to the white correctional officers. Black people are also disproportionately incarcerated in Virginia, reports show. 
 ‘Unsubstantiated’ claims

Incarcerated people, their families and prison reform activists have repeatedly complained about what they call excessive use of solitary confinement. Though Virginia doesn’t technically label it as solitary confinement, “restorative housing” is a form of confined housing that is used in correctional facilities here.
A 2024 lawmaker-directed report by a consulting firm confirmed the use of restorative housing and signaled at least one, unnamed facility was not granting legally-required out-of-cell time for those who’d been isolated.
The new OSIG report shed more light on how restorative housing is used at Red Onion and found the facility had not abused the practice. The report said some inmates placed in restorative housing had chosen not to participate in out-of-cell time or had refused to comply with search procedures. 
“It is a safety concern when an inmate refuses to participate in search procedures and inmates are not allowed to leave their cell until they participate in search procedures,” the report stated.
The report dismissed other claims of medical or mental health neglect, poor food quality, inhumane living conditions and physical or sexual abuse. 
The probe also did not find Red Onion in noncompliance with VADOC’s grievance procedures, which must be addressed within 180 days of filing and requires inmates be notified at their completion. Review of a sexual harassment complaint and eight abuse complaints filed by a redacted name appear to have also cleared Red Onion staff of those allegations, per the OSIG report. 
The report noted “Additional information” concerning those allegations but the redactions make it difficult to ascertain the context. 
With the report concluded, investigators recommend the prison make complaint forms more accessible to residents and consider offering a course on self-advocacy and accessing health resources.

Dan McKee's State of the State 2025 address on Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The second floor entrance to the floor of the Rhode Island House of Representatives will remain closed when Gov. Dan McKee unveils his 2026 State of the State address next week. But the rest of the State House will remain open for members of the public to exercise their constitutional right to assemble and speak out.
That is the plan per an agreement announced Tuesday by the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) as part of a lawsuit against the McKee administration for blocking off the rotunda during last year’s “People’s State of the State” rally.
Most of the first floor of the State House will be open to the public during this year’s State of the State speech scheduled for Tuesday, Jan. 13.
“Our administration developed a plan to provide meaningful public access to the State House, including the rotunda, during the 2026 State of the State Address, while prioritizing the safety and security of all individuals present,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in an email to Rhode Island Current. 
The agreement crafted by Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office guarantees public access to the rotunda and the hallways of the first floor of the State House with a small pathway cordoned off near the stairway to the second-floor House chamber where the speech takes place. Public access to designated third floor hallways will also be allowed.
But the decision to close the area at the entrance to the House chamber during McKee’s speech still dismayed advocates like Harrison Tuttle.
“The governor is still participating in restricting freedom of assembly,” said Tuttle, formerly director of Black Lives Matter RI PAC, which dissolved last year, in a phone interview Tuesday afternoon. “It’s childish.”
Tuttle was a lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against McKee filed Oct. 28, by the ACLU in U.S. District Court. The suit claimed the governor violated protesters’ First Amendment rights and requested a ruling be made ahead of the upcoming State of the State Address.
Tuttle now works as a warming center coordinator for the Rhode Island State Council of Churches.
Advocates organized by Black Lives Matter RI PAC had planned to gather in the rotunda during McKee’s 2025 speech to call on the governor to declare a public health emergency to shelter the state’s growing homeless population over the winter. But when people started to arrive around 5 p.m. on Jan. 14, 2025, they were met by State and Capitol Police. Stanchions cordoned off the rotunda declaring the space was “reserved for the State of the State through the Department of Administration” from 4:30 to 10 p.m. 
Blocked from State House Rotunda, ‘People’s State of the State’ moves one story down

Demonstrators were instead told to gather in the “Bell Room” on the first floor, tucked away from the State House’s main entrance and elevators. The rotunda remained vacant throughout McKee’s 2025 speech.
On Oct. 28, 2025, the ACLU sued McKee in U.S. District Court over claims the governor violated protesters’ First Amendment rights and a request that a ruling be made ahead of the upcoming State of the State Address.
Because of the new plan from the McKee administration, the ACLU is no longer seeking a preliminary injunction. But that doesn’t mean the ACLU is dropping its case, which has yet to go before Chief Judge John J. McConnell.
“For more than 50 years, the State House rotunda has served as an indispensable space for the exercise of First Amendment rights,” Steven Brown, executive director for the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in a statement.
Still, advocates are painting the agreement as a minor victory as they prepare to gather again to call on state leaders to provide additional care for Rhode Island’s homeless population.
“For too long in our state, people have not provided adequate enough care that is needed for our most marginalized people,” Tuttle said. “Whatever happens in the governor’s address is not going to address those who are most marginalized.”

Video footage of the arrest shows that, shortly after the camera lights were turned off, two Grand Rapids Police Department officers came up behind Jessica Plichta, an organizer with Grand Rapids Opponents of War who planned Saturday’s rally, to arrest her. 
Plichta can be heard in the footage saying “I am not resisting arrest, I am going peacefully” as she is handcuffed.
Plichta was arrested, according to a statement from a Grand Rapids police spokesperson, after being positively identified as involved in an earlier instance where protesters were marching in the roadway. 
“Over 25 announcements were made from the PA system of a marked police cruiser for the group to leave the roadway and relocate their activities to the sidewalk,” the statement continued. “Blocking traffic in this manner is a direct violation of city and state law. The group refused lawful orders to move this free speech event to the sidewalk and instead began blocking intersections until the march ended.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I was put in the police car, and they drove me to a secondary location, because they said I was making a scene. And so they got me out at the secondary location,” she told WZZM following her arrest. “They had me bend over the police car, they patted me down, ruined my belongings, and then they put me back in the police car without buckling my seat belt and drove me to [the Kent County jail].” 
Plichta added that she was held for around three hours before being released, and as of Monday evening, had not received notice of official charges being filed. 
The Grand Rapids Police Department did not respond to questions from the Michigan Advance about whether official charges had been filed or what those specific charges would be. 
The police department also did not respond to questions about whether any other protesters were arrested based on that incident or other incidents at the rally, or if any additional arrests were expected. However, the police statement added that patrol officers at the scene were informed by their sergeant and watch commander that “if the individuals could be located, they were subject to arrest.”
Plichta expressed her disappointment at the police intervention at the protest, saying, “Why does Grand Rapids seem to be the only city in Michigan where protesting is illegal? I believe it’s our sacred right in this country to protest.”

This year, amid economic headwinds, the fate of yet another tax cut remains uncertain.
“There will be a revenue measure filed and passed at some point during this session. What that looks like? I’m not ready to say yet,” House Speaker David Osborne told reporters after adjournment on the first day of this year’s session Tuesday.
Osborne, R-Prospect, said lawmakers “continue to have discussions about different measures on tax policy.” 
Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, signaled a more cautious approach, saying Republicans should abide by the fiscal guardrails they established in a landmark 2022 law aimed at reducing the income tax while avoiding the kind of fiscal crisis that followed deep tax cuts in Kansas.

“I’d love to reduce it again, but then you start, ‘Well, what’s the next time? Where’s the next line?’” Stivers said. “We’ve drawn it. We’ve set it. We should abide by it.” 
The fiscal triggers for another half-percentage point reduction were barely missed in the most recent fiscal year, though some Republicans, notably House Majority Whip Jason Nemes, are still pushing lawmakers to approve another income tax cut this year. 
The 2022 law created a system of fiscal triggers based on state finances to determine when the state can afford to lower the income tax rate by a half-percentage point. Since then the Republican-controlled legislature has lowered the personal income tax rate from 5% to 3.5%, working toward a goal of eventually eliminating it. 
In the background of income tax cut discussions is a more challenging two-year state budget that lawmakers need to pass during the 60-day session. 
Kentucky expects a $156 million revenue shortfall for the current fiscal year, which economists attribute to uncertainty around trade and tariffs.
Osborne cited national, global and economic “uncertainty” when saying that this may be “the most difficult budget that we will have done since taking the majority.” Kentucky Republicans won control of the House in 2016 for the first time since 1920.
“Normally, when you think of difficult budget situations, you think of it in terms of not having money. And the fact of the matter is that we do have money and our revenues remain strong,” Osborne said. “Uncertainty is the enemy of a good budget, and we have a dramatic amount of uncertainty: Global uncertainty, national economy, things that are coming down (from) House Resolution 1 that we will have to deal with.” 
House Resolution 1, better known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will cut Medicaid spending over 10 years by $880 billion. Congress approved the measure last summer. More than 1 in 3 Kentuckians depend on Medicaid to pay for their health care. 
“All of those things create uncertainty. And when you have uncertainty, you have a lot of opinions about how to address that and I think that they will require a lot of debate, a lot of conversations,” he said. “I don’t expect that to be contentious by and large, I just think that it’s genuine disagreements and differences in opinions.” 
Kentucky is “constantly looking for ways to make our delivery of services better,” Osborne said, to make sure safety net programs are “accomplishing the goals that they’re intended to” while “also being mindful of the fact that these are taxpayer dollars.” 
Sen. Chris McDaniel, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee, said last year that federal food assistance program costs shifted to states through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could also amount to a $180 million “hit” to the budget. 
Senate President Stivers, of Manchester, gave a brighter outlook on the state budget, telling reporters that Republicans “feel like we’re pretty comfortable dealing with the budget as it currently exists.” Lawmakers also have the Budget Reserve Trust Fund to potentially rely on, also known as the state’s “rainy day” fund, which has more than $3.7 billion as of August 2025.
The GOP is expecting growth in the state’s receipts despite recent cuts to the state income tax, Stivers added.

Senate Democrats, who hold a small minority in the chamber, called for more transparency about fiscal matters ahead of lawmakers reconvening Tuesday. 
Senate Democratic Floor Leader Gerald Neal, of Louisville, said the caucus would focus on finding solutions to the state’s housing shortage, improving access to health care and education and increasing the state’s minimum wage. 
Neal repeatedly said Senate Democrats were concerned about future cost shifts from the federal government to states on programs like Medicaid and SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
“We are beginning at the circumstances that demand both fiscal responsibility and moral seriousness,” Neal said. “Decisions made in Washington are already shifting costs onto states, counties and local communities. Our responsibility in Frankfort is to confront those realities head on and not contend that they do not exist.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2711-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 17:57:55.543264

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As lawmakers return for a new session, the Nebraska Capitol walls are lined with golden-colored, framed portraits of the signers of the Declaration of Independence distributed online by conservative nonprofit PragerU. 
The 82 paintings along the first-floor hallway highlight the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence, key events from the founding of the United States and women of the American Revolution. The display is part of a push from the Trump administration’s White House Task Force 250, an outreach effort this year designed to celebrate America’s semiquincentennial. 
The White House has sent letters to state governors and leaders encouraging them to put the “Founders Museum” in state capitols, schools and embassies, NPR has reported. The White House also partnered with Hillsdale College to produce a history video series. Some view the Christian liberal arts school of about 2,000 students in Michigan as a conservative alternative to traditional higher education.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said the purpose of hosting the exhibit is to let the state “celebrate the country’s 250th anniversary” and do things that put Nebraska on the map.
The state also unveiled a logo for the semiquincentennial and a website link listing upcoming events in the state and nationally for the 250th anniversary. The state’s Semiquincentennial Commission sponsored the “Founders Museum” at the Capitol, officials said.
Conservative radio host Dennis Prager and Allen Estrin, Prager’s producer at the time, founded PragerU in 2009 to produce short videos on viewing historical, economic and climate issues using a conservative lens. The group has touted itself as a “free alternative to the dominant left-wing ideology in culture, media and education.”

PragerU has faced criticism for sharing content historians consider misleading and inaccurate. The nonprofit has pushed the view that the U.S. was founded on“Judeo-Christian values” and it is and should remain a Christian nation. 
When asked about the leanings of the nonprofit and criticisms of it, Pillen said that if people have a problem, he would tell them, “Hey, we’re the United States of America. We are Americans.” 
“Let’s celebrate America together and focus on unity, and let’s not get distracted by the 1/10 of 1%,” Pillen said, referring to what he described as the far ends of both sides.

U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon has said the traveling exhibit is dedicated “to the purpose of patriotic civics education in this country.” She said she hoped students and others would honor the founders by learning and debating their ideas.
“Patriotic education does not mean propaganda to produce blind allegiance to the government,” McMahon said during the opening last year of PragerU’s exhibit at the White House. “The patriotism of the revolution was the opposite of blind allegiance.” 
Next to the portraits in Lincoln are short biographies with QR codes that link to artificial intelligence-generated videos from PragerU featuring the historical figures talking about their lives. 
William G. Thomas, vice president of the research division at the American Historical Association, told NPR that he has “real concerns about the extent to which they weave together words that are preserved in primary sources from historical figures with other sort of commentary.”

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)The first day of the 2026 legislative session featured all the hallmarks of an opening celebration.
Lawmakers exchanged hugs and posed for selfies. Gun safety advocates, health care workers and lobbyists lined the State House second-floor corridors. The shrill reverberation of the 4 p.m. bell signaled legislators and onlookers to attention.
But the typically jubilant occasion was tinged with sorrow, as leaders of both chambers recognized the need for healing after a mass shooting at Brown University less than a month ago, which killed two students and injured nine more. 
“These last difficult weeks have emphasized what we all know to be true: Rhode Islanders come together in difficult times,” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, said.
Across the rotunda, Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, called for a moment of silence for the victims, university faculty and staff, health care workers, first responders and the Providence community. 
In an interview after the close of session, Lawson elaborated on the personal pain she felt as a former educator, whose own training on mass shooting preparations changed drastically over the course of her 30-year teaching career.
“What happened is tragic,” Lawson said. “When I started teaching, gun shootings wereas not a training we did.”
Dual resolutions honoring the victims and commending first responders were unanimously approved in both the chambers Tuesday.

Much like the uncertainty that gripped the state during the five-day manhunt before the shooter was identified and found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility, state lawmakers are also facing unknowns as they begin the six-month-long session. Chief among them: the fallout of federal funding cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which threaten state programs and services at nearly every turn — from Medicaid and the Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program to infrastructure projects and secondary and higher education support. 
R.I. lawmakers are back in action on Tuesday. Here’s what awaits them.

A trio of state-commissioned reports published in October offered a cursory projection of the financial and human costs for federal spending cuts, but the extent of the damage for Rhode Island has not been determined.
Despite the challenges posed by unprecedented and unpredictable actions in Washington, and a $101 million state budget deficit, Shekarchi and Lawson each pledged to protect and support the people and programs of the state.
Health care — costs and access for patients, support for hospitals and more competitive pay for primary care providers — were a shared emphasis in both leaders’ opening day remarks. Shekarchi also noted the “significant situation” around Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, which remain under threat of closure or state-appointed receivership if the prospective buyer, The Centurion Foundation, cannot finalize its purchase by Jan. 15.
“My father was a surgeon at Pawtucket Memorial Hospital, and I saw how much the surrounding communities were impacted when that hospital closed,” Shekarchi said. I do not want to see a major disruption to the already burdened health care system.”
Lawson, meanwhile, drew upon her teaching and present role as elected head of the National Education Association Rhode Island. She named expanded subsidies for child care providers to pay for their own child care — currently set to expire in 2028 — universal pre-K, a state constitutional right to education and a new workforce development center at the Community College of Rhode Island as some of her priorities for the 2026 session.
Shekarchi renewed his focus on affordable housing, touting “positive results” from the 60 new housing laws passed over the last five years under his tenure as speaker. Building permits for new housing rose 70% from 2022 to 2023, increasing again in 2024 in what marked the largest increase since the 2008 recession, Shekarchi said.

Crickets on RIPTA and a millionaire’s tax
Despite supporters making an early push for additional state funding for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) was not addressed in either leader’s first-day remarks. Transit advocates plan to unveil their own funding proposals for the cash-strapped bus agency Thursday afternoon. RIPTA faces a nearly $14 million budget shortfall in the next fiscal year.
The prospect of a tax on top earners, also a priority among various advocacy groups, was not mentioned on Tuesday, either. Asked directly about the policy idea in an interview after the session, Lawson reiterated the increased need for additional state revenue, potentially through a “millionaire’s tax.” Lawson has co-sponsored iterations of the bill in past legislative sessions.
Both leaders concluded their brief remarks with messages centered on collaboration and inclusion. No other policies were introduced or voted on.
“For Rhode Island’s future, let us listen to one another, learn from one another, and reaffirm our shared commitment to the shared values we cherish,” Lawson said. “No matter the challenge before us, when we work together, we can and will emerge stronger.”
The message applies especially in the Rhode Island Senate, where a series of leadership challenges over the last two years and the April 2025 death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio divided chamber Democrats. Lawson and Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, chosen as the new leadership team in the final two months of the 2025 session, told Rhode Island Current in December interviews that the lingering tensions had evaporated.
Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat who voted against Lawson and Ciccone in a party caucus in April, seemed to agree.
“Honestly, the absolute disaster we are facing with the Trump administration is going to serve as a unifying force,” DiMario said in an interview after the session.
Sen. Jonathon Acosta, a Central Falls Democrat who last year excoriated the feuding factions within his party for placing personal politics over policy, also said he was “cautiously optimistic.
Acosta referenced a December meeting convened by Senate leadership in which more detailed policy priorities and a schedule were presented — two facets he felt were absent during the 2025 session.

The race is on 
In the House, the biggest unspoken presence hanging over the chamber is the career path of its leader. Shekarchi has been widely named as a potential candidate for the 2026 governor’s race, though he has fended off direct questions with a promise to announce a decision in the first three months of the year.
Asked on Tuesday, Shekarchi gave the same timeline for his answer.
The attorney general’s race also influenced first-day activities. Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat, formally accepted the role of chair of the House Committee on Judiciary on Tuesday. She had been informally tapped in November after the former chair, Rep. Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, was removed from the leadership role.










Honestly, the absolute disaster we are facing with the Trump administration is going to serve as a unifying force.

Craven’s fall came amid new scrutiny of decades-old domestic violence charges, brought to light during his brief run for state attorney general. He also suspended his campaign for attorney general. He intends to serve out the remainder of his term, but has already said he will not seek reelection in November.
“At a time when countless rights are being trampled upon with disregard, the House Judiciary Committee stands as a crucial line of defense for all Rhode Islanders,” McEntee said. “This is a tremendous honor.”
Committee leaders remained unchanged in the Senate. 
State lawmakers will meet biweekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4 p.m.
Gov. Dan McKee is scheduled to deliver his annual State of the State address on Tuesday, Jan. 13 at 7 p.m. in the House chambers. He is expected to unveil a proposed fiscal 2026 budget in the following days.

(Photo by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority and provided by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority on Tuesday approved spending nearly $500,000 to repair six bridges that were struck by a truck carrying an oversized load.
The agency’s governing board approved paying $491,700 to Built-Right Construction following an emergency declaration that allowed immediate repairs to be made to the six bridges over the Will Rogers Turnpike. 
The incident took place Dec. 16 on the turnpike near Claremore in Rogers and Mayes counties.
“The bridges sustained significant damage to multiple beams in the eastbound direction,” according to OTA.
Joe Echelle, OTA executive director, said the emergency repairs were completed within a week of the accident, and the bridges are now open and structurally sound.
After the bridges were struck, four were closed and two remained open, said Darian Butler, OTA engineering director.
Butler called the event “monumental,” adding that OTA officials “hadn’t seen anything quite like it.”
Butler said the agency will pursue reimbursement for the cost to repair the damages with the truck company’s insurance carrier.
“This was an illegal load,” he said, adding that the company did not get the required permit.
The driver of the 2021 Freightliner was cited for failure to have a permit, according to a citation provided to Oklahoma Voice by the state Department of Public Safety.
Service Oklahoma on Tuesday did not immediately release the collision report detailing the incident.
Oklahoma Department of Transportation Director Tim Gatz told his panel on Monday that the truck was transporting a utility pole base of some kind.
Gatz said had the company sought a permit, a suitable route could have been determined.
“This load was not routed and certainly was not observing the travel ways they should have been sticking to,” Gatz said. “The fact that they hit six of these bridges is on the inexcusable side.”
Because bridges had to be closed, disruption in local travel patterns was significant, Gatz said.

Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin) said reporting known or suspected overdoses to a central database would help first responders coordinate their responses. (Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Starting this year, emergency medical service providers are now required to report known or suspected overdoses to a statewide mapping system overseen by the Pennsylvania State Police.
It’s the result of a new law sponsored by Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin). 
The Overdose Information Network previously included reports from law enforcement, which Mastriano said excluded an estimated 80% of fatal and nonfatal overdoses where EMS responded. 
“This isn’t just data collection,” said Mastriano. “It’s about saving lives.” 
Collecting information in one place could allow first responders to identify “bad batches” of drugs, such as concoctions with higher amounts of fentanyl or other addictive compounds, Mastriano said. 
“All of us are flawed people, sinners, and we struggle with things. And sometimes people end up in the throes of addiction,” said Mastriano. “When people are stuck in addiction, we don’t want them to die in Pennsylvania. We want to try to save their lives.” 
An interactive data report from the Pennsylvania Office of Drug Surveillance and Misuse Prevention breaks down overdose data, including demographic information.
In 2023, 4,719 Pennsylvanians died from an overdose and there were 37,371 nonfatal suspected overdoses, according to the state Department of Health. Fatal overdoses dropped by 29% in 2024 to 3,341 — though the most recent state report doesn’t include a figure for nonfatal overdoses. 
Senate Bill 89, now Act 18, passed both chambers unanimously and was signed into law in June. A companion bill sponsored by Mastriano, Senate Bill 92, passed out of the Senate in April on a 33-16 vote. 
It would impose a mandatory 25-year minimum sentence on anyone who sells or distributes fentanyl that kills another person. The proposal targets dealers who might otherwise “cut deals for lenient sentencing,” as detailed in an accompanying memo. 
The measure hasn’t advanced in the House.
Mastriano left the stage after his portion of the press conference, and did not respond to questions about whether or not he would run for governor. 
He was resoundingly defeated by now-Gov. Josh Shapiro in 2022. Opponents of his campaign repeatedly highlighted Mastriano’s role in supporting President Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election, including his presence outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when rioters stormed the building and drove Congress from its chambers to disrupt the vote certification. 
Shapiro is expected to officially launch his campaign for reelection this week. State Treasurer Stacy Garrity received the Pennsylvania GOP’s endorsement for the party’s nomination in September, but Mastriano hasn’t ruled out running again.

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Gov. Patrick Morrisey is expanding his efforts to improve the state’s overburdened foster care system, announcing a plan to put programs in public schools aimed at helping children before they need the child welfare system.
There are around 6,000 children in West Virginia’s foster care system, and the state has received more than 10,000 referrals so far this year. 
“This is a very difficult area, but I do think we’re making progress, and it’s important that we continue to update people about what’s going on,” Morrisey said Tuesday at the state Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia.
In an effort to reduce the number of children coming into the foster care system, Morrisey announced that the state will expand a program known as Star Academy. It’s a school-within-a-school model designed to help at-risk middle school students. 
The program, built on site at current schools, provides classroom instruction along with an academic recovery program to help students catch up. 
“I think it’s going to help kids, keep kids engaged in school and reduce some of the risks that lead to foster care involvement,” Morrisey said. 
His administration plans to open eight new Star Academy sites in the state.
Alex Mayer, secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services, said it was a good step in establishing primary prevention in the state. 
“I think prevention is a key part, though, to the overall success and reform in child welfare,” he said. “So while it’s not, I think, the only thing we have to be focusing on, it’s a key part in the reforms that we’re going to be putting in place and moving forward with here in West Virginia.”
Morrisey will use unspent federal Temporary Assistance for Need Families dollars to pay for the $8 million project, and he’ll need lawmakers to approve some changes to allow the expansion. States have discretion about how they use TANF, a federal emergency relief program, and it can be used to pay for a wide range of programs.
The program can serve up to 80 students per year and generally operate on a three to five year cycle. Morrisey that could allow the programs to serve up to 240 to 400 students per school. 
Star Academy has been piloted in four areas — Charleston, Logan, Martinsburg and Philippi. Results from West Virginia’s four pilot programs show an 81% decrease in behavioral incidents and a 63% increase in attendance. 
“We’re seeing that they’re already producing some strong results in math and English scores. But it’s on the behavioral side that we’re really encouraged,” Morrisey said.
West Virginia recently enacted a new school discipline law outlining how teachers can respond to violent and threatening behavior in the classroom following increased student discipline issues. 
Educators have linked worsening behavioral issues in schools to the state’s ongoing substance abuse crisis; behavioral issues can be because of abuse and neglect or a result of neonatal abstinence syndrome, they said. 
Fewer than half of the state’s 55 counties have alternate learning centers for children with behavioral issues.
No planned changes for homeschool students 
The Star Academy will serve students in public schools, and Morrisey said he wasn’t interested in “a whole new regulatory scheme” for parents who are homeschooling their children. 
The number of homeschool children in the state is growing. 
Previous Gov. Jim Justice and some Republicans previously floated the idea of tightening homeschool students’ reporting requirements after 14-year-old Kyneddi Miller, a homeschool student, died in 2024 from apparent starvation in Boone County. The girl’s mother hadn’t turned in the required homeschool assessments to the local school district that could have prompted someone to check in on the child. 
The Senate last year declined to take up a bill that would paused a parent’s request to homeschool if there’s a pending child abuse investigation against the parent. The measure was named “Raylee’s Law” for an eight-year-old girl who died of abuse and neglect in 2018 after her parents withdrew her from school. Educators at her elementary school had notified Child Protective Services of potential abuse. 
In response to a question from WOWK reporter Maddy Sperling, the governor said he trusted parents to take care of their children.
“I think it’s important that our kids are always brought up in the best and proper environments, and if there are complaints, they’re made, they’re all going to get addressed,” he said. 
Morrisey has announced several foster care reform efforts since taking office last year and recently unveiled a plan to bring 380 foster children in out-of-state institutions back to West Virginia. Foster children are in facilities in states including California, Texas, Utah and Washington, according to DoHS data.
The governor said he’ll request $6 million in state funding for a new fund aimed at renovating current state-owned buildings with the goal of opening beds for foster children who need acute mental and behavioral health services. 
The 60-day legislative session begins Wednesday, Jan. 14. Morrisey will deliver his second State of the State address that evening.

Kyle Howe resigned from City of Toledo’s police force in 2023 when city officials publicly condemned him for what they alleged were multiple instances of excessive force. Howe’s resignation came in the midst of an internal investigation that involved a review of various body-camera videos involving several individuals he had arrested.
At the time, City Attorney Michael Marquess said city officials were “shocked and dismayed by Mr. Howe’s abhorrent behavior in what we believe to be several instances of unnecessary force.”
In September 2023, two separate lawsuits were filed against Howe and the City of Toledo in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, each alleging false arrest, assault, battery, negligent supervision and civil rights violations. That was followed by similar lawsuits filed by other citizens in November 2023, February 2024 and May 2024. A sixth lawsuit was filed in February 2025.
Court records indicate that of the six lawsuits, one resulted in a jury finding in favor of Howe, one resulted in a summary judgment in favor of Howe, one resulted in an out-of-court settlement and three resulted in a dismissal that may or may not have involved a settlement.
In February 2024, the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy initiated its efforts to suspend or revoke Howe’s certification. In December 2025, a final decision was made to suspend Howe’s certification for three years. By suing the academy, Howe is now seeking judicial review of that decision.
Arrest triggers investigation, resignation
According to Howe’s court petition, he graduated from the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy in October 2017 and was hired a few weeks later by the State Center Police Department. In August 2018, he was hired by the Toledo Police Department.
Court records indicate the City of Toledo promoted Howe to the position of sergeant in November 2022 and bestowed several awards and accommodations on him during his years with the department. According to the records, Howe received no formal field training or training in report writing or conflict de-escalation while working for the city.
On March 30, 2023, Howe conducted a traffic stop and arrested Shyla Wolf, who later complained to the police chief that she was mistreated by Howe. On April 7, 2023, the city opened a formal investigation into the matter and one week later Howe was placed on administrative leave.
On April 23, 2023, Howe resigned. The next day, the city’s hired investigator, Jon Thomas, presented the preliminary report on his investigation to the city, which publicly condemned Howe’s conduct while stating it did not rise to the level of excessive force.
Around that time, Howe was the focus of a KCRG-TV report that included body-camera footage of him physically restraining Wolf, who was suspected of driving while barred.
The Tama Toledo News Chronicle subsequently posted to its YouTube channel a series of videos from traffic stops conducted by Howe, some which show Howe pushing people to the ground and yelling, seemingly without provocation, “Stop resisting!”
On Feb. 15, 2024, the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy initiated efforts to decertify Howe as an Iowa peace officer.
Howe, meanwhile, had taken a job with the Polk County Juvenile Detention Center where he worked as a youth service worker. He later was hired as a youth counselor for the state-run Iowa State Training School in Eldora.
Report: Howe lacked the ‘cognitive capacity’ to recall arrest details
State records show Howe contested the academy’s efforts to suspend or revoke his certification, which led to a two-day hearing in April 2025 before Administrative Law Judge Denise Timmins.
At the hearing, Thomas served as the state’s expert witness and indicated he had reviewed several arrests by Howe and although he found no use of excessive force, he did conclude Howe had problems “overall (with) some poor decision making” related to documentation, report writing, and inappropriate language.
Thomas found that Howe’s tone of voice, his choice of words, and his use of profanities were unprofessional and helped create what he characterized as “a public perception of excessive force.” Howe, Thomas said, had demonstrated a pattern of conduct in which he “just did not attempt to de-escalate or bring down the temperature of the conversation” with arrestees.
In his investigative report for the City of Toledo, Thomas stated that while Howe’s written arrest reports  may have conflicted with what could be seen on video of those arrests, Howe “did not have the cognitive capacity to accurately recall” all of the details of those arrests when writing his reports.
Judge: Howe ‘lacked judgment and discipline’
While lawyers for the academy argued that Howe, by providing false information in his reports, had committed serious misconduct warranting the revocation of his certification, Timmins found that Howe was, at most, “careless in his report writing.”
Timmins also found that while Howe had claimed in his reports to have “assisted” — rather than forced — arrestees to the ground, such language doesn’t represent a false statement but is instead a “poor choice of words” that reflects the actual language Howe and other police officers throughout the nation are specifically trained to use in their reports.
“If one were to watch the videos without having any other context or evidence to supplement what is observed, the immediate emotional reaction is alarm and dismay over the actions taken and words said by (Howe),” Timmins wrote in her decision “However, in legal proceedings, emotions cannot replace evidence.”
As to whether Howe committed a lower level of misconduct that could result in the suspension of his certification, Timmins sided with the state.
Timmins wrote that Howe’s “tone of voice, his aggressive stance, the consistency of his desire to take subjects to the ground, his choice of words used during his interactions, and his overall lack of empathy and respect when dealing with another human being that he has authority over, all fall well below the current standards of the profession … Just as important, this conduct occurred over an extended period of time with multiple instances.”
She added that during Howe’s “tenure with the Toledo Police Department, he was rough around the edges,” and “lacked judgment and discipline of emotions when others around him challenged his authority.” She stated that while “none of these actions are ideal in a law enforcement officer,” they are traits that “can change with age, maturity and proper training.”

According to a statement shared to social media, Romulus Police responded to a report of an active shooter at 9:53 a.m. after school employees instituted a lockdown upon seeing a man with a handgun attempting to enter the school’s main doors. There were reports of shots fired. 
Officers apprehended the man near the main entrance and recovered a handgun at the scene. An investigation into the suspect’s motives or intentions remains ongoing, with the department advising anyone with information related to the incident to contact Detective Sergeant Jason Otter at 734-942-6857. Callers may remain anonymous.
There is no ongoing threat to the school or the community, the department said, commending the school employees for “their quick recognition of danger and immediate notification to 911.” 
“Their professional and timely actions may have prevented this incident from becoming much worse,” the department wrote in a statement. 
State Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton), whose district includes Romulus, issued a statement Tuesday afternoon, noting that he’d been briefed on the matter by local leaders including Romulus School Board President Porsche Laster and Mayor Robert McCraight.
“I’m extremely grateful that our school staff and first responders were able to ensure that all students and staff remained safe during this frightening moment,” Camilleri said. “Every safety system worked today, and we avoided any potential tragedy.

The Vermont Senate Ethics Panel dismissed two complaints against Sens. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, and Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, and found their conduct was not unethical under the state’s Senate rules.
The complaints were filed over the summer, after lawmakers worked overtime to craft the final form of a wide-ranging education bill, now called Act 73.
The ethics complaints allege the senators advocated for private schools they are associated with. Beck, the Senate minority leader, is employed as a teacher at St. Johnsbury Academy, while Bongartz, the chair of the Senate Education Committee, served almost two decades on the board of Burr and Burton Academy.

Bongartz and Beck both held critical positions on a conference committee charged with reconciling differences in the House and Senate versions of education reform legislation.
The Legislature passed the bill June 16 and Gov. Phil Scott signed the bill into law on July 1.
One complaint, filed by Friends of Vermont Public Education board member Geo Honigford, alleged that the two senators violated ethical standards by negotiating the reform bill and used their positions to advance provisions benefiting the private schools.
Among its many components, the bill set new limits on which independent schools would remain eligible to receive public funding in the future and how much they would be able to charge.
The other complaint, filed on July 9 by Essex-Westford school board Chair Robert Carpenter, alleged ethical violations against Beck specifically.
Carpenter, in his complaint, said he was “alarmed at the conflicts of interests we watch unfold at the state level,” and asked why Beck did not recuse himself from education reform negotiations.
Carpenter attached correspondence his board had with Beck during the state’s implementation of Act 127, a law that tweaked the state’s education finance formula. In the exchange, Carpenter asked Beck whether it was “the will of the legislature and the governor to scale back public education in Vermont?,” to which Beck replied “yes.”
In the Senate Ethics Panel letters dismissing the complaints, panel member Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, wrote that the panel “did not find probable cause an ethical violation occurred” under Senate rules.
Senate Ethics Panel correspondence typically remains confidential but in this case was shared with VTDigger. The panel’s dismissal of the complaints was first reported by Seven Days.
In correspondence with Carpenter, Hinsdale wrote that Beck’s employment as a teacher “was no secret” at the time of his election. She wrote that he has been employed with St. Johnsbury Academy longer than he’s been a senator.
“To issue an ethical violation to a Senator solely for being an employee/member of a class, known to voters prior to his election in the body, may create constitutional challenges and undermine the sovereignty of the electorate,” Hinsdale wrote.
Bongartz said in an interview the complaint against him was “vacuous” and said he “knew from day one” it would be dismissed.
“I never lost a moment’s sleep over it,” he said. “There was absolutely nothing there.”
He called the complaint “an attempt to weaponize the ethics process, which is unfortunate.”
Beck also said he had not given the complaints much thought.
“My job in here is to represent my towns, the schools in my districts, the students in my district, and that’s what I do, and if somebody from a faraway district doesn’t want me to do that then, I’m not gonna not do what I’m supposed to do,” he said. “I’m gonna do my job.”
Honigford said he was not surprised by the panel’s dismissal. “I knew they were going to dismiss it before I even filed it,” he said.
“You basically have to get caught with your hand in a cookie jar,” he said. “And aside from that, there’s really nothing you can do to be unethical in Vermont.”
Carpenter in an interview suggested that school boards are held to higher standards than sitting senators are.
“I did believe that ethics were not being followed, and that there was private interest involved,” he said. “At the local school board level that would have zero tolerance whatsoever — our constituents would vote us out of office instantly.”
A third complaint against Beck, meanwhile, remains in process. Filed by Danville School District’s board Chair Clayton Cargill, the complaint alleges Beck “used his position and legislative influence to advance a narrative and push” the district to close high school grades at the Danville School to benefit St. Johnsbury Academy.
Beck similarly dismissed that complaint. Cargill said he has not heard back yet from the Senate Ethics Panel.
Statehouse Bureau Chief Ethan Weinstein contributed reporting.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa lawmakers meeting Tuesday said they recognized the need for expanding access to subacute mental health services in Iowa — but said there are no specific plans on how to tackle the issue yet.
The Subacute Mental Health Care Services Interim Study Committee met Tuesday, the week before the 2026 legislative session is set to kick off, to discuss concerns and issues with certain services in Iowa’s mental health system. Subacute mental health programs are for people who do not need emergency hospitalization but need more intensive support than is available through outpatient care — a type of care that Iowans and officials said was extremely limited and difficult to access in the state.
Mary Neubauer, a former spokesperson for the Iowa Lottery, said her family had extensive experience in seeking subacute mental health care system as they pursued care for their son, Sergei, who died by suicide in 2017. Sergei, who was adopted by Neubauer and her husband in 2009, struggled with major depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder after going through an abusive childhood in Russia.  Neubauer said their family knew he would need “more support” as he transitioned to life in the U.S., but that after his second inpatient psychiatric care hospitalization, “it was obvious he would need longer-term care if he were to have a chance to regain his health.”
When Neubauer and her husband asked the psychiatrist treating their son where they could find such care, she said “the doctor’s answer was that there were great subacute care programs out there, but he did not know of any in Iowa, and we would have to find them.”
“I do not denigrate that doctor,” Neubauer said. “He was doing the best he could in the state with few resources at the time, but for us as parents who were so scared and stressed, that answer was devastating.”
After extensive research, Neubauer said, her family found two subacute mental health treatment centers that they believed would be a good fit for Sergei, located in Arizona and Wisconsin. Sergei received care in the Arizona treatment program for five weeks, and then went on for three months of “step-down care” in California.
After completing these programs, he returned to Iowa. While he appeared to be doing well in his first weeks home, Neubauer said, he eventually committed suicide in September 2017.
“I don’t know if Sergei’s story would have been different, would have had a different outcome if more mental health treatment options would have been available for him here in Iowa,” Neubauer said. “But I do know that his journey to regain his health was made that much harder by having to go halfway across the country to receive that care, and it made our journey as his parents trying to support him absolutely excruciating. If we can keep another family from having that experience, we will have done something good.”
The committee members heard from officials with the Iowa departments of Health and Human Services and Inspections, Appeals, and Licensing about why there was a dearth of subacute mental health programs in Iowa.
One of the major difficulties identified in Iowa’s current oversight of these subacute mental health care was a provision in Iowa Code stating these services “shall be limited to a period not to exceed ten calendar days or another time period determined in accordance with rules adopted by the department for this purpose, whichever is longer.”
Sara Throener, legislative liaison for DIAL, said the 10 days marked in this section was not meant to be a hard limit for receiving subacute mental health services, but a period for receiving “rolling assessment” on the patient’s condition. While there is the ability to provide longer care, Throener said it is possible the 10-day language is “misconstrued by payment providers or by providers thinking that’s all that they can offer.”
Neubauer said as their family looked at treatment options for their son, subacute mental health treatment programs typically ranged from six weeks to three months in length.
The perceived 10-day limit was also brought up by providers in a Request for Information from Iowa HHS, according to Cory Turner, HHS division administrator for state-operated specialty care.
“It’s not a fault of the rules or HHS at the time, it’s just the way in which it’s written and the way in which it’s interpreted, providers see it as a detriment,” Turner said. “… It doesn’t ensure that there’s viability in their business model. If you have a 10-day limit on someone, and that 10th day comes and goes, the individual may already be discharged by the time they receive payment, or they may not get payment for services at all.”
Turner said these issues on time limits may be part of why Iowa’s currently available subacute mental health care provisions are being underutilized. There are currently at least 30 beds at six health care providers in Iowa that provide this treatment, according to HHS data — but Turner said in one RFI response, a provider said of the 16 beds available in their program, only two were being used.
Other issues were funding and reimbursement streams for these programs, he said, as well as difficulties recruiting qualified staff.
Turner said investing more in subacute programs could help lessen the burden on other parts of Iowa’s mental health care system. At several of Iowa’s mental health care institutes, he said, there are significant numbers of patients “in the facilities for longer lengths of stay than are necessary.” He said some of these individuals likely would benefit from moving from an emergency, acute level of care to a subacute treatment program, that would help “unkink” the system and free up resources for others in crisis.
There are also other rules, like higher professional requirements for practitioners in subacute facilities than in crisis facilities, as well as lower limits on how many patients at a time can be cared for in these programs, that officials said make it less economically viable for health care providers to offer these services in Iowa.
Though the committee discussed several issues, the panel did not move forward with any suggestions at the meeting. Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, who co-chaired the committee, said “it sounds like there is sufficient interest that we are going to move something forward.” However, he said any potential legislation on this issue is far from finalized.
“Many of you are going to think as a result of today, we’re going to come out with a grandiose, multimillion-dollar plan — don’t count on it,” Mohr said. “Some of you expect us to come out with virtually nothing, and maybe one or two recommendations — don’t count on it. We’re going to get as far as we can moving this issue forward, based on the knowledge we have now and the questions we still have yet to ask. But it’s an issue that seems to be important, and we will move this forward through our committee structure probably, the Legislature — again, you know how things work here, there’s no definite path for it.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As Utah adds more titles to its banned book list, three award-winning authors and two high school students are suing the state, the board of education and three school districts over what they describe as “the freedom to read.”
In a lawsuit filed Tuesday with the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, authors Elana K. Arnold, Ellen Hopkins and Amy Reed, the Kurt Vonnegut Estate, and two anonymous students challenged Utah’s “sensitive materials” law that the Legislature expanded in 2024, making it easier to prohibit “criminally indecent or pornographic” books from public schools statewide.
“The right to read and the right to free speech are inseparable. The First Amendment protects our freedom to read, learn, and share ideas free from unconstitutional censorship,” Tom Ford, attorney at the ACLU of Utah said in a statement. “This law censors constitutionally protected books, silences authors, and denies students access to ideas, in violation of the First Amendment rights of students and authors alike, and must be struck down.”

Plaintiffs are asking a 3rd District judge to rule the state’s book bans as unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, since, they say, they constitute “blatant violations of the free speech rights of students and authors alike.”
The Utah State Board of Education has a list of 22 titles that at least three school districts have reported to contain “objective sensitive materials,” which the law defines as “pornographic or indecent.” And, hundreds of books have also been removed from individual school libraries in the state.
Arnold is the author of “What Girls are Made of” and “Damsel,” and Ellen Hopkins is the author of “Tilt,” “Fallout” and “Tricks,” all books that have been prohibited from public school libraries all over the state. Other individual libraries have banned works including Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse-Five” and Toni Morrison’s “The Bluest Eye.” 
The Utah State Board of Education said in a Tuesday statement that it is aware of the lawsuit and cannot comment on specifics of ongoing litigation.
“We remain committed to fulfilling our responsibilities under state law and supporting local education agencies in serving Utah students,” the board wrote. “The Board will respond through the appropriate legal channels.”



Let us know what you think...


 


In the lawsuit, plaintiffs criticized that the book ban applies to “any book that contains even a single description or depiction of sex, no matter how fleeting, no matter its context, and no matter its literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.” 
One of the student plaintiffs said in an ACLU news release that making books disappear sends “a clear message about whose stories matter and whose do not.”
“Book bans do more harm than simply removing stories. Empty shelves cost us understanding and connection, turning schools from places of learning into systems of control,” the student said. “Censorship does not just make ideas disappear, but also makes schools more confusing and dangerous because of its chilling effect on our right to learn.”
The suit also rejects a lack of distinction between kindergartners and 12th graders in the rule.
“This creates an absurd mismatch with other parts of Utah’s own legal standards. State law permits sixteen-year-olds to consent to certain sexual activity,” the lawsuit reads. “Yet the same students whom Utah trusts to make intimate, real-world decisions about their bodies are, under the Book Removal Law, barred from accessing out books that contain a mere single passage describing the very conduct in which is lawful for them to engage.”  
Plaintiffs say no one disputes that pornography and obscene material should be excluded from school libraries. However, statewide bans have gone further than what the U.S. Constitution allows, according to the lawsuit. The Constitution protects books from removal if they “have value as a whole” under the Miller-for-minors standard.

MONTPELIER — House Speaker Jill Krowiniski had some less-than-cheery opening remarks to her colleagues to kick off the 2026 Vermont legislative session.
“Let’s be honest, last year was tough, and anyone who tells you otherwise didn’t sit where you are and confront the decisions that came before us in this chamber,” the Burlington Democrat said.
Last year, lawmakers worked into June — well past their more typical May adjournment — to hammer out the details of Act 73, the year’s landmark education reform package. Despite the marathon work of 2025, this year is expected to require similar fortitude, as lawmakers determine how and if to consolidate school districts, and whether to restrict school spending to limit property tax increases.

To complicate matters, lawmakers are eyeing the onslaught of federal funding cuts, and the Legislature’s budget writers have warned their colleagues that 2026 will require agonizing spending decisions. 
The start of the second year in the biennium, Tuesday began at a fast pace. Over 60 bills were introduced on the House floor, and almost as many moved in the Senate. And with numerous new lawmakers in both chambers, leadership appointed incoming representatives and senators to their legislative committees. 
In no surprise, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, told his upper chamber colleagues that education would be the year’s big topic. He said he expected to release a bill this week that would seek to limit the growth of school district spending for two years while Act 73’s other reforms play out.
Gov. Phil Scott welcomed the Legislature back to Montpelier in a statement reflecting on the fifth anniversary of Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riots.
“It’s an important reminder that fear, anger, and deeply held beliefs can be manipulated and elevated to the point of destruction and violence,” he said. “It’s also a reminder that our democracy depends on respect for the rule of law, peaceful political disagreement, and the integrity and accountability of the institutions created to serve the people.”
The anniversary accompanied looming changes in Vermont’s capital. The session launched with enhanced security. All visitors were directed to a single point of entry rather than the usual multiple doors, and police checked bags with X-rays, as was sometimes the case last year. 
Baruth indicated in his introductory remarks that these precautions may become more regular, and that Capitol Police have been working to “beef up” security.  
“We mean to go there full time at some point,” he said of the single point of entry. “This particular session you will see that on and off as we get accustomed to it.”

We’ve put everything you need to engage with statehouse lawmaking in one story, with links. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Your starter kit for the 2026 Vermont legislative session.","Every year, for roughly five months, the Vermont Legislature takes up the people’s business, debating policies and passing laws that impact all aspects of Vermonters’ lives.
As part of our annual Legislative Guide, we’ve gathered the essential information to follow along, with links to deeper explainers and tools you can use all session.
No matter where in Vermont you live, you have at least one person representing you in each chamber of the Legislature — the House and the Senate. You can find out who they are and how to contact them in the state’s legislative directory, or learn about other ways to contact them directly at the Statehouse. 
Lawmakers in each body are elected every two years. Those two years are considered one biennial session, though each annual lawmaking period is also described as a session.
You can watch representatives and senators work in real time. Anyone can show up at the statehouse, at 115 State St. in Montpelier. Plus, the Vermont General Assembly — what we usually just call “the Legislature” — livestreams most of its activity on YouTube. That includes debate and votes in both chambers. Since the Covid-19 era, the offerings have also included committee meetings where lawmakers craft and vet bills in specific policy areas. 
Each committee has its own YouTube channel. New streams begin every time the body convenes, and videos are saved on the channel for later viewing.
The House and Senate calendars, posted daily on the Legislature’s homepage, list the bills and other items that each chamber plans to take up. You can also read about what’s happening in Final Reading, our daily Statehouse newsletter. 
Who runs things?
To be a good observer, you need to know who’s in charge. There are a number of key roles in the Vermont Legislature. 
The most powerful individual in the statehouse, at least on paper, is the speaker of the House. That person has abilities that, in the Senate, are distributed among several officials. Specifically, the speaker sets the agenda for the chamber and is responsible for moderating the action on the floor. She also makes committee assignments and assigns committee chairs.  
Unlike the House, the Senate does not choose its presiding officer. The people do that, when they vote for lieutenant governor. But while the lieutenant governor technically runs Senate meetings, the president pro tempore (often referred to as the “pro tem”) does so in practice. 
In the Senate, committee chairs and members are appointed by a three-member Committee on Committees, which includes the lieutenant governor, the pro tem and the so-called third member. That last person is selected by a vote of all 30 senators at the start of the biennium. 
Each political party in the House and Senate selects one member in each chamber to serve as its leader. The parties also generally elect an assistant or deputy leader — sometimes known as the “whip” — to help enforce priorities and count votes before a bill reaches the floor. 
Two offices carry the institutional knowledge of the House and Senate: the clerk of the House and the secretary of the Senate. As chief parliamentarians, they ensure that each chamber’s rules are followed by lawmakers. And as the chambers’ chief administrative officers, they keep the building running. 
Read about these leaders and other supporting officers in the Legislature here. 
What do they do? 
One of the primary jobs of the Legislature is to create and adjust the laws of the state by approving bills. 
A bill becomes a law if a majority of the members in both chambers — the House and the Senate — vote to approve it, and the governor signs it. Simple, right?
Not quite. There are lots of ways a bill can die before it reaches the governor’s desk — and even then, the governor has a few options for how to treat legislation that’s been passed by the House and Senate. Only bills that clear all the potential hurdles become state laws.
Here’s a more detailed look at the process.
Another key role for the Legislature is to approve government spending and taxation. That involves voting on annual budget bills, tax bills and bills involving infrastructure investments. Typically, though not necessarily, these bills are developed with the input and approval of the governor. The executive branch is then charged with raising and spending the money necessary to keep the state running, and it has a certain amount of discretion to determine where that money goes. 
There is, of course, a longer answer.

El déficit de California está creciendo, la incertidumbre se cierne sobre el estado y los líderes estatales pueden tener menos opciones que antes para hacerle frente.


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
El gobernador Gavin Newsom abrió el 2025 con un pronóstico optimista : impulsado por $17 mil millones más en ingresos de lo planeado previamente, el estado tendría un modesto superávit de $363 millones para el año fiscal 2025-26, dijo a los periodistas en enero.
 Pero la vida da un giro repentino.
Los incendios forestales de enero que arrasaron Los Ángeles obligaron al estado a gastar miles de millones de dólares en ayuda por desastres y a retrasar la declaración de impuestos de los residentes de Los Ángeles. El costo de Medi-Cal, el programa estatal de seguro médico para residentes de bajos ingresos, se disparó 6 mil millones de dólares más de lo previsto. Las políticas arancelarias intermitentes del presidente Donald Trump sacudieron la bolsa de valores , de la que California depende en gran medida para obtener ingresos fiscales. Además, el estado presentó una serie de demandas contra la administración Trump por su amenaza de retener fondos federales para asistencia alimentaria, recuperación ante desastres y otras subvenciones.
 En mayo, Newsom ya no predijo un superávit modesto, sino un déficit de 12 mil millones de dólares.
Para tapar el hueco, Newsom inicialmente propuso recortes drásticos a Medi-Cal. Pero el presupuesto final que negoció con los legisladores estatales dependió en gran medida del endeudamiento interno, utilizando las reservas estatales y congelando la inscripción a Medi-Cal para inmigrantes indocumentados para evitar recortes profundos a otros servicios sociales.
 Si bien los líderes demócratas culparon en gran medida a la administración Trump del problema presupuestario de California, la volatilidad de los ingresos estatales no es nueva. California depende en gran medida de la tributación de los ingresos y las ganancias de capital de las personas con altos ingresos, cuya fortuna a menudo depende de la bolsa. En 2022, el estado registró un superávit de casi 100 000 millones de dólares, seguido de un déficit proyectado de 56 000 millones de dólares durante los próximos dos años.
 Perspectivas para 2026
 Se proyecta que el déficit alcance casi 18 mil millones de dólares el próximo año, principalmente porque se espera que el estado gaste tanto dinero que compensaría, si no eclipsaría, los fuertes ingresos fiscales impulsados por un auge de la IA, dijo la Oficina del Analista Legislativo no partidista en su perspectiva fiscal el mes pasado.
 Si la estimación se mantiene, será el cuarto año consecutivo durante el mandato de Newsom que California enfrenta un déficit a pesar del crecimiento de los ingresos.
 Peor aún, el déficit estructural podría alcanzar los 35.000 millones de dólares anuales para el año fiscal 2027-28, afirmó la LAO.
 California se enfrenta a un gasto adicional de 6 mil millones de dólares el próximo año, incluyendo al menos 1300 millones de dólares porque el estado ahora debe pagar más para cubrir los beneficios de Medi-Cal según el proyecto de ley presupuestaria de Trump. El estado también podría perder más fondos del gobierno federal para la vivienda y las personas sin hogar.
 ¿Cómo pueden los legisladores solucionarlo? Las opciones son limitadas, ya que el estado ya tomó medidas puntuales para equilibrar las cuentas. La LAO señala que resolver un problema presupuestario estructural persistente requiere encontrar fuentes de ingresos más sostenibles, realizar recortes drásticos, o ambas cosas.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 16:58:32.153249

(Photo courtesy of University of Iowa)The University of Iowa is working to upgrade equipment and expand its materials science learning capabilities for students and researchers across Iowa with the support of a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense.
The university announced it has received a nearly $1.5 million grant to study potential combinations of different materials to develop “light- or electronic-based quantum systems,” according to a news release.
Titled “Heterogeneous Nanoscale Materials Collaborative for Quantum Technologies at The University of Iowa,” the grant-funded initiative will bring together researchers in physics, chemistry and engineering and allow for the purchase of new equipment to better study materials at sub-microscopic levels and manipulate them for combination.

“We want to utilize the quantum mechanical properties of new materials,” said Ravitej Uppu, assistant professor in the UI physics and astronomy department and a principal investigator on the award, in the release. “If we can harness these new materials, functionalize them, then we could make sensors that can achieve better image quality and better sensing performance.”
The UI Materials Analysis, Testing and Fabrication Facility will act as the project’s base and will see its equipment and infrastructure updated through the grant, facility director Tori Forbes said in the release.
New equipment will have etching and pattern-creation capabilities, the release stated, and a new printing system will be able to layer materials “to optimize their optical and electronic properties.” Uppu said in the release the technology will help researchers potentially turn “conceptual structures into working devices” and fabricate “everything from light-routing devices to tiny transistors relevant for quantum technologies in a university research setting.”
“It’s been challenging to keep this aging equipment functional and enable faculty and students to conduct research in this area,” Forbes said in the release. “This award will ensure that students can receive training on state-of-the-art equipment and faculty can continue to innovate.”
Just under 30 academic teams received grants from the Department of Defense this fall through its Defense Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, or DEPSCoR. More than $19 million was awarded, with both the UI and Boise State University selected for funding up to $1.5 million over two years and the rest receiving up to $600,000 over three years.
According to the release, students and faculty from other Iowa colleges and universities will have access to the work and opportunities afforded by the Materials Analysis, Testing and Fabrication Facility and the grant. Uppu said in the release the team plans to run a summer school program for students from regional colleges interested in learning to use the new equipment.
“That way, we create a new bridge between the universities to start thinking about potential collaborative projects. And naturally, MATFab becomes the central hub for that, because it hosts all the required facilities,” he said in the release.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Environmentalists are cheering after a New Jersey appellate court upheld controversial new state environmental regulations and rejected a challenge from scrap recyclers and a labor union that alleged regulators had acted arbitrarily and exceeded their statutory authority.
The court’s Monday decision will keep in place, for now, the landmark New Jersey law that requires additional environmental reviews for projects in overburdened communities and allows the Department of Environmental Protection to block those projects if they would disproportionally worsen public health there.
“Today’s decision was a win for all New Jersey residents, but primarily for the environmental justice communities that have long championed this fight. When our environmental laws protect our most vulnerable communities, they protect us all,” said Casandia Bellevue, an attorney with Earthjustice, which represented supporters of the law.
Plastic pellets known as ‘nurdles’ are polluting beaches and waterways

Some business groups lamented the decision. Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said the environmental rules “have had, and will continue to have, a chilling effect on New Jersey’s business community.”

The 2020 Environmental Justice Law requires state environmental regulators to reject permit applications for facilities like gas power and waste treatment plants that produce significant contaminants in communities where at least 35% of residents are low-income (or 40% are non-white or have limited English proficiency) if they fail to pass a public-interest balancing test.

The law is meant to limit further contamination in parts of New Jersey that historically saw significant pollution during the state’s industrial era, though provisions allow some projects to continue based on public need or mitigation technology approved by regulators.
The public-interest balancing test does not consider whether a project’s economic activity could be used to overcome disproportionate health impacts. The New Jersey branch of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries and the Engineers Labor Employer Cooperative Local 825 argued that excluding economic gains from the test is impermissibly arbitrary because a better economy could boost education and employment levels, reducing public health stressors.
But the court agreed with state officials who said economic benefits are difficult to quantify while reviewing a project’s application, adding that they cannot enforce promises of economic growth.
Though other New Jersey environmental laws balanced economic growth against public or environmental health, the Environmental Justice Law did not, the three-judge panel found.
“It is clear from the Legislature’s intent in [the Environmental Justice Law] that it requires prioritizing the health, safety, and environmental needs of the individuals in [overburdened communities] and that neither DEP nor applicants for approvals are allowed to trade fewer pollution reductions for more jobs and tax ratables,” Judge Heidi Currier wrote for the panel.
New Jersey marks all or part of 341 municipalities covering more than 5.2 million residents as overburdened communities, according to data maintained by the Department of Environmental Protection.
Those include portions of cities — swathes of Newark and Atlantic City, for example — but they also include parts of wealthier suburbs like Voorhees, where significant percentages of residents in a given census block are low-income, are non-white, or speak limited English.
The court rejected the plaintiffs’ other challenges for similar reasons. Rules requiring reviews for expansions at existing facilities — including ones that do not alter a facility’s physical footprint — are not overbroad because those expansions could still strain public health, the court said.
Rules requiring additional environmental reviews in census blocks with zero residents bordering overburdened communities are likewise permissible because pollution generated there could flow to areas covered by the law.
Regulations requiring air pollution controls at some sites are also permissible, the judges ruled. Scrap recyclers and the union had charged that those provisions conflict with the Air Pollution Control Act and are impermissibly vague.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ claims that the department violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to provide meaningful analysis of the rules’ impact on jobs and the economy, arguing its impact reports were “devoid of meaningful analysis or information.”
The department had released all required economic impact statements alongside the rule proposal, the judges said, adding the law does not require the department to make a more fulsome analysis of how the rule might affect New Jersey’s economy.
“Neither the rule nor the APA require an agency to provide specific cost information or quantify the expected costs and revenues generated or lost. ‘All that is required is for the agency to describe the expected economic impact,’” Currier wrote, citing an earlier case.
Dennis Toft, who represented the engineers union, expressed disappointment in the ruling.
“We’re disappointed that the appellate division deferred completely to DEP when circumstances where it was admitted by the DEP that the legislation had gaps in it that DEP, on its own, decided to fill those gaps without pointing them out and going back and having the robust legislative debate that would’ve been called for,” he said.
He said it is too early to say whether his clients would petition the New Jersey Supreme Court for an appeal. An attorney for the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries did not immediately return a request for comment.

Anna Paulina Luna with Gov. Ron DeSantis in Clearwater on Jan 6, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)CLEARWATER — Pinellas County Republican U.S. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna’s push for a congressional stock trading ban received an endorsement Tuesday from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Saying members from both major parties have unfairly boosted their personal financial fortunes based on information they learn while serving in Congress, the governor added that every member of the state’s 28-member congressional delegation should support the legislation when it comes to a vote in the House later this year.
And he said he will advocate for a state law to require all candidates running for federal office in Florida to check a form about whether they intend to trade individual stocks while serving.
“It’s really odd,” he said while speaking at a press conference held at the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station in Clearwater.
“You’ll have people get elected to Congress having never shown any investment acumen ever in their life, and then all of a sudden they become Warren Buffet on steroids. They’re putting some of the biggest hedge funds in America to shame with these stock trades that have these really suspicious timings. Because, look, if you buy a stock and it goes up 400% in like a month? That’s like a once in a lifetime investment, and yet these guys seem to be doing this quite frequently. And they have access to certain information I believe that is helping to fuel that.”
Public opinion polls have shown for several years that banning stock-trading in individual companies by members of Congress is popular.
Portfolios increase
Republicans from across the country have made former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi the symbol of how members of Congress have become exponentially wealthier during their time in Washington. Over the past three years, Pelosi reported a trade volume of more than $50 million, according to Capital Trades, a website that monitors the stock activity of members of Congress.
However, according to the government watchdog group Common Cause, that only put the California Democrat eighth among the members of the 119th Congress in terms of trade volume (Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal was first).
Both DeSantis and Luna referred to Pelosi Tuesday but acknowledged that members from both political parties are at fault.
“On average, members that do engage in stock trading on both sides are getting 600% returns now outperforming the S&P,” Luna said. “So, how could you ever expect members of Congress to truly work for the American people if this is indeed what they’re doing? And it’s wrong and it needs to stop and so I’m very happy that Gov. DeSantis has been able to lead on this effort.”
“If you look at Nancy Pelosi’s portfolio, she has absolutely shattered a lot of these investment records,” DeSantis said. “But it’s not just that. There’s a whole bunch and it’s on both sides of the aisle.”
Members of Congress are allowed to buy and sell individual stocks, as long as they don’t violate insider trading rules, under the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012 (STOCK Act).
The public perception that members of Congress are disproportionately benefitting from their positions has been growing in recent years. Members of Congress who later ascend to leadership positions outperformed rank-and-file members by 47 percentage points, according to a November 2025 paper produced by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
State legislation to address the issue
DeSantis said he believes so strongly about the issue that he is supporting state legislation to require candidates in Florida who qualify for federal races to fill out a form declaring whether they intend to trade individual stocks while serving. If those candidates run for re-election, he added, they will need to fill out a form asking them whetehr they traded any stocks while serving.
“If they say ‘yes,’ then that means they broke their word to do and, honestly, lied on those forms. That’s what we’re going to do,” he said.
DeSantis served in Congress for six years (2012-2018) and said that he stopped buying and selling stocks when he went to Washington because he didn’t want to be questioned about his integrity.
“My reason was, why would I want to be in a situation where, like, I take some action and then someday someone will say, ‘Well, that’s because you own Microsoft or you own this or that,’” he said.
DeSantis is national co-chair of a bipartisan campaign with the group U.S. Term Limits to enact congressional term limits via a constitutional amendment. And he travelled to Idaho earlier this year to promote a constitutional amendment requiring the federal government to balance its budget.
Rep. Luna has been battling with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to force a vote on the issue. Last month, she introduced a discharge petition to move the proposal directly to the House floor, similar to the tactic used by a bipartisan group of lawmakers to force a vote on the Jeffrey Epstein files. The Pinellas Republican said Tuesday that she has received word that the bill will get a vote.
“I’m happy to report, governor, that we actually have met with the Speaker of the House and that we are going to be putting something on the floor coming up this quarter that will permanently stop insider trading ,which it is happening in Washington D.C., but it’s permanently going to stop it in D.C., so happy to report back on that,” she said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-1-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 16:58:32.153249

The project was one of five offshore wind farms that were under development until the Department of Interior ordered work halted last month due to national security concerns. It’s the second time that the Trump administration had shut down work on Revolution Wind, a 704-megawatt project that is due to begin producing power for the New England electric grid by the end of this year.
On Friday, Revolution Wind’s developers — a collaboration between Skyborn Renewables and the Danish energy company Ørsted — filed a request for a immediate injunction against the stop-work order within an ongoing lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.
A hearing on the developers’ request has been scheduled for Monday, Jan. 12, in front of U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth.
Both Tong and his counterpart in Rhode Island, Attorney General Peter Neronha, followed up with their own request on Monday which reiterated the developers’ claim that federal intervention risks raising costs for electric customers while upending thousands of local jobs.
That includes hundreds of workers at the State Pier in New London, which serves as the on-shore staging area for Revolution Wind and a sister project, Sunrise Wind.
“Donald Trump is escalating his lawless and erratic attack on Connecticut ratepayers and workers,” Tong said in a statement Tuesday. “Every day this project is stalled costs us hundreds of thousands of dollars in inflated energy bills when families are in dire need of relief. Revolution Wind was vetted and approved, and the Trump Administration has yet to disclose a shred of evidence to counter that thorough and careful process.”
In addition to their request for an injunction, both states on Monday sought to consolidate their lawsuit with the case brought by Revolution Wind’s developers. (The states’ lawsuit, originally filed in federal court in Rhode Island, has already been transferred to Washington, D.C.)
In a statement responding the injunction request on Tuesday, U.S. Department of the Interior Spokesperson Matt Middleton defended the agency’s actions by citing the costs of offshore wind projects as well as national security concerns.
“Under President Trump, this administration is putting America First by safeguarding reliable, affordable energy and defending the safety of the American people,” Middleton said. “We will not sacrifice national security or economic stability for projects that make no sense for America’s future.”
“We will not sacrifice national security or economic stability for projects that make no sense for America’s future.”Matt Middleton, U.S. Department of the Interior
In its Dec. 22 announcement of the pause on offshore wind projects, the Department of Interior cited the potential for spinning turbines to create a kind of radar interference known as “clutter” that can hamper the military’s ability to identify and track targets nearby.
The Interior Department initially said that reports detailing the potential for clutter were not classified. However, agency staff did not respond to a subsequent request by the Connecticut Mirror to provide those reports.
In a legal filing on Monday, attorneys for Interior’s Bureau of of Ocean Energy Management said they were prepared to share relevant classified information with the court in a closed-door meeting.
Critics of the Trump administration’s actions have said that national security concerns, including potential radar impacts, were extensively vetted during Revolution Wind’s multi-year vetting process.
Lamberth, the judge who is considering both injunction requests, previously sided with the project’s developers by lifting the Trump administration’s earlier stop-work order in September. At the time, Lamberth said the government had failed to provide proper justification for its decision to rescind its prior approvals for Revolution Wind.
At the time of the initial stop-work order, construction of Revolution Wind was already 80% completed. During the few months work was allowed to resume, construction progressed to around 87% completion, according to the developers’ legal filings.
The latest pause is costing Revolution Wind roughly $1.4 million a day, according to those filings, and the developers are nearing the end of their contracts with the specially-built vessels needed to mount the massive turbines onto their foundations. 
If they are forced to cancel the project due to delays, Revolution Wind’s developers say they will be saddled with an additional $1 billion in costs on top of their current $5 billion investment.
If it is completed, Revolution Wind will be supported by power purchase agreements with electric utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Its sister project, Sunrise Wind, is slated to sell its power to customers in New York.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Revolution-installed-turbine-file-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 16:58:32.153249

The measure passed out of the committee with no audible opposition. If passed into law, the proposal would pump at least $1 billion into the Public Employee Retirement System over the next decade. 
Sen. Daniel Sparks, a Republican from Belmont who authored the legislation, said giving the Public Employees’ Retirement System a large cash infusion is a necessary next step after the Legislature last year overhauled it, moving forward.
“The employees of the state of Mississippi have done their part,” Sparks said. “Now we’ve got to fund it.”
The cash injection comes after the Legislature voted last year to create a new system with fewer benefits for new hires that will be a hybrid of a defined contribution plan, similar to the 401(k) system many private employers offer, and a defined benefit plan, which the state has had for decades. 
Opponents of the new hybrid plan say its more austere benefits will make it hard for the state to hire and retain workers, particularly first responders and teachers. First responders, through their associations of chiefs of police and firefighters, are calling on lawmakers to create a separate retirement plan for them.
Both Sparks and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann have defended the hybrid plan as a necessary change to prevent the pension system from disastrous shortfalls in the future, while still giving state employees a retirement package. The system has unfunded liabilities of about $26 billion.
House leaders have proposed a recurring revenue stream for PERS, either from the state lottery or by legalizing mobile sports betting.
Sparks on Tuesday did not appear receptive to those proposals, and said such earmarked streams would not stabilize the system like the large cash infusion the committee passed. The Senate measure now heads to the full chamber.
PERS covers about 350,000 current public employees or retirees — about 10% of the state’s population. Changes to the system can have a substantial economic impact on the state in the future.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/06034415/3X0A4453-copy-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-06 16:58:32.153249

Kim Reynolds initiated a state task force to evaluate the potential for nuclear energy expansion in Iowa.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Efforts to expand nuclear energy in Iowa have kicked off in 2026 with the formation of a state nuclear energy task force and the Linn County approval of a rezoning request for Iowa’s sole nuclear plant’s planned restart.
The Iowa Nuclear Energy Task Force, initiated by Gov. Kim Reynolds, will generate a report and advise state leadership on opportunities to embrace nuclear energy in the state of Iowa. 
Reynolds said in a news release the task force marks a “strategic step forward” to ensuring Iowa has a “safe, efficient, and responsible integration” of nuclear energy. 
“Nuclear energy is a vital part of Iowa’s energy future, and I am committed to advancing reliable, sustainable energy solutions that strengthen our energy independence and fuel economic growth,” Reynolds said. “With our strong foundation in manufacturing and energy innovation, we are uniquely positioned to lead the nation in developing and deploying nuclear technologies.” 
Presently, Iowa has no operational nuclear energy plants, but NextEra Energy is working to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Linn County. The company’s request to rezone close to 400 acres at the site was approved by Linn County Supervisors Monday, though there are still several regulatory hurdles NextEra must cross to be operational at the start of 2029 as it plans.
The plant, if restarted, would generate 615 megawatts of energy and have more than 400 onsite, full-time jobs. Google signed an agreement with NextEra in October to purchase power from Duane Arnold nuclear site to power Google cloud and artificial intelligence operations.

Lane Witten, a vice president at NextEra, was chosen as one of 14 members to serve on the Iowa Nuclear Energy Task Force. 
The task force is chaired by Mark Nutt, a graduate of Iowa State University’s Nuclear Engineering program and the director of Nuclear Energy Programs at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Other members represent utilities, local government, industry and the Iowa Utilities Commission. 
State legislators Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny; Sen. Izaah Knox, D-Des Moines; Rep. David Young, R-Van Meter; Rep. Hans Wilz, R-Ottumwa, and Rep. Sean Bagniewski, D-Des Moines, also serve on the task force. 
According to the news release, the task force is asked to assess emerging nuclear technologies for Iowa’s energy sector, engage with industry leaders to help develop the necessary workforce for the industry, as well as engage with manufacturers and other stakeholders to identify potential barriers to entry in the nuclear field. 
The task force is also asked to explore engagement opportunities with federal nuclear energy programs to “ensure Iowa’s policies and initiatives align with national regulations” and to evaluate opportunities for economic growth within the nuclear energy sector. 
While energy consumption remained fairly stable across the U.S. from 2000-2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a recent report from the consulting firm ICF projected overall energy demand will increase by 25% by 2030. The report attributes the growth in part to data centers that power cloud and artificial intelligence models, as well as increased electrification in transportation and building sectors. 
Reynolds has identified nuclear energy as one of her priorities to build an “affordable, reliable and sustainable energy system” for the state. The governor’s energy bill from the 2025 legislative session also called for the General Assembly to “encourage the development” of nuclear electric power generation, but the bill did not make it to the floor for debate in either chamber. 
Nuclear energy expansion and acceleration has also been a priority outlined by President Donald Trump. NextEra’s website for the Duane Arnold restart claims the project contributes “toward the Administration’s goal of adding 5,000 megawatts of nuclear energy by 2030.” 
According to the news release, the task force has 180 days to submit a final report on its findings and recommendations to the governor, per the executive order. 
Additional task force members include:
May Farlinger, president of Alliant Energy’s Iowa company, Interstate Power & Light Company; Mike Fehr, senior vice president of renewable generation and compliance at MidAmerican Energy; Brandy Meisheid, chair of the Linn County Board of Supervisors; Jim McCalley, distinguished professor at Iowa State University; Sarah Martz, chair of the Iowa Utilities Commission; Matt Resor, business manager for IBEW Local 405, and Andy Roberts with Central Iowa Building & Construction Trades Council.

John Larson as ally in fight against Trump,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/william-tong-endorses-john-larson-as-ally-in-fight-against-trump/,U.S. Rep. John B. Larson accepted the endorsement of A.G. William Tong on the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.,"U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District, accepted the endorsement of Attorney General William Tong on the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, each ignoring the congressman’s three Democratic rivals to focus on their party’s great unifier: President Donald Trump.
The chosen venue for the Tuesday morning press conference was the community center named for his late mother, Lois Nolan Larson, at Mayberry Village, the one-time federal housing project in East Hartford that has been a blue-collar touchstone for Larson through his nearly 50 years in public life, the last 27 as a congressman.
Tong, the first of the state’s six statewide constitutional officers to take sides in the rare intra-party challenge to a Connecticut congressional incumbent, said he and Larson share modest beginnings that shape their politics and fuel their opposition to a president the attorney general has sued 45 times this year.
“I don’t have to guess what John Larson is about. I don’t have to guess what this campaign is about. It’s about the people that live here,” said Tong, the son of Chinese immigrants. “It’s about the people that fight for every inch, every single day.”
Larson, 77, who has not had a Democratic primary since winning the open seat in 1998, is facing a challenge from former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin, state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford, and Hartford school board member Ruth Fortune.
Tong’s repeated references to Mayberry Village and  Larson’s upbringing in a public housing seemed calculated to draw a contrast with Bronin, who grew up in Rye, N.Y., and Greenwich, and is by far the best funded of the three challengers. 
Larson is “fighting for people that come to Mayberry Village, that come to the community center here. He’s fighting for immigrants like my parents, who walk around with a target on their backs every single day,” Tong said. “That’s why I’m supporting John Larson. The other reason why I’m supporting John Larson is because in our official roles, we are on the front lines of this fight against a president and the federal government that every day seeks to do us harm.”
Tong’s endorsement was expected. He had joined Larson in September in opposing the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants and speaking out against the Department of Homeland Security targeting the congressman over his harsh criticism of the tactics employed by DHE’s  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
Larson had compared masked ICE agents to the SS and Gestapo of Nazi Germany.
On Tuesday, Larson accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of lying to Congress when he assured members that the Trump administration was not working for regime change in Venezuela, not long before U.S. commandos seized its president, Nicolas Maduro, snubbing congressional leaders who should have been consulted.
“How about respect for the law, the Constitution and the War Powers Act?” Larson said. 
He offered sarcastic praise for the president on one count.
“At least he was honest about this: It’s about the oil. It’s about the oil and taking over those refineries,” Larson said. “And by the way, who’s going to defend those refineries and the American corporations that go there? And who’s going to defend that pipeline? United States military. This president and his administration need to come before Congress.”
Larson said Democrats need more than criticism of Trump and pivoted to a favorite topic: the preservation of Social Security. He faulted Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden quit the race, for failing to talk about issues other than Trump’s fitness.
“I begged the Harris administration to talk about Social Security, to put it out there, and we didn’t. We talked about Donald Trump, and as bad as he is, if you don’t have a plan, you’re not going to be successful. And we will have a plan, and you’ll hear about it in more detail.”
Larson said he is working with two other members of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal of Massachusetts and Mike Thompson of California, on legislation addressing student debt and the difficulty in renters becoming homeowners.
“We’re going to be back to the new New Deal,” Larson said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9382-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 16:58:32.153249

This is down from an overall rate of 29.77 the year prior, and 32.56 in 2021 — the year that the agency switched to publishing what is known as “incident based reporting” data. Due to the difference in definitions and categories, comparing rates with prior years is often not “apples to apples,” the report notes.

Almost 60% of the crimes reported in 2024 were crimes against property, like theft, and less than half of that, 12,586, were crimes committed against people. Slightly more than 4,700 reported crimes were considered crimes against society, such as drug violations, gambling and prostitution.
Violent crimes such as murders, rapes, aggravated assaults and robberies have generally been low in Maine, but followed the overall trend, declining steadily from 1,432 in 2021 to 1,374 in the latest report.

Dec. 7, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska will pay outgoing University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Rodney Bennett a one-time sum of $1.1 million as part of his Jan. 12 resignation agreement.
The compensation is part of Bennett’s negotiated resignation, which Bennett and NU President Jeffrey Gold agreed to Jan. 2 and announced Monday. 
The Nebraska Examiner obtained the agreement via a public records request Tuesday. Bennett joined UNL as chancellor on July 1, 2023, for a three-year term until June 30, 2026. Bennett will leave about six months early, ranking his tenure among the shortest of UNL chancellors.
“Chancellor Bennett acknowledges and agrees that he is resigning his employment with the university voluntarily, without duress, based upon his own belief that it is in his own best interest to do so,” the agreement states.

20260102 Bennett Resignation Agreement Release_Redacted 
Bennett signed the resignation at 4:24 p.m. Jan. 2. Gold signed it an hour later. Bennett could revoke the agreement in writing within seven days of signing. Bennett was given 21 days to consider the agreement, the document states. 
He voluntarily signed sooner.
Multiple members of the UNL chapter of the American Association of University Professors condemned the resignation agreement in light of recent budget cuts at UNL that Bennett steered.
Gold did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday regarding the resignation agreement. Asked if Bennett could sit down for an interview in the next week, a UNL spokesperson said Bennett “is not currently available for interviews.” 
Resignation specifics
In October, Bennett told the Examiner he desired a contract extension but did not know if or when that might occur. Gold said then he supported an extension but said it was a decision left to the NU Board of Regents. In December, Bennett said the Examiner had to “talk to the boss” about his contract.
As part of the resignation agreement, the regents will pay Bennett nearly $1.14 million “as soon as possible,” but no later than late February. The sum includes $36,000 for dental and group health insurance for the remaining months of his insurance eligibility period.
The NU Board of Regents hired Bennett at a salary of $720,000 in 2023. His salary increased to $732,000 the following two years, or $61,000 per month, according to NU salary records.

Bennett will not receive at least $250,000 in “deferred compensation” from his contract,  an amount tied to his salary. His wages end Jan. 12, an NU spokesperson confirmed, and he will not be paid for the remaining five and a half months.
Gold said a search for a permanent UNL chancellor would likely begin in mid to late spring.
Kathy Ankerson, former UNL chief academic officer and former dean of UNL’s College of Architecture, will take over for Bennett in the interim. Her salary was not immediately available. 
If Bennett had resigned to seek or accept an administrative post at another academic institution or higher education campus before June 30, 2025, he would have been required to pay NU $1 million.
On Monday, Gold told the Examiner that Bennett’s choice to resign was a “very personal decision” and a “fairly abrupt decision” made with his family.
The agreement barred Bennett and NU leaders from releasing it unless requested under public records laws. Bennett is barred from disparaging UNL in the future, as are regents and other top NU leaders. Gold’s office will prepare Bennett a reference letter for future employment, too.
Bennett is barred from being employed at any NU campus for three years under the resignation’s terms, and Bennett agreed to cooperate in transitioning his duties over the next three months.
Resignation follows budget cuts
Bennett’s departure and payout come after UNL finalized $27.5 million in cuts last fall, including the elimination of four academic programs with regents’ approval in December. After that meeting, Bennett told the Examiner the campus had “a lot of work to do” with implementation.
“We’re going to do that with a lot of care and concern for everybody who’s impacted,” he said.
Bennett’s plan included cuts meant to close a $21 million structural deficit and $6.5 million in “proactive” steps to mitigate the need for future cuts.

UNL’s AAUP chapter said the payout demonstrates the cuts were a choice, including for the more than 50 faculty and 500 students in the departments approved to be eliminated.
Another 69 UNL long-time, tenured faculty had until Monday to decide whether to take an NU-wide early retirement offer. It’s not yet clear how many accepted the one-time lump sum.
Bennett, in November, became the first UNL chancellor to receive a vote of “no confidence” from UNL faculty. The vote passed 60-14, citing, among other concerns, his handling of the budget.
“The university cannot credibly claim that it lacks the resources to sustain academic programs and faculty positions while simultaneously paying over a million dollars to a failed chancellor,” said Sarah Zuckerman, president of the UNL AAUP. “This payout exposes the administration’s financial crisis narrative as a matter of priorities, not necessity.”
Administrator pay
Crystal Garcia, an AAUP Executive Committee member, said the public deserves to know why educators are being fired while “executive failures are rewarded.” Garcia and Zuckerman are in the Department of Educational Administration, which the regents voted to eliminate 8-0.
“Nebraska’s legislators and taxpayers should be asking hard questions about governance, oversight and whose interests are truly being served,” Garcia said.

Alexander Vazansky, another UNL AAUP Executive Committee member and professor in the UNL Department of History, said Bennett’s situation is “not just a failure of one chancellor” but also of a “systemic failure of leadership at the highest levels,” including Gold and the regents.
The AAUP called for an immediate halt to faculty and staff terminations, reconsideration of the elimination of academic programs and full transparency into university finances, including executive compensation and information used to make budget decisions.
Regent Kathy Wilmot of Beaver City thanked and defended Bennett’s work handling the budget after the “no confidence” vote and after the December regents meeting.
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, said Tuesday he was “very disappointed” Bennett is resigning. Murman noted he’s frequently talked about being careful with administrator pay, at all levels of education, but deferred to NU on its decision for any buyout.
Said Murman of Bennett: “I think he’s done a good job as chancellor under very challenging circumstances.”

Greene, a conservative Republican who was once one of President Donald Trump’s most stalwart allies, announced plans to resign in November after publicly feuding with the president over issues including health care costs, Israel’s actions in Gaza and the release of the Epstein files.
The two also reportedly clashed behind the scenes over whether Greene should run for either U.S. Senate or Georgia governor, which Trump said he disapproved of her doing.
Monday was Greene’s final day representing Georgia’s District 14 in Congress after four years in office.
Early voting is set to begin on Monday, Feb. 16 in the district, which includes Catoosa, Chattooga, Dade, Floyd, Murray, Paulding, Polk, Walker and Whitfield counties and portions of Cobb County.
The winner will serve the remainder of Greene’s term and be up for re-election all over again in November.
If no candidate exceeds 50% of the vote, a runoff between the top two will be held on April 7.
That’s a pretty likely outcome – as of Tuesday afternoon, 22 candidates have already filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run. Candidates from both parties will all appear on the March 10 ballot together.
The official qualifying period will run from Jan. 12 to 14, so the total number of candidates could grow even higher.
The northwest Georgia district is the most heavily Republican district in the state, and Greene was known as a staunch conservative, appearing alongside Trump at rallies, echoing his false claims of election interference and boosting him on social media before their falling out.
The district’s strong Republican base makes it a plum spot for a conservative lawmaker who would like to avoid challenges from the left.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)Kentucky lawmakers are expected to propose more than 1,000 bills this year, and several wasted no time by filing legislation on the first day of the 60-day session. 
On Tuesday, Republicans filed bills to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in Kentucky public schools and have the state honor the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, while Democrats, who hold a small minority in the statehouse, filed a bill to raise the state’s minimum wage. 
High priority bills are still to come, including the legislation for the next two-year state budget. 
On the Republican side, Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, of Smithfield, filed a bill to prevent Kentucky public schools from having any kind of DEI program, or risk legal action from the Kentucky attorney general’s office. Among its several provisions, Senate Bill 26 prohibits schools using resources to keep DEI offices, having DEI training or employees whose role is related to advancing DEI. 
Tichenor previously presented the proposal in committee during the interim, arguing that it would “eliminate the wasteful, ineffective and divisive DEI initiatives” in K-12 schools. 
Sen. Steve Rawlings, R-Burlington, filed Senate Bill 31 to designate Oct. 14 of each year as “Charlie Kirk Day” in honor of the right-wing activist who was assassinated at Utah Valley University in September. Kirk’s birthday is Oct. 14. 
Kirk was the founder of Turning Point USA, which aimed to mobilize conservative youth and young adults on high school and college campuses. He often visited campuses around the country to discuss contemporary hard-right topics, including anti-LGBTQ positions and encouraging young women to retreat from careers and return to the home. Kirk also hosted a daily radio show and podcast. 
Rawlings’ bill says Kentuckians would be encouraged to use the day to “reflect on the principles he championed, participate in educational events promoting civic engagement, and honor his legacy as a martyr for truth and liberty.”

Meanwhile, Democratic Whip Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, of Louisville filed a resolution to honor Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, who was killed along with her husband, Mark, in June, as well as a resolution to condemn all acts of political violence. 
Lexington Sen. Reggie Thomas, the Democrats’ caucus chair, said in a Tuesday morning press conference he would file a bill, Senate Bill 16, on the first day of the legislative session to increase Kentucky’s minimum wage from the federal rate of $7.25 an hour to $10 an hour. The legislation would also include the state eventually moving toward a $15 an hour minimum wage in 2030. 
Thomas said 30 states, including five states neighboring Kentucky, have a higher minimum wage than the federal rate. 
“We don’t have to be tied to the federal minimum wage,” Thomas said. “Thirty other states have acknowledged that. Why should we be different? There’s no reason why Kentucky should be at the bottom in terms of saying what our workers should be paying.” 
Senate Democratic Floor Leader Gerald Neal, of Louisville, added that Thomas’ bill would be a “primary position of the caucus” and Senate Democrats would try to sway their Republican counterparts on supporting the measure. Senate Democrats are beginning this session with six members to the Republicans’ 32. 
Temporary chambers

Tuesday was the first time the Senate and House had convened in temporary quarters near the Capitol Annex while the Capitol undergoes a multi-year renovation.
Rules in both chambers were updated to reflect that neither the House or Senate will have in-person galleries for members of the public to watch legislative proceedings. 
In the Senate, Republican Floor Leader Max Wise, of Campbellsville, gave a summary of the Senate rules changes, including removing references to the gallery in the chamber, as the temporary chamber has no seats for members of the public to view proceedings in-person, and limiting guests who may come to the Senate floor to lawmakers, their immediate family members, staff and reporters. The Senate approved its rules in a voice vote without any senators objecting to the changes.
However, two House Democrats expressed concern about shortening the daily business order of motions, petitions and communications for lawmakers from 30 minutes to 15, but the rules were still adopted. Republican House Floor Leader Rep. Steven Rudy, of Paducah, said the limitation was because lawmakers could not have floor guests to introduce this year. Much of the House changes were similar to the Senate rules.
More to come
In other matters, the House must review impeachment petitions it received earlier this year, including a petition filed by Louisville attorney and GOP official Jack Richardson against Supreme Court Justice Pamela Goodwine. 
Osborne told reporters lawmakers are still talking about forming a committee to handle citizen petitions the House received.
On the petition to impeach Goodwine, Stivers said he’s told Senate Republicans to “say nothing about it” while it’s still in the House’s purview. 
“We should wait for the House to come up with some type of dispositive action, because we will be the jury, the trier of facts, so we should not in any way weigh in to express an opinion one way or another,” Stivers continued. “That would be, from my perspective, totally inappropriate and improper.” 
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has made a push for the state funding universal pre-K ahead of session, but it must clear the GOP-controlled legislature. 
Stivers told reporters that it is a “flawed concept.” Republicans do agree that access to child care is an issue that should be addressed, but not through universal pre-K.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5529-1024x709.jpg,,,2026-01-06 16:12:37.247768

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)CLEARWATER — Gov. Ron DeSantis admits he wasn’t familiar with the federal legislation vetoed by Donald Trump last week that would have given the Miccosukee Tribe more control over a portion of the Everglades.
But he says he agrees with the president’s assertion that the tribe has worked against the president’s immigration efforts.
In his statement last week announcing his veto of H.R. 504, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, sponsored by South Florida Republican U.S. Rep. Carlos Giménez, Trump declared the Miccosukee Tribe “has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”
That was a reference to the fact that the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida is part of a lawsuit against the state which claims planners behind an immigration detention center in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” failed to follow federal environmental regulations in constructing the 3,000-bed facility.
The legislation (previously supported by a bipartisan group of Florida lawmakers, including U.S. GOP Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody) would have added a small village called the Osceola Camp to a section of the Florida Everglades that the Miccosukee Native American Tribe controls. It would also require the Department of the Interior to protect structures in the village from flooding.
“What he pointed out — [the tribe] is trying to obstruct the immigration — that is true,” DeSantis said during a press conference in Clearwater Tuesday. “I mean, they tried to obstruct and it was demagogic, they were not being honest about what was going on.”
The governor went on to call the Miccosukee Tribe “wrong” and said it was “disappointing to see them do that,” apparently referring to the organization’s involvement in the lawsuit.
The Miccosukee Tribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment about DeSantis’ remarks, but a spokesperson told the Phoenix Monday that they have “long supported President Trump’s commitment to Everglades restoration for the benefit of America’s public lands.”
“The Tribe has a constitutional duty to protect and defend the Everglades ecosystem, our traditional homelands. We never sought to obstruct the President’s immigration agenda. Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments,” Chairman Talbert Cypress said in a written statement.
He added that the tribe was “disappointed to learn that the White House vetoed a measure intended to mitigate restoration impacts on a Tribal village.”
Politico reported Monday that the U.S. House of Representatives will vote Thursday whether to override two vetoes, one being of HR 504. That outlet reported that “senior House Republicans and Democrats generally expect the chamber will approve the overrides in a rare rebuke of Trump.”
Prosecuting Maduro in Florida?
DeSantis also said on Tuesday that Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier’s office is “looking very seriously” at bringing a state criminal case against Nicolás Maduro, removed Saturday as president of Venezuela by U.S. troops on four criminal counts that include narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices. He pleaded not guilty to those charges in federal court in New York on Monday.
Because Maduro “was obviously very involved with bringing drugs, particularly to Florida,” DeSantis said, the state could charge  him with bringing criminals and gang members here.
The former Venezuelan president “would empty his prisons and send them to America across the border, and we’d end up with some of these people in Florida, Tren de Aragua gang members that were in prison there and he did that, and so to me that is a very hostile act,” he said.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls announced Tuesday that she was diagnosed with breast cancer late last year.
“I had surgery over the holidays and will continue a course of treatment to address this disease,” said Earls in a video released on social media.
Earls told supporters that the diagnosis will not impact her ability to continue to serve on the court or campaign.
“We are not slowing down. We are not losing focus. This is just a bump in the road on the way to a win this November,” said Earls. “And we all know courageous women who have experienced breast cancer and treated it successfully, including some of our most brilliant political leaders here in North Carolina.”
Earls said she is fortunate that the disease was discovered early during a routine mammogram, and it’s because of that early detection that her prognosis is positive.

“I know it can be easy to put off doctor’s appointments, but I encourage every woman to get regularly screened for breast cancer,” said Earls.
State representative Sarah Stevens (R-Surry) is running this year against Earls for a seat on the state’s highest court. In January 2024, Stevens announced that she too had undergone treatment for breast cancer. Stevens told the Associated Press breast cancer runs among women in her family, and she expected to make a full recovery.
Breast cancer survivors serving in the state House and Senate urged legislators last year to pass legislation that would provide health coverage parity for breast cancer diagnostic imaging.
“You shouldn’t be in a situation where women are denied access [to care] because they can’t afford the actual screenings,” said Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) during a press conference last April.
The Senate did not advance Batch’s bill after its introduction. In the N.C. House, Rep. Howard Penny Jr. (R-Harnett) encouraged lawmakers to support a companion bill for better breast imaging, noting he had also been treated for breast cancer. House Bill 297 passed the House with Penny’s help, only to stall in the Senate.

(Stock photo by Getty Images)A Florida bill banning drivers from holding their phones on the road was re-filed Tuesday, one week before the start of the 2026 legislative session.
Republican Sen. Erin Grall’s bill, revived from last session, would expand the Sunshine State’s ban on texting while driving to cover holding or “supporting” a handheld device while on the road.
This means drivers would not be able to make calls from their phone, hold it, or even rest it on their laps if the bill becomes law. If passed, it would take effect on Oct. 1.
“‘Handheld manner’ means holding a wireless communications device in one or both hands or physically supporting the device with any other part of the body,” SB 1152 reads. These devices could range from phones to laptops to gaming devices.
The bill would not apply to first responders or include small radios or in-vehicle systems.
Drivers who violate the law while moving through either a school zone or past construction workers would be slapped with a $150 fine and 3 points off their licenses. A subsequent offense would include a $250 fine and 3 more points against the license, and a third offense would include a $500 fine, 4 points against the license, and a 90-day license suspension.
Where did the bill come from?
Tallahassee resident Demetrius Branca has been a leading advocate for a hands-free driving law, which would mirror those of 30 other states plus Washington, D.C. In 2014, Branca’s 19-year-old son Anthony while on his way to Tallahassee State College was killed by a distracted Comcast driver.
During the 2024 session, when the measure passed the House but was never scheduled in the Senate, Branca blasted then-chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, Nick DiCeglie, during a Pinellas County legislative delegation meeting. The two engaged in a sharp exchange, but DiCeglie changed course when the bill reemerged during the 2025 legislative session, the Phoenix previously reported.
“I looked at the statistics,” DiCeglie said at the time. “I looked at the data, and I looked at what 31 other states did. And I thought of you and I thought of your son, Anthony.”
Although it passed the Senate that time around, the legislation was never scheduled in the House — a reversal from the year before. Branca blamed Rep. Linda Chaney, who chaired one of the committees that was supposed to see the bill.
“You stopped it cold,” Branca told her at a Pinellas County legislative meeting. “After all the work, all the testimony, all the grieving parents who begged you to act. You chose to not let it through. That was not leadership, that was political cowardice and I’m standing here to look you in the eye and tell you to your face.”
In 2023, distracted driving resulted in the deaths of 3,275 people, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which reported that “texting is the most alarming distraction.”
This year, Grall’s bill has yet to have a House companion.

(Photo by Will Jacott/Minnesota Reformer) Three senior leaders in the finance department of Minneapolis Public Schools have been placed on administrative leave, according to two people with knowledge of the personnel decisions, just as the district begins its annual budget process. 
Administration of the state’s fourth largest school district placed the three leaders on leave Friday, according to the two people familiar with the moves. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were  not authorized to speak publicly.
The officials placed on leave are Ibrahima Diop, senior finance officer; Tarior Chapinduka, executive director of finance; and Aaron Gilbert, controller. 
When reached by phone, Gilbert would not confirm her employment with the district and would not provide further comment. Diop and Chapinduka did not respond to voice messages left seeking comment.
Donnie Belcher, executive director of communications, said the district could not comment on the personnel changes due to personnel privacy laws.
The school board is set to vote Tuesday night to designate certain financial authorizations to Senior Executive Officer Ryan Strack. These designations were previously held by Diop.
The removal of finance department leadership comes at a crucial time for the district. The district expects a $30 million gap between its revenue and expenses next school year, or roughly 4% of the annual budget. . This deficit comes despite the district cutting more than $70 million in expenses during its last budget cycle, and voters approving a $20 million increase to the district’s operating capital levy in 2024.
The district failed to complete its annual financial audit by the state deadline of December 31. The district’s auditor, Bergen KDV, told the board on December 9, 2025, that the delay was because the district’s finance department had failed to provide the necessary on time. The auditors expect to finish by the end of January.
The district as an ongoing structural budget deficit as costs — primarily wages and benefits — continue to grow faster than revenue. The structural deficit is exacerbated by the district’s physical footprint, designed to serve over 40,000 students while only 28,000 students are currently enrolled. 
The district’s auditors have warned for years that the district lacks sufficient finance department staff to appropriately segregate its accounts payable and accounts receivable functions.
Superintendent Lisa Sayles-Adams made significant changes to the district’s leadership after she started in February 2023. Diop was one of the few district leaders hired by former Superintendent Ed Graff that she left in place.
Staff were told in December that Diop would end his tenure with the district at the end of January. Diop joined the district as its senior finance officer in 2015, under the leadership of former superintendentGraff. At the time, the district was in financial turmoil, with the board spending down district reserves rather than making budget cuts to erase a $27 million budget deficit. 
During Diop’s tenure with the district, district enrollment dropped over 20%. The majority of district revenue is tied to enrollment, while state law limits the district’s property tax levies. This forces school districts to cut expenses to balance their budgets.
Chapinduka was first hired by the district by Diop; both had previously worked together for Omaha Public Schools in Nebraska. Chapinduka left the district to work at Hopkins Public Schools in 2019 before returning to Minneapolis in 2025.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MinneapolisSchool_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 15:57:36.201107

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana legislators are talking about possibly banning one form of internet gambling while also giving the Hoosier Lottery permission to sell tickets online.
The House Public Policy Committee endorsed a bill on Tuesday allowing online lottery sales, a move sought for years by state lottery officials as a way to boost revenues.
Another proposal under discussion by the committee would prohibit so-called online “sweepstakes” games where players can win money from simulated casino games.
Hoosier Lottery’s online push
Illinois, Kentucky and Michigan are among 18 states currently with online lottery sales, said Jared Bond, the Hoosier Lottery’s external affairs director.
“When the Hoosier Lottery was created in 1989 … there was really only one way to buy a lottery ticket,” Bond said. “You walked into a retailer with cash, but today Hoosiers utilize their mobile devices for all kinds of different things, like banking and to shop.”
Online lottery sales likely wouldn’t start until the summer of 2027 as lottery officials hire the needed vendors and set up measures to confirm app users are at least 18 years and are within the state lines when making purchases.
Committee members voted 9-3 to advance House Bill 1078 to the full House for consideration, as some members objected to the bill not including provisions allowing the state’s casinos to offer online games.

The committee last year endorsed a bill for both online lottery and casino games, but it didn’t reach the full House for a vote amid concerns that internet gambling would draw business away from physical casinos and risk greater gambling addiction.
“I strongly feel that i-gaming and i-lottery should be hand in hand, and we’re picking winners and losers,” said Rep. Cory Criswell, R-Middletown. “I don’t think that’s the way it should work.”
An analysis prepared by the Legislative Services Agency projects that online sales would boost the Hoosier Lottery’s revenues by between $314 million and $629 million in the third year. That would increase the lottery’s annual profits — $340 million for fiscal year 2025 — by between $31 million and $94 million in the third year.
The lottery’s sales have been flat at around $1.7 billion for the past five years.
Lisa Hutcheson, the vice president for prevention and policy at Mental Health America of Indiana, warned committee members about rising gambling addiction among young men with the proliferation of sports wagering.
Hutcheson said online gambling such as i-lottery “removes many of the physical safeguards that exist in brick-and-mortar facilities.”
“Online gambling heightens those risks through constant access, targeted advertising, secrecy and the perception of quick financial gain,” she said.
If given approval for online sales, the Hoosier Lottery could sell tickets for instant games and jackpot drawings such as Powerball and MegaMillions via the internet and host online instant games on its website. 
“Sweepstakes” ban considered
A separate proposal under discussion would prohibit any online “sweepstakes” game that “simulates casino-style gaming, including slot machines, video poker, table games, lottery games, bingo, and sports wagering.”
Such games are not specifically covered by Indiana law, so the state Gaming Commission doesn’t have authority to set rules or monitor them, said Natalie Huffman, the commission’s general counsel.
Other than sports wagering, Indiana’s 13 state-regulated casinos are not allowed to offer online gambling.
The sweepstakes games, however, have gained an estimated 200,000 players in Indiana, said Sean Ostrow of the Social Gaming Leadership Alliance, an industry lobbying group.

Rep. Ethan Manning, chair of the Public Policy Committee, said he supported legalizing i-gaming by the casinos but is sponsoring House Bill 1052 that includes the ban on sweepstakes games.
“People are going to sweeps because that’s what’s available right now, even though it’s a black or gray market, depending on your perspective,” said Manning, R-Logansport. “But if i-gaming were legal here … there wouldn’t be much market for the sweeps casinos.”
Huffman said eight states had banned such games and that Indiana was among nine states currently considering doing so. 
Representatives of companies providing sweepstakes games told the committee that no states were regulating the games so far.
They said they were open to discussions about state oversight and taxation, arguing that a ban would push out responsible companies that try to ensure only those older than 21 play the games and work to prevent fraud and money laundering activities. 
“If this bill passes and legitimate companies like us are forced to exit, consumer demand will still remain and our players will simply drift to those offshore sites that have no compunction about operating illegally, allowing minors to participate and not paying out legitimate prizes,” said Dan Marks, chief financial office of Miami-based ARB Interactive.
The committee did not vote on the bill Tuesday, with Manning saying he expected to bring it back for further action in the next couple of weeks.

(Laura Paskus for Source NM)A male house finch belts out his springtime song. Mustard greens have pushed through the loam in my backyard. The hyssop and salvia are greening up, and so are the Mexican sage and globemallow. Sunflowers and poppies are sprouting, and I slept Sunday night with the window cracked open — 38 degrees is usually my threshold for allowing cold air into the room. In the morning, there’s not even a skiff of ice on the birdbath water.
Like many of you, I’ve been walking a fine line between joy and terror this winter. 
Oh, it’s so nice to be outside! And I love listening for screech owls and coyotes at night. But these balmy days and nights fill me with dread. They aren’t just omens of a hot, dry year. They also weaken ecosystems and species that rely upon winter. Including humans. 
In 2025, Albuquerque experienced its hottest year on record, and at the end of December, more than 80% of the state was in drought. 
In early January, Red Flag warnings already exist for Quay, Curry and Roosevelt counties. The National Interagency Fire Center is forecasting above normal wildlife potential for eastern New Mexico in February. And  the soil moisture map looks like the state is breaking out into measles. 
Snowpack across New Mexico is grim. (Do you really want to see the median numbers as of early January? Rio Grande Headwaters in Colorado: 52 percent. Upper Rio Grande in New Mexico: 30. San Juan River Basin: 51. Rio Chama River Basin: 57. Jemez River Basin: 17. Pecos River Basin: 34.) And we’re facing continued La Niña conditions, at least through the next three months. 
‘Snow drought’ observed across the West, amid higher-than-average winter temps

Meanwhile, New Mexico doesn’t have much in its water savings account; just look at the reservoir numbers from the top of the Rio Chama to the Lower Rio Grande in New Mexico. Heron Reservoir is 7% full; El Vado, 13%; Abiquiu, 58%; Elephant Butte, 8%; and Caballo, 7%.
From this vantage point in early January — with a few decades of warming temperatures, drying rivers, burning forests and aridifying croplands already behind us — it’s clear that human-caused climate change is tightening the noose on a viable future for New Mexicans, and for the wildlife and ecosystems we are bound to, inextricably.
In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report, noting that if the Earth’s temperature increased by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, the climate consequences will be “long-lasting” and “irreversible.” Scientists wrote that human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide would need to “fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching ‘net zero’ by 2050.” 
In 2025, the Earth passed the 1.5-degree Celsius threshold. And we’re nowhere near to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by significant levels. 
Nothing that’s happening right now should be a surprise — not the melting ice caps nor the drying rivers. We’ve had decades to pivot or at least prepare. 
Yet, 60 years after President Lyndon Johnson’s science advisory committee warned that the carbon dioxide humans were sending into the atmosphere would cause changes that could be “deleterious from the point of view of human beings,” in 2025, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin launched the Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative, deregulating industries and “driving a dagger straight into the heart of climate change religion.” 
Meanwhile, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright last year told The Guardian that he’s not a climate skeptic. Rather, he’s a “climate realist.” 
“The Trump administration will treat climate change for what it is, a global physical phenomenon that is a side-effect of building the modern world,” Wright said. “Everything in life involves trade-off.”
The men spearheading the Trump administration’s plans know climate change threatens the lives of billions of people and ecosystems ranging from the sea’s coral reefs to Earth’s mountaintops. And their tradeoffs involve the calculated obliteration of longstanding federal environmental laws, the privatization of public lands and watersheds, and of course, the subversion of climate science. (Not to mention, the waging of illegal wars.)
In just a few weeks, New Mexico state legislators will convene for a 30-day session. It’s a fast-paced budget session, which means climate and water won’t top the list of priorities, again. No matter what the mustard greens, house finches, bare mountaintops, and drastically low reservoirs show us. 
This winter, temperatures will drop here and there. Some snow will fall. There will be days that feel like winter. But we’re past the point of comforting ourselves that these warm winter temperatures are an anomaly. They are our future. 
Decades ago, I rented an attic bedroom in a house in western Colorado from a woman who was kind and angry and trying very hard and battling demons. Because she had taped handwritten quotes inside the kitchen cabinet next to the sink, every time I reached inside, I would read them. There’s one quote from the late Joanna Macy I think of every day.  
“The point is not to save people. The point is to create the conditions for the possibility of grace.” 
The point right now isn’t to save the planet — or even ourselves or the more-than-human species we rely upon or love. The point is to create the conditions for the possibility of grace. The possibility of a climate-changed future in which all the best and most beautiful things about this Earth haven’t been traded away.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/dryriogrande.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 15:12:46.853577

About one-third of the petition pages submitted Dec. 9 won't be checked because the signatures were collected prior to Oct. 14 (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Signatures on only two-thirds of the petition pages submitted to force a statewide vote on Missouri’s gerrymandered congressional map will go through the verification process, new filings in a Cole County court case show.
Secretary of State Denny Hoskins delivered 33,068 pages to local election authorities out of 49,773 pages with signatures collected by a political action committee called People Not Politicians. The PAC began circulating petitions after lawmakers passed the new map on Sept. 12. Those pages will be checked to determine which signatures are from registered voters.
Hoskins held back the rest because he does not believe signatures collected before Oct. 14 — the day he approved the form of the petition — are valid. Any pages with at least one signature dated Oct. 14 or later were sent to local election authorities, an exhibit included in the court filings state.
The filing is part of the case pending before Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh over which signatures must be counted. On Dec. 12, Limbaugh declared he would not issue a ruling until the verification process shows whether the referendum petition can succeed without signatures collected before Oct. 14.
People Not Politicians needs approximately 110,000 signatures spread among six of the state’s eight congressional districts to put the redistricting plan to a statewide vote. The 49,773 pages have 305,968 signatures overall, but the filings do not show how many signatures are on the pages being checked.
In other court filings, People Not Politicians has stated that about 103,000 of the signatures were collected before the cutoff date.
The raw signature counts — including the names on pages not sent for verification — show enough signatures were collected in the city of St. Louis to qualify the 1st District and enough in Greene County to qualify the 7th District. 
The data did not show the breakdown in split counties. There were 71,008 signatures submitted from St. Louis County, which is split between the 1st and 2nd districts. There were 59,823 signatures collected in Jackson County, which includes the 4th, 5th and 6th districts, and  30,110 signatures collected in Boone County, which is split between the 3rd and 4th districts.
The two districts where the petition is unlikely to have enough signatures are the 6th Congressional District in north Missouri and the 8th Congressional District in southeast Missouri.
The gerrymandered map was forced through by Republicans who succumbed to pressure from President Donald Trump and revised the eight districts during a September special session.
The intended result from the new map is to flip the 5th District to the GOP. The district, based in Kansas City, has been represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005. 
The district is carved up under the new map with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts. Heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
If the referendum has sufficient signatures, the map would be on the November ballot unless lawmakers set an earlier date.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Referendum-security-20251209-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 15:12:46.853577

Bounds is the institutional historian for the institution, Monday, Nov. 17, 2025.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
For Alexis Dean, age 21, attending Tougaloo College is literally a dream come true.
The idea came to her in a dream. The dream worked out, and she’s now a senior music education major. There’s a lot of hands-on instruction, the teachers are supportive and she loves her classes, though the building where her classes are located might be considered nightmarish by some.
Ballard Hall is the home of Tougaloo’s music department and one of the oldest buildings on campus, but it’s in need of renovations after over a century of use.
“People are scared of this building,” Dean said. “They call it the haunted house because of how it looks on the outside.”
Tougaloo College is working to secure funding to save the historic Ballard Hall from disrepair.
C. Erskine Brown is the assistant vice president of facilities and real property management at Tougaloo. Brown explained that Tougaloo is preparing “a comprehensive preservation and rehabilitation effort” that is in line with preservation guidelines from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History and the National Park Service.
“Preserving this building is not simply a construction project,” Brown said. “It represents the safeguarding of Tougaloo’s legacy, identity and cultural heritage for generations to come.”
The building needs major repairs, including roof replacement, modernizing the HVAC system and interior rehabilitation. Efforts to secure funding for an engineer to survey the building for soundproofing and acoustic treatment are also ongoing.
Dr. Jessie Primer III, chair of Tougaloo’s music department, said the soundproofing and acoustic treatment is part of an effort to gain accreditation from the National Association of Schools of Music. This accreditation would bring the department up to national standards and improve recruitment.
Primer said the overall renovations would improve student morale.
“When alumni come back to visit on campus, they’re surprised to see that this old facility is still standing,” said Primer.
Tony Bounds, Tougaloo’s institutional historian,  explained that the building will become unusable without renovations, and that Toougaloo doesn’t have a place to relocate the music department. The music technology and audio principal labs have already been relocated to the Zenobia Coleman Library.
Bounds believes Ballard Hall is “a hidden gem,” which is why he nominated it to Mississippi Heritage Trust’s list of the “10 Most Endangered Historic Places in Mississippi.” The list raises awareness about places, buildings and things that may be lost to demolition, disrepair and other forces.
“You don’t find too many structures that remain that were actually funded directly by abolitionists, and Ballard Hall is a product of that era in American history,” Bounds said.
“I think that’s very important because it’s material culture. It’s something that we can actually still handle and see and study and delve into physically.”
Ballard Hall was constructed in 1886, mostly by students at the American Missionary Association, which established Tougaloo. It’s named after philanthropist and businessman Stephen Ballard, who contributed money to Black schools throughout the South. His $5,0000 donation was used to construct three buildings, and Ballard Hall is the only one that remains standing.
The 139 year-old building has been repurposed multiple times. It was a preparatory school, the home of Mississippi’s first accredited all-Black high school. It’s been the home of Tougaloo’s music department since 1957.
One of the notable moments from the history of Tougaloo’s music department and Ballard Hall occurred on April 4, 1968. The College’s choir and famed pianist and orchestra leader Duke Ellington had to stop their performance at Carnegie Hall in New York for Ellington and then-Tougaloo President George A. Owens to announce the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.
In 1998, Ballard Hall and the rest of the Tougaloo College Historic District joined the National Register of Historic Places.
Brown explained the challenges faced getting funding: the work the building needs is expensive; the college has limited resources; state and federal preservation grants are very competitive; and there are few funding streams for historically Black colleges and universities for historic preservation.
The total renovation project is estimated to cost a little over $1 million, though the design team hasn’t provided a full schedule of costs yet. Once funding is secured, construction would take an estimated 12 to 18 months.
Bounds says Tougaloo is currently in talks with private funding entities that were recommended to the college by the Mississippi Heritage Trust.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/17151750/Ballard-Hall-2.jpg,,,2026-01-06 15:12:46.853577

(Photo by Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas State University has resolved a student complaint about the presence of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts within its student government following pressure from legislative leadership to investigate.
The Legislature passed a provision in 2025 requiring state agencies, including state universities, to eliminate DEI-related positions, mandates, programs, activities, training requirements, grants and contracts by Aug. 1.
Universities and agencies scrubbed their websites of DEI terminology, reassigned or eliminated staff positions, refocused clubs and departments, examined contracts and removed pronouns from email signatures.
But a student was not satisfied with K-State’s efforts and sent an anonymous report to legislative leadership in July outlining complaints. The Kansas Board of Regents, which oversees the state’s higher education institutions, informed K-State of potential issues within the university’s student government.
Among the issues was language within the university’s Student Governing Association’s constitution that required planning diversity training for student government members. The association also has power to allocate funds to clubs that could involve DEI-related topics. The student senate repealed the training requirement at its Sept. 4 meeting.
Marshall Stewart, chief of staff for K-State’s president, told the State Finance Council on Tuesday that K-State did not realize it was out of compliance at the time of the complaint and worked hard to course correct. The State Finance Council is made up of Gov. Laura Kelly and legislative leadership.
Stewart said students took the matter seriously and resolved to no longer disperse money or make appointments that could be in conflict with the state’s anti-DEI law.
“Universities are big, complex organizations, and I’m not going to say if you go deep enough and look hard enough you’re not going to find some things,” Stewart said. “But if you do find them, we ask that people share those with us.”
Young America’s Foundation, a conservative youth organization, complained to the U.S. Department of Education’s civil rights office in March that K-State’s wasn’t complying with federal anti-DEI efforts. The organization’s letter mentioned the Student Governing Association and other K-State departments by name. However, it did not produce a formal investigation, according to U.S. Department of Education records.
Tuesday’s issue is a carryover from that March complaint and the State Finance Council’s July meeting. Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican and candidate for governor, had charged state officials with investigating the anonymous report, which was sent to his office. 
Adam Proffitt, the secretary of administration, who must certify all agencies and universities are in compliance with the state’s anti-DEI law, presented his findings Tuesday to the council.
He said his legal team worked with K-State, and he was satisfied with the university’s updated report. Masterson commended the university’s effort but expressed interest in crafting additional anti-DEI provisions in the upcoming legislative session.
University leaders recently appeared before the House Committee on Government Efficiency to detail efforts to extricate DEI from college campuses. Legislators on the committee expressed interest in censoring related college curricula.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Masterson-9-Senate-3.26.25-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-06 14:58:01.637292

The remainder are offering foreign catch and failing to inform their customers about where it’s sourced. 
The test results show a significant disparity between establishments on the west bank versus those on the east bank that were found to have much higher authenticity rates for local shrimp. The results also depart from the high authenticity rates found two years ago among independent vendors at the Westwego Shrimp Lot, an open-air seafood market on the west bank.
The testing, performed by SeaD Consulting, analyzed genetic tissue of shrimp served at 24 restaurants randomly selected on the west bank of Jefferson, Orleans and Plaquemines parishes. Sixteen served locally caught seafood, while eight offered foreign, farm-raised shrimp while fraudulently presenting it as domestic catch. 
None of the eight restaurants had signage or menu language disclosing that they were serving imported seafood, as required under law. Seven businesses falsely labeled the imports as domestic, wild-caught shrimp on their menus or through verbal communications with SeaD’s undercover inspectors. One of the eight west bank restaurants had staff that didn’t know what kind of shrimp was being served, according to a news release issued Tuesday.
SeaD Consulting does not publicly identify the businesses that have violated the law, instead focusing on those who are in compliance.  
It is illegal under federal and state law to mislabel imported seafood as local and can result in heavy fines or other penalties, including prison time for some federal cases. 
There have been 2,600 violations of Louisiana’s imported shrimp law — and no fines

For more than a decade, Louisiana law has required restaurants and other food establishments to state on their menus the country of origin of any shrimp and crawfish being served. The same requirement applies to food vendors at fairs and festivals. 
Local seafood was once easy to find in Louisiana, but an influx of cheap foreign catch — particularly shrimp and crawfish — has flooded the market over the past two decades. 
In December 2024, the Louisiana Shrimp Task Force, an advisory panel for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, asked SeaD Consulting to analyze shrimp from restaurants across the state in an effort to eliminate consumer seafood fraud. Its analysis includes sampling 24 randomly selected restaurants in different metropolitan areas across the state. The company shares the results with the Louisiana Department of Health, which has authority to enforce the state shrimp labeling laws at restaurants. 
“When the local shrimp is so abundant, there’s no excuse not to serve them,” Shrimp Task Force Chairman Andrew Blanchard said in the release. 
SeaD Consulting is a food safety technology company that developed a rapid seafood species identification test. Dave Williams, a fisheries scientist and Houston resident, developed the process in collaboration with Florida State University microbiologist Prashant Singh. Over the past two years, SeaD has made headlines for uncovering foreign-sourced shrimp sold fraudulently as local catch at restaurants and festivals across the Gulf Coast.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Shootings in New Jersey hit a record low last year, for the third year in a row, state officials announced Tuesday.
They said 559 people were shot in 487 incidents last year, down from 778 in 2024 and 924 in 2023.
Before 2023, the number of shooting victims had topped 1,000 every year, annually averaging about 1,300, since officials began tracking gun violence statewide in 2009, Attorney General Matt Platkin said. Atlantic City, Camden, Newark, Paterson, and Trenton all saw their shooting numbers drop, officials said.
The lethality of gun violence also fell, with 107 fatalities reported last year. That’s down 31% from 2024 and more than 60% from 2016, when 273 people were shot to death in the deadliest year for gun violence since 2009, officials said.
NJ’s attorney general says he hasn’t ‘shied away’ from tough fights

“Just a few years ago, many experts — and by the way, yours truly — said getting below 1,000 shootings in a year was impossible. But we did it, and then we went further, nearly cutting that number in half,” Gov. Phil Murphy said during the announcement in East Rutherford.
Murphy and other state officials credited the drop to the state’s famously tough gun laws, street teams that work to de-escalate community tensions and reduce violence, interventions like Arrive Together that pair police with mental health professionals to respond to calls, and better data tracking that ensures “an intelligence-led strategy” to cutting gun crime.
“We are not just reacting to crime. We are identifying it, targeting it, and preventing it,” acting Superintendent Lt. Col. David Sierotowicz said. “Our real-time crime centers and gunfire detection technology and other surveillance techniques allow us to identify shootings as they occur in real time, rapidly deploy resources, and provide investigators with critical information to identify both suspects and victims.”
New Jersey also has seen “a meaningful drop in auto thefts, a crime that too often escalates into other forms of violence,” Murphy noted. The number of vehicles stolen statewide fell 9% from 15,041 in 2024 to 13,693 last year, according to the New Jersey State Police.

Pittman, the founder and executive director of Recidivism Reduction Educational Program Services, Inc. (RREPS), was sent to prison at age 18 and served 11 years and six months for conspiracy to commit murder. January 26 will mark eight years since his release and return to the Southeast Raleigh community in which he was reared. 
“I started a nonprofit when I came home and began advocating for individuals coming out of the [incarceration] system but I also put in programming to try to help them reintegrate into society with a little more ease,” Pittman said.
His experience behind bars gave him insight into what other formerly incarcerated individuals needed after they left prison.
“I had family support, so I had housing. but a lot of my friends didn’t have any place to go. Or if they did, there was a time limit on how long they could stay,” Pittman said.
Pittman’s purchase of the abandoned, 400-bed prison is an extension of the work he started soon after he left prison. He plans to create re-entry housing and a workforce campus where formerly incarcerated people can attain job skills or industry certifications.
“The campus would be like a stabilization phase for guys coming out of jail or prison, to give them a six-month pause so they can get their life back on track,” Pittman said. 
Pittman estimates it will take up to two years to get the former prison ready for as many as 300 residents who would live on the campus until they completed the six months-long program. Another class of up to 300 would replace the previous residents each six months, he said.  
He envisions residents studying and training to become electricians, plumbers, HVAC technicians, construction workers and other trades that are in high demand.
“Right now, not only in the United States, but particularly North Carolina and particularly rural North Carolina, they are experiencing a decline [in people] seeking trade jobs,” Pittman said.
Other residents might choose a track to earn industry certifications or a Commercial Driver’s License, he said. 
The program will be open to previously incarcerated individuals from across the state, Pittman said.
“We’ll take referrals, we’ll have a case management team that go inside the jails and prison … and then we’ll go and see if the candidate is the best fit for our program,” Pittman said. 
Pittman said it would make sense to locate such a facility in Goldsboro even if the former prison wasn’t available.
“Goldsboro is suffering right now with the plague of not only violence, but also poverty,” Pittman said. “It only made sense when this institution came up for sale to purchase it because of all of the other things that are going on in Eastern North Carolina, but also in that area.”
Pittman said he bought the former prison for under a million dollars and projects it will take about $2 million to refurbish it, while taking care to ensure it no longer looks like a prison. Pittman will rely heavily on private donations to fund the enterprise but has not ruled out pursuing local, state or federal funding.
The prison closed in 2013 as North Carolina sought to save money by reducing prison capacity after inmate populations declined.

Wayne County Commissioner Bevan Foster had not heard about the project but was excited after a reporter shared the news.
“If he’s able to do what he said he’s gonna do, it’d be great,” Foster said. “It’s the kind of program we need.”
Foster noted the irony of the prison being repurposed to help formerly incarcerated individuals.
“They’re using it for some good,” Foster said. “It would be a great thing.”
Wayne County Commissioner Antonio Williams also had not heard about Pittman’s proposal but said it would be a “wonderful opportunity” for people leaving prison.

“You can look around and see a lot of people who have been rehabilitated, but they come home and it’s challenging for them to even have housing, it’s challenging for them to find a job,” Williams said.
Many formerly incarcerated individuals return home to find that relatives or other loved ones have died or they’ve just lost those relationships while they were away and don’t have any place to go, Williams said.
“Pittman’s proposal, he said, “would definitely give them a chance to rejoin life and get the basic steps in order such as finding jobs, housing and health care, all of those things that are valuable and have meaning.” 
As NC Newsline previously reported, a year ago, Pittman launched the state’s first mobile reentry service center to bring resources and support to people reentering society from prison. He followed up with a second mobile center six months later.
The centers provide previously incarcerated people with case management and other services such as job placement, housing assistance, mental health support and help obtaining important documents such as identification.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A group of conservation organizations said U.S. Critical Materials presented a “bad faith” proposal for “a mining plan” in the Sheep Creek area — not just an “exploration” plan as the company describes.
A letter Monday from the groups to the Bitterroot National Forest asks the U.S. Forest Service to reject the operations plan to look for valuable minerals at the headwaters of the Bitterroot River.
The letter is signed by 21 conservation and planning organizations, some focused on the Bitterroot Valley and others focused on Montana or specific issues.
Signers include Friends of the Bitterroot, MPG Ranch, Ravalli County Fish and Wildlife Association, Bitterroot River Protection Association, Montana Environmental Information Center, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Wild Earth Guardians and Center for Biological Diversity.
The West Fork Ranger District office was closed Monday and a spokesperson could not be reached for comment in time for this story.
U.S. Critical Materials, a privately held company with an interest in mine exploration, has proposed a controversial 3.9 acre project to look for “rare earth” minerals to see if a fullscale mine is feasible. Company representatives have said the operation would support the local economy and national security.
But members of the public have raised numerous concerns including a lack of transparency on the part of company representatives, the environmentally sensitive nature of the site, and the potential for impacts to the entire watershed, especially on water.
After public outcry at a packed December meeting at the Hamilton fairgrounds, Ravalli County Commissioners sent letters to members of the Congressional delegation asking the project to be removed from the FAST-41 list of federal projects to be expedited.
FAST stands for Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act. Title 41 aims to streamline infrastructure projects related to energy, pipelines and other areas including mining.
Monday, the project still was listed on the federal FAST-41 dashboard as a priority in Montana.
Members of the congressional delegation sent their own letter to the Forest Service urging it to ensure transparency from U.S. Critical Materials. Earlier, U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy and U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke explicitly called for the project’s removal from the FAST-41 list.
As chief among their concerns, members of the public and county commissioners have cited a lack of public engagement by U.S. Critical Materials, which states on its website that it is headquartered in Salt Lake City and has a mission to reduce foreign reliance of imports.
Rare earth elements are key ingredients used in everyday products such as cell phones and cars.
Ravalli County Commission Chairperson Dan Huls said Monday county commissioners have yet to hear from U.S. Critical Materials since the December meeting, and they too want more information from the company, especially about projected truck traffic.
The letter Monday from the conservation groups outlines multiple concerns, including that the plan of operation by U.S. Critical Materials is “missing basic critical information” and would require a full environmental impact statement as opposed to a less exhaustive environmental assessment.
“Among the numerous omissions and ploys we note, there is no discussion about testing for asbestos, a potentially immediate human health issue, and no plans to mitigate foreseeable impacts of toxins like arsenic, thorium, lead or possible asbestos,” the letter said.
U.S. Critical Materials could not be reached for comment through a voicemail left Monday afternoon.
The letter also said the project is designed to allow U.S. Critical Materials to ignore waste from the site — “and they already are ignoring it.”
The plan proposes to transfer excess waste “to a containment pad and then offsite via truck to be utilized in gravel production or backfill unrelated to the proposed site activities,” the letter said. It said that could spread toxic contamination, as happened in Ravalli County with Curlew Mine waste, and it raises another concern.
“This seems to be a cynical ploy to stay within a five-acre limit to surface disturbance,” the letter said.
The Bitterroot Star reported that old tailings from the Curlew Mine near Victor were used for graveling roads and even as fill for stream culverts by the Ravalli County Road Department, and a study linked lead contamination to the mine.
At the Sheep Creek site, the letter said waste is a significant issue.
It said mining a mile-long 12-by-12 foot tunnel will require more than an equally large space for storage — “think pulling a sleeping bag out of its stuff sack. The waste will be bigger than the hole it came out of.”
And the waste disposal is related to the mining and needs to be evaluated as a “foreseeable, connected, cumulative impact,” the letter said.
It said storage also is a problem.
“Storing rock inside the mine tunnel, which could be flooded with groundwater, looks like a recipe for a toxic stew of assorted minerals leaching off finely fractured rock surfaces into the water drainage,” the letter said. “We have no idea how the stew will turn out.”
Chairman Huls said the county still is missing important information from U.S. Critical Materials.
For example, he said the county commissioners have no idea if the project in its production or exploration phase would mean 10 trucks or 20 or 30 in any time period.
But the county is responsible for many of the roads leading to the site, he said, and more trucks mean more use, more traffic and budget implications.
“Frankly without a large infusion of cash, we can’t improve those roads as it is,” Huls said.
Since the December meeting, Huls said the county has continued to hear from the public. He estimated 99% of the comments are opposed to fast-tracking the project and oppose the mine altogether, although he said a couple of callers said it presents an opportunity.
Huls said the county commissioners are monitoring the situation and will continue to do so.
“While we do as a commission support the extraction of critical materials, we think there are lots of better opportunities, and we don’t think the sensitivity of the environment where this proposed mine is can be healthy for our economy here in the Bitterroot — and especially with the potential environmental hazards that it possesses,” Huls said.

(Provided by MSU for the Daily Montanan.)The last time Montana State University football team claimed a national championship, U.S. Sen. Steve Daines was graduating from the school, in 1984.
“What a time to be a Bobcat!” Daines wrote in a social media post on X last night from Nashville, where he was in attendance to witness MSU pull off an incredibly exciting overtime victory over Illinois State, 35-34.
Also in attendance supporting Montana State’s run to the top of the FCS was Gov. Greg Gianforte and U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy.

“What a game! Bobcats are the National Champs. So proud!” Gianforte wrote on X, along with photos of himself and his wife celebrating the win on the field.
The Bobcats returned to the FCS championship game for the third time in five years, after losing a close game 35-32 to North Dakota State University.
At the start of this season’s playoffs, NDSU was ranked No. 1, with the Bobcats entering as the No. 2 ranked team following their Big Sky Conference title earned in a Brawl of the Wild win against the University of Montana.
The Cats earned their championship berth with a second victory over the Griz in a semifinal game on Dec. 20, setting the stage for a trip to Nashville to take on Illinois State.
MSU jumped to an early lead in the game, with quarterback Justin Lamson rushing three yards to put points on the board first.
Another rush by Lamson in the second quarter put MSU up by 14 before the Redbirds finally responded with their own touchdown.
The teams continued back and forth with MSU always holding the lead until the fourth quarter, when the Redbirds reached the endzone twice, tying the game at 28 with just over five minutes on the clock.
The momentum seemed to be with Illinois State, as the Bobcats saw a three-and-out that gave the Redbirds the ball, and they drove deep into Bobcats territory with a chance to kick a field goal for the win with a minute to go.
But a block by Bobcats cornerback Jhase McMillan ended that dream, and gave the Bobcats their own chance to end the game in regulation time.
Instead, a bad snap sent the ball over Lamson’s head and gave the chance right back to Illinois State, which sent the game into overtime, a first for an FCS championship.
The Redbirds kept up their second-half momentum by scoring in two plays in OT, on a 10-yard pass from quarterback Tommy Rittenhouse.
It wasn’t enough, however, as once again, an MSU player blocked the additional point.
The Bobcats marched back down into Illinois State territory and Lamson landed a 14-yard pass to Taco Dowler for the touchdown, and the point after by Myles Sansted clinched the game.

The beauty of sports is overwhelming sometimes.
What a game. What a season. What a memory.

The proposal is part of a larger effort to reform Maine’s overburdened indigent defense system, which courts have ruled is in violation of defendants’ Sixth Amendment rights. 
Last session, several bills were proposed to reduce the number of cases brought to the courts in order to alleviate the backlog. Most did not pass, though some were carried over to this session.
The bill, LD 449, sponsored by Rep. David Sinclair (D-Bath), would allow first-time criminal defendants to file a motion for conditional discharge as an alternative sentencing option. 
Only those convicted of the less serious crimes (classes C, D, and E) would be eligible if they have not been previously convicted of a serious offense. 
The Maine Commission on Public Defense Services supported the bill, arguing it would help reduce the number of criminal cases, as hundreds of indigent defendants wait for court-appointed attorneys.
“Right now, we have a very, very significant backlog of cases,” said Frayla Tarpinian, the new executive director of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services, told lawmakers during a Judiciary Committee work session Tuesday. “And it’s really taxing everybody who’s involved in the system: the court, the courts, the prosecutors, defense attorney resources. And so establishing narrow places where judges can intervene and off-ramp cases… could help alleviate some of that burden.”
But prosecutors raised issues with the proposal’s potential to increase the number of motions filed, saying it would burden the courts. 
Shira Burns, executive director of the Maine Prosecutors Association, told the committee that the bill also fails to consider the impact conditional discharge would have on victim rights, particularly in domestic violence cases. Burns argued the bill is too broad, and does not prevent repeat offenders from filing motions of conditional discharge — even if they may not be eligible for it.
Committee co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) echoed Burns’ concerns, pointing out that the proposal, carried over from last session, could have been amended to address those issues, but wasn’t. She also noted the overlap with another reform that recently took effect that allows prosecutors to charge certain Class E crimes as civil violations.
Carney previously told Maine Morning Star that she wasn’t sure whether it is possible to make the changes proposed in LD 449 to the state criminal code, although she said the proposal is “trying to get at that same concern: that we’re spending more resources charging and prosecuting people than we need to spend, in order to achieve the rehabilitative purpose of the criminal code.”
With the committee unanimously opposed, the legislation has little chance of passing the full Legislature and will likely be rejected without a roll call vote. However, members of the Judiciary Committee will consider several other reforms to the indigent defense system in the coming weeks.

Jeff Landry speaks in the Louisiana House of Representatives on the opening day of a legislative special session, Nov. 6, 2024, at the State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry wrote in an opinion column he believes captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro should be put to death for his alleged drug-related crimes. 
“Personally, I’d like to see Maduro executed for the crimes he has committed against the people of the United States and the families left to mourn,” Landry wrote for the right-leaning news outlet Breitbart. “However, I would be well satisfied to see him and his wife spend the rest of their days at Camp 57 in Angola.” 
Camp 57 is an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement-run facility Landry set up at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola. Landry named the site in honor of himself, the 57th governor of Louisiana. 
Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured by American forces last week after an attack on Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. They were brought to New York, where they face federal drug trafficking and other charges. The couple pleaded not guilty. 
“Since 2015, over 800,000 Americans have died from opioid overdoses. The vast majority of those cases are from fentanyl, a drug that makes its way into the United States through various drug cartels,” Landry wrote. “One of the largest in the world was the illegitimate government of Venezuela, run by indicted criminal Nicolás Maduro.” 

“Because of the actions of the president of the United States and the world’s finest military force, he will be brought to justice,” Landry continued. 
Federal law enforcement agencies attribute the bulk of illegal fentanyl shipments into the U.S. from China and Mexico.
President Donald Trump has said the United States will run Venezuela, and American oil companies will increase their operations in the country. In Maduro’s absence, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has been sworn in as acting president. 
Landry believes Trump’s plans for Venezuela will be economically beneficial for Louisiana. 
“Our ports will be key logistics bases for the rejuvenation of the Venezuelan oil and gas industry,” Landry wrote. “Our oil and gas companies will see tremendous opportunities in this process. More importantly, our people will find high-paying jobs in support of this effort.”

The New Mexico Department of Justice said Jan. 5, 2026, it is “reviewing” the legality of a recent ICE detention contract extension. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM).The New Mexico Department of Justice is reviewing whether the Torrance County Commission violated the state Open Meetings Act last week when it quickly approved a contract extension enabling a federal agency to continue housing immigrant detainees at a local jail, an NMDOJ spokesperson told Source New Mexico. 
The commission met for only a few minutes Dec. 30 and voted without debate or public comment to extend the contract between the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency and CoreCivic, which owns and operates the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia. Before commissioners met last week, the contract had been defunct for two months.
The contract extension to March 31 of this year increased the monthly payment ICE makes to the county to roughly $2.4 million, funding the county then passes on to CoreCivic. The parties also backdated the contract to Nov. 1, 2025, the date the original contract expired.
The meeting between Christmas and New Year’s Day to extend a backdated contract has piqued the interest of the New Mexico Department of Justice, according to spokesperson Chelsea Pitvorec.
50 NM immigrant detainees say mail issues at jail hurting their legal cases  

“The information surrounding the December 30 meeting raises real concern regarding backdating a contract, compliance with the New Mexico procurement code, and whether the Open Meetings Act was complied with,” Pitvorec told Source in an email Monday evening. “NMDOJ has authority over local government compliance with the Open Meetings Act, and we intend to gather more facts and review what transpired in accordance with State law.”
Ian Philabaum, a program director for Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based immigrant legal advocacy group that does weekly jail visits, told Source New Mexico last week that he was concerned county officials did not provide adequate notice about the meeting. 
The county’s 2025 Open Meetings Act resolution requires county commissions holding “special meetings” like the one last week to provide public notice at least 72 hours in advance to an area newspaper and a television or radio station.
In response to questions from Source NM, Torrance County Manager Jordan Barela did not directly address whether the county had provided that notice, though he said in an email county officials published notice on its website about the meeting on Dec. 26. 
“This means that the notice was posted in excess of 96 hours before the date of the meeting. In addition, this meet[ing] was posted in the same form and manner as all other special meetings conducted by the County Commission,” he said via email Monday. 
He also said it’s common practice for the commission not to allow public comment in special meetings where there is only one agenda item.

Leaders in the House and Senate could not agree on a general operating budget in 2025. With the chambers divided over the state’s planned income tax cuts and how much to increase pay for state workers and teachers, they left town with negotiations in a holding pattern until this year’s short session.
In the meantime, much of state government has been running on a continuation of the 2024 budget. Republican legislative leaders say that level of funding is adequate, but agency heads on both sides of the aisle disagree.
Democratic Secretary of State Elaine Marshall told the governor and other members of the council that more than 172,000 new businesses were created in North Carolina last year, nearly 10,000 more than in 2024.
While the growth has been remarkable, Marshall said on Tuesday, it was disappointing that her calls for additional personnel within the agency have fallen on deaf ears at the legislature.
“I sat at this very seat in August of ’23 asking the General Assembly for help,” said Marshall. “Two years later, that help has still not come. This is now our second year without a new state budget.”
The workload at the Secretary of State’s office has essentially doubled since 2017, yet staffing levels have remained largely unchanged, Marshall said. The agency has implemented technology improvements to manage a flood of new filings, but technology alone cannot solve every issue.
“People are essential,” said Marshall.
State Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey said his agency was understaffed for the amount of work investigators are asked to do. (Photo: NC Council of State livestream)
But Marshall said her employees are the second lowest paid employees in state government.
“We’ve consistently communicated to the General Assembly leadership the need for additional staff positions. While there’s growing awareness on Jones Street, the reality remains that there has been no budget,” she said.
State Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey, a Republican, joined Marshall in criticizing the failure of lawmakers to address the state’s budgetary needs.
Causey said his department’s team of 50 criminal investigators was called to investigate more than 7,600 cases of possible insurance fraud in 2025.
“Last year, these teams made 380 arrests,” said Causey. “We’re still only scratching the surface when it comes to fighting fraud.”
From 2017 to 2025, the Department of Insurance recovered over $76.6 million for people who were victimized by insurance fraud, according to the commissioner.
Governor Josh Stein said the lack of a comprehensive budget is hurting state employees and teachers. (Photo: NC Council of State livestream)
“I don’t think there’s an agency here that couldn’t use more staffing,” said Causey. “But both the Senate and the House, when they came out with their proposed budgets, were asking us as a self-funded agency to cut 20 positions or $2 million from our budget at a time when we need to be adding that many [positions] or more.”
Governor Josh Stein empathized with both agency heads and echoed their call for state legislators to get moving and pass a comprehensive budget that should have been in place last July.
“We have public safety officers who are not paid well. We have teachers who are earning less money on a real basis today than they were a year ago,” lamented Stein.
The governor noted that North Carolina ranks 48th in per-pupil spending and 50th in the country in terms of funding effort of K-12 education.
“These are numbers in which we can take no pride,” said Stein. “The legislature needs to pass a budget. I’m at the table ready to get to work whenever they are.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Marshall_1-6-2026.jpg,,,2026-01-06 13:57:34.699472

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday recommended that the previous number of childhood vaccines of 17 be reduced to just 11 vaccinations.
In a statement issued Tuesday, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan’s chief medical executive, said that the new changes may create confusion for families and clinicians in terms of school vaccine requirements, clinical workflows and the supply and use of combination vaccines.
“[The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services] will continue to provide clear guidance, backed by science, to help protect Michigan families,” Bagdasarian said.
The new schedule is specifically suggesting tighter restrictions on vaccines for rotavirus, hepatitis A and B, meningitis and seasonal influenza, recommending that those vaccines only be given to children with high medical risk or at the recommendation of a pediatrician or health care provider.
NPR reported that those vaccines now exist in a category designated as “shared-decision making.”
The move follows U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s missives on the federal government reevaluating the number of vaccines given to children and their effectiveness, which follow his long history of questioning vaccines and their disproven ties to autism and unsubstantiated connections to other disorders.
Schedule changes issued Monday by Jim O’Neil, the deputy secretary in Kennedy’s agency, were the product of consultation with National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya, Food and Drug Commissioner. Marty Makary, and U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz, as well as the health ministries of what the agency described as peer nations.
Recommended for all children are vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus (HPV), and varicella (chickenpox).
In response, Bagdasarian said that the underlying scientific evidence surrounding vaccine effectiveness remains unchanged, and that the state will continue to follow guidance produced either by the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Bagdasarian in December 2025 issued a standing recommendation to follow that guidance despite whatever changes the federal government made regarding the vaccine schedule, and she stands by the recommendation.
Both the state’s health department and the federal health agency have said that all vaccines, including those moved to shared clinical decision-making category, will remain covered with no out-of-pocket cost via Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act-regulated private insurance plans and federal coverage programs such as Medicaid and the Vaccines for Children program.
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who has become one of Kennedy’s foremost critics in Congress, said in a statement that the agency’s move was part of why she has called for his impeachment.
“RFK Jr. is ignoring decades of reliable science and making our children less safe — this is the latest step,” Stevens said. “The Secretary of Health and Human Services is supposed to protect the health of the American people. Instead, at every turn, RFK Jr. actively chooses to make our country sicker.”
Stevens added that Kennedy’s “conspiracy agenda is dangerous and unacceptable.”

California es uno de los 32 estados que no exige que los niños de 5 años asistan a la escuela.



This article is also available in English. Read it here.
En los últimos años, California se ha centrado en el ABC, el 1-2-3 y las ruedas del autobús, invirtiendo más de 5 mil millones de dólares en educación de la primera infancia.
Pero el kínder, un elemento básico de las escuelas primarias durante más de un siglo, sigue siendo opcional. A pesar de casi media docena de intentos legislativos para hacerlo obligatorio, California es uno de los 32 estados que no exige que todos los niños de 5 años asistan a la escuela.
Eso podría cambiar en el 2026. Los legisladores planean presentar un nuevo proyecto de ley para exigir la educación preescolar y confían en que tendrá mejor suerte que sus predecesores, que fracasaron en comisión o fueron vetados, en gran medida debido a su costo.
 “Los niños necesitan estar rodeados de otros niños, necesitan aprender. Es importante”, dijo Patricia Lozano, directora ejecutiva de Early Edge California, organización que aboga por la educación infantil temprana. “No veo por qué California no puede lograrlo”.
Los datos, según los activistas, son contundentes. Los niños que asisten al kínder obtienen mejores resultados en matemáticas y lectura a partir del tercer grado, y mayores tasas de graduación de la preparatoria. También tienen menos probabilidades de ser suspendidos o abandonar la escuela más adelante.
 ¿Por qué algunos padres optan por no participar?
Si bien California exige que todos los distritos escolares ofrezcan kínder, no obliga a las familias a matricular a sus hijos. La mayoría lo hace, pero aproximadamente un 5% al año opta por no inscribir a sus hijos. Las razones varían: algunas familias creen que los niños no están preparados para los rigores de la escuela, mientras que otras están satisfechas con la situación actual de sus hijos, ya sea preescolar, guardería o quedarse en casa con la familia.
Las familias latinas son las menos propensas a enviar a sus hijos al kínder, según los datos. Lozano explicó que esto se debe a diversas razones: o bien no lo saben debido a la barrera del idioma; o bien tienen miedo de inscribir a sus hijos en la escuela por preocupaciones migratorias; o bien los padres trabajan tanto que no recibieron las notificaciones del distrito escolar; o bien una combinación de las tres. En cualquier caso, las escuelas necesitan mejorar su acercamiento a esa comunidad, afirmó.
 Cecelia Kiss, maestra bilingüe de kínder del Distrito Escolar Unificado de la Ciudad de Sacramento, comentó que recientemente tuvo una alumna cuya madre fue deportada, y la niña no pudo asistir a la escuela porque no había nadie disponible para llevarla. Aunque le encantaba la escuela y la familia valoraba mucho la educación, era logísticamente imposible llevarla a la escuela. La escuela y la familia tardaron varias semanas en organizar el transporte.
“Para los latinos, la educación es fundamental. Queremos darles a nuestros hijos lo mejor posible”, dijo Kiss, quien también es madre de un niño de kínder. “Pero a veces no podemos con todo. Confiamos en maestros bondadosos que cuiden a nuestros hijos, que los ayuden a aprender y que los preparen para el primer grado”.
 La senadora estatal Susan Rubio afirmó que el hecho de que el kínder no sea obligatorio desalienta a las familias ya desfavorecidas a matricular a sus hijos. En su experiencia, las familias latinas tienen un gran respeto por el sistema escolar público, y si este les dice que el kínder es opcional y, por lo tanto, no es una prioridad, “lo escuchan”.
Por eso ha propuesto dos proyectos de ley anteriores para hacer obligatorio el kínder. El estado debe transmitir a las familias un mensaje claro: la educación en la primera infancia es esencial para el éxito escolar y personal de los estudiantes, afirmó. El estado  de California ya ha implementado el kínder de transición para todos los niños de 4 años, ha ampliado la educación preescolar financiada por el estado y ha añadido más plazas a su programa de guarderías subvencionadas. El siguiente paso debería ser reforzar el kínder, añadió.
El superintendente estatal de Instrucción Pública, Tony Thurmond, coincide con esta apreciación. Este mes, declaró que la obligatoriedad del kínder es una prioridad legislativa para 2026 y se comprometió a apoyar cualquier proyecto de ley que lo aborde. Varios legisladores afirmaron que considerarían patrocinar uno.
‘No es una necesidad urgente’
 Los dos proyectos de ley anteriores de Rubio sobre jardines de infancia fracasaron: uno en el Comité de Asignaciones del Senado y el otro cuando el gobernador Gavin Newsom lo vetó. En su nota de veto, afirmó que apoya la educación temprana en general, pero que el estado no había presupuestado el costo, estimado en 268 millones de dólares anuales.
 “Si bien la intención del autor es loable… es importante mantener la disciplina en lo que respecta al gasto, particularmente el gasto continuo”, escribió Newsom.
 Numerosos grupos apoyaron los proyectos de ley, incluyendo la Asociación de Maestros de California (el sindicato de docentes más grande del estado) y varios distritos escolares. Sin embargo, tuvo algunos oponentes, en particular la Asociación de Educación en el Hogar de California. La oposición del grupo no se basaba en las ventajas del kínder en sí, sino en la capacidad del estado para despojar de derechos a los padres.
 “La mayoría de los niños ya van al kínder. Pero algunos padres tienen buenas razones para dejar a sus hijos en casa”, dijo Jamie Heston, miembro de la junta directiva del grupo. “Los padres quieren tener la opción de decidir qué es lo mejor para sus hijos”.
 La Asociación de Contribuyentes Howard Jarvis no se ha pronunciado al respecto, pero en general se opone a las nuevas iniciativas que cuestan dinero, como la educación preescolar obligatoria. Es improbable que esta postura cambie si resurge un proyecto de ley sobre educación preescolar, declaró esta semana la vicepresidenta del grupo, Susan Shelley.
 “Desde un punto de vista presupuestario, este año hay mucha presión para mantener el gasto bajo control”, dijo Shelley. “Este no sería un gasto único. Sería continuo. Y no hay una necesidad urgente de ampliar el jardín de infantes, en comparación con otras necesidades más apremiantes que enfrenta el estado en este momento”.
Bruce Fuller, profesor de educación en la Universidad de California en Berkeley y especialista en educación infantil temprana, afirmó que la Legislatura debería centrarse en las necesidades más urgentes de los menores de 6 años. Entre ellas se incluye cómo la implementación del kínder de transición ha provocado el cierre de muchos centros preescolares, dejando a muchos niños de 3 años sin lugares de cuidado diario. Además, Head Start enfrenta dificultades financieras y otros obstáculos impuestos por la administración Trump, incluyendo intentos de excluir a familias no ciudadanas. Y aunque California ha ampliado el acceso a la educación preescolar financiada por el estado, no hay suficientes familias que sepan que son elegibles.
“No hay tantas familias optando por no asistir al kínder, así que no es una gran necesidad”, dijo Fuller. “Hay preocupaciones más inmediatas”. 
 Brechas de aprendizaje entre los estudiantes
Aun así, Rubio confía en que un proyecto de ley sobre jardín de infantes tiene buenas posibilidades de aprobarse este año, en gran parte porque la Legislatura ha experimentado una rotación significativa desde la última vez que votó sobre un proyecto de ley sobre educación preescolar en 2024. Veintisiete nuevos senadores y miembros de la Asamblea fueron elegidos el otoño pasado.
Para Rubio, cuyos padres emigraron de México, el asunto es personal. Aunque a ella le fue bien en la escuela, a su hermano gemelo no. A temprana edad, lo asignaron erróneamente a educación especial, se retrasó y tuvo dificultades durante toda su etapa escolar, hasta que finalmente abandonó los estudios. Rubio cree que le habría ido mejor si hubiera recibido una educación infantil de alta calidad.
Ella también es maestra de primaria y ha visto la brecha entre los estudiantes que han asistido a preescolar, kínder tradicional y jardín de infancia, y aquellos que nunca se matricularon en la escuela hasta primer grado. Los niños que han asistido a jardín de infancia saben sostener un lápiz, escribir sus nombres, contar hasta 20, esperar por su turno y quizás incluso leer o hacer cálculos matemáticos básicos, comentó. Los que no han asistido se quedan muy atrás de sus compañeros y algunos nunca se ponen al día, añadió.
 “Tengo recuerdos muy vívidos de mis alumnos rompiendo a llorar al final del año porque no pudieron hacer un examen. No sabían las respuestas, y es muy doloroso verlo”, dijo Rubio, quien está de licencia en su trabajo como maestra en el Distrito Escolar Unificado de Monrovia, en el condado de Los Ángeles. “Es duro para ellos y para los maestros, porque esos niños necesitan mucha ayuda adicional”.
 Lozano dijo que cree que el proyecto de ley se aprobará con el tiempo. La iniciativa costaría dinero, pero el estado ahorraría dinero a largo plazo si más estudiantes tuvieran éxito en la escuela y se graduaran.
 “Nos llevó 20 años conseguir el TK. Se necesita tiempo para cambiar de opinión y de políticas”, dijo Lozano. “El kínder ofrece muchísimos beneficios, especialmente para los niños que más lo necesitan. Creemos que los beneficios superan los costos”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/032723-Buttonwillow-LV_CM_15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 13:57:34.699472

On Dec. 30, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O’Neill announced on X that the Administration of Children and Families will now “require a justification and a receipt or photo evidence” before it will send money to a state for child care purposes. 
The Administration of Children and Families oversees the distribution of federal child care funds to states. It administers funding from the Child Care and Development Block Grant and the Child Care and Development Fund, or CCDF. 
In New Hampshire, the fund and grant bankroll the Bureau of Child Development and Head Start, the Child Care Scholarship Program, mental health and substance misuse programs, and other initiatives. New Hampshire received over $28 million in CCDF funds in the grant year 2025. 
The announcement comes after a video from a right-wing social media influencer went viral, claiming there is widespread fraud in Somali-run day care programs in Minnesota. As a result, the Trump administration froze all child care payments to Minnesota and announced that all states must produce funding receipts. 
As of Tuesday, the federal Department of Health and Human Services has frozen over $10 billion in funding — specifically for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, CCDF, and the Social Services Block Grant — in New York, California, Illinois, and Colorado, in addition to Minnesota. 
Josh Corbett, spokesperson for New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte, said the governor’s office had not received any notice from the federal government about a pause in child care funding as of Monday. 
O’Neill said that funds will be released “only when states prove they are being spent legitimately.”
To receive CCDF funding, the state submits biennial plans and quality progress reports. The federal government has not specified what additional documentation could be required to keep funding available. 
Freezing federal dollars could significantly impact Granite State families and child care providers across the state. As of November 2025, 4,976 children were actively using the Child Care Scholarship Program.
While the program is funded through both federal and state dollars, the majority of funding comes from the federal government. 
Additionally, a pilot program began on Jan. 1 that would allow scholarship applicants to be presumed eligible and receive scholarship funds for the program while completing their applications. 
The state Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about how a pause in federal funding could impact either initiative. 
Meanwhile, the Trump administration continues to make changes to child care subsidies. 
On Monday, U.S. Health and Human Services rescinded rules from 2024 that required states to pay providers before verifying any attendance and before care was delivered. Under the new rule changes, attendance-based billing will be restored, upfront payments will no longer be required, and voucher flexibility for parental choice will be restored. 
In the press release, O’Neill said that upfront payments based on enrollment instead of actual attendance “invites abuse” and that the new rules will “make fraud harder to perpetrate.”
On Dec. 1, New Hampshire started its prospective payment system, which would allow child care providers to bill a week in advance for Child Care Scholarship Program services, in an effort to ease administrative burdens.
It is currently unclear how new federal guidelines will impact New Hampshire’s programs.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/childcaresubsidies-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-06 13:57:34.699472

The move comes as the Trump administration has heightened federal oversight of child care subsidy distribution after a conservative social media influencer alleged fraud in Minnesota’s child care programs. 
After Minnesota fraud allegations, HHS orders states to justify child care spending

In a letter last week, two Idaho Republican lawmakers — Rep. Josh Tanner, an Eagle Republican who on Monday became co-chairman of the Legislature’s powerful budget committee, and Sen. Brian Lenney, a Nampa Republican — asked the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to freeze payments for Idaho’s program, which they called similar to Minnesota’s.
Idaho’s funds haven’t yet been doled out, but the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is shoring up oversight efforts now, agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in a statement Friday. 
“Recent federal enforcement actions in Minnesota, now under investigation as one of the largest welfare-fraud schemes in U.S. history, have revealed systemic vulnerabilities in childcare subsidy programs similar in structure to Idaho’s,” Tanner and Lenney wrote. “Those investigations identified inadequate enrollment verification, limited financial oversight, and insufficient inspection controls.”

In their Dec. 31 letter, Lenney and Tanner asked Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Juliet Charron to temporarily suspend “proposal solicitations, contract issuances, and fund disbursements” linked to $14 million in funding the Legislature approved in 2025 to expand child care availability, “pending implementation of enhanced program-integrity and fraud-prevention safeguards.”
Lenney and Tanner could not be reached for comment. 
 Idaho’s funds haven’t been given out, Department of Health and Welfare says

The lawmakers called on freezing the state’s spending for $14 million in federal funds for the Idaho Child Care Program. Last year through Senate Bill 1206, the Legislature allowed the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to spend that money to boost child care availability through contracts, grants and programs. 
The Department of Health and Welfare “is committed to administering all programs with robust oversight and will continue efforts to address suspected fraudulent behavior by bad actors,” McWhorter said last week. “While the department has established processes for fraud and abuse identification and mitigation, the department has been working closely with the Governor’s Office since Monday to take additional steps to conduct heightened reviews of subsidies that were previously disbursed.”

“The department is actively redirecting staff to scale up resources to continue to support these reviews and necessary actions, including provider termination when appropriate,” he said. “Any bad actors will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
In an X post last week, Lenney called their letter “just the opening shot.”
“Minnesota got torched for BILLIONS in childcare fraud. We’re not waiting around to be next,” he wrote.

It isn’t immediately clear whether fraud has been alleged in Idaho’s program. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare could not be immediately reached about whether it received specific fraud allegations in its program.
 Idaho’s request came after Minnesota fraud allegations that prompted federal crackdown

On Dec. 18, a federal prosecutor said fraud in Minnesota’s Medicaid services could be more than $9 billion, the Minnesota Reformer reported. 
Then last week, the Trump administration cracked down on child care funding in response to a viral YouTube video by right-wing social media influencer Nick Shirley that alleged Somali-run child care centers receive state and federal funding but had no children attending those centers, the Minnesota Reformer reported. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced it froze all child care payments to Minnesota and is requiring states to provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers in order to get those dollars, States Newsroom reported.
In August 2024, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare paused new enrollments for parents to receive subsidies through the program for months as the agency anticipated the program would face a budget shortfall. At the time, state officials said the projected shortfall was caused by rising costs of child care and expanded program eligibility, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.

Collins, a Republican from Jackson, is seeking the GOP nomination to face Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff in November’s midterm election. He is set to face fellow GOP Congressman Buddy Carter and former football coach Derek Dooley in the Republican primary in May.
The House Ethics Committee announced the probe in November but offered no details about the allegations at the time.
A report from the Office of Congressional Conduct released Monday found “substantial reason to believe that Rep. Collins used congressional resources for unofficial or otherwise unauthorized purposes” and paid an intern who was the girlfriend of his chief of staff but who did not actually perform any duties.
According to witnesses cited in the report, the intern, identified as Caroline Craze, received payments of about $5,000 in 2023 and 2024. Craze was reportedly in a relationship with Collins’ then-chief of staff, Brandon Phillips, and was working for Sandy Springs-based Cox Communications during the time she was allegedly paid by Collins’ office.
Phillips served as Collins’ chief of staff from January 2023 through last month and now works as a senior policy adviser for Collins’ campaign.
The report also accuses Phillips of potentially inappropriately spending money set aside for official duties on campaign expenses.
The report says that Collins, Phillips and other campaign staff did not cooperate with the investigation and recommended that the House Committee on Ethics issue subpoenas to them as well as Craze.
In a statement, Collins’ office denied the allegations.
“This bogus complaint is a sad attempt to derail one of Georgia’s most effective conservative legislators in Congress. Rep. Collins looks forward to providing the House Ethics Committee all factual information and putting these meritless allegations to rest,” the office said.
In a letter to the House Committee on Ethics, attorney Russell Duncan, who represents Collins and Phillips, said that the allegations came from “two disgruntled, former members of Congressman Collins staff” and called on the committee to dismiss the matter.
Duncan said the decision to temporarily hire Craze was within Phillips’ discretion and that she “provided valuable assistance to the Office throughout both years regarding communications and other work of the Office.”
Surrogates from both parties are hoping the allegations will stick.
“Mike Collins wouldn’t be refusing to cooperate if he had nothing to hide,” said Devon Cruz, senior communications advisor with the Democratic Party of Georgia, in a statement. “Collins’ apparent abuse of power is disturbing and once again underscores he cannot represent Georgians in the United States Senate.”
The House Ethics Committee consists of 10 members, five from each party. If an investigation reveals wrongdoing, the committee has the power to levy punishments ranging from private letters of admonition to, in especially rare and severe cases, recommendations of expulsion, which require a two-thirds majority vote from the entire House to enact.

Community resident confirms Christina Park needs additional support to address abandoned personal property, trash removal, restroom cleanliness, and other basic services.
 
WILMINGTON, Del. (Jan. 6, 2026) — The City of Wilmington is formalizing the growth of the Christina Park unhoused community and expanding on-site services through a new partnership with Friendship House of Delaware, city officials announced Tuesday.
Mayor John Carney said the agreement places Friendship House in charge of daily management of the city-sanctioned community at Christina Park, which is now the only location in Wilmington where camping is permitted for people experiencing homelessness.
Christina Park was temporarily designated in October 2025 as part of the city’s response to a rising street-unhoused population. City officials estimate more than 600 people are unhoused in Wilmington and nearly 1,600 statewide. Rather than displace residents living outdoors, the city chose to formalize the site as a managed, temporary community focused on safety, sanitation, and access to services while longer-term housing solutions are developed.
Under an initial six-month contract — expected to extend to at least a year — Friendship House will provide daily oversight and coordination for up to 100 tents. Services include implementation of site infrastructure; cleaning and sanitation; cold-weather protocols coordinated with Code Purple; installation of safety stations and posted rules of decorum; coordination of food and donation drop-offs; and on-site case management connecting residents to housing, healthcare, employment, mental-health, and substance-use services.
City officials said the Christina Park community replaces unsanctioned encampments elsewhere in Wilmington. Camping will be prohibited in other locations, with enforcement focused on directing people to the managed site.
A resident’s view underscores service needs
For some residents, Christina Park is more than a temporary shelter — it is a self-described community that still faces daily challenges.
Alfonzo, a 61-year-old veteran and former Boy Scout who lives at the park, said he prefers to call himself a “city camper” rather than a member of the unhoused population. He lives in one tent and uses a second tent as storage for blankets, food, and personal belongings. He said he chose to live at Christina Park rather than stay with his sister in Wilmington.
Alfonzo said he informally serves as an “ambassador” for the park, welcoming new residents and helping them adjust. He said he is not using drugs, though he acknowledged that substance use affects some residents. According to him, his veteran benefits provide $79 a month, which he used to purchase the tents.
He said he is one of the few residents who can boil water — an important capability for washing dishes and maintaining sanitation — and that he regularly helps others access clean water. At the same time, he said the community needs additional support to address abandoned personal property, trash removal, restroom cleanliness, and other basic services.
Alfonzo said he was recently released from jail following an attempted bank robbery and did not want to return to living with family. He described Christina Park as offering structure and autonomy, but said consistent management and services are necessary to keep the site safe and functional — needs the city says Friendship House is contracted to meet.
Part of a broader strategy
City leaders emphasized that Christina Park is not a permanent solution. It is part of a broader homelessness strategy that includes plans for a new daytime dining and service center at 600 Fourth St., expanded affordable housing development, coordination with behavioral-health providers, and potential zoning changes to support additional housing options.
Residents interested in donating food, clothing, or essential items are asked to contact volunteer@friendshiphousede.org.

Gary Tramontina/AP Images for Kmart/WWE","The trial for Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr. will be the first, and maybe the only, criminal case brought to jurors in the Mississippi welfare scandal that’s unfolded over the last six years.
The former WWE wrestler, who often appeared publicly alongside the state’s disgraced former human services director from 2018 to 2019, is accused of defrauding two federal assistance programs, while DiBiase has argued he was a lawful contractor.
The other seven people charged with crimes, including the former human services director, a prominent nonprofit founder and DiBiase’s own brother, have pleaded guilty and agreed to aid the prosecution. None are in prison as they continue to await sentencing.
Many other characters have emerged – whether through audits, civil litigation or investigative reporting – for their potential roles in the conspiracy to divert tens of millions of welfare dollars away from the needy. But the federal government hasn’t opened any new indictments in the case in over a year. It hasn’t publicly identified any additional targets.
DiBiase’s trial could signal the beginning of the end of a saga that catapulted government bureaucrats in a poverty-drenched state – as well as the failures of federal welfare reform – into the national spotlight.

Leading up to the trial that started Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves cautioned attorneys against doing anything that may delay the proceedings or trigger the need for a new trial years from now.
In his December 2024 order, Reeves mentioned the defendants awaiting sentencing. “They might be eager to get the DiBiase trial behind them, as it represents a major step toward finality in their own cases,” he wrote.
Days before trial, DiBiase retained an additional lawyer, Eric Herschmann, who is a former adviser to President Donald Trump and has defended retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre against civil charges in the welfare scandal, prompting the federal government to raise questions about a potential conflict of interest. Reeves ultimately allowed Herschmann to represent DiBiase.
Eighty people filed into the Thad Cochran U.S. Courthouse in downtown Jackson Tuesday morning for jury selection.
The federal government is accusing DiBiase – son of famed 1980s-era WWE heel Ted “The Million Dollar Man” DiBiase – of stealing more than $1 million in federal public assistance funds by using “sham contracts” with two nonprofit organizations that controlled the funds. 
On paper, the nonprofits hired the younger DiBiase’s companies to provide leadership outreach services, assess the need for emergency food assistance and create programs to help inner-city youth. He received payments upfront.
But prosecutors allege DiBiase did not provide, or intend to provide, those services. The 13 counts in the indictment include conspiracy, wire fraud, theft of federal funds and money laundering. The federal government also alleges he used the money to purchase a vehicle and a boat and to put a down payment on a roughly $1.5 million lakeside home in the Madison community of Reunion, which the federal government has since seized.
DiBiase’s lawyer refuted the government’s narrative in a 2023 interview with Mississippi Today, saying evidence shows the former pro wrestler did carry out work under the contracts and that DiBiase was free to use the money he earned through his fees as he wished.
The money came from two federal public assistance programs: the Emergency Food Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, which is best known for supplying the monthly “welfare check” to very low-income households. But Mississippi typically spends very little of its TANF funds on direct assistance to needy families.
The allegations in DiBiase’s criminal case deal with just a sliver of spending within a broader scandal. Auditors have questioned agency purchases totaling nearly $100 million from 2016 to 2020.
Indeed, the nonprofits unlawfully showered TANF funds on dozens of people or companies, according to audits and an ongoing civil lawsuit. 
Judge Reeves’ order hinted at a possible strategy by DiBiase’s defense: Using “testimony to illustrate how many other entities and persons” that the nonprofits “wrongfully sent TANF funds to.” 
In this order, Reeves was discussing the need for defense attorneys to avoid certain testimony because the law firm defending DiBiase had previously defended a separate character in the larger welfare case, posing a potential conflict.

But if the defense is interested in highlighting other improper TANF recipients, it wouldn’t need to mention that person or entity, Reeves wrote, since, “There are many other options available to them to land this blow with the jury.”
For DiBiase, participating in Mississippi’s welfare delivery model was a family endeavor. His father’s nonprofit ministry, Heart of David, and his brother Brett DiBiase also took part. The wrestling family secured nearly $6 million in federal grant funds, according to a forensic audit, under the leadership of former Mississippi Department of Human Services Director John Davis. 
Davis and Brett DiBiase, also a wrestler, pleaded guilty more than three years ago. Ted DiBiase Sr. has not been accused of a crime. All three DiBiase men are named in a separate ongoing civil lawsuit brought by the welfare department.
Davis had become especially close to the wrestlers during his tenure, text messages retrieved by investigators revealed. After the agency selected two nonprofits to run a multi-million dollar statewide welfare program called Families First for Mississippi, Davis then allegedly directed the nonprofits to pay his wrestling buddies in violation of federal law. In one instance, Davis got one of the nonprofits to pay $160,000 in TANF funds for Brett DiBiase’s four-month stay at a luxury addiction treatment facility in Malibu, California.

Davis and others may have believed they could get away with this kind of spending because the federal government barely checks what states do with TANF block grants. Across the nation, states have openly diverted more and more funds away from families in poverty. 
The federal government allocates nearly $90 million a year in TANF funds to Mississippi. “The headline figure is an illusion, though,” wrote Reeves, because in the most recent year on record, the state distributed just $4 million of that to needy families through cash assistance. 
The federal department tasked with overseeing state use of TANF funds is the Administration of Children and Families, or ACF, an agency under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But as Mississippi Today has reported for several years, that agency has almost no say over what states do with the money. State officials don’t have to spend a dime on the monthly “welfare check” if they don’t want to. Much of the money, instead, is spent on subgrants with organizations that claim to provide services such as parent initiatives, after-school programs or workforce development.
Favre, the most prominent celebrity in the scandal, allegedly helped steer subgranted TANF funds to construct a volleyball arena at his alma mater, the University of Southern Mississippi, as well as to an experimental pharmaceutical company that claimed to have found a cure for concussions. Favre is named in an ongoing civil suit, but he has not been charged with a crime.
Favre has denied any wrongdoing, saying he’d never even heard of the TANF program until more than two years after his projects began receiving the funds. 
“Importantly, I have learned that nobody was — or is — watching how TANF funds are spent,” Favre testified during a U.S. House committee hearing in 2024.

The federal government only requires that states provide a one-page spending breakdown using a number of vague categories, and the agency doesn’t do anything more to verify the accounting. If a state like Mississippi wants to fib, if it wants to describe the construction of a volleyball facility as “Fatherhood and Two Family Parent Formation,” “there’s no way to check that,” the federal agency’s former director told Mississippi Today years ago. 
Revelations from the Mississippi scandal have changed little on the national level. In fact, oversight at ACF has likely only taken a hit as the Trump administration has slashed positions in the agency, closing and consolidating the regional offices that exist to provide guidance to states on their administration of these funds.
New TANF rules proposed under President Joe Biden’s administration – which would have limited some non-assistance spending and finally allowed the federal government the power to determine if purchases were “reasonable” – were abandoned before Trump began his second term.
This all speaks to what the future holds for the TANF program. But what about the past?
There’s no debate that some federal TANF funds were misspent in Mississippi. Seven guilty pleas demonstrate as much. But the federal government has not sent one person to prison or forced the state to repay a dime.
Back in 2020, during Trump’s first term, HHS officials confirmed to Mississippi Today that the state would have to repay any stolen or misspent TANF funds using state dollars. In other words, it could not use federal TANF money to pay the clawback. 
Four years later, Biden’s appointed ACF leadership sent a letter to Mississippi demanding repayment of $101 million. The letter was always expected to serve as a starting point for negotiations. The federal government would allow the state to provide documentation to prove some purchases were lawful in order to whittle down the amount the state must return. 
During Trump’s second term, that penalty letter has been rescinded. The most recent letter from ACF in April said the agency “will issue a new penalty letter at the appropriate time.” 
This federal clawback process hinges in part on Mississippi Department of Human Services’ slow-moving civil lawsuit. The agency is still attempting to verify which TANF purchases were illegal, and recoup those funds, through a lawsuit against dozens of people or companies – sans at least eight lower-level defendants who settled their way out of the lawsuit. 
The department filed the lawsuit in 2022 and has spent roughly $2 million – in TANF funds – on outside attorneys. 
A handful of those defendants, such as Jacob Black, were employees of the very agency bringing the lawsuit. The former lawyer for the human services department is accused of crafting the lease structure officials used to fund the volleyball arena, skirting a federal prohibition against spending TANF on construction costs. For this, he has faced no criminal charges.
Most recently, defendants in the civil case took depositions of a former division director at the state auditor’s office, Stephanie Palmertree, who now runs her own firm that DHS has contracted with to provide expert testimony in the case. The welfare department has paid the firm $112,500, according to the state’s public expenditure database, but by Monday, the agency had removed Palmertree as its expert. No trial has been scheduled in the DHS case.
In another civil case that began in early 2023, Favre is still suing State Auditor Shad White for defamation. A trial is set for November 2026. Ted DiBiase Sr. also filed a defamation complaint against White in August. 
As for criminal consequences, the following people have pleaded guilty in connection to the scandal and await sentencing:

John Davis pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges in September 2022.
Nancy New pleaded guilty to state bribery and fraud charges in April 2022.
Zach New pleaded guilty to state bribery and fraud charges in April 2022.
Jake Vanlandingham pleaded guilty to a federal fraud charge in July 2024.
Brett DiBiase pleaded guilty to a state fraud charge in December 2020 and a federal conspiracy charge in March 2023.
Christi Webb pleaded guilty to a federal theft charge in March 2023.
Ann McGrew pleaded guilty to a state fraud charge in October 2021.

Another defendant originally arrested in 2020, Gregory “Latimer” Smith, underwent pretrial diversion, effectively avoiding prosecution. 
Only DiBiase is still fighting charges. 
It’s common for prosecutors to wait until the resolution of an investigation, or the conclusion of all cases, before sentencing. These defendants have agreed to aid the prosecution and may appear as witnesses. Their sentences could be contingent on their level of cooperation. 
And while the public waits for justice, more than $150 million in Mississippi TANF funds sit unused, according to the most recent federal data. 
Mississippi Today has reported on these federal reports for years, and while the figures in them fluctuate wildly, they conjure deja vu.
Since the scandal, Mississippi’s welfare department has tightened oversight of its TANF subgrants, instituting a competitive application process. It also successfully secured an increase to the monthly TANF benefit – raising the amount from $170 to $260 for a family of three – and adopted a “pass-through” that allows families to keep more of their child support dollars before the state recoups the rest. More recently, the agency has elected to transfer nearly $30 million a year in TANF funds to the state’s child care voucher, allowing that program to serve more working families. 
“The agency needs to be acknowledged for those efforts, too,” said Mark Jones, spokesperson for the human services department.
Still, the state is spending less of its TANF funds on direct cash assistance today than it did under the leadership of convicted felon Davis.
This can be attributed, at least in part, to the state’s stringent eligibility criteria for TANF set by the Legislature. The state also continues to use a large chunk of its block grant to fill holes at a separate agency, the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services. And nonprofits are still awarded five times more than poor families receive directly.

Though the monthly “welfare check” is administered under a program called the “TANF Work Program,” nearly 80% of the families on the program are “child only” cases, meaning no parent is receiving assistance or workforce training as part of the case. And fewer than 1,500 families receive the assistance each month. 
This is in a state where over 100,000 families live below the poverty line.
The “Mississippi welfare scandal” – nearing its sixth anniversary since initial arrests – has multiple possible definitions. 
Was the tragedy that a volleyball arena project, or a nebulous pharmaceutical startup, or a famous and wealthy athlete received TANF funds? Or that poor families didn’t?
Because in the case of the latter, the scandal endures.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/06120502/100116138569-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-06 13:11:41.628427

Miller,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2026/01/lamalfa-dies-vacancy/,"LaMalfa was known for his dedication to water access and forestry management, key issues for his largely rural district. His death leaves House Republicans with an even more precarious majority that could struggle to pass Republican legislation.","In summary
LaMalfa was known for his dedication to water access and forestry management, key issues for his largely rural district. His death leaves House Republicans with an even more precarious majority that could struggle to pass Republican legislation.


Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a fourth generation rice farmer and Republican who for the last 13 years represented much of California’s rural north in Congress, has died. He was 65.
His sudden death, confirmed Tuesday morning by House Republican leadership, further shrinks the party’s already razor-thin majority, which now stands at 218  following Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation this week. The GOP can now only afford to lose two members on any given party-line vote.
While President Donald Trump and House Republicans could consistently count on LaMalfa’s support for conservative priorities such as last year’s mega domestic policy bill, he never adopted the firebrand or antagonist persona that many of his colleagues preferred. 
Instead, LaMalfa developed a reputation as a pragmatic and affable member who prioritized water access and forestry management, key interests for his largely forested, fire-prone and agricultural-heavy district. It’s those issues that led him to staunchly oppose Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan that proposed to lump much of the rural north with parts of the far more urban and liberal San Francisco Bay Area.
Under California election law, Gov. Gavin Newsom has 14 days to call a special election to fill the remainder of LaMalfa’s current term. That election will take place under the existing congressional district lines, which stretch from much of the Oregon-California border through rural Shasta and Sutter counties, rather than the new Democratic-leaning district adopted after voters approved Prop. 50 in November.
That sets up a potentially confusing scenario for voters, as Newsom could set the special election to replace LaMalfa to coincide with the already scheduled statewide primary in June, which uses the new Prop. 50 maps. 
LaMalfa was known for his steadfast commitment to issues that affected his district. One tradition of his was to stake out the president after the State of the Union speech. In those precious few minutes, as the leader of the free world descended the dais and moved to exit the chamber, LaMalfa would make his legislative requests. As the Washington Post reported, after President Joe Biden’s final address, LaMalfa asked the president to force the U.S. Forest Service to speed up permits for cutting timber, telling the president, “We gotta cut some trees.” 
LaMalfa strongly opposed Prop. 50, framing the gerrymander as a significant loss of representation for rural Californians. At a press conference last fall, he stressed how much he loved representing the farmers, ranchers and other agricultural workers in his district, rattling off names of small towns such as Fort Goodwin and Cedarville, where he said he’s knocked on countless doors and held various town halls over the years. 
“I know where all those places are,” LaMalfa told the handful of reporters gathered in the Butte County Farm Bureau lodge. “Do you think that’s going to happen when people from Cedarville, Modoc County, are lumped in with people from Sausalito and Marin County?”
It’s possible that LaMalfa’s successor won’t be sworn in for several months, depending on when Newsom calls the special election and whether any candidate receives 50% of the vote. If not, voters will have to cast ballots in a runoff election. 
“Whoever runs for it is literally going to be a congressman for a month,” said Paul Mitchell, the primary architect of the Prop. 50 districts. He noted that even though a Republican would likely win the special election, “there’s no reality that they’re going to win the Prop. 50 map.”
He noted that House Republicans would benefit from uniting behind a single candidate to avoid a runoff, whereas Democrats would likely prefer to keep the seat open as long as possible. 
Neither of LaMalfa’s Democratic challengers, state Sen. Mike McGuire and Chico State Professor Audrey Denney, immediately said whether they would run in a special election.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/081124_LaMalfa-TownHall_SO_CM_31.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 12:58:57.383658

(Photo courtesy of Revolution Wind)Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general in legal filings Monday asked to consolidate their federal lawsuit against the Trump administration with a separate complaint lodged by the developers of the Revolution Wind project. 
Both lawsuits were initially filed in the wake of an Aug. 22 stop work order from federal regulators on the 65-turbine project, then 80% complete south of Rhode Island’s coastline. Both complaints sought court intervention — the developers in D.C. and the AGs in Rhode Island — to bar the Trump administration from what plaintiffs argued was an unconstitutional overreach of federal authority on the 704-megawatt wind project.
The developers’ case progressed more quickly, with Senior Judge Royce Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granting a preliminary injunction on Sept. 22 temporarily barring federal regulators from interfering with the project. The AGs’ case languished in Providence with no court order until being transferred to D.C. in early December.
The two complaints remained on separate trajectories when the U.S. Department of Interior issued a second suspension order on Dec. 22, forcing Revolution Wind, and four other area projects, to press pause for 90 days. 
Revolution Wind developers seek second court order against Trump administration

By Jan. 1, Revolution Wind LLC, a partnership between Danish renewable energy company Orsted A/S and a consortium of other companies led by Skyborn Renewables, replied with a flurry of new court filings asking for a second preliminary injunction. The new submissions reprised many of the same arguments of the original case: The Trump administration’s latest move was “arbitrary and capricious” with significant financial, economic and environmental consequences for the companies if work did not resume quickly.
The project was 87% complete when the second suspension was handed down, with 58 of 65 turbines built and offshore installation on track to be completed by mid-February. Since Dec. 22, the project developers estimate they are losing $1.44 million a day, with a projected $6 billion loss and risks of broken contracts if they cannot resume work by Jan. 12, according to court filings.
Rhode Island and Connecticut stand to suffer major losses, too, underscored in the lawsuit filed by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong.
The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity is enough to power 350,000 homes across both states, with the 400 megawatt share directed toward Rhode Island representing one-fifth of the state’s electricity needs, according to a Jan. 5 affidavit from Chistopher Kearns, the state’s acting energy commissioner. The renewable energy infusion is critical to meeting mandated state emissions reductions under the 2021 Act on Climate Law, and to smoothing seasonal fuel supply and price fluctuations across the regional grid.
“Any significant impact to this project, including but not limited to the loss of the 704MW load, would have grid reliability risks to Rhode Island and New England,” Kearns wrote.
The project has already employed more than 1,000 union laborers in Rhode Island, including 200 on standby amid the second pause. And even after Rhode Island’s first major wind project is up and running, other area projects will rely on the Ocean State’s workforce expertise and upgraded ports to assist in their own construction and operations.
“Revolution Wind’s investments have continued to catalyze infrastructure upgrades at ProvPort and the Port of Davisville, and positioned Rhode Island as a leader in attracting global ocean economy companies,” Kearns wrote.
The AGs have asked Lamberth to rule on their request to consolidate their case with the Revolution Wind developers by Wednesday. They are also seeking to join the developers’ motion for a second preliminary injunction, with a hearing scheduled in Lamberth’s D.C. courtroom on Monday, Jan. 12.
Meaghan Wims, a spokesperson for Orsted, declined to comment in an emailed response Tuesday.  
Matthew Nies, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, which is representing the Trump administration in both cases, declined to comment in an emailed response Tuesday. However, Justice Department attorneys previously argued that the AGs’ case should be transferred to D.C. and consolidated with the Revolution Wind developers lawsuit.

It shows, two law professors explained, that the nation has worked hard to move on quickly from the events of that day — perhaps too fast.
“This is true in Michigan and around the country, that the people who were involved really at any level of the effort to steal the election,” said Quinn Yeargain, a professor of the law of democracy at Michigan State University, “every single person, for the most part, with some notable exceptions like Rudy Giuliani, have largely managed to evade consequence for their actions, and have just resumed doing what they were doing before, or have come into greater positions of power.” 
“By not having consequences, it sort of entrenched that that was an acceptable thing to think and do,” he added. “And to the extent that we’re able to unravel this mess, I think that there definitely has to be consequences, whether they’re political, criminal, legal, for people who have facilitated all of this and committed crimes along the way.”
Samuel Bagenstos, a professor of law at the University of Michigan who worked in the Biden administration, said that he understood the desire to focus on other pressing issues, not least the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But he also called it “fundamentally a mistake” to not have also addressed the Jan. 6 attacks with the same urgency.

GPO-J6-REPORT 
“Our elected leaders decided that they wanted to move on from this challenge to democracy, and what that meant was it created a space for January 6 to become just another contested issue between the parties,” Bagenstos said. “And so instead of coming together to defend our democracy and our Constitution, what we have is now just division over this as every other issue in the United States between the parties.”
Michigan had a central part to play in the election denialism that led up to the events of Jan. 6, 2021, as one of the key swing states that eventually voted against Trump to lead Joe Biden to victory. But those involved in the attempts to deny and overturn the election here in Michigan have, following national trends, avoided significant consequences. 
Analysis: What we now know about Michigan’s pivotal role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection

Michigan’s alleged “false electors,” who attempted to cast the state’s slate of electoral votes in 2020 for Trump, had their charges dismissed in September by Lansing 54-A District Court Judge Kristen Simmons, who said that there was not sufficient evidence to prove that those who allegedly signed the documents had criminal intent. That decision came after one of the alleged electors, James Renner, testified in court following a cooperation agreement that led to charges against him being dropped.
All 16 of the alleged false electors were also pardoned in November by Trump in sweeping pardons of over 70 individuals nationwide — though those federal pardons would not apply to the state-level charges that they had faced, which Attorney General Dana Nessel has indicated her office is reviewing. 
Yeargain said state laws are not set up to deal with these kinds of prosecutions. 
“The dismissal of the indictment against people involved in Michigan’s fake electors scheme really shows that and generally the difficulties that state level prosecutors have had in bringing some of these charges,” Yeargain said.
Among those pardoned were former Republican National Committeewoman Kathy Berden and former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Meshawn Maddock. Others remain in elected office: Amy Facchinello sits on the Grand Blanc Board of Education, while Kent Vanderwood serves as the mayor of Wyoming, and Stanley Grot was re-elected as the township clerk in Shelby Township in 2024. And both Maddock and Kenneth Thompson are county co-chairs on the U.S. Senate campaign for Mike Rogers, who has himself cast doubt on his own electoral loss in 2024.
Screenshot of post dated 12/14/20 from Meshawn Maddock’s Fakebook page
Meanwhile, Matt DePerno, a lawyer facing felony charges of election tampering during the 2020 election, is running for Michigan Attorney General in 2026. DePerno was nominated by the Republican Party in 2022 for the same race, losing to incumbent Dana Nessel by nearly 10 points, but is seeking another shot at the seat.
The lack of consequences for those who participated in the Jan. 6 riots and the surrounding attempts to overturn the election, has set the stage for Trump’s second term in many ways, Yeargain and Bagenstos both agreed.
“I don’t know how to disaggregate January 6 itself from Trump’s second term,” Yeargain said. “In many ways, I think that the pillaging of the federal government that has taken place in the past year has really been January 6, part two.”
But while Michigan was at the center of the election denialism movement in 2020 and 2021, Bagenstos said that the larger failures were on the federal level — specifically, Congress’ failure not to immediately impeach Trump and hold a Senate trial. 
“It was this idea by the leadership that what we needed to do was move on and let the temperatures cool,” he said. “What that did was give Donald Trump and the people around him who had engaged in this violent scheme to seize power and not give up power, gave them the opportunity to regroup and to start to plot to return to power.”
As for whether consequences will come in the future for those who took part in the attempts to overturn the 2020 election, “That must be the case,” Yeargain said. “There must be that kind of reckoning. If we are to maintain as a democratic republic with any sense and semblance of constitutional meaning, there must be.”

In November, OU psychology junior Samantha Fulnecky filed a formal claim of illegal discrimination after receiving a zero on an essay on gender stereotypes in which she cited the Bible as her sole source, later published by The Oklahoman.
The instructor, Mel Curth, said in her grading comments the paper did not follow the assignment and was at times “offensive.” In the essay, Fulnecky wrote that the “lie that there are multiple genders… is demonic and severely harms American youth,” as well as “lies spread from Satan.”
Curth was placed on administrative leave during the university’s investigation and was later relieved of all instructional duties at the investigation’s conclusion — a decision Curth is appealing, according to a Bluesky post from civil rights attorney Brittany Stewart.
OU claimed Curth’s grading of the paper was “arbitrary.” It did not release the findings of the investigation into Fulnecky’s religious discrimination claim, and the grade appeal was decided in her favor.
The petition, which has 24,571 signatures as of Monday afternoon and is addressed to OU President Joseph Harroz, demands OU:

“OU’s decision to place the instructor on administrative leave following a routine grading dispute — a decision it has yet to adequately explain — and subsequent failure to defend her from harassment and discrimination, including reported death threats, raises serious concerns about the University’s commitment to educational standards, academic freedom and instructor safety,” the petition reads.
OU’s Faculty Handbook pulls its definition of “academic freedom” from the AAUP:
“As teachers, faculty members encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students,” the policy reads. “They hold before them the best scholarly and ethical standards of their discipline. Faculty members demonstrate respect for students as individuals and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and counselors. Faculty members make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to ensure that their evaluations of students reflect each student’s true merit.”
OU-AAUP President Michael Givel said the university’s actions open a “can of worms” for academic freedom and scholarly integrity.
“There’s a crisis at OU,” Givel said. “… are there concrete standards, in terms of academic integrity, scientific values, scholarly research? Or do instructors and anybody else have to worry about somebody who doesn’t like their grade claiming they’ve been discriminated against based on, supposedly, religion?”
Givel said the AAUP chapter wants clarity on the university’s response process for student discrimination complaints — a process he said is not in writing.
The case has drawn backlash from all sides. In November, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt posted on social media, calling for the OU Board of Regents to review the investigation. National publications have taken notice. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the incident “intellectual rot in higher education.”
In December, hundreds of supporters gathered at OU’s Norman campus to protest Curth’s suspension.
Fulnecky has since spoken to media outlets and at a recent event hosted by local conservative group Original Constitutional Principles Affecting Culture.
“I was asked to give my opinion, and I gave my opinion,” Fulnecky said at the event. “I’ve gotten 100% on every essay I’ve written in that class.”
Punitive measures for universities are also making their way to the state Capitol. Last week, Rep. Gabe Woolley (R-Broken Arrow) filed House Joint Resolution 1037, which would grant the legislature the authority to freeze, suspend or withhold up to 100% of state-appropriated funds recommended for allocation to a higher education institution within the Oklahoma State System for Higher Education. If approved, the measure would be placed on a statewide ballot.
OU did not return a request for comment on the AAUP’s petition. Givel said his organization will decide what it will do next if the university does not respond to the demands.

The Wyoming Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that the state’s two abortion bans are unconstitutional, preserving a hotly contested right amid a push by legislators to end the practice in the Equality State.
In a 4-1 decision, the court agreed the bans conflict with a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution that protects individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions. That amendment, ironically, was enacted by voters after a push by conservatives in the same Legislature that’s since made repeated attempts to curtail abortion.
Ballot initiative to end Idaho’s abortion ban has more than 50,000 signatures, group says

“A woman has a fundamental right to make her own health care decisions, including the decision to have an abortion,” the ruling states.

“The State did not meet its burden of demonstrating the Abortion Laws further the compelling interest of protecting unborn life without unduly infringing upon the woman’s fundamental right to make her own health care decisions. As such, the Abortion Laws do not constitute reasonable and necessary restrictions on a pregnant woman’s right to make her own health care decisions.”
The ruling represents a victory for abortions rights advocates in one of the nation’s reddest states. They contend abortion bans conflict with the state’s long history of skepticism toward government involvement in medical and other personal decisions.
For abortion opponents, the decision is a bitter setback that suggests an abortion ban would require changes to the Wyoming Constitution — a more difficult hurdle than a simple majority vote in the Republican-dominated statehouse.
 Republican push to end abortion in Wyoming came after fall of Roe v. Wade

Wyoming’s once vaunted live-and-let-live political ethos for years thwarted legislative attempts to restrict abortion. That began to change in the years before the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed abortion rights in the U.S. since 1973.
In early 2022, Wyoming lawmakers passed a trigger law that banned abortion with Roe’s fall. But that ban did not go into effect due to a court challenge that centered, in part, on Wyoming’s 2012 constitutional amendment.
In 2023, Republican lawmakers in the Legislature tried again, this time succeeding in passing two abortion bans. One was a fairly comprehensive prohibition that included only a few notable exceptions, such as in the case of rape or incest. A second law banned medication in abortions — the first law of its kind in the nation.
A group of abortion providers and advocates challenged the constitutionality of the bans, and Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens temporarily blocked them as the case played out.

Finally in November 2024, Owens ruled the bans were unconstitutional. The state, which was represented by the Wyoming Attorney General’s Office, appealed the decision to the Wyoming Supreme Court. The justices heard arguments on the case in April.
In the meantime, Wellspring Health Access in Casper has provided abortions for women in Wyoming and neighboring states. The facility was targeted by an arsonist before it opened and later became a plaintiff in the legal challenges to the growing number of abortion restrictions passed by state lawmakers, including mandatory ultrasounds and a 48-hour waiting period passed earlier this year.
Justice Kari Gray was the dissenting vote in the case while Justice John Fenn authored a concurring opinion. Meanwhile, retired Justice Kate Fox participated in the case’s consideration and decision since she heard the case, per state law and the Wyoming Constitution.

(Getty Images)Nearly 92% of Indiana’s high school seniors graduated in 2025, setting the highest graduation rate on record, the Indiana Department of Education announced Monday.
“Today’s record-high graduation rate is a testament to the hard work of Indiana’s students, families, and educators,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a news release.
“While high school graduation marks the end of a student’s K-12 journey, our schools play an essential role in preparing students for all that comes next, whether that’s going to college, starting a career, or joining the military,” he continued. “This strong improvement in our state’s graduation rate shows that when we focus on academic excellence and establish clear, personalized pathways, our students thrive.”
The 91.83% graduation rate bested the 90.23% record set in 2024 by 1.6 percentage points.
It represents the third straight year of post-pandemic improvement kicked off in 2023, when 88.98% graduated. Seniors recorded a decade-low graduation rate of 86.65% in 2022.

“As we continue to scale the new Indiana diploma and readiness seals statewide, we will not only strengthen the value of high school and help more students graduate, we will ensure that they are prepared to succeed in whatever path they choose for their future,” state Education Secretary Katie Jenner said.
Numerous student populations improved in the results released Tuesday.
Almost 87% of Black students graduated in 2025, up 3 percentage points from the previous year, along with nearly 90% of Hispanic students, in a boost of 2 percentage points. White students improved to 93%, or by about 1.5 percentage points, and their multiracial classmates logged a graduation rate of 88%, up by 1 percentage point.
Seniors learning English, receiving free and reduced-price meals, and in special education also graduated at higher rates than the year prior — but still lagged their native speaker, paid lunch and general education peers.
The rate of students who graduated without waivers additionally cleared 90%. Students who do not complete or pass some graduation requirements can still qualify for a diploma if they demonstrate knowledge or skill.
The waivers are intended to help students with special circumstances, like those who’ve transferred to a new school or who have attempted to pass competency tests at least three times.

State education and policy leaders have for years sought to lower dependence on waivers, including by setting caps on the percentage of graduation waivers that can be counted toward a school’s state and local graduation rate. They took effect with the 2024 cohort.
Non-public schools outperformed their public counterparts by about 1 percentage point — 93% versus 92% — but the differences between traditional public and public charter schools were not reported. In the 2024 results, about 93% of students at traditional public schools graduated as opposed to just 59% of students at public charter schools.
Indiana’s federal graduation rate increased, almost hitting 90% compared to 2024’s 89%. The rates are calculated differently because of differences between state and federal accountability models, according to IDOE.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)When I heard my former student Mike was suspended after shoving and injuring my 2nd grade student, Eddy, as they got off the bus at the start of a recent school day, I wondered if I could repair what had been done, providing an outcome that would make a positive difference in the lives of these boys.
Could I mediate a conversation between them so that Mike, now in middle school, understood the gravity of what he did? Could I help ensure Eddy felt safe around older students?
Buoyed by the idea of using restorative practices, which separate the deed from the doer and shift the focus away from punishing Mike to address and fix the harm that was done, I asked my school administrators and the boys’ families if Mike could spend time in my classroom as a tutor and mentor to Eddy.
The powerful connection that grew between the boys as a result of this extra effort gives me so much hope.
Across the country, including schools around Pennsylvania, projects are underway to turn traditional student discipline models on their heads. Why? It’s all about encouraging appropriate behavior by bringing students into the collaborative process to resolve the issues.
A recent study by the University of Chicago Education Lab found that schools that implemented restorative practices saw proactive changes in students’ behaviors—including an 18% decrease in suspensions—with many youth experiencing a stronger sense of belonging.
In 2023, Representative Anthony Bellmon introduced bipartisian legislation that reflected this growing body of research and would have embedded conflict resolution instruction into both coursework and educator training. The bill, which didn’t pass, was meant to ensure students develop skills such as mediation, effective communication, emotional regulation, and relationship-building by equipping educators with sustained professional learning to put these practices into action in our schools.
Restorative practices and  more robust teacher training are important strategies that go beyond what is included as student supports in Pennsylvania Statute.
Here’s why:
First, they are a more effective and sustaining way to address discipline. Suspension, which pulls students away from their classrooms and learning, doesn’t always help them see the bigger picture of how their behaviors affect others. After the incident, Eddy was hesitant to be anywhere near Mike. However, as I supported them, each boy had a role to play as they worked together. Eddy became more relaxed; feelings of safety and trust replaced his uncertainty as they built a mentor-mentee relationship. Meanwhile, Mike got a “little brother” out of the deal.
Another reason for employing restorative practices is that it teaches students collaborative skills. With Mike’s support, Eddy, who struggled with reading comprehension, became more confident to ask questions of me and his peers when he struggled to understand what he read. For his part, Eddy’s calm nature forced Mike to slow down, which helped him be more patient and understanding while also strengthening his confidence in his abilities as Eddy’s reading tutor. And the time they spent together encouraged conversations outside of academics. Soon Mike and Eddy were singing songs they both liked.
Just as important, restorative practices help students work through conflicts, giving students tools to engage with each other during disagreements and empowering them to use their voice and become part of change.
During the last week of school, as the students walked to their bus, Mike playfully pulled Eddy into a hug and ruffled Eddy’s hair. Eddy was full of smiles and giggles. I was near enough to overhear their conversation: “Eddy, I’m sorry for what I did to you. I don’t know why I did it. If I could take it back, I would.”
The Latin root for discipline is discere which means “to learn.” Restorative practices are a tool that educators can use to teach students how to navigate their social world. Let’s bring it into schools across Pennsylvania so that students like Mike and Eddy can move beyond punishment and into a place where they belong and get along.

Free.,Death of US House member from California narrows already slim GOP majority,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/death-us-house-member-california-narrows-already-slim-gop-majority,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. California Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa has died and Indiana Republican Rep. Jim Baird was injured in a car accident, President Donald Trump said Tuesday. Speaking to a meeting of House Republicans at the Kennedy Center, Trump said he wanted to express “our tremendous sorrow” following LaMalfa’s death and said the congressman was “a fierce champion on California water issues.”“I also want to send our best wishes to Congressman Jim Baird and his wife, who are recovering from a car accident. They’re going to be okay. But they had a pretty bad accident,” Trump said. “And we’re praying they get out of that hospital very quickly. He’s going to be fine. She’s going to be fine. But it was a bad accident.”The cause and timing of LaMalfa’s death were not immediately clear on Tuesday morning. It will reduce Republicans’ already slim House majority, making it more complicated for leadership in that chamber to pass legislation that’s not bipartisan. Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation earlier this week, combined with LaMalfa’s death, decreases the GOP majority to 219 seats. Baird’s absence until he recovers and can vote in person further erodes that to 218. And it could be narrowed even more by GOP lawmakers missing votes for other reasons. Democrats control 213 House seats, giving Republican leaders next to no margin for defections on partisan bills. LaMalfa, 65, was first sworn in as a member of Congress in January 2013 and represented California’s 1st Congressional District, which covers a large section of the northeastern corner of the state. Baird, 80, has been a member of Congress for seven years, representing Indiana’s 4th Congressional District constituents in the central and northwestern parts of the state. Baird’s office released a statement shortly after Trump’s announcement, saying the congressman ""is in the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery, and he is extraordinarily grateful for everyone’s prayers during this time. “Congressman Baird looks forward to continuing his work on behalf of Hoosiers. The Office of Congressman Baird will continue to provide services and support for those who need it. Congressman Baird and his office remain steadfast in their commitment to serving constituents and focused on advocating for Hoosiers at the highest levels of government.”Johnson, Jeffries mourn LaMalfaSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., released a statement saying that “Congress is devastated to learn this morning about the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa.” “Doug was a lifelong resident of northern California and deeply loved its people. He was as fierce of a fighter for his state’s vast natural resources and beauty as we have ever known,” Johnson wrote. “We are mourning the loss of our friend and brother today and we send our respects for his life and work to his wife Jill and the LaMalfa family during this difficult time.” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York wrote in a statement that he joined “people across Northern California in mourning the untimely passing of Congressman Doug LaMalfa. “Doug and I joined the Congress as classmates in 2013, and it was an honor to witness firsthand his passion and personal resolve for more than a decade,” Jeffries wrote. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., released a written statement that he was “devastated to hear of the passing of my dear friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa.”“A fourth generation rice farmer, he fought passionately for the region’s agricultural community and small businesses, and in 2024 was elected Chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, which focuses on the priorities of Western and rural America,” Scalise wrote. “He also worked to bolster disaster recovery efforts and funding for rural schools.”National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson of North Carolina wrote in a statement that he was “deeply saddened by the passing of my colleague and close friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.” “I cherished our time serving together on the Agriculture Committee and discussing NASCAR; he was a real gearhead and motorsports fan,” Hudson wrote. “I will deeply miss my ‘amigo.’ Renee and I are praying for his beloved wife Jill, as well as Kyle, Allison, Sophia, Natalie, and all his loved ones, friends, and staff during this incredibly difficult time.”",,,,2026-01-06 11:58:46.502630

Tim Walz ending his reelection campaign in light of alleged widespread fraud in the state’s social services programs, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, who is also a Republican candidate for governor, is now seeking an audit of the Great Lakes state’s child care programs.
Nesbitt, of Porter Township, on Jan. 2, issued a letter to Michigan’s Auditor General Doug Ringler asking his office to take a look into the Michigan Child Development and Care Program housed in the relatively new state Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement and Potential, or MILEAP. While the program began in 2018, it moved to MILEAP when Gov. Gretchen Whitmer created that agency in her second term via executive order.
A message seeking comment from the department was not returned at the time of publication.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ends campaign for third term

The senator and gubernatorial candidate wrote that he wanted Ringler to take a deeper look into the program in light of what was happening in Minnesota.
Reporting from Michigan Advance’s sister publication, the Minnesota Reformer, shows that Walz, a Democrat who was the 2024 vice presidential nominee, faced headwinds after national Republicans learned about the wide-scale fraud in Minnesota’s social services programs during Walz’s tenure. That includes the Feeding Our Future scandal, in which fraudsters pocketed hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars intended to feed children during the pandemic, the Reformer reported.
It has also been reported that the national attention to Minnesota’s issues was driven by a right-wing YouTuber specifically directed to various day care centers by that state’s Republican Party.
In his letter to Ringler, Nesbitt noted that Michigan’s program is intended to assist low-income families with the cost of child care and has received more than $540 million in taxpayer support this year. 
“The lack of affordable child care is one of the greatest challenges facing families in Michigan,” Nesbitt wrote. “As such, every tax dollar lost to fraud or waste makes it even more difficult for law-abiding Michiganders to get the child care they need.”
Nesbitt also said the audit was important because of what he viewed as previous oversight failures from the Whitmer administration.

Trump […]","The Nevada State Republican Party posted this picture on social media after party chairman Michael McDonald, center, and five other Republicans signed a fake certificate in December 2020 falsely claiming that Donald Trump had won the 2020 presidential election in Nevada that Trump lost to Joe Biden.Nevada State Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald and the five other 2020 fake presidential electors from Nevada – James DeGraffenreid, Duward James Hindle III, Jesse Law, Shawn Meehan and Eileen Rice — must be celebrating today in observance of the violent attempt to overthrow an election by storming the U.S. Capitol five years ago.
Trump attorneys instructed McDonald, DeGraffenried, et al. to meet in Carson City in December 2020 and pretend Trump had won the presidential race in Nevada, even though old Joe Biden beat Trump fair and square.
Due to the patent absurdity of not only the McDonald-led cast of characters but also their empty election fraud claims, their tawdry little ceremony on Dec. 24, 2020, was mostly brushed off at the time as just another exhibition of Trump-inspired quackery.
And yet the plot to steal the election, and the January 6 insurrection that ensued, rested on the existence of fake electors from Nevada and six other states. That’s why Team Trump instructed Nevada’s fake electors to put on their pathetic little show and then send fake electoral certifications to Congress.
Under the scheme crafted largely by Trump lawyer John Eastman, Vice-president Mike Pence, while overseeing the electoral vote count, would accept the fake certificates from Nevada and other states as grounds to declare the election results in dispute and either not count them or throw the election to the House of Representatives to determine the election outcome. Under either scenario, Trump would have been declared the winner of the election he lost.
Of course it turned out Mike Pence had at least an ounce or two of something wholly undetectable in the likes of Trump, Eastman, or McDonald: patriotism. If you’ll recall, according to Trump’s followers that day, patriotism is an offense punishable by hanging.
McDonald is still the chair of the Nevada State Republican Party, and the party has an astounding preponderance of weak candidates and failed campaigns to show for it.
The most — only — high profile victory by a Nevada Republican in a competitive contest over the last ten years was Joe Lombardo’s win over former incumbent Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak in 2022. Upon securing the nomination, Lombardo’s campaign tried to get as little of Trump, or the Nevada Republican Party, on their candidate as possible, and Lombardo won  despite the state party, not because of it.
But the Nevada Republican Party’s considerable fecklessness notwithstanding, under McDonald’s leadership, it can always be relied upon to diligently and faithfully put Trump’s interest ahead of Nevada’s.
Like fake electors in other states, McDonald et al. were indicted. Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford literally could not have been slower in bringing the indictments, only to have a court rule Ford filed the case in the wrong jurisdiction. The Nevada Supreme Court overruled that decision in November, and the case is scheduled to finally be heard next month.
In 2023 the Nevada Legislature passed a law clearly and specifically outlawing fake electors. Perhaps remembering that his political career could be ended with a single social media post from Trump, Lombardo vetoed it.
Trump pardoned the 1,600 lawless insurrectionists on the ground in Washington on Jan. 6. He also pardoned the fake electors in Nevada and the other states who made it all possible. But Ford’s charges are state, not federal, so Trump’s pardon of Nevada’s electors was nothing more than a minor red meat media hit for the base.
Meanwhile, Ford hopes to be the Democratic nominee for governor against Lombardo this year. So maybe Ford will slam Lombardo for vetoing the bill to outlaw fake electors.
Then again, maybe not.
Five years after the insurrection, the most glaring thing about Nevada’s fake electors is the degree to which the state, including many of its elected officials — Republican and Democrat alike — have sought to ignore them, or if that’s not possible, then to normalize them, effectively succumbing to Trump’s attempt to deny and rewrite history.
And now, ironically thanks to a Nevada electorate whose votes Trump and Nevada’s fake electors tried to nullify five years ago, we’ve got the president to show for it.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fake-electors-bordered.jpg,,,2026-01-06 11:58:46.502630

According to a news release, a traveler from South Carolina who has been diagnosed with measles spent a night in Albuquerque, with potential exposure to others between 11:45 p.m., Dec. 28 and 7 a.m., Dec. 29 at the Quality Inn (450 Paisano St. NE).
The health department said anyone who stayed at the Quality Inn during that time period should check their vaccination status; report any symptoms in the next three weeks to a health care provider; and stay home if symptoms develop. Those symptoms include: fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes followed by a spotted rash that begins on the head before spreading to the rest of the body. People can pass measles on from four days before and after the rash begins.
“This situation reminds us there continue to be active measles cases across the United States,” NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. “The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine remains the best protection against measles.”

Wyoming Supreme Court rules two bans passed by state lawmakers are unconstitutional.
The post Abortion remains legal in Wyoming after state high court strikes down bans appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that the state’s two abortion bans are unconstitutional, preserving a hotly contested right amid a push by legislators to end the practice in the Equality State.
In a 4-1 decision, the court agreed the bans conflict with a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution that protects individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions. That amendment, ironically, was enacted by voters after a push by conservatives in the same Legislature that’s since made repeated attempts to curtail abortion.
The ruling represents a victory for abortions rights advocates in one of the nation’s reddest states. They contend abortion bans conflict with the state’s long history of skepticism toward government involvement in medical and other personal decisions.
For abortion opponents, the decision is a bitter setback that suggests an abortion ban would require changes to the Wyoming Constitution — a more difficult hurdle than a simple majority vote in the Republican-dominated statehouse.
Wyoming’s once vaunted live-and-let-live political ethos for years thwarted legislative attempts to restrict abortion. That began to change in the years before the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed abortion rights in the U.S. since 1973.
In early 2022, Wyoming lawmakers passed a trigger law that banned abortion with Roe’s fall. But that ban did not go into effect due to a court challenge that centered, in part, on Wyoming’s 2012 constitutional amendment. 
In 2023, Republican lawmakers in the Legislature tried again, this time succeeding in passing two abortion bans. One was a fairly comprehensive prohibition that included only a few notable exceptions, such as in the case of rape or incest. A second law banned medication in abortions — the first law of its kind in the nation.
A group of abortion providers and advocates challenged the constitutionality of the bans, and Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens temporarily blocked them as the case played out. 
Finally in November, Owens ruled the bans were unconstitutional. The state, which was represented by the Wyoming Attorney General’s Office, appealed the decision to the Wyoming Supreme Court. The justices heard arguments on the case in April. 
In the meantime, Wellspring Health Access in Casper has provided abortions for women in Wyoming and neighboring states. The facility was targeted by an arsonist before it opened and later became a plaintiff in the legal challenges to the growing number of abortion restrictions passed by state lawmakers, including mandatory ultrasounds and a 48-hour waiting period passed earlier this year.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-06 16:06:20+00:00,CT Mirror,HHS bars Head Start providers from using ‘women’ and ‘race’ in grant applications,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/hhs-bars-head-start-providers-from-using-women-and-race-in-grant-applications/,A coalition of organizations said in court filings that Trump officials told a Head Start director in Wisconsin to cut over a dozen terms from her application.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is telling Head Start providers to avoid dozens of terms in federal grant applications, including “race,” “belonging” and “pregnant people” — a directive that could reshape the early education program.
A coalition of organizations representing Head Start providers and parents said in court filings last month that the Department of Health and Human Services told a Head Start director in Wisconsin to cut those and over a dozen other terms from her application. She later received a list with nearly 200 words the department discouraged her from using in her application, including “Black,” “Native American,” “disability” and “women.”
President Donald Trump’s administration associates the terms with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which it has vowed to root out across the government.
The guidance could lead Head Start centers to preemptively drop anything that could be seen as fitting the administration’s definition of DEI, said Ruth Friedman, who led the Office of Child Care under President Joe Biden.
“Grantees are sort of self-selecting out of those activities beforehand because of fear and direction they’re getting from the Office of Head Start that they can’t do these important research-based activities anymore that are important for children’s learning and that are actually required by law,” Friedman said.
The filings came in a lawsuit filed in April by parent groups and Head Start associations in Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other officials. They allege the Trump administration is illegally dismantling Head Start.
The plaintiffs say the administration is trying to force providers to change how they operate in violation of the Head Start Act, which requires directors to provide demographic information about their families, a task that becomes difficult if they are banned from using “Black,” “disability” and “socioeconomic.”
Health and Human Services officials said they do not comment on pending litigation.
Head Start centers receive the bulk of their funding from the federal government. The long-standing preschool and family support program serves babies, infants and toddlers who come from low-income households, foster care or homeless families.
Plaintiffs’ attorneys say the anti-DEI guidance has generated confusion for Head Start programs, which are operated by nonprofits, schools and government agencies. The grant application itself contains many of the banned words, asking directors to include demographic data about their community that includes estimates of the number of pregnant women and children with disabilities.
“This has put me in an impossible situation,” the unnamed Head Start director in Wisconsin wrote in the court filing. If she complies with the Head Start Act and includes the banned words in her application, she could end up losing her grant, she said. But if she follows the Trump administration’s guidance, she said she fears she’ll face penalties for violating the law down the line.
Another Head Start, located on a Native American reservation in Washington state, was told to cut “all Diversity and Inclusion-related activities,” leading it to drop staff training on how to support autistic children and children with trauma, according to the court filing. Officials there also told the director that she could no longer prioritize tribal members for enrollment — even though the Head Start Act expressly permits this. The word “Tribal” is among the disfavored terms.
For some, the new grant application rules are another attempt to undermine Head Start, a program with a history of bipartisan support that some conservatives have been attacking as problematic and ineffective.
“They don’t believe these public programs should actually be open to serving all communities,” said Jennesa Calvo-Friedman of the ACLU, an attorney for the plaintiffs. The effort to ban words from applications “is a way to gut the fundamentals of the program.”
Not long after Trump took office, his budget chief unsuccessfully tried to halt all federal grants, saying they needed to be reviewed to root out any DEI efforts. Head Start was not supposed to be part of the freeze, which was quickly reversed, but in the months afterward, grantees reported problems drawing down their funding. Some had to briefly close.
The Government Accountability Office later said the delays violated the Impoundment Control Act, which limits when the president can halt the flow of government funds.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dims.apnews-1-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-06 11:12:19.146688

The state has the nation’s fourth-highest per capita population of Native Americans, and about one in ten of the residents in its second-largest city — Rapid City, gateway to Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills for millions of annual visitors — are Native American.

Native-led tourism alliance launches ‘economic catalyst’ tours on reservations

It’s the site of the Wounded Knee Massacre, but also the American Indian Movement of the 1970s and its occupation of Wounded Knee. More recently, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe drew international attention to protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline just north of the South Dakota border and etched the phrase “Water is Life” into the cultural lexicon.
Those tribal ties help draw tourists. A survey from South Dakota Tourism in 2018 found that around 80% of visitors want a Native American “experience” during their stay. Yet the state’s nine tribal nations typically don’t see much from the billions in economic impact that tourism delivers to the state.
The South Dakota Native Tourism Alliance formed in 2019 to help bridge that divide. The nonprofit organization trains tour guides, plans tribal tour itineraries and works to develop tourism infrastructure in tribal communities.
Recently, it secured one of 10 J.M. Kaplan Innovation Prize awards, earning it $175,000 and connecting it with other early stage nonprofits across the U.S. for collaboration and guidance.
South Dakota Searchlight recently spoke with Rhea Waldman, South Dakota Native Tourism Alliance’s executive director, and Sarah Kills In Water, a Rosebud Sioux tribal member and member of the group’s board of directors.
EDITOR’S NOTE: The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What can you tell us about what you’ve done so far? Can you give us an update on your economic catalyst tours?
Kills in Water: We worked with Destination America and developed multi-reservation tours, a multi-day tour that started in the Black Hills. They came through Pine Ridge, spent two days on Rosebud and went up to Standing Rock. They ended up marketing that itinerary to a company called Trafalgar, which operates heavily in South Dakota. So that was one major win.

Our tour guide training came up out of a need for another initiative that we worked on, helping the Sicangu Oyate Treaty Council and the Wild Foundation host the Wild 12 conference last year. They brought in people from all over the world, and they wanted to hear from our youth on questions like “How is the mining in the Black Hills going to impact your youth for the next seven generations, for the foreseeable future?” 
So we went to engage with the Sicangu Youth Council, and they jumped on the opportunity. They provided a tour experience for a group of 50 international visitors at Bear Butte State Park. The kids were excited, and they were wanting to expand and do more, and so I brought them into my Trafalgar itinerary this year. They actually do the tours on Rosebud when Trafalgar comes through. 
What’s lacking in the tourism landscape today that your organization aims to improve upon?
Kills In Water: The cultural piece is so important. Having these experiences with us, provided by us, told in our voices, our stories, everything, it makes it more personal, and I think it brings the realization to our visitors that these people are still here. After all the years of government oppression and everything that’s been done to them, they’re still here, and they’re still vibrant.
Tribal people sometimes have a really bad idea when they think about tourism. They think we’re selling our culture, but that’s not what we’re doing. All we’re here to do is help tribal nations define what stories they want to tell. What do you want to share with your visitors? 
Waldman: South Dakota Tourism has been a great partner for us, and really helped us, because obviously they have a lot of data. One of those data points is that over 80% of people want to have a Native American experience when they visit South Dakota. Not even half of them actually do, though. So why don’t they do that? It’s because people don’t know where to go, where to find information.
What are the hidden gems that are already there that you point people to? 
Waldman: Every tribal nation has their own gems. The tribes along the river have some of the most beautiful scenery you can imagine. Cheyenne River has one of the biggest buffalo herds in North America. There are cultural centers that have phenomenal art, that are showcasing local artists and the breadth of the history that Native Americans have experienced.
One of the challenges comes when you think about the great American road trip. When you’re on Interstate 90 between Sioux Falls and Rapid City, none of the reservations really are right there. I live in Pierre, and even though we’re the state capital, it is actually hard to get people out here. It’s because we are 35 miles from the interstate, so it takes you at least an hour and a half to travel there and back. So how much can you see here in order for people to come? That’s even worse for the reservations, because they are not the capital, and people don’t necessarily know all the things they can do. 
What is it that this grant in particular might help you do? 
Kills in Water: The nine tribal nations in our state are so geographically spread out. We don’t always have the resources to get out and go to these tribal nations ourselves. I live in Rosebud, and unless there’s gas money or something tied to it, sometimes I can’t just go to Flandreau. Pine Ridge is close enough where I can volunteer my time, because they’re only an hour and a half from us. With these funds, I see us increasing our partnerships with each tribal nation and really strengthening our efforts that way at the grassroots level.

Waldman: The grant is unrestricted, and that is huge. We’re all aware of travel reimbursement after the fact, but if you’re living in a place where you’re maybe living paycheck to paycheck and you don’t have a thriving business yet, waiting for travel reimbursement can take a while. If you do something like gift cards for gas, that is definitely not something that you can reimburse with federal grants.
And we’re not only getting money. There are 10 different organizations that receive this innovation grant, and we are meeting with them frequently. We can learn from those other amazing entrepreneurs. In addition, the entire team at the JM Kaplan Fund are there to help us succeed, because they know they are funding early stage nonprofits. They’re there with us every step of the way. Yes, money is great and we still need more, but having people that rally for you, that are there for you, that are your family and want to see you succeed, that is really special.

(Courtesy photo)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger announced on Tuesday morning that long-time educator Jeffrey Smith would be Virginia’s next secretary of education.
The Richmond Times-Dispatch first broke the story about the announcement, as the next administration prepares to shape education and other areas of state governance for the next four years.
Smith has over 32 years of experience in public education, including 15 years as a superintendent. He led Hampton City Schools for eight years and served seven years as superintendent in the Town of West Point. He now leads the Virginia Air and Space Science Center. 
Spanberger appoints former state education secretaries to transition team

“As a mother of three daughters in Virginia’s public schools, I understand the importance of making sure Virginia’s students are set up for success and the invaluable foundation that the Commonwealth’s schools provide for our next generation of leaders,” said Spanberger in a statement. “Dr. Smith’s decades of experience leading districts in Virginia gives the Commonwealth’s students a champion who I know will work tirelessly on their behalf — and I’m excited to work alongside him to strengthen our schools.”
Once confirmed by the General Assembly, which will be under Democratic control in the House and Senate, Smith will guide education agencies and key state learning institutions, including the Virginia Department of Education, the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, museums and cultural institutions, and boards and foundations.
His career also includes work in several Virginia school divisions and teaching roles at Old Dominion University and William and Mary. 
In 2020, the Virginia General Assembly recognized Smith for his service and academic achievements during his time with Hampton City Schools, among other local, state, and national recognitions. Smith was one of four finalists for AASA National Superintendent of the Year and recipient of the Virginia Department of Education’s Mary Peake Award for Education Equity.
While at Hampton, Smith was involved with two notable accomplishments:  strengthening the division’s dual-enrollment program with the Virginia Peninsula Community College and expanding career pathways at the Academies of Hampton.
“It is an honor to serve as a member of Governor-elect Spanberger’s administration. I strongly support her Strengthening Virginia Schools Plan,” Smith said in Tuesday’s announcement. “Together, we can advance a vision for a Commonwealth that is stronger, safer, and more affordable for all Virginians, ensuring that every learner has the opportunity to achieve and succeed.”
Spanberger will be inaugurated in Richmond on Jan. 17, replacing Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who cannot run for a second consecutive term.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann at separate events on Monday said they plan to push for legislation this year to make it easier for K-12 students to attend schools outside their home districts. 
Hosemann, the Republican president of the Senate, said he wants a more measured policy tailored to public schools. White, the Republican leader of the House, is pushing for a more comprehensive package of policies commonly called “school choice.” 
Hosemann said at a Stennis Institute of Government Capitol Press forum that he wants the Senate to pass a measure to ease restrictions for students to attend public schools outside their districts. 
Mississippi has a very limited version of this policy already, commonly called “portability.” Students can attend schools outside their district, but the receiving and the home districts both have to agree to the transfer. 
Now, Hosemann is pushing his colleagues to remove the requirement that the home district must approve a transfer. 
“I think that’s something arcane and needs to be removed,” Hosemann said. “Where you don’t have the ability to hold a student back who wants to leave and go to another school.” 
Hosemann also said he is pushing the Senate to pass a bill that would raise salaries for K-12 teachers, as well as community college and university professors. 
White on Monday afternoon conducted a press conference in his Capitol office but blocked Mississippi Today from attending. Multiple media outlets provided audio of the press conference to Mississippi Today. 
The first-term speaker also favors legislation that would make it easier for students to transfer to other public school districts But he said on Monday that he will also advocate for legislation for taxpayers to pay for 10,000 or 15,000 students to attend any school in the state, including private schools. 
These programs are referred to as “vouchers” or “education savings accounts” in other states. Families can apply for public tax dollars to pay for education outside of traditional public schools, including homeschooling. Some of these programs are universal, meaning any student can apply. Others are limited by income or group. Mississippi has had an education savings account program for students with disabilities since 2015.
White proposed Monday that of the available slots, lower-income students who come from families making up to 300% of the median income level would receive priority. 
“The slots will be limited,” White said. “And we will receive half of the slots only for current public school kids, and the other slots will be available for any and all students in the state.” 
The speaker also said he will push for legislation to reform Mississippi’s charter-school application process, including allowing charter schools to open in any area of the state. Current state laws only allow charter schools to open in school districts with a D- or F-rating.

The Republican primary field is already crowded, featuring House Speaker Lisa Demuth; MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell; 2022 GOP nominee for governor Scott Jensen; state Rep. Kristin Robbins; and perennial candidate Kendall Qualls, who recently won a straw poll of delegates in the GOP State Central Committee. 
Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who is running for U.S. Senate, said in a statement Monday she is focused on the Senate race and will not run for governor. Former U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips said on X that he has no intention to run for governor. 
Primary elections are on Aug. 11. 
Here are some potential Democratic candidates for governor: 
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar

Amy Klobuchar has represented Minnesota in the U.S. Senate since 2007, and has handily won each of her re-election campaigns since, though the margin of victory has narrowed over time, perhaps reflecting political changes here and nationwide. In 2024, she outperformed presidential candidate Kamala Harris by more than 5 percentage points. 
A source close to Klobuchar, who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said, “Sen. Klobuchar is getting outreach from people encouraging her to run, and is seriously considering it.”
Klobuchar ran in the Democratic presidential primary in 2020 but dropped out after performing poorly in early contests after some withering national press scrutiny. She wound up endorsing former President Joe Biden just before Super Tuesday.
The senior senator previously served as Hennepin County attorney, where she brought high-profile charges. That could give her a platform to talk about the public program fraud that is expected to continue to dominate the political conversation in the coming months.
Secretary of State Steve Simon

Steve Simon has been the state’s top elections administrator since 2015, among the other duties of the secretary of state. For more than a decade prior, Simon represented a west metro House district in the Legislature. 
During his time in office, Simon has battled against election misinformation among the public and high-ranking elected officials. He has refused to comply with Trump administration requests for voter rolls, calling the requests unconstitutional. 
At the 2022 state DFL convention, Simon spoke briefly about how his great-grandfather, a Lithuanian Jew, wound up in America. 
“He didn’t just emigrate to America. He fled. He fled discrimination and persecution. He was what today we would call a refugee. The year before he left for America, Jews in the Russian empire lost the right to vote.” 
Simon announced in December he would seek a fourth term as secretary of state.

Keith Ellison represented Minneapolis in Congress for 12 years before winning a narrow election to become the state’s top legal officer in 2018. In 2022, he won re-election by less than 1 percentage point. 
Ellison was the first Black person elected to statewide office and the first Muslim elected to any statewide office in the United States.
As attorney general, Ellison has taken on cases against gun manufacturers, TikTok and negligent landlords. He is part of a cohort of blue-state attorneys general that is fighting the Trump administration in the courts, suing dozens of times on a range of issues including funding cuts, trans athlete bans and immigration status checks in federal programs. 
Ellison said in October he would seek a third term as attorney general.

She received a BA in Art from Elmira College, in Elmira New York where she met Larry.  She completed an MA at the College of Saint Rose. After graduating she began her teaching career at the Bement school in Deerfield, Mass. and continued at the Montessori School of Albany.  After a series of international adventures in the late 1970’s (midnight crossing from East Berlin through Checkpoint Charlie, and in Britain, a mistaken identity as a member of the Baeder-Meinhof gang) and travel (Britain, Holland, Germany) she married Larry to move to Montréal.
After three years in Québec, both were ready to return to the States, and they chose to move to Burlington, Vermont area where they made their home for the past 40 years. Martha taught Art at Richmond Elementary School for 10 years. She had a second career teaching basic skills to adult learners and New Americans at Vermont Adult Learning.
Martha was predeceased by her parents Elizabeth (Baggerly) and Paul Colyer.
She leaves her husband Larry Keyes, his brother Philip and Phil’s wife Laura and their children, Tor and Christopher. She leaves her sister Nancy Buckley and her Nancy’s children Peter, Elizabeth, David and Sarah and eight grand nieces and nephews. She also leaves her cousins Joanne, Betty, Liz and Andrea.
Martha and Larry were married for 43 years, and were together for much of 10 years prior to getting married. For Larry, Martha was his “Lebensgefährtin”, “the person with whom I traveled through life”. 
Martha has many life-long friends from childhood and from teaching.  Many are far away, but she maintained a regular correpondance with cards, calls and emails. Margaret Sansone, Michéle Dominy, Cassie Keith, Leslie Knauf, Carmine Sargent, Lee Hollister and many others.
The family would like to thank the staff of the University of Vermont’s Cancer Center, and UVM Hospice. A very special thanks to Margaret Sansone… who with Larry, took loving care of her during her last days.

(Photo provided by SC Department of Motor Vehicles)COLUMBIA — When getting new license plates, South Carolina residents can choose — at no additional cost — to brag about the state’s role in winning the Revolutionary War.
Department of Motor Vehicles offices across the state began offering the commemorative plate last week as one of its two standard options, coinciding with this year’s 250th anniversary of the country’s founding.
The tag replaced the decade-old, blue-and-white plate with the state’s motto, “While I breathe, I hope,” printed above a Palmetto tree. Those license plates will remain valid until their expiration date, according to the DMV.
As per state law requiring the switch, the American Revolution tag will remain the state’s regular plate through December 2032, the 250th anniversary of the British completing their evacuation of occupied Charleston, which ended the war in the Carolinas.
Drivers can still opt for the license plate reading, “In God we trust,” with an American flag and Palmetto flag flying.
The new plate, which is nearly identical to one available by request since Jan. 1, 2022, includes an illustration of Sgt. William Jasper retrieving Fort Sullivan’s flag during the Battle of Sullivan’s Island in 1776. As the British Royal Navy bombarded the fort, Jasper grabbed the fallen flag, replaced its pole with a cannon gunner’s staff, and replanted it.
Known as the Moultrie Flag, it’s depicted on the license plate with a white crescent in one corner — copying the original flag — and the word “LIBERTY” in all caps across the bottom, which didn’t exist on the flag 250 years ago.
The only difference between the new, standard plate and the 2022 special plate is the words across the top.
The plate available for the last three years read, “250 Year Anniversary Revolutionary War.” The new one reads, “Where the Revolutionary War Was Won.”
After success at State Fair, SC250 considers how to show exhibit year-round

“It’s recognizable, and it’s one of those things where, if it’s not broken, don’t fix it,” said Molly Fortune, executive director of the SC250 Commission.
The change in wording to take credit for the nation’s independence was a late addition by the state Senate in the legislation signed by Gov. Henry McMaster last May. Senators pointed to the more than 200 skirmishes and battles fought in the state, including multiple significant fights, in proposing the tagline, which passed both the House and Senate unanimously.
Historians cite the decisive Patriot victory at South Carolina’s Battle of Cowpens in 1781 as laying the groundwork for the surrender at Yorktown in Virginia nine months later. Thomas Jefferson called the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780 “the turn of the tide of success.”
Rep. Neal Collins, an Easley Republican and the law’s main sponsor, has seen some debate online about the accuracy of calling South Carolina the place the war was won, since the final major land battle took place hundreds of miles away. That discussion is a good thing, he said.
“Hopefully that’ll get people to crack open a book or ChatGPT it and get some answers,” Collins said.
As long as people are learning about the state’s role in the Revolutionary War, the plates are serving their purpose, said Collins, who also proposed the 2021 law creating the previous special plates.
South Carolina has plenty of Revolutionary War stories, much like the other states involved, Collins said: “It’s just that over the years we haven’t marketed it as well.”
Much of the celebration for the country’s sestercentennial will center around July 4 to mark the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, but that “was really just sort of a beginning of an era,” Collins said.
The 2022 plates are still available upon request. Unlike other specialized plates, which show off emblems for businesses, nonprofits and universities, the special Revolutionary War plates are available at no additional cost, according to the DMV.
There are 1,667 of the 2022 special license plates in circulation, said DMV spokesman Mike Fitts.

(Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Jordan Chessher senses an urgency surrounding an effort to increase the criminal penalties in Kansas for child endangerment.
Fatal and near-fatal cases involving children across Kansas have stuck with him “because warning signs were missed, oversight failed or the law lacked the strength to intervene early and decisively,” he wrote in a Dec. 20 open letter to news outlets.
A bill filed in the Kansas House ahead of the 2026 legislative session may address his concerns. House Bill 2412 seeks to increase penalties for people convicted of child endangerment or aggravated child endangerment if their crimes involve children younger than 6 years old.
Chessher is the cofounder of Project Heaven, a Wichita-based grassroots group advocating for legislative changes to prevent child abuse. He said the bill, if passed into law, could save children’s lives.
“This legislation is not about punishment alone — it is about deterrence, accountability, and prevention,” he said.
Child endangerment applies when a person “knowingly and unreasonably” allows a child younger than 18 years old “to be placed in a situation in which the child’s life, body or health may be endangered,” according to state law. Aggravated child endangerment applies to the same situation but when a person recklessly causes or allows a child to potentially be placed in danger.
Typically, those situations involve drug manufacturing or use.
For children younger than 6 years old, the bill proposes upping child endangerment from a misdemeanor to a felony.
Sara Hortenstine, executive director of the Kansas State Child Death Review Board, said the board consistently has found that infants and young children are at heightened risk for serious injury and death.
That’s often because of their developmental stage, physical dependency on their caregivers, and a limited ability to seek help and protect themselves, she said.
“Recognizing this vulnerability helps ensure accountability is proportionate to the level of risk and dependency involved and supports enhanced safeguards for very young children,” Hortenstine said.
The review board sits within the Kansas Attorney General’s Office and acts as a citizen panel responsible for gauging whether state and local agencies are adequately protecting children by reviewing every child death in the state. The results of the board’s evaluation are published in an annual report.
The board’s most recent report examined deaths that occurred in 2023. Of the 361 children who died in Kansas in 2023, a toxicology screening was performed for 180 of them. There were 24 detections of marijuana, 16 of fentanyl and nine of alcohol, according to the report.
Nearly half of the 221 sleep-related sudden, unexpected infant deaths in Kansas between 2019 and 2023 involved a parent or caregiver with a history of substance use. In 12 instances, a caregiver was under the influence at the time of a child’s sleep-related death, the report said.
In more than half of all child deaths during that time period, a parent or caregiver had prior or current involvement with child protective services, according to the report.
The board outlines each year a series of public policy recommendations to improve child death investigations, enhance data collection and prevent future child deaths. Many have reappeared year after year. Modifying child endangerment statutes was not one of the recommendations featured in the 2025 report, but Hortenstine said the bill enhances legal protections for young children.
Rep. Ken Collins, a Republican and convenience store owner in Mulberry, filed the bill on Dec. 10.
In 2024, a high-profile, unlicensed day care incident led to permanent medical conditions for then-4-month-old Benny Cannon in Pittsburg, near Collins’ district.
Two day care attendants who left Cannon alone in a bouncer were sentenced earlier this year. One pleaded guilty to aggravated battery, two counts of child endangerment, aggravated child endangerment, marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia possession, according to court records. She served 60 days in jail and was given 18 months of probation along with mandatory substance use treatment and restitution payment requirement. The other pleaded guilty to three counts of child endangerment, served 30 days in jail, was given 18 months of probation and must pay restitution.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Statehouse-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 09:58:46.251936
,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-06 14:13:35+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Mass. insurer of last resort wrestles with thorny questions around affordability,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/environment/mass-insurer-of-last-resort-wrestles-with-thorny-questions-around-affordability/,"Now, after the FAIR Plan saw its largest single-year jump in 2024 in new enrollees in two decades, the plan will need to decide this year whether it wants to raise the rates it charges — something that hasn’t happened in 20 years.","MASSACHUSETTS MAY BE faring better than other states in riding out turbulence in the home insurance industry, but its insurer of last resort is being forced to confront the affordability of its own coverage amid a reckoning across the state over the high cost of living. 
Rising home insurance prices around the country and in New England, driven by increasing climate risk and higher rebuilding costs due to inflation and tariffs, are accelerating the FAIR Plan’s next critical juncture. 
Already, the FAIR Plan’s premiums have gone up 11 percent between 2019 and 2023 even without a rate hike, and last year it increased the amount of coverage new policyholders are required to purchase. 
Now, after the FAIR Plan saw its largest single-year jump in 2024 in new enrollees in two decades, the plan will need to decide this year whether it wants to raise the rates it charges — something that hasn’t happened in 20 years. 
“This is the tension between getting everybody insurance and what that costs,” said Charlie Sidoti, a former insurance executive who now serves as executive director of the Cambridge-based nonprofit InnSure, which works with insurers and communities navigating climate risk. “Either way, people are screwed. If the premiums provide the coverage people need in case disaster strikes, but they can’t afford it, that causes strain. If the coverage is inadequate but affordable, there’s a protection gap that could really hurt people and whole communities during the next catastrophe event.” 
Last year, the FAIR Plan, which provides home insurance for those unable to get it in the private market, launched a new requirement to raise the amount of coverage new policyholders must purchase. Those enrollees must now buy insurance that covers at least 90 percent of the reconstruction cost of their home, up from 80 percent.  
Frank O’Brien, the FAIR Plan’s general counsel, said in an interview that most other private insurers now also require coverage of at least 90 percent of the reconstruction cost and “we didn’t want to be inconsistent with the marketplace.” 
That reflects a growing tension: whether the insurer of last resort should continue to be both widely available and affordable amid rising prices and nonrenewals from private insurers. While being so accessible would help more people get needed coverage, it could also concentrate risk within the FAIR Plan among coastal properties, which are most vulnerable to severe damages from flooding, high winds, and other forms of extreme weather.  
Such a scenario would disproportionately saddle the FAIR Plan with massive losses should a major storm hit Cape Cod and Plymouth and Bristol counties. Those areas now account for 55 percent of all FAIR Plan enrollees. 
O’Brien said the decision to raise the amount of coverage new enrollees must purchase was essentially made with these tradeoffs in mind.  
“We made that change because we were growing,” he said. “And one of the concerns is that when you have a large and growing residual market, which is what the FAIR Plan is, that’s a sign that the market is not as healthy as it should be. Our ability to do things that would slow growth down is pretty limited. One of the things that we looked at, however, was this requirement. It’s not a good thing when somebody’s under-insured — when something bad happens, they get the check and can’t go rebuild their house with it.” 
The next decision in the FAIR Plan’s hunt for the affordability sweet spot will be more dramatic and impact far more people. 
A two-year ban on the FAIR Plan being able to file for a rate increase will lift in March. Any rate changes would need approval from the state division of insurance, and the FAIR Plan agreed to the two-year prohibition in 2024 as part of a package of reforms it made in coordination with regulators.  
O’Brien declined to say whether or not the plan would request a rate hike, saying that “we’re constantly evaluating where we are in the marketplace” and that it “depends on a lot of circumstances” like the plan’s costs and claims.  
The last time the FAIR Plan filed for a rate increase, in 2013, the insurance division denied it. A rate increase would likely impact all policyholders within the FAIR Plan and would be a recognition that the base cost of coverage is going up due to a higher potential for climate-driven disasters and increased repair costs. 
The churn at the FAIR Plan, accelerated by a spike in enrollment in 2024 and the expiration of the ban on a rate increase, shows how the insurer of last resort is navigating a time of change in the industry. 
The Bay State, though, is in a better spot than others. A number of private insurers remain competing for business in Massachusetts, unlike in states like California and Florida, where several companies exited altogether in the wake of catastrophic wildfires and hurricanes that prompted dramatic spikes in enrollees in their insurers of last resort. 
And the 11 percent increase in FAIR Plan premiums in Massachusetts between 2019 and 2023 is still far lower than other states’ insurers of last resort, including the 393 percent jump in California, the 116 percent spike in Georgia, the 735 percent increase in Louisiana and the 18 percent hike in Rhode Island.  
Insurance in the private market is also likely more expensive since the FAIR Plan last raised rates in 2006, though premiums have gone up in the plan despite rates remaining flat because of increases both in the risk for individual properties and of property values over time. 
One tweak that the Massachusetts FAIR Plan made years ago struck right at the heart of the tug-of-war over affordability for homeowners now versus ensuring they can rebuild later in the event of a major loss – and it’s stirring controversy today. 
In 2019, the FAIR Plan changed wording in its manual for agents and brokers that required homeowners to purchase insurance based on their home’s reconstruction cost, which is more of a “worse case scenario” of what it would take to rebuild a replica of a home after a loss, including demolition or debris removal and higher labor and material costs.  
Buying insurance based on the reconstruction cost can be more expensive than buying it based on the replacement cost, which doesn’t take those factors into account, but could offer a more accurate representation of the price of rebuilding a home after a disaster and thereby grant the homeowner better protection. (The FAIR Plan’s policy terms for home insurance, however, references replacement costs as the level to which a home must be insured.) 
Frank Lombard, a Chicopee-based independent insurance adviser, has complained to the FAIR Plan that that switch in wording paved the way for what he views as unnecessarily high insurance costs for policyholders above what the policy terms require, according to emails viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.
For two of Lombard’s clients, according to valuation documents, the difference between the replacement cost and reconstruction cost of the homes was roughly $193,000 and $644,000, respectively. The disparity between purchasing insurance based on the replacement cost and the reconstruction cost, then, would account for the significant increase in premiums those clients shouldered, he argued. 
Lombard said he has no doubt private insurers are following the same practice. The difference, he said, is that people enrolled in the FAIR Plan have nowhere else to go for coverage. 
“They’re inflating the amount of coverage that’s required,” Lombard said in an interview. “In some cases, these are retired people, or elderly households. It’s not fair.” 
O’Brien denied that that change had any impact on the premiums people are paying, arguing that the FAIR Plan treats those terms as interchangeable. He pointed to policy language that states the plan will “repair or replace” the damaged home after a loss, which O’Brien says essentially renders moot any difference between the terms. Premiums, he added, can change for any number of reasons. 
There’s some divergence among insurance experts about whether the wording in the agent’s manual would have an impact on the amount of coverage provided and the corresponding premiums that homeowners pay. 
Tristan Hormann, executive director of the Washington state FAIR Plan, said replacement and reconstruction costs are, in his experience, used interchangeably, especially when there is the “repair or replace” clause in the policy like there is in Massachusetts. 
Chris Stark, executive director of the Massachusetts Insurance Federation, said although the reconstruction cost is generally a more specific value that incorporates more of what it would cost to rebuild a damaged or destroyed home, the disparity in definitions between the terms could look different in practice: In many cases, Stark said, the two values may be similar. But the reconstruction cost of a historic Victorian-style home could be much higher than the replacement cost of that home, for instance, since there could be a large difference in costs between simply building a new home of similar square footage and building that home with today’s prices with identical Victorian style and materials. 
Still, even if it costs more to maintain coverage based on the reconstruction value, the homeowner gets more in return, he said. 
“This is likely a balance of solvency and ensuring the proper coverage for homeowners by the FAIR Plan, as was the decision to require more coverage for new policyholders, and eventually any decision to raise rates will be one, too,” he said. “We always have to balance solvency with consumer protection. In this instance, you actually are getting more protection for these changes.”  
And the FAIR Plan’s choice to use the reconstruction cost value in determining the coverage offered and the corresponding required premium is emblematic of the insurer’s larger tensions, Stark said. The plan is trying to keep insurance affordable in an era of soaring premiums while raising the level of protection for homeowners so they can be made whole should disaster strike and ensuring that the plan has the capital it needs to cover that risk and pay those claims, he added.  
“All of this is about addressing the delta that people have between what they are insured for versus what it would cost to get that home back into its pre-loss condition,” Stark said. “It’s a careful balance of having consumer access to affordable and available insurance products while at the same time making sure that they’re not risking their solvency. Collectively, these are all various decisions that help maintain that balance as much as possible with affordability always in mind, especially for the insurer of last resort.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Climate_Flooding_House_Lowell.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 09:58:46.251936

People are trickling in for lunch, served every weekday to Missourians 60 and older for an optional donation. One person asks about the soup of the day, while another donates a stack of Sunday papers. There are coupons for baby formula inside, she explains, in case anyone has family who could use them.
“Seniors need socialization,” said Diana Asher of Holts Summit, who has been attending the lunches a few times a week since moving from California in June. “Most people are busy. Seniors tend to end up alone at home one way or another, even if they have a spouse.”

Rebecca Nowlin, CEO of Aging Best, said the nonprofit, which is central Missouri’s area agency on aging, was able to keep offering all of its services throughout the 2025 federal government shutdown. But to cope with delayed reimbursements, it instituted a hiring freeze and expanded the waitlist for home chore services.
Funding delays during the shutdown forced other area agencies on aging to also cut back services or furlough staff, causing lasting harm to the agencies and the older Missourians who rely on them, agency leaders said.
Now Missouri’s 10 area agencies on aging are facing more uncertainty. Federal funding for the Older Americans Act, currently sustained by the same legislation that ended the shutdown in November, is set to expire on Jan. 30. 
“These are dollars and funds which for more than 50 years have been stable funding in the community to help seniors with day to day needs, so that they don’t have to go into a nursing home,” said Anneliese Stoever, director of the St. Louis Area Agency on Aging.
The federal law, enacted in 1965, established a national network of area agencies on aging to connect older Americans with services to help them stay safe and healthy in their homes. 
In Missouri, those services include free or subsidized home-delivered and community meals, transportation to medical appointments, to buy groceries or visit family, home modifications like grab bars and relief for family caregivers. 
All agencies have now been reimbursed for services they offered while Congress was deadlocked, said Lisa Cox, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which administers state and federal funds for the agencies. 
Cox said in an email to The Independent that the federal government has always come through with funding for the agencies.
“This has happened in the past, and funding has always continued,” Cox said. “There has been no cut to the funding to date.”
But since it takes four to eight weeks for funding to be processed at the federal and state levels after a shutdown, some agencies have only recently been reimbursed for services they provided while Congress was deadlocked.
Stoever said at the end of December that the agency was “just now receiving the dollars that are flowing as a result of the last government shutdown.”
And as agencies fight to build up their cash reserves to protect against future funding delays, some services haven’t resumed.
Most Thursdays since the end of October, there have been no weekly hot meals at the Cameron Lunch Club Senior Center.
Penny Crawford, CEO of Young at Heart Resources, the area agency on aging for northwest Missouri, said the group meals it hosted in Cameron attracted 60 to 70 people before the shutdown.
Now the Cameron senior center only serves lunches when there’s a private donation — like when a client donated $1,000 to fund a Thanksgiving lunch, complete with turkey, mashed potatoes, green bean casserole and pumpkin pie.
“She said, ‘I have to have my Thanksgiving meal here. It’s the only way I get Thanksgiving,” Crawford said. “So she [got] everyone a Thanksgiving meal, and she got to be with people.”
 Home and community-based services

Stacy Morse, executive director of the Missouri Council on Aging, said that by improving health outcomes among older Missourians, services provided by the agencies save the state money and reduce stress on rural hospitals. 
Morse added that stable Older Americans Act funding is crucial in addition to short-term sources of federal investment, like the Rural Health Transformation Program passed by Congress this summer as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Missouri has been awarded more than $216 million for fiscal year 2026 through the program, one of five potential years of funding. With the money, Missouri proposed expanding a pilot project called ToRCH, or Transformation of Rural Community Health, that put six rural hospitals in charge of local health initiatives and enabled medical and community providers to get Medicaid compensation for a broader range of preventative services.
Morse said that in order to take advantage of a future outcome-based Medicaid payment system, Missouri needs reliable support for services that keep people healthy.
Cheryl Lee, of Lamar, Missouri, for years received meal and grocery deliveries from the Region X Area Agency on Aging. Services from the agency enabled her to die at home instead of in a nursing home (photo submitted).
“We need the Older Americans Act money to support home and community-based services in order to make the ToRCH program successful,” Morse said.
Nowlin said staff of area agencies on aging, including Aging Best, are experts in connecting clients with services in their communities.
“I don’t think anybody else out there probably has the expertise of some of our people,” Nowlin said. “If you call us, they know who to talk to.”
Jennifer Shotwell, CEO of Region X Area Agency on Aging in Joplin, said meal and grocery deliveries are the only way some older Missourians can access nutritious food, especially in rural areas.
Shotwell said Cheryl Lee, a client from Barton County, for years depended on meals and groceries from the agency. The agency even delivered food for her cats.
Where she lived, outside of Lamar, Shotwell said, “they don’t have delivery. They don’t have DoorDash, no Uber.”
“We did our job,” Shotwell said, “because she passed away at home where she wanted to be and not in a nursing home.”
Morse said these services provide a lifeline to older Missourians who use them.
“Just think, for one day, what that would be like to not have access to food,” Morse said, “to not have access to transportation, to not have anybody to help you, whether it’s to open your medicine bottles or take you to the bathroom to get cleaned up.”
 Funding stress

Even without federal disruptions funding has not kept pace with increased costs and demand as Missourians age, said Julie Peetz, executive director of the Missouri Association of Area Agencies on Aging.
“I had one [agency leader] tell me recently, ‘I don’t have any more rabbits to pull out of my hat,” Peetz said. “I just can’t do more. There’s no fallback anymore.”
The total state and federal funding Missouri’s agencies received increased by only 15% from fiscal years 2019-2024, from $40.8 million to $47.1 million, according to data provided to The Independent by the association, though there were spikes due to supplementary funding during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Cox, the spokesperson for the state’s health and senior services department, said about 71% of Missouri’s funding for the agencies for fiscal year 2026, or $30.1 million, comes from the federal government. 
The agencies have begun to benefit from a state tax on insurance premiums passed by Missouri lawmakers in 2019 to help fund home and community-based services. But that new funding stream was intended to supplement existing funding sources, not replace federal contributions.
Shotwell said that during the shutdown, her agency could only keep offering lunches at its six senior centers thanks to private donations and loans from several city governments.
“I couldn’t keep assuming expenses if I had no idea when we were going to be reimbursed,” Shotwell said.
Shotwell said the agency, which serves Barton, Jasper, Newton and McDonald counties, has had to place about 40 people on a wait list for home-delivered meals.
Crawford’s agency, which serves 18 northwestern counties, furloughed half of its staff and halved its in-home services. The agency cut its program to help clients navigate Medicaid eligibility recertifications and paused transportation services.
Peetz said some furloughed staff quit.
“They’re not going to wait around a month or two months to see if they’ll have a job,” Peetz said.
Between staff losses and services that were cut, Peetz said the shutdown did “permanent damage” to agencies “and most of all to the clients.”
Stoever said her agency, one of two in Missouri that are part of a local government, was able to sustain its services throughout the shutdown partly through support from the city of St. Louis. Most agencies in the state are nonprofits.
The agency collaborated with the antipoverty and disaster relief organization Convoy of Hope to distribute 965 cases of food across 10 senior center food pantries to meet heightened demand due to the pause of monthly food benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, Stoever said. 
About 22% of Missouri’s 1.1 million residents 65 or older receive SNAP benefits, according to the state’s Department of Health and Senior Services.
As a result of the delays in federal benefits, Stoever said, the agency delivered 3,325 emergency meal boxes in November.
 Lasting effects

Agency leaders said they are adjusting their financial planning in anticipation of more frequent funding delays. 
Stoever said that due to funding uncertainty, she’s had to tell contractors and community partners that while she doesn’t anticipate cutting their funding in the coming fiscal year, she can’t increase it either. 
Shotwell said her agency is trying to increase its cash reserves, aiming to have six months in the bank rather than three. 
“Previous to this shutdown,” she said, “if I had more than three months’ worth of my expenses in the bank, I’m doing a horrible job as a nonprofit. My job is to turn dollars into services to help older adults live independently and with dignity.”
But Shotwell said the shutdown — along with inflation and increasing labor costs as Missouri has increased the minimum wage — have demanded a “paradigm shift.”
Shotwell said she is “constantly chasing grant money and fundraising” to accumulate carryover funds.
But that won’t ultimately be enough, she said.
“We can’t keep up the pace we’re at without an investment in the [Older Americans] Act,” Shotwell said.
Morse said it isn’t sustainable for Congress to keep funding area agencies on aging through temporary spending measures, called continuing resolutions. 
“We need to stop this continuing resolution business and get a budget so that [the agencies] have some defined numbers and stability,” she said.
Nowlin said that even though reimbursements from the shutdown have come through, Aging Best is still being careful with funds.
They haven’t lifted the hiring freeze yet. And the agency has plans to install a permanent LED sign in front of the new senior center, but it’s had to wait.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, speaks at an Aug. 4, 2025, news conference in her Anchorage office. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)It was an eventful year in national politics, and Alaska’s senior senator was often in the spotlight for bucking the Republican Party or the Trump administration.
She sat down with veteran Alaska reporter Nathaniel Herz of the Northern Journal to reflect on the last year and look forward into 2026 — in a conversation that ranges from federal funding for public broadcasting to Alaska’s 2026 U.S. Senate election to transboundary mining.
The Alaska Beacon is republishing this edited transcript of their conversation.
Nathaniel Herz: Have you seen these t-shirts yet, with this quote from you?
Lisa Murkowski: I’m looking at it. What is it? Oh, yeah. It says, ‘What’s woke about the birthday line?’
Right? What’s woke about the Talk of Alaska Merry Christmas greeting (show) today?
Nathaniel Herz: My understanding is, the genesis of these t-shirts was that you were at the public media station in Bethel, in Western Alaska, KYUK. And that this was maybe a cheeky question that you posed about their Birthday Line program, in the context of critics saying that public media is woke and liberal.
Lisa Murkowski: I’m like, ‘Yeah, really?’
Nathaniel Herz: Because the Birthday Line is, like, people calling in and wishing people happy birthday?
Lisa Murkowski: Mm hmm. ‘I want to wish my auntie in Aniak a happy birthday.’ ‘I want to wish my brother Tom downriver a happy birthday.’
Nathaniel Herz: And your point was, ‘This is not anti-Trump. This is not anti-whatever’?
Lisa Murkowski: This is not radical, woke, leftist bias. It’s just not. And people in the Lower 48 only wish that they had fun things like the Birthday Line. We could transform America with the birthday line.
Nathaniel Herz: I had a question about public media, which was effectively close to zeroed out in the federal budget last year. It seems like a lot of people had their minds made up about this issue while it was being debated. But I was questioning whether the argument that folks were making about the need and value of public broadcasting was the right one. Because there was this big emphasis on emergencies. But today, everyone gets tsunami alerts on their phones. Was there a more compelling argument than the one you guys were making that could have resonated more with folks?
Lisa Murkowski: You know, I don’t disagree with you. As I think back to how I was trying to get people, like, exercised about it — it was really convenient, oddly enough, to have had that massive earthquake over in Russia, and the impact on the tsunami.
But as I think about the real value — the real value is the ability to connect people within their communities.
I think particularly, the role that KYUK would have played in this whole (Western Alaska) typhoon incident. Yeah, we know that everybody from (the village of) Kipnuk is evacuated. But you have so many people, like: ‘Well, my brother was born here in Kipnuk, but he’s living down in Kasigluk.’ And the way that people just checked in with one another was by listening to public radio.
It’s not necessarily the Birthday Line. It’s like, oh, you knew the generator has been out in this town for two weeks now. So, you know that you’re going to call your brother and say, ‘How you doing?’
I think that’s the type of thing where, in Alaska, particularly, where you don’t have roads that connect people, this public media is your connector. It’s your communications connector. Maybe it’s been replaced a little bit by Facebook. I’m not a Facebooker, so I don’t know. But I think it’s the connections, and that’s why people in rural America understand, a little bit more, the value of public media. Because they, too, need those connections
Nathaniel Herz: There’s this year of funding through the Bureau of Indian Affairs that Alaska’s junior senator, Dan Sullivan, I think, helped make happen, which is supporting some Alaska stations.
Lisa Murkowski: It was (South Dakota Sen.) Mike Rounds who made it happen.
Nathaniel Herz: What’s your sense of the outlook for whether you can get Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding, or some sort of recurring federal funding, back for stations once that first year expires?
Lisa Murkowski: We are working to, kind of, reexamine, and we’ve been working directly with the corporation. They’ve got a big decision to make as to whether they even remain in existence. And my pitch to them — I actually talked with their board a couple of weeks ago — was like, ‘We know how we’re going to limp through this next year. But I need you to exist for a little bit longer, until we can figure out if we can get more predictable funding streams. If it’s a more reduced version of what we’re seeing at the federal level — which I believe it will be — but it is still somewhat reliable, then you can kind of piece in the other things after that.’
So, I am not convinced that it’s going to be through what the Bureau of Indian Affairs is doing. BIA actually called up the corporation and said, ‘We have no clue how to implement any of this.’ For lack of a better word, ‘Can we contract with you?’
I mean, this is how bizarre the whole thing is, and how stupid it is, and what a waste of money it was. But this is how they got Sen. Rounds to stand down from his opposition. ‘Your tribal stations, we’ll support them.’ But I think, initially, the commitment was going to be, they were going to support the tribal stations without a one year limitation. So, I think he kind of got ripped off, myself.
Nathaniel Herz: Did the junior senator from Alaska and the representative for all Alaskans miss an opportunity to be more outspoken and to have made an impact on the outcome here?
Lisa Murkowski: There were a lot of other issues that were going on. But this place was electric with the buzz about funding for public media. And I don’t think it was reserved just for the conversations that I was part of. It was a big deal. People would come in and they wanted to talk about health care, they wanted to talk about energy. And it was like, ‘Oh, and, don’t forget, this is important.’ So, I don’t know. I don’t understand how you can say you support public broadcasting and then you don’t support public broadcasting when it’s in front of you.
Nathaniel Herz: There has been a ton of speculation about Democratic former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola and what she’s going to do, as far as running for Alaska governor or U.S. Senate. I’ve been hearing increasingly about the potential for her to run for Senate against Sullivan. What kind of position would that put you in, given that you work with Sullivan on a day-to-day basis but have also supported Peltola in the past?
Lisa Murkowski: Well, it’s not so much about me. That’s a hard race. Sen. Sullivan is coming up on finishing two terms, and not without significant successes. So, anybody who’s thinking about taking him on, I think, is setting themselves up for a very, very hard and a very expensive race.
You know, I made it very clear, when Nick Begich was running against Mary (in 2024) — I said, ‘No offense to you, Nick, but Mary has been my longtime friend, and I’m going to support her.’
If she were to run against my colleague, yeah: It puts me in a difficult spot. But I also think it puts a lot of Alaskans in a difficult spot. Mary, not unlike me, is able to attract support from both sides, right? And granted, it’s early right now. But my sense is that Dan is doing a pretty good job of shoring up this support from not only traditional Republican voters and donors, but from many who kind of view themselves more independently.
Nathaniel Herz: He’s trying to broaden his base a little bit.
Lisa Murkowski: I think that will put people in a spot where it’s like, ‘Yes, I may have supported you (Peltola) when you were running for the House. But we’ve got a different scenario here.’ So, I think it would be hard. I think it’d be really hard.
Nathaniel Herz: Do you feel like you could say at this point whether you’d support Mary if she made that decision?
Lisa Murkowski: No, I can’t say that I would support, no.
My hope is that we have an election where we recognize the value of the individuals that are running, the contributions that they’ve made, and we don’t get into this nasty, going-at-one-another’s-throats campaigns. I really don’t want to see that. I don’t think Alaskans want to see that.
Nathaniel Herz: Would you like to see Mary run?
Lisa Murkowski: For Senate, for governor, for house?
Nathaniel Herz: For Senate.
Lisa Murkowski: I think it would be a very, very, very hard race. I think it’d be hard on people in this state. And again, I don’t like the idea of, just, a really nasty, nasty race at the Senate level. I have said many times very publicly that Mary is my friend. I want Mary to do what’s going to make Mary happy. And only Mary can determine that.
Nathaniel Herz: My sense, from having done some reporting on her choices here, and from reading others’ reporting on it, is that there is very clearly a dynamic when it comes to the national Democrats that have pushed her to run for U.S. Senate. And that perspective is not about Mary, it’s not about Alaska, it’s about the big picture sort of politics.
Lisa Murkowski: Just put a name to it. (U.S. Senate Democratic leader) Chuck Schumer would like to be in the majority. And he’s got to figure out where he picks up more votes. And so, the pressure to get a Democrat who has that level of notoriety, public support — he’s going to weigh in and promise, probably, the sun, the moon and the stars to her.
But it’s one thing to go through a campaign. I have said many times, you know, ‘Well, I may not always agree with some of the decisions that come out of the Trump administration, or from my Republican leadership.’ I have no desire or design or intention of being in a caucus that is led by Chuck Schumer.
I think it would be hard. I think it would be really, really hard for Mary Peltola, or any Democrat from Alaska, to be in a caucus like we currently have with Schumer as the leader over there. I don’t think it would work for any Alaskan.
Nathaniel Herz: Change of subject. We’ve been doing some reporting on transboundary mines — those on the Canadian side of the border, in watersheds that flow into Alaska. You’ve been pretty consistent in your support for resource development inside Alaska, and haven’t necessarily expressed those same kinds of concerns about mining projects here, even as others have expressed concerns about them.
What’s different about these projects in Canada compared to the ones in Alaska that are making you feel more compelled to speak on behalf of folks who are concerned about them?
Lisa Murkowski: It’s an easy question, and the answer is, Tulsequah Chief. (Tulsequah Chief is an abandoned mine in Canada that has been leaching pollution into a watershed that drains into Alaska.)
For how many years? Well, it’s been at least 25, because I was in the state Legislature when I first heard of what we were dealing with, coming from the Canadian side. And not only a level of contamination that was basically left unchecked, but just a whole series of finger pointing. Promises that they were going to address it, and no delivery.
In that instance, we saw, just, a complete failure, and a failure that went on for decades to the point where, in British Columbia, they know that they have got to address it. They know that for projects going forward, they’re kind of stained by the operation there, and so they’re making the same promises, ‘Our environmental regulations are tough. We’re going to be good stewards.’ But it’s really hard when they have failed to keep their word.
I look to the requirements that we have on our side of the border. They’re much more stringent than the Canadians’. And so, I think that’s where you have the difference.
We made some headway during the Walker administration, when Byron Mallott was lieutenant governor. I think we had a real good level of communication going on for the first time in a while. (But) we’ve kind of pulled back from that. And it’s been tough to get the U.S. State Department involved. And I don’t feel like we’re going to have that much luck with this particular State Department, so we’re exploring other ways to get the attention of Canada on, just, the obligations.
Nathaniel Herz: Like what?
Lisa Murkowski: I mean, noodling. Maybe we incorporate some things on, you know, from a tariff perspective. We’ve been doing kind of the same thing for a while, and we haven’t really gotten the attention to it.
Nathaniel Herz: The idea being that tariffs are a tool that could be used to get their attention.
Lisa Murkowski: Yeah. And we haven’t explored it any further than that. But again, we’re just kind of spitballing.
Nathaniel Herz: It’s an idea. It’s not legislation that’s drafted.
Lisa Murkowski: Yeah.
Nathaniel Herz: I get the sense that you experienced a lot of pressure, and had to do a lot of work, in this past year. And I’m just curious, looking back on it, if you would say this was the most difficult year you’ve experienced in D.C., or if you wouldn’t go that far.
Lisa Murkowski: I don’t know if it’s been the most difficult year. But I can tell you that I am so happy to be having the door of 2025 close on my butt, and I’m done with it.
It has been — it’s been a challenging year, and a lot of it has to do with, just, the unknowns that were in front of us. You have a new administration coming in, and that’s always different. But there was just a lot that was coming before us that caused anxiety with a lot of people — whether it’s anxiety about, you know, ‘My health insurance is going to triple in cost, and so I’m stressed out about that.’ Or, you know, ‘We’re in the middle of a government shutdown, and I’m having to work, but I’m not getting paid, and it’s costing me 100 bucks to fill up my truck to get into work, and I still have to pay childcare.’ And the uncertainty that comes about when you had all of the DOGE rifts early on, and people not knowing what their situation was going to be.
We received all of that, as incoming. People wanting answers on their grants, to know whether or not they needed to lay off an extra staff person, or whether something is coming in. And it was hard. It was just, emotionally, a hard year for a lot of Alaskans. And maybe it’s because I’m a very empathetic person: I don’t want people to be anxious that way. I don’t want them to be suffering. I don’t want them to feel like this is a really bad place for them, their family. And so, I kind of absorbed a lot of that, to kind of carry it. And so, it’s been a hard year, because there’s just been so much uncertainty.
Nathaniel Herz: Does it push you one way or the other, as far as your desire to do this for another six years when we get to 2028 and your re-election?
Lisa Murkowski: It’s hard, because the harder the job is, the more you realize why it’s so important that you’re there doing the hard job, if that makes any sense. It just does.
I take really seriously the responsibility that I have to the Constitution, to the oath of office that I have made. And that sounds maybe a little bit old fashioned. But I don’t get to sit in this office just because we pay the rent every month. It is a privilege that has been given, because people have asked me to try to help them. And part of that means that you have to stand up for what you think is right.
And when an administration of your own party is doing something that either you don’t feel is right, or you don’t feel comports with their authorities under the Constitution, there’s a responsibility to stand up. And that can be hard.

The top artificial intelligence and tech companies in California may be swimming in cash for now, but as skepticism grows over whether this current AI boom will continue or bust, so do concerns over the state’s budget and its reliance on the AI industry.
As CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay explains, California’s biggest source of revenue is personal income tax. In addition to base wages, many tech companies pay employees in stock options, which when fully vested and owned by employees are treated like ordinary income for tax purposes. Companies pay withholding taxes on some of that income to the state and U.S. governments.
The revenue paid from these taxes by some of the state’s biggest tech companies is expected to make up about 10% of all income tax withholding this year, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. As California faces a projected $18 billion deficit this year (more on that below), the state’s financial outlook is partly tied to these AI companies.

Chas Alamo, LAO’s principal fiscal and policy analyst: “We’re seeing a real boost to income-tax receipts because of this — for a relatively small number of employees. If the AI market were to deteriorate, we could see these withholdings decline.”

That’s because other aspects of California’s economy, such as job growth and wages, remain stagnant or are declining: In September California’s unemployment rate rose to the highest in the country, and from 2024 to 2025, the number of Bay Area tech jobs decreased. Some tech companies, such as San Francisco-based Salesforce, cite AI as a reason why they must layoff employees. 

Jeff Bellisario, executive director of the think tank Bay Area Council Economic Institute: “Tech booms in the past have led to an employment boom. This doesn’t feel like that.”

Coming soon: The last Newsom budget

Speaking of the state budget, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday will unveil his preliminary spending plan for 2026-27 — his last as California’s governor. With an $18 billion deficit projected for the fiscal year, how Newsom plans to handle the deficit could have notable implications for his expected presidential bid, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu.
The deficit is a result of the state’s escalating spending, federal funding cuts and rising economic insecurity under President Donald Trump. State Republicans and other Newsom critics also blame the deficit on Newsom’s mismanagement. 
To close the gap, state leaders could walk back some of last year’s funding commitments. Medi-Cal is also California’s most expensive program, though Newsom has not indicated whether he’ll target it for cuts. But as a lame-duck governor eyeing the presidency, Newsom would be even less inclined to enact major policy changes to address the state’s long-term budget issues, political strategists say.

Garry South, longtime Democratic consultant: “It’s not an uncommon occurrence in California for a departing governor to leave a note on the new governor’s desk that they’ve got a budget deficit.”

Most Altadena residents still displaced, still awaiting utility settlements

Utility company Southern California Edison has paid out just 82 victims of the Eaton Fire through its wildfire recovery compensation program, despite drawing in nearly 1,800 customers into the program, writes CalMatters’ Malena Carollo.
A year ago, the deadly wildfire killed 19 people and destroyed over 9,000 structures in Los Angeles County. About 80% of Altadena residents are estimated to still be displaced as of October. Though an official cause has yet to be determined, federal prosecutors cite faulty Edison equipment for the fire. 
To settle numerous lawsuits against the company, Edison launched a compensation program two months ago. Survivors have criticized the program for excluding some residents, underpaying others and requiring participants to waive their right to sue the company.
Edison offered a total of $34.4 million to settle the 82 claims, with half of the claims for total losses, and the others related to smoke and ash damage.

The Trump administration is attempting to drastically cut the amount of federal funds that can be spent on permanent housing for homeless individuals. CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall and video strategy director Robert Meeks have a video segment on why advocates say this move could force people out of housing, as part of our partnership with PBS SoCal. Watch it here.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: As Newsom kicks off his last year as governor, California’s intractable issues not only serve as a potential drag on his presidential campaign, but they also color the campaigns of his would-be successors.
The attention brought to incarcerated firefighters during last year’s L.A.-area wildfires showed that people want to see second chances given to incarcerated people working to turn their lives around, writes Jose Angel Amezcua, a formerly incarcerated firefighter from Salinas.

How will he address it?,Yue Stella Yu,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2026/01/gavin-newsom-politics-budget-deficit/,"As Gov. Gavin Newsom prepares to release his spending plan this Friday, a projected $18 billion deficit awaits. Will he raise taxes or cut spending? Either could spell trouble for Newsom’s legacy.","In summary
As Gov. Gavin Newsom prepares to release his spending plan this Friday, a projected $18 billion deficit awaits. Will he raise taxes or cut spending? Either could spell trouble for Newsom’s legacy. 


In 2019, first-year Gov. Gavin Newsom inherited a state flush with cash. With a $21.4 billion budget surplus to play with, an ambitious Newsom invested billions in affordable housing, child care and health care expansion while paying down the state’s debt and shoring up reserves. 
The next governor won’t be that lucky.
When Newsom unveils his last spending plan as governor Friday, he will do so with the spectre of a projected $18 billion deficit — the result of the state’s fast-growing spending, federal funding losses and heightened economic uncertainties under President Donald Trump’s administration.
The deficit could balloon to $35 billion annually in the next few years if state leaders don’t pursue long-term solutions, namely making sustainable revenue increases or cutting spending, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the nonpartisan fiscal adviser to lawmakers. 
But neither will be appealing options to Newsom and legislative leaders this year. 
They have repeatedly resisted increasing taxes on average Californians and high-income earners alike — a politically dicey pitch to make in a state with high tax rates and increasing revenue. Spending cuts are equally painful to swallow, especially for Democrats running for re-election in November who have fought to expand services, such as Medi-Cal, that may now be rolled back. 
For Newsom, a lame-duck governor with presidential aspirations, there is even less incentive to address the state’s long-term budget health through major policy changes, political strategists say. 
“It’s not an uncommon occurrence in California for a departing governor to leave a note on the new governor’s desk that they’ve got a budget deficit,” said longtime Democratic consultant Garry South.
But how Newsom tackles the structural deficit will almost certainly have implications for his expected presidential bid. State Republicans, such as Assemblymember David Tangipa of Fresno, are already blaming the budget problem on Newsom’s mismanagement. “A Newsom presidency would be a fiscal and governance disaster of historic proportions,” Tangipa wrote in a December op-ed.
It’s the fourth consecutive year in Newsom’s tenure that the state is projecting a deficit even as revenue grows. In the past, state Democratic leaders resorted to temporary fixes such as internal borrowing, deferring payments, one-time cuts and drawing from California’s rainy day fund to avoid cutting into the social safety net. 
But that cushion is deflating: The state’s reserve stands at $14 billion, half its peak balance, after two years of withdrawals. State leaders have borrowed more than $20 billion from other state funds, debts that will come due in later years. Continuing to rely on those options would leave the state “undeniably less prepared” for an economic downturn, the LAO warned. 
“Eventually you are going to run out of Band-aids,” said Steve Maviglio, a Democratic strategist who worked for then-Gov. Gray Davis during a massive budget deficit. “(Newsom) has used every trick in the book, and after a certain point, there’s nothing left.”
More health care cuts to come?
Newsom has not indicated whether he’ll consider cuts to Medi-Cal, the state’s primary health insurance program for low-income residents. But as the state’s most expensive program, it is an attractive target. More than half of the $200 billion program’s funding comes from the federal government. 
Last year, as Newsom and legislators scrambled to close a $12 billion budget gap, they froze new Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented immigrants, charged immigrant enrollees a $30 monthly premium and delayed cutting certain benefits. The cost of Medi-Cal has been rising faster than expected, forcing the state Legislature to allocate $6.2 billion midyear to prevent a shortfall. 
The decision was contentious, with some health care advocates and Democratic lawmakers slamming their leaders for creating a “two-tiered health care system” that deemed immigrants less worthy of quality coverage. 
“That was an incredibly disappointing backslide,” said Amanda McAllister-Wallner, executive director of Health Access California, which advocates for universal health care.
This year, Trump’s budget reduced the federal government’s share of funding to Medi-Cal, requiring the state to pay more to provide the same benefits. California is projected to spend at least $1.3 billion more to implement that change, a figure that could reach $5 billion by fiscal year 2029-30, the LAO estimated.

Assemblymember Mia Bonta, an Oakland Democrat who chairs the Assembly Health Committee, said solving the state’s budget crunch shouldn’t come at the expense of health care.
“California needs its state and federal leaders to look for more innovative solutions to fill the gaps, make health care affordable, and keep our families healthy,” she said in a statement that did not offer specific alternatives. 
Any cuts to Medi-Cal could bring political consequences for Democrats who often pride themselves on expanding social services. Rolling back Medi-Cal could hurt Newsom’s legacy, too, since it was under him that the state began offering Medi-Cal to immigrants.
“Democrats are the party of expanding health care,” Maviglio said. “To slash it goes against everything they stand for.”
McAllister-Wallner acknowledged she isn’t optimistic about the budget outlook. But she said she hopes the state finds new revenue through taxing corporations instead of making cuts to vulnerable populations.
If “we are addressing this through cuts only, and cuts to the most vulnerable, that’s … not the leadership that we are looking for,” she said.
State leaders could also walk back some of last year’s funding commitments in other areas. While state lawmakers negotiated $500 million for homelessness to counties and delayed it until next year, it is not guaranteed. Newsom, who has blamed the state’s homelessness problem on local governments, could withhold the money. 
Newsom also promised last year he’d reach a deal with Bay Area transit advocates over state funding to save the area’s transit net from collapsing. But last month, in light of the budget shortfall, Newsom urged advocates to dip into previously allocated dollars to save the regional transit network, instead of a $750 million loan the advocates had requested.
Taxing the rich a nonstarter for Newsom
It’ll be hard to muster the political will in Sacramento to raise taxes. 
Former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Los Angeles Democrat running for state superintendent of public instruction, said he’s long supported higher taxes on industries that have “skated away from taxation for a long time.” 
But even the most progressive Democrats in California have had little appetite to raise taxes, he said, because many represent affluent areas such as Silicon Valley where their wealthy donors live. 
Even when the state faced a projected $56 billion deficit over two years in 2023, Rendon said Democrats were “shrugging” at the problem and pointing to the state’s reserves as a solution, which he said reflected a culture of reliance on the rainy day fund.
This year, Newsom has already spoken out against a proposed labor-backed wealth tax ballot measure, consistent with his past opposition to similar proposals. 
The ballot measure, titled “The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act” and filed with the state attorney general’s office in October, seeks to tack a one-time 5% tax on those with a net worth of at least $1 billion and use the money to fund the state’s health care and education programs. The effort is led by the SEIU-UHW, a powerful labor union representing health care workers, and St. John’s Community Health, one of the largest nonprofit health care providers in Los Angeles County.
State. Sen. Roger Niello, a Roseville Republican and vice chair of the Senate Budget Committee, applauded Newsom’s opposition to the proposed tax increase. 
“To have a situation where we have developed an increasing deficit in the face of an economy that is not in recession, and revenues are increasing, it would seem to be silly to solve that by further increasing revenue,” he said. 
While taxing the rich is a popular Democratic talking point, backing a proposal like that could mean alienating the wealthy donors Newsom will likely rely on for his presidential run. 
There would also be no political gain for Newsom in his last year to stabilize the state’s progressive tax structure, which heavily relies on high-income earners, despite him promising to do so when he took office.

,California,2026-01-06 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California tax revenue getting a boost from AI boom — but for how long?,Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2026/01/california-tech-tax-revenue/,"As talk of a possible AI bubble grows, so does uncertainty around an important source of California tax money.","In summary
As talk of a possible AI bubble grows, so does uncertainty around an important source of California tax money.


As California becomes more dependent on tax revenue from the tech industry, its stake in the health of the artificial intelligence industry has grown.
The state is seeing financial benefits from the AI boom, a new analysis by the Legislative Analyst’s Office shows. But the boom raises questions: Will it continue to be accompanied by a decline in tech and other jobs? Is it a bubble? 
Tax revenue from stock-option withholding paid by some of the state’s biggest tech companies made up about 10% of all income tax withholding in 2025, estimated Chas Alamo, the principal fiscal and policy analyst with the LAO. Alamo looked at tech companies’ public financial filings and other data through the second quarter of 2025. That figure would be about the same as 2024, and is up from more than 6% just three years ago, when he first did the analysis.
The state’s biggest source of revenue is personal income tax. It’s common for tech companies to pay employees in stock options in addition to their base wages. Stock options that have vested and are fully owned by employees are treated like ordinary income for tax purposes, so companies pay withholding taxes on some of that income to the state and U.S. governments. 
Shining a spotlight on where the state’s tax revenue comes from is especially timely, when it needs all the revenue it can get. California is expected to have a nearly $18 billion budget deficit this year, with the state expecting to have to fill funding gaps because of cuts by the Trump administration. But the state’s growing reliance on AI-driven revenue is risky for two reasons: fears that the technology is overhyped, and because AI’s rise threatens livelihoods.
Alamo based his analysis on the performance of the state’s five most valuable tech companies by market value: Apple, Google, Nvidia, Broadcom and Meta. Shares of Nvidia, Broadcom and Google did especially well in 2025: They rose 25%, 46% and 59% for the year, respectively. Alamo also included Intel, Cisco, AMD, Intuit, Paypal, Applied Materials and Qualcomm in his analysis because they paid substantial amounts of withholding on their employees’ stock options.
“We’re seeing a real boost to income-tax receipts because of this — for a relatively small number of employees,” Alamo told CalMatters. “If the AI market were to deteriorate, we could see these withholdings decline.” 
In other words, if the AI bubble pops, California could see a steep drop in tax revenue. That’s because there has been little job growth and wages are not rising, Alamo said, adding that the analyst’s office has been raising its concern over “the stagnant nature of the state’s labor market and broader economy” for the past couple of years. In September, the most recent data available, California’s unemployment rate rose to 5.6%, the highest among U.S. states.

‘AI is not a job-gainer’
Despite the AI boom, the number of tech jobs in the Bay Area actually decreased from September 2024 to August 2025, according to the latest analysis by the Bay Area Council Economic Institute, a think tank supported by the Bay Area Council, a business coalition. Jobs in the information industry were down 1.3% over that period, while jobs in professional and business services fell 1.5%. Some tech companies, such as San Francisco-based Salesforce, mentioned AI as a factor when they disclosed layoffs of thousands of employees. 
“Right now, on net, AI is not a job-gainer,” said Jeff Bellisario, executive director of the think tank. “The bigger question for us is, you put aside (tech companies’) valuation and think about the number of people employed in these companies.” 
Another analysis of employment data by the California Business Roundtable’s information arm, the California Center for Jobs and the Economy, shows a loss of more than 130,000 jobs in high tech, including manufacturing jobs, through the first quarter of last year. 
“Tech booms in the past have led to an employment boom,” Bellisario said. “This doesn’t feel like that.”
There’s no consensus about whether this tech boom is set to go bust anytime soon. Some of the biggest AI optimists include Jensen Huang, chief executive of chipmaker Nvidia, who told investors in November: “There has been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” 
Another optimist is Dan Ives, longtime tech analyst and managing director at Wedbush Securities. 
“This is not a bubble,” he told CalMatters. “This is Year 3 of an 8- to 10-year buildout of the AI revolution.” Ives said AI could be huge for U.S. innovation, and that this moment in time reminds him “much more of a 1996 moment than a 1999 or 2000 moment.” 
Bubble back-and-forth
In the mid-1990s, widespread adoption of personal computers and the advent of the graphical web browser paved the way for the dot-com boom and gave rise to companies such as Google, Netflix and PayPal. But by 2000 or shortly afterward, after the founders of those companies made their fortunes, many other internet companies had gone out of business — some in spectacular flameouts, such as Webvan or Pets.com.

Today, there are signs that there are too many startups in certain subsectors, according to analysts at PitchBook, which tracks public and private capital markets. Among the ones they mentioned in their 2026 outlook: AI scribes in health care, which automatically generate medical notes; aerial defense drones; content development in gaming; personal assistant bots; and more. The analysts warned investors that startups would really need to differentiate themselves to bring value.
Researchers for Allianz Trade, the global insurance company, wrote in a November brief: “The financial market frenzy over AI shows classic signs of an asset bubble: widespread consensus, unproven valuations and returns at times detached from earnings.” The researchers also said they were watching a lot of corporate spending on AI as concerns grow around tightening energy constraints. AI is driving demand for data centers, which are straining the electric grid.
Discussion about a bubble aside, some tech-friendly experts point out that California’s reliance on AI means the state should help the sector succeed, such as by not overregulating it. 
“What’s important to remember is that California’s social safety net depends on a healthy tech industry, “ said Kaitlyn Harger, an economist for Chamber of Progress, a think tank funded by the tech industry. The financial cushion tech provides helps the state fund public-sector jobs, health services, education, social services and more, Harger said. 
California leads all states in trying to regulate AI, and is expected to fight against the president’s recent executive order to develop federal laws around AI that would supersede state laws.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/122025-Data-Center-Vernon-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C709&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 08:59:42.018184

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The moment Gov. Tim Walz was cooked was little remarked upon at the time, but in retrospect illustrates how he and his administration were sleeping through an enveloping crisis. 
At the late 2024 budget forecast, he said disability and autism services were driving state government spending beyond expectations. When he was asked about potential fraud in the autism program — about which we’d reported an FBI investigation six months prior — he seemed unfamiliar. I traded texts with an incredulous reporter who was there and wound up publishing a column called, “Minnesota: an easy mark.” 
More recently, Walz faced the full force of the right-wing propaganda machine in the past two months. It was a frightening sight to behold, and a healthier democracy would never be host to such a parasitical malignancy. 
Although restoring American democratic habits of mind to eviscerate that propaganda machine should be on our lengthy, long-term to-do list, the lesson here for me is that the most underrated tool in the political toolbox is … governing. 
Deadly dull, I know, but the word governor even has the word “govern” in it: competently administering programs to help people who need it; ensuring Minnesota’s children are learning literacy and numeracy; and managing the state’s vast infrastructure assets. That’s the job. 
Former St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, another one-time rising star in Minnesota politics, recently faced the same sort of governing reckoning as Walz, when Mayor Kaohly Her pulled off an upset November victory promising to make stuff work again. May Democratic elected officials everywhere take notice. 
We live in perilous times, no question, but Minnesotans are right to expect a minimum level of competency in these matters of public administration. It’s especially important for the party of government, i.e., the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, to pay attention to details, like whether a 3,000% increase in spending on the autism program is reasonable, especially when some of the providers had ties to Feeding Our Future. 
Tim Walz is at heart a decent man, and he doesn’t deserve what’s been thrown at him in recent weeks — especially a despicable allegation leveled by the president of the United States and the odious propagandist Nick Shirley that Walz was involved in the assassination of former House Speaker Melissa Hortman. 
He made some mistakes, but he’s not evil, unlike some of the loudest and most influential voices in American politics today, whose greed and lust for power are boundless. 
Walz’s first term was marked by almost constant crisis, none of it his doing. He was a mostly steady hand, even as Republicans came to despise him during the pandemic and the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd.
His second term comprised major legislative accomplishments — for which the credit mostly belongs to Hortman and the late Sen. Kari Dziedzic — as well as his (again, in retrospect) disastrous candidacy for vice president. All the while, thieves were stealing the people’s money with gusto.
Walz has served the community of Mankato, the people of Minnesota and his country. 
And now he has saved us from what would have been a deeply divisive campaign, and which would have put the state of Minnesota under federal siege. 
Unlike former President Joe Biden, who doomed his party and the country with his insistence on running for a second term, Walz is stepping aside before any more damage is done to his state and the DFL. He says he’ll focus all his energies on cleaning up the mess. 
He deserves our thanks for that service and for making this decision.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_9328-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 08:59:42.018184

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for Utah News Dispatch, image courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)After President Donald Trump returned to the White House last January and launched an aggressive immigration crackdown, at least 3,040 immigration arrests have happened in Utah — more than double the number of arrests under former President Joe Biden’s administration in 2024.
Of those, slightly more than half of the arrests in Utah last year — 55% or 1,685 — have been of people with criminal convictions. But that’s not so for the other 45%.
About 27.4% or 832 arrests were of people with what immigration officials categorized as having pending criminal charges at the time of their arrests. And the other 522 arrests — making up about 17% — were detained solely for alleged immigration violations. That’s more than six times the number of immigration arrests in Utah of people with no criminal record (82, or a 7% share) under former President Joe Biden’s administration in 2024.
That’s according to data obtained through public information requests and litigation by the  Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers that collects and shares anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets, and compiled into a dashboard developed by Relevant Research, a research group focused on immigration data. 
The dashboard includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest data dating back to September 2023 and through Oct. 15, 2025. Monthly arrest data in that time frame show a clear uptick in ICE arrests starting last January and continuing through 2025, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data obtained and processed by the Deportation Data Project, and analyzed by Utah News Dispatch. 



Because about 16% of the government data provided to the Deportation Data Project is missing state information, the number of immigration arrests in Utah may be higher.
Through 2025, the share of arrests of people in Utah solely for alleged immigration violations and no pending or criminal charges have also grown compared to 2024.
From September 2023 to December 2024, 1,457 immigration arrests took place in Utah, according to the dashboard. Of those, 71% (1,034) were of people with criminal convictions. About 22% (322) were of people with pending criminal charges, and less than 7% (101) were solely for alleged immigration violations. 
The data paints a statistical picture of ICE operations in Utah. Under Trump, ICE arrests of all types are up — and a majority include those with criminal convictions. But even if it’s a smaller percentage, there’s a growing share of people arrested by ICE with no criminal record. 
Notably, Utah’s share of immigrant arrests solely for alleged immigration violations is smaller than the national share of those arrested with no criminal record, which makes up roughly one-third of immigrants arrested nationwide. 
While high-profile ICE operations in major cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Massachusetts have resulted in more than half of those arrested with no criminal record, according to The New York Times, operations in the red state of Utah haven’t been as aggressive.

However, the numbers only go so far to tell the story of what’s been happening in the Beehive State, where ICE operations have largely flown under the radar — except for certain arrests that have sparked outcry. 
Among them was an arrest of a woman at the Salt Lake City International Airport — which went viral after a video posted on social media showed four plain-clothes ICE officers take her away as she screamed for help. 
In the state’s Democratic stronghold of Salt Lake City, leaders condemned the arrest. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said she was left “aching from the fear and pain these types of operations keep striking in my heart and the hearts of so many of us.” 
‘Worst of the worst’
While ICE officials under Trump have said they’re targeting the “worst of the worst,” critics including immigrant advocates and attorneys in Utah have criticized the Trump administration’s approach. 
They say the federal government’s tactics have been “broad” and “haphazard,” sweeping up too many otherwise law-abiding people while the nation’s immigration system remains broken and difficult to navigate.
Utah News Dispatch sent a request for comment to the Department of Homeland Security pointing to the data that shows arrests of all types are up in Utah, but also asking about the growing percentage of people in Utah who are being arrested solely on alleged immigrant violations. The department issued a statement from Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs, that has been provided to other news outlets maintaining the Trump administration is focused on “the worst of the worst.” 
“This story only reveals how the media manipulates data to peddle a false narrative that DHS is not targeting the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said. “Nationwide our law enforcement is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens — including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.”
She added: “70% of illegal aliens ICE arrested across the country have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges just in the U.S. This statistic doesn’t account for those wanted for violent crimes in their home country or another country, INTERPOL notices, human rights abusers, gang members, terrorists, etc. The list goes on.”

The Department of Homeland Security statement also pointed to a list of press releases it said were examples of “non-criminals” arrested by ICE that are wanted for crimes allegedly committed outside of the U.S. 
The Department of Homeland Security has also created a “worst of the worst” dashboard to highlight arrests. As of Monday, about 250 arrests were listed on that dashboard from Utah. The dashboard lists their name, city where they were arrested, and what they were convicted of, according to the Department of Homeland Security. 
The convictions listed next to some of the highlighted arrests on the “worst of the worst” dashboard range from homicide, assault, sexual assault and drug trafficking. Some convictions listed, however, include nonviolent crimes such as fraud for making a false statement, forgery, and illegal re-entry. 
The dashboard doesn’t list dates for the arrests, but the 250 highlighted in Utah make up about 8% of the 3,040 immigration arrests that occurred in the state in 2025, according to Deportation Data Project data. It’s also less than 15% of the total number of people arrested (1,685) with criminal convictions in all of 2025 in Utah. 



Is being present in the U.S. in violation of immigration laws a crime? 
On its own, no, it’s not a crime, but a civil infraction. The act of entering the U.S. without being inspected and admitted is a federal crime (a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the circumstances). But many undocumented immigrants do not enter the U.S. illegally. “They enter legally but overstay, work without authorization, drop out of school or violate the conditions of their visas in some other way,” according to the American Civil Liberties Union. 



While more than 80% of ICE arrests in 2025 in Utah have been of people with pending criminal charges or convictions, the increased enforcement on others without criminal records has raised alarms for immigration advocates and legal defenders.
With eyes on what’s happening both nationally and in their home state, they say the uptick of ICE operations — and particularly arrests of people with no criminal backgrounds — have left many immigrants, their families and their communities living in fear and uncertainty. 
They say the tactics — especially arrests of those seeking legal status at Salt Lake City’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office — have intimidated many to retreat further into the shadows. 
A human and economic cost
The cost of more aggressive immigration enforcement is both human and economic, said Bob Babcock, a longtime construction attorney specializing in an industry that is highly dependent on immigrant labor. 
“I feel like we are abusing this community,” Babcock told Utah News Dispatch in a recent interview. “And I am shocked that so many of our citizens don’t understand and they think it’s a simple solution — ‘Oh just go back and come legally,’ you know? That’s a bunch of crock.” 
Babcock said he wishes more people understood there’s not a simple “line” that undocumented immigrants wait in to obtain legal status. 
“There is no line for carpenters, concrete workers, drywall workers,” he said. “No such line exists.” Meanwhile, he said the industries are short employees because the natural birth rate in the U.S. has long been declining and fewer people are willing to work in labor-intensive fields. 










They’re not criminals. They’re not the ‘worst of the worst.' That’s not who they’re getting. They’re getting anybody and everybody they can. 


– Bob Babcock, construction attorney


In a recent op-ed for the Deseret News, Babcock posed a question for leaders and residents of a state that has long been known to be welcoming and solutions-focused when it comes to immigrants and refugees: Are Utahns OK with what ICE is doing in their state? 
“Everybody’s very fearful,” Babcock told Utah News Dispatch, adding that his clients in the construction industry have seen workers occasionally being “picked up and detained.” 
“They’re losing guys. They’re not criminals. They’re not the ‘worst of the worst,’” he said. “That’s not who they’re getting. They’re getting anybody and everybody they can.” 
Babcock said he’s not aware of any major raids or large-scale arrests on job sites in Utah, but the arrests that have happened instill fear. That fear has been leading some to not show up to work at times.

“And the expectation is it’s going to get much worse,” he said. 
While Republicans and Democrats alike have for years agreed the nation’s immigration system is broken, nothing has been done about it, Babcock said. And the resulting reality is it’s common for undocumented people to work in construction and agriculture, and without them the industries would suffer, he said. 
The current approach, he said, is doing more harm than good. He called on Utah’s state and federal leaders to be courageous and stand up to the Trump administration and say what’s happening isn’t only inhumane — it’s damaging the workforce and economy. 
“Everyone should be standing up and saying, ‘We need a solution,’” he said. “Crushing the workforce day by day is not the solution.” 
What has Gov. Cox said about ICE enforcement in Utah?
In late 2024, Gov. Spencer Cox announced a “targeted” state effort to support the Trump administration’s immigration policies with an emphasis on immigrants “who have committed crimes and pose a threat to public safety.” 
“When it comes to immigration policy, the safety of Utah residents is my top priority,” Cox said in a statement at the time. “Utah will continue to welcome refugees and immigrants who enter the country lawfully, and we will continue pushing for reforms to the asylum process and for more visas to support our workforce needs. We have zero tolerance, however, for those who demonstrate a threat to public safety while in the country illegally.” 










My position is always that laws are supposed to be followed, that we are, I believe, the most welcoming state in the country when it comes to people who are seeking a new life and who are coming here. But you also have to do it the right way, and that’s really important.


– Utah Gov. Spencer Cox


When asked during his most recent news conference broadcast by PBS Utah on Nov. 25 about ICE operations in Utah becoming more frequent and aggressive, Cox said “my position hasn’t changed at all.” 
“My position is always that laws are supposed to be followed, that we are, I believe, the most welcoming state in the country when it comes to people who are seeking a new life and who are coming here,” he said. “But you also have to do it the right way, and that’s really important.” 
Cox added that his administration has been “very supportive of operations to enforce the law and will continue to be.” 
Cox’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.  
‘Haphazard and broad enforcement’
Like the arrest data shows, civil rights advocates have noticed an uptick of ICE enforcement in Utah — and “we have seen an increase in detentions and arrests of folks that don’t have a criminal record or only have a record of more minor criminal offenses,” said Ellie Menlove, legislative and policy council for the ACLU of Utah. 
“We’re seeing more haphazard and broad enforcement without regard to a person’s criminal status,” Menlove said, “which is extremely worrying to us from a civil rights perspective, and it wasn’t what ICE said that they were going to do in the state.” 
The ACLU of Utah is part of the Utah Immigrant Advocacy Coalition — a group of organizations “committed to ensuring Utah remains a welcoming and supportive community for all immigrants, regardless of their status,” according to the coalition’s website. 
The ACLU of Utah has been keeping an up-to-date tracker of the various types of 287(g) agreements that state and local governments have adopted to give local police the power to enforce federal immigration law. In effect, the agreements can turn local officers into ICE agents, “fueling deportations, racial profiling, and fear in immigrant communities,” the ACLU of Utah says on the site. 



The following Utah government entities have adopted 287(g) agreements, according to the ACLU of Utah

Utah Department of Corrections — Warrant Service Officer 
Riverton Police Department — Task Force Model
Cache County — Warrant Service Officer 
Weber County — Task Force Model
Tooele County — Task Force Model
Utah County — Task Force Model and Warrant Service Officer
Wasatch County — Warrant Service Officer
Sanpete County — Warrant Service Officer
Sevier County — Jail Enforcement Model and Warrant Service Officer
Beaver County — Warrant Service Officer
San Juan County — Jail Enforcement Model
Kane County — Warrant Service Officer
Washington County — Task Force Model and Jail Enforcement Model

 



“This just creates a lot of fear in immigrant communities, and it’s overall very harmful to public safety in general when people are under the impression that a law enforcement agency is working with ICE,” said Molly Karasick, a legal fellow with the ACLU of Utah.
The different types of 287(g) agreements grant varying levels of power to local agencies to enforce immigration law — but they all have the same effect of giving the impression that those agencies are partnering with ICE, and that has a chilling effect on communities, Karasick said. 
“When you see that your local agencies partner with ICE, that gives a broad impression that they’re working with ICE and it undermines the community towards law enforcement in general,” she said. “And then, in effect, we have people who are scared to contact their local police or sheriff’s department because they’re under the impression that they’re working with immigration. And when people aren’t reporting crimes, that’s more dangerous for every single person.” 
There are three different types of 287(g) agreements — the Jail Enforcement Model, the Warrant Service Officer and the Task Force Model. 
The Task Force Model grants the most power and is the most concerning to civil rights advocates. Described by ICE as a “force multiplier,” it allows state and local law enforcement agencies to make immigration arrests during regular police enforcement.
The Jail Enforcement Model delegates some immigration authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to identify immigrants in state and local custody and place them into immigration proceedings. “Corrections officers in local jails, under the supervision of ICE, are deputized by the federal government to interrogate people in their custody about their immigration status and funnel people into the deportation pipeline,” the ACLU of Utah says. 
The Warrant Service Officer model grants limited powers, allowing ICE to train, certify and authorize state and local law enforcement officers to serve administrative immigration warrants on people who are in custody in their jails.

‘One of the great horrors of our generation’
Immigration Attorney Nicholle Pitt White was among the attorneys last month warning immigrants to get legal consultation before going to appointments at the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services field office in Salt Lake City due to reports that arrests of immigrants in the process of applying for legal status had started taking place there. 
Though data shows more than half of ICE arrests in Utah have been of people with criminal convictions, Pitt White said the growing number of people arrested solely based on alleged immigration violations is unjust. 
‘Stuck between a rock and a hard place’: Lawyers warn of arrests at Salt Lake immigration office  

Pitt White said she takes the following legal principle of criminal justice to heart: “It’s better that 10 guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.” 
“And I think that’s true for immigrants, too,” she said. “The vast majority of these people, even the ones with criminal history, their crimes are generally pretty minor.”
To Pitt White, what’s happening in the U.S. is “one of the great horrors of our generation.” 
She has multiple stories of aggressive ICE arrests from her own law firm. 
From a case that happened in Utah, Pitt White described seeing dashcam footage “of a dad that had his toddler in the car with him, that had a removal order, meaning a deportation order, but there was reason to believe that should be re-opened.” 
“ICE stopped him. They broke the window where his toddler was. They refused to identify themselves,” she said. “He didn’t know if they were actually ICE or just criminals trying to harm him and his kid, and he took off.” 
Thanks to the dashcam footage, Pitt White said she and her legal team were able to prove “he didn’t actually harm any of the ICE officers” in the face of federal officials accusing him of trying to cause intentional harm to a federal officer. “He was able to provide video evidence to prove that was a big fat lie.” 
“But that’s one of the most egregious things I’ve seen,” she said.

Pitt White said she’s also heard of “several examples” in areas like West Valley City and Magna where “ICE has just kind of sat outside of apartment complexes that are heavily Latino, and they’ll just stop everyone on their way out and ask for papers. And they’ve, like, filled up vans of people and taken them away.” 
Compared to other states, Utah’s ICE operations aren’t as large-scale or high profile — but Pitt White noted Utah does have a fairly large immigrant population in parts of the state, and arrests are happening here, even though many go unreported in the media. 
“I think we had a false sense of security here because Utah is so red,” she said. “But the more we know and the more we’ve seen, it’s not any different here.” 
Like Babcock, Pitt White said she wishes Utah’s political leaders would stand up to what’s happening. Most immigrants are here seeking safety, not to cause trouble. 
“I’ve met so many people that have come here not just because they wanted to work and make a better life for themselves and their family, but because in their home country they were raped by multiple family members and the police refused to help them,” she said. “And the only place they felt they could be safe was here. Because here we follow the laws and we have police that will protect you and we care about your rights.” 
“It’s horrifying,” she said, “that that no longer seems to be the case.” 
Pitt White also urged people who might support the Trump administration’s actions to take a step back and recognize there are good people being swept up by ICE — it could be their neighbor, a friend, someone who cleans their house, or who works on a local farm or at a nearby mechanic shop.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The commotion at the security checkpoint was unusual for a weekday in October. Travelers heading to their gates stopped in their tracks as a woman cried out for help, yelling “No!” and “I have my papers” at Salt Lake City International Airport.  
Video quickly spread of four immigration officers pulling her to the ground and taking her away as she tried to break free, jumping in her stocking feet. Since then, immigration attorneys say the emotional and widely viewed arrest has marked a turning point in Utah.
The viral airport arrest has ratcheted up fear for Utahns without permanent legal status. And it changed the advice Utah attorneys give many of their clients about booking any flights as the Trump administration continues to intensify immigration enforcement.

Two months later, would-be travelers continue to ask South Jordan attorney Carlos Trujillo if it’s unwise to buy plane tickets out of state to visit family or take their children to a Disney theme park. He now advises those with pending applications for green cards or asylum to stay home. 
“The best answer you can tell them is, honestly, if it’s not a necessary flight, if somebody’s not dying, it’s not recommended,” Trujillo said. “It’s not, because that’s where they’re grabbing people.” 
He also tells naturalized citizens and permanent residents to bring their documents with them, saying several clients have been stopped for further questioning. 
“They’ve been taken to secondary screening for the first time in all their life here, and that seems to be picking up more and more,” Trujillo said.  
Few interactions involving immigration enforcers in Utah have been as visible as the airport arrest. Before this year, authorities didn’t typically arrest flyers in the busy, public setting unless they were wanted in criminal cases. The woman they detained on Oct. 29, originally from El Salvador, had a prior deportation order but no criminal record.

The dramatic video reinforced how immigration operations are increasingly being carried out in public, at businesses, near schools and in public places across the country. Trujillo said he anticipates immigration enforcement will intensify in 2026 after a cash infusion from Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill.”
Congress set aside $30 billion for ICE hiring, transportation and other costs as part of the legislation. ICE did not respond to a request for comment from Utah News Dispatch about the arrest at the airport or the new funding’s impact in the state. 
Kimberly Tobar, a therapist with Jacky’s Recovery Support Services who works with members of Utah’s Latino communities, noted the significant change to daily life for many immigrants who  haven’t left their homes in months and aren’t going to work or school because they’re worried about being stopped by authorities. 
“Even people who have documentation here feel that fear, because they feel that they’re going to get racially profiled and just be accused of not having documentation,” Tobar said.

She said that worry has left many in a state of isolation and constant anxiety “that they feel very powerless over, because they’re like, ‘What can I do?’”
Tobar said teenagers her organization works with report they’re worried about ICE coming to their school or job and detaining them, or that they’ll come home at the end of the day to find their parents aren’t there anymore. Others have brought up that they aren’t traveling to see loved ones. 
“A lot of the youth have also been the ones that are learning about their rights and teaching their family members,” Tobar said. 
Attorneys representing the woman detained at the airport emphasize that she has a current work permit and no criminal history.
“What it demonstrates is that ICE is actively using everything in its means to try to identify individuals who have outstanding deportation orders,” said one of her attorneys, Andrew Armstrong. 
He said his client applied for asylum in the U.S. years ago with the help of someone she hired to assist with the paperwork. But that person never provided her with correspondence from the government demanding her further participation in the process, Armstrong said.

Her subsequent lack of response triggered the deportation proceeding, Armstrong told Utah News Dispatch. She didn’t receive notice of that case either, and didn’t know it ended in a deportation order until she was carried out of the airport, he said. 
“I don’t want to criticize the ICE agents having to do their job,” Armstrong said. “But they were large men who forcefully removed her from the airport who did not speak Spanish and were not able to explain to her what was going on.”
She is being held in a detention center in Louisiana, Armstrong said, as she waits to hear whether a judge will withdraw the deportation order. Such arrests “create fear so that they inspire certain immigrants to leave on their own because they are so afraid of what might happen to them if they stay here,” Armstrong said. 
His client came on the radar of ICE via a list of passengers that airlines provide the federal government, Armstrong said. The Transportation Security Administration has begun sharing more data with ICE to deport more people, including in her case, The New York Times reported in December, citing internal documents the newspaper obtained. 
TSA and ICE are both under the umbrella of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
Ysabel Lonazco, an immigration attorney in West Valley City, agrees the dramatic scene near the baggage claim was a turning point. 
She now counsels those living in Utah without documents to avoid traveling. 
“There’s an Ysabel before the airport — and after the airport,” Lonazco said. “The attorney before the airport event would tell you, ‘OK, you can fly with your passport, you’ll be fine. Keep on with your life.’ But after, it’s like, ‘Don’t go anywhere. Don’t fly out of state.’” 
She also advises clients at risk of deportation to avoid driving to Zion National Park, because the sheriff’s office in neighboring Washington County has a formal partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement known as a 287(g) agreement.
Lonazco said she tries to avoid instilling more fear in clients, but has new advice for those whose travel plans cause her concern:  “just try to find joy within home.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/saltlakecityairport_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

(Annie Knox/Utah News Dispatch)On an early December weekend hundreds of Latinos congregated at a Salt Lake Community College conference center in Sandy. Tables were set in a fair-like style, the smell of a mixture of perfume samples saturated the air, the hot pink and bright yellow of Venezuelan snack packaging and stress balls from an immigration law firm decorated some areas.
A voice with a Maracaibo accent announced an upcoming raffle for a piece of pernil-style pork, a traditional Christmas dish every hour, this year’s initiative at the annual Christmas celebration hosted by Utahzolanos, a social media outlet and community.
The event has been a tradition kept for five years. But this time, amid stronger immigration enforcement tactics deployed by the Trump administration, and increasing immigration arrests in the state, the sentiment and tone around the event changed.

Organizers modeled the party into an event in support of the community, said Patricia Quiñonez, who runs Utahzolanos. However, she said, it still was “a chance to cheer each other on, to give each other strength.”
Fewer people showed up this year, Quiñonez said. Still, about 2,000 came, which is about 1,000 less than what the organization had seen in past years.
“We are happy because we expected fear to prevail over the call, the invitation to attend,” she said.
This year’s Christmas party had Santa Claus hats, toys, crafts and gifts. However, the busiest tables were those of immigration law firms offering free consultations. 
But, other events, like Utahzolanos’ New Year’s party, an often-sold out event where over 1,000 people gather for food and music, was almost canceled as ticket sales languished. The traditional celebration ultimately came together, but with 60% fewer attendees this year.
“We didn’t want to lose the tradition we’ve had for the past five years,” she said. “The families who didn’t come told us they were afraid to attend a predominantly Latino event that might attract the attention of ICE.”
Venezuelans living in the U.S. have felt a particularly heavy impact since the second Trump administration took power. The Temporary Protection Status, a protection from deportation that Trump granted Venezuelans during his first term, has been eliminated, abruptly leaving about 600,000 Venezuelans without work permits, driver’s licenses or permission to remain in the country. In all, more than 1.5 million people lost legal status in 2025.
Quiñonez says many of her group’s followers have said they are self-deporting out of fear of being detained and separated from their families. Others have voluntarily left the country after the detention of the breadwinner.

“It’s not just people who have been here for two, or three years. We are talking about friends who applied for asylum 10, eight, seven years ago,” Quiñonez said in Spanish, adding that many feel worn out by how cases are playing out in immigration courts. 
In October, the Department of Homeland Security reported that 1.6 million people had voluntarily self-deported since President Donald Trump reclaimed the White House.
“Fear is overcoming faith or the choice of moving forward with immigration cases,” she said.
Since Venezuela and the U.S. don’t share a diplomatic relation, first-generation Americans born in Venezuelan families aren’t able to receive a visa to Venezuela to join their parents if they are deported. 
Some of those who decide to stay have begun limiting their routines — Latin restaurants have become off-limits for many fearing an ICE raid. And some churches have low attendance on Sundays, as well, she said. Immigration attorneys have started advising their clients to restrict travel, a new recommendation stemming from a high-profile ICE arrest at the Salt Lake City airport.
However, in the last three months, Quiñonez has also seen Latino entrepreneurs opening businesses, including restaurants, barber shops, insurance companies and car dealerships, she said. 
But, amid these sparks of hope in the Latin community, immigrants remain uncertain about whether immigration enforcement will turn more aggressive in Utah, especially now with reports naming Utah the home of an upcoming 10,000-bed ICE detention facility. 
“It makes you wonder, if that 10,000-people capacity means that they’ll be stricter. Will they search for more people to be at that detention center?” Quiñonez said.
‘The fear isn’t exclusively quarantined just to Latinos’
Like other owners of establishments with international offerings, for a naturalized American business owner with warehouse operations in Salt Lake City, watching how ICE raids developed in 2025 makes him feel “completely uncomfortable.”
While the business owner is an American citizen, with tensions lingering in the immigrant community, he asked not to be identified for fear of becoming an ICE target.
“Their program is to remove criminals from our communities, but our community is suffering because they don’t pause and take the time to respect human rights,” he said, adding that officers have often detained people without a criminal record. “It’s terrible for our communities, and it’s terrible for any industries where immigrants and minorities are working.”
Anecdotally, there hasn’t been a massive mobilization across Hispanic businesses in the state, said Victoria Petro, a Salt Lake City Council member and executive director of the Utah Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. But, this federal administration’s tactics instill fear among communities in the state.
“People are more susceptible to false alarms and anecdotes, right?” Petro said. “So it just creates kind of a jumpiness and a difficulty for our people to understand, where is truth? Where is credible information?”



Let us know what you think...


 


The immigration enforcement operations have also brought a chilling effect to Utah Hispanic establishments — mostly from anxiety about spending money in Latin businesses in fear of being detained, even with a legal immigration status, she said.
“If I’m a consumer, and I go to a market that caters predominantly to the Hispanic community, ‘la migra’ might show up there a lot more readily than they’re going to show up at Smith’s,” Petro said. “So we’re seeing a transfer of buying power to a more dominant paradigm, and it’s more difficult to aggregate audiences and consumers in places where they worry they might be profiled.”
With more Latin consumers saving up for emergencies and avoiding Hispanic establishments, the conversation around immigration enforcement in the chamber has been ongoing, Petro said, with many businesses aiming to determine how to maintain consumer bases with this threat. 
“I was just with a business the other day that showed me their year-over-year, their expenses have skyrocketed and their revenues have gone down,” she said.
And, not only Hispanic-owned businesses have suffered the impact of the federal operations. 
“We’ve seen an influx from construction companies who are looking into membership with us to stand with us, and to try to stay up to date as to what they’re facing in labor supply,” Petro said, “So the fear isn’t exclusively quarantined just to Latinos. It’s being shared now by the dominant paradigm as well.”
The Salt Lake City business owner still hopes his staff doesn’t feel targeted just for the fact his business has Mexican origins. He has done some planning, ensuring that everyone knows their rights in the case an immigration officer comes knocking on his business’ door. But, he’s not making a big fuss out of it, especially since not every employee that works for him “happens to be Mexican,” he said.
His job, he said, is to run his business, “not to create chaos.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4962-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

“The premise behind this is to make sure that every child in the state of Alabama, especially with the emphasis on the Literacy Act and other programs that have recently been implemented, but to make sure that every child in the state of Alabama has access to books and to help them develop a love for learning,” Kitchens said in a recent interview.

Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is a book gifting program that mails free “high quality books” to children regardless of their families income. The initiative was started in 1995 by Parton to distribute books to families in Sevier County, TN. In 2000, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library became a nationwide program.
Gov. Kay Ivey launched a statewide expansion of Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library in 2023. The prefiled bill makes no changes to the program but codifies an executive order Ivey signed in 2023 to establish the statewide expansion of the Imagination Library.
State funds will make up half of the funding for the program, while local partner programs will make up the other half.
Collins filed a similar bill in the House during the 2025 legislative session. It did not pass through the Senate due to time constraints. 
Under the legislation, the Alabama Imagination Library will be managed by the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education (ADECE). The department will also be required to work with a nonprofit agency to operate the program and create rules as needed.
Private donations are also allowed to be contributed to help fund the program.
“When you pass legislation, more people are going to hear about it, so more families with young children will be able to sign up. They’ll be more informed about it, and then local groups or individuals that are looking for something to support, they can see the benefits of this, and so they can choose to support it,” Collins said in a recent interview.
The books provided for the children must be considered age appropriate.  
“Age appropriate when they’re very young, would be those big, almost cardboard pages, so that their little fingers can turn them by themselves,” Collins said “And they may have more touch, and there’ll be less as they get a little bit older. They’ll still be simple books, but there’ll be some that they can start recognizing some of the words and some of the things that go with the pictures.”
On Dec. 1, Ivey said in a statement that 2 million books have been distributed by Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library to children in all 67 counties in the state. The statement also said over 106,000 children are enrolled in the program.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wes-Kitchens-May-8-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

Gavin Newsom's State of the State address may hint at how he'll balance his last year as governor with his presidential campaign image.,"Political California cranked up for the New Year Monday.
The Legislature reconvened after a 114-day recess, Gov. Gavin Newsom renewed his nascent campaign for president and the dozen or so men and women who covet his job continued to seek ways to reach a so-far-uninterested electorate.
Newsom’s interview Monday on MS NOW, the cable channel beloved by Democratic politicians and activist voters, implied anew that his final year as governor will be dominated by his all-but-certain bid for the White House in 2028. He spent much it criticizing President Donald Trump for refusing aid to Los Angeles fire victims and cracking down on undocumented immigrants.
Newsom’s preoccupation will color whatever he and the Legislature do about a deficit-ridden state budget and a half-dozen or so other stubborn issues that have emerged or become more acute since Newsom took office seven years ago.
In past years Newsom has been lackadaisical about delivering the annual State of the State message to the Legislature that the state constitution requires. But he’ll perform the chore later this week, then unveil his response to the projections of semi-permanent, multi-billion-dollar deficits.
Gabe Petek, the Legislature’s budget analyst, sees an immediate $18 billion gap between income and outgo that could mushroom to $35 billion if not closed. He’s warned that Newsom and legislators can’t count on a sluggish economy to solve their problem.
They have used a variety of gimmicks, including raids on emergency reserves, off-the-books loans and deceptive accounting gambits to stave off the day of fiscal reckoning, but the shortfall, born of overspending revenues, has continued.
“If our estimates hold, the Legislature will face a fourth consecutive year of budget problems — all during a period of overall revenue growth,” Petek said in a November analysis. “As it stands — with larger forecasted deficits and many fewer tools available to address them — California’s budget is undeniably less prepared for downturns.”
The Legislature’s leaders, pressed by a powerful progressive contingent, don’t want to reduce the health care and income support services they so willingly enacted after Newsom declared, erroneously, that the state had a $97.5 billion surplus three years ago.
Progressives and their allies in public employee unions and other left-of-center groups want to close the budget gap with new taxes and are sponsoring two ballot measures, one to extend a surtax on the highest-income taxpayers that’s due to expire and a second to impose a new wealth tax on the state’s billionaires.
Newsom has steadfastly rejected tax increases to deal with the deficit, unwilling, obviously, to become a pro-tax presidential candidate. But neither has he offered, so far, anything other than gimmicks to solve the problem his wildly off-base 2022 surplus declaration created.
The state’s stubborn budget deficit is just one of the issues that continue to defy resolution as Newsom’s final year begins. Other issues include high levels of homelessness and poverty, a housing shortage that’s just as acute as when he took office in 2019, an insurance crisis born of chronic wildfires, a woebegone bullet train project, soaring costs of living, persistent water supply uncertainties and a looming shortage of gasoline as refineries close due to hostile state regulation.
On top of everything, California’s $4 trillion economy is more or less stuck in neutral, with the nation’s highest unemployment rate, no net job growth since the COVID-19 pandemic and severe employment cutbacks in signature sectors, such as film and TV production technology.
The stark existence of such issues during Newsom’s final year as governor is not only a potential drag on his presidential campaign, but it colors the cast-of-thousands campaigns to elect a successor.
Will the would-be Democratic governors be willing to point out Newsom’s leftover issues — especially the budget deficit — and tell voters how they would approach the challenge? Or would they merely joust over who can be the loudest?",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010526-Newsom-BB-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

Dina Titus. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Nevada’s sole Republican congressman, Rep. Mark Amodei, had as of Monday evening yet to comment on the military capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro or President Donald Trump’s assertion the country and its oil production industry are under U.S. control.  
Maduro and his wife, captured Saturday in Caracas by an elite U.S. military squad, entered pleas of not guilty Monday in New York to charges of trafficking cocaine. 
Amodei’s office did not respond to a request for comment Monday. His silence comes as Nevada’s Democratic congressional delegates are calling out Trump for deploying the military for a criminal matter and for engaging in regime change and nation-building, policies Trump has previously decried. 
“Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure,” Trump said while campaigning in 2016. 
Maduro “was a brutal dictator who deserves no sympathy,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said on social media. “But the Trump Administration using American service members to overthrow a foreign leader it has criminally indicted under U.S. law sets a dangerous precedent.”
Trump, she said, “made a dangerous decision to bypass Congress with his actions in Venezuela, and so far he has offered no real details on plans for the future other than a vague assertion that the ‘United States will be running the country.’” 
The prosecution of Maduro, Cortez Masto added, “contradicts” Trump’s pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was found guilty by a federal jury of conspiring to traffic cocaine and sentenced to 40 years in prison. He was released last month as a result of Trump’s pardon. 
On Monday, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president in Maduro’s absence. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, laid out a scenario that more closely resembles a military takeover than the criminal apprehension of two individuals.
“We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” Miller said. “By definition, we are in charge, because we have the United States military stationed outside the country. We set the terms and conditions. We have a complete embargo on all of their oil and their ability to do commerce. So for them to do commerce, they need our permission. For them to be able to run an economy, they need our permission.” 
Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Maduro an “illegitimate and brutal dictator” but noted only Congress has the power to declare war. “This illegal regime change operation won’t make our country safer and risks destabilizing the region, dragging us into additional military conflicts, and increasing the amount of immigrants seeking refuge at our border.”
Trump’s administration needs to “explain why it lied when it claimed in its briefings that regime change wasn’t the U.S. goal in Venezuela,” Rosen said, and urged Congress to pass Senator Tim Kaine’s (D-Virginia) War Powers Resolution “to prohibit Donald Trump from carrying out additional strikes without our input.”
In a statement issued Saturday, Rep. Dina Titus, a former Political Science professor at UNLV, detailed more than half a century of U.S. regime change efforts in Latin America. 
“In each case, our long-term interests were not advanced, regional relationships were damaged, and the Hemisphere saw more turmoil and violence, not less, “ she said. “Instead of learning from history, President Trump has perpetuated a failed foreign policy.”
The Trump administration’s action, Titus said, “is clearly based largely on the desire to take over Venezuela’s oil.”
The U.S. invasion of a sovereign nation, she added, “opens the door for Xi Jinping to do the same in Taiwan and lends legitimacy to Vladimir Putin’s goals in Ukraine.” Titus said Trump, who calls himself “the ‘President of Peace’ has once again shown that he is the ‘Commander-in-Chaos.’”
Titus faces challenges in 2026 from six Republicans, including State Sen. Carrie Buck, who did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s takeover of Venezuela. 
Rep. Susie Lee, also a Democrat, said Maduro’s capture raises “more questions for the Trump Administration than answers. The American people are opposed to another forever war.”
Lee noted that taking control of Venezuela is “an act of war, not a law-enforcement activity, and requires Congressional authorization and clear legal authority, neither of which the Administration has been given.” 
Three Republicans vying to replace Lee are praising Trump’s actions. 
Dr. Aury Nagy praised Trump’s “decisive leadership” but a spokesman was unable to say whether Nagy supports putting U.S. troops in Venezuela. 
Marty O’Donnell, who is prioritizing affordability in his campaign, commended Trump and the military for taking decisive action without loss of life to Americans. 
Dr. Jeff Gunter, who served as an ambassador during Trump’s first term, praised the military action that resulted in Maduro’s capture as a “’lawful, moral, and necessary’ step to protect American families from drug cartels and liberate Venezuela from socialist tyranny.”
Gunter is best known in political circles for an attack ad in the 2024 Republican primary race for U.S. Senate, in which he portrayed fellow Republican Sam Brown as a swamp creature. Brown was disfigured by an improvised explosive device in 2008 in Afghanistan, where he was serving in the U.S. Army. 
Gunter did not respond when asked whether he supports U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela. 
Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, echoed colleagues in asserting Trump’s actions “appeared to be driven largely by access to Venezuela’s oil resources.”
“Nevadans struggling through the Trump Slump get no relief from another reckless attempt at nation-building abroad,” he said. “President Trump is occupying Venezuela for corporate oil profits while the American people are clamoring for affordability relief here at home.”
David Flippo, one of several Republicans seeking to oust Horsford, praised Trump’s actions. In a statement, the former Air Force commander said Trump acted “exactly how the Commander-in-Chief is supposed to act…” 
He did not respond when asked whether he supports prolonged U.S. involvement and troops in Venezuela. 
Cody Whipple, another Republican seeking to represent Horsford’s Congressional District 4, applauded Trump’s capture of Maduro.
“Operations like this send a clear and unmistakable message: the United States will not tolerate criminal regimes poisoning our communities with fentanyl and other deadly drugs,” Whipple said in a statement. He did not say whether he supports deploying U.S. troops to Venezuela.

We reached out to all the stakeholders from the sheriff’s department, the fire department, the police department, the county and the League of Municipalities, on how to get the services to the individuals when they need them,” Treadaway said in an interview after a meeting of the commission on Monday. “I think we’ve accomplished that. I think that they’re going to be able to get those services.”

According to the Mayo Clinic, both the symptoms of PTSD and when they arise can vary from person to person. Typically, symptoms appear within the first three months of the traumatic event, but it could also take years and last for a year, or more. Symptoms are grouped into four categories, according to the clinic: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions.
According to a 2023 study, about 1% of all suicides in the United States between 2015 and 2017 were first responders. Most of them were law enforcement officers, followed by firefighters.
The report is not available to the public until it is submitted to the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. The commission has until Jan. 15 to do so. But Legislative Attorney Jeff Condra walked members of the commission through its contents on Monday. 
“The overall purpose of the report is to demonstrate to the Senate president pro tem and to the House speaker that the commission was faithful to its charge,” Condra said.
Condra said the report contains the discussions of the commission’s October and November meetings. It also includes the findings of a survey the commission sent to first responders and veterans across the state.
“There are key insights from the survey responses that were gleaned by the study commission: the need for better communication to first responders about available mental health resources, the fact that health insurance is provided through the local government, their health care insurance program does include mental health treatment, the importance of peer support, and the fact that a lot of these current problems kind of operate in isolation from one another,” Condra said. “Which means that there could be a lot of inefficiency, and there can be gaps in what we might call the continuum of care.”
The report also includes a communication plan from the Alabama Department of Mental Health (ADMH) that aims to increase awareness of available resources. 
“This plan focuses on the existing resources so that it’s easier for them to be told about it, and then actually access those resources,” Malissa Valdes, public information officer for ADMH, told the commission on Monday.
Valdes said ADMH will measure the success of the communication plan by tracking usage of the 988 suicide hotline, downloads of the Connect Alabama app and social media analytics. 
“We feel people will actually utilize this in order to reduce stigma, actually go out there and get help, create the mental health resilience that they need in order to help with PTSD,” she said.
Treadaway, who was a police officer for 31 years, said that awareness of resources is the biggest issue and that he learned about many programs through the commission.
“I think what we’re learning each year is that mental health has a lot of challenges, and the state of Alabama and the Legislature is ready to meet those challenges,” Treadaway said in an interview after the meeting.
Treadaway said additional legislation is possible but not guaranteed for the 2026 legislative session, which begins on Jan. 13.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5915-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

Dan Caine at Mar-a-Lago Saturday, January 3, 2026. (Official White House Photo by Molly Riley)An image circulated over media the weekend of Jan. 3 and 4 was meant to convey dominance: Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, blindfolded and handcuffed aboard a U.S. naval vessel. Shortly after the operation that seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would now “run” Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be arranged.
The Trump administration’s move is not an aberration; it reflects a broader trend in U.S. foreign policy I described here some six years ago as “America the Bully.”
Washington increasingly relies on coercion – military, economic and political – not only to deter adversaries but to compel compliance from weaker nations. This may deliver short-term obedience, but it is counterproductive as a strategy for building durable power, which depends on legitimacy and capacity. When coercion is applied to governance, it can harden resistance, narrow diplomatic options and transform local political failures into contests of national pride.
There is no dispute that Maduro’s dictatorship led to Venezuela’s catastrophic collapse. Under his rule, Venezuela’s economy imploded, democratic institutions were hollowed out, criminal networks fused with the state, and millions fled the country – many for the United States.
But removing a leader – even a brutal and incompetent one – is not the same as advancing a legitimate political order.
 Force doesn’t equal legitimacy

By declaring its intent to govern Venezuela, the United States is creating a governance trap of its own making – one in which external force is mistakenly treated as a substitute for domestic legitimacy.
I write as a scholar of international security, civil wars and U.S. foreign policy, and as author of “Dying by the Sword,” which examines why states repeatedly reach for military solutions, and why such interventions rarely produce durable peace.
The core finding of that research is straightforward: Force can topple rulers, but it cannot generate political authority.
When violence and what I have described elsewhere as “kinetic diplomacy” become a substitute for full spectrum action – which includes diplomacy, economics and what the late political scientist Joseph Nye called “soft power” – it tends to deepen instability rather than resolve it.
 More force, less statecraft

The Venezuela episode reflects this broader shift in how the United States uses its power. My co-author Sidita Kushi and I document this by analyzing detailed data from the new Military Intervention Project. We show that since the end of the Cold War, the United States has sharply increased the frequency of military interventions while systematically underinvesting in diplomacy and other tools of statecraft.
One striking feature of the trends we uncover is that if Americans tended to justify excessive military intervention during the Cold War between 1945–1989 due to the perception that the Soviet Union was an existential threat, what we would expect is far fewer military interventions following the Soviet Union’s 1991 collapse. That has not happened.
Even more striking, the mission profile has changed. Interventions that once aimed at short-term stabilization now routinely expand into prolonged governance and security management, as they did in both Iraq after 2003 and Afghanistan after 2001.
This pattern is reinforced by institutional imbalance. In 2026, for every single dollar the United States invests in the diplomatic “scalpel” of the State Department to prevent conflict, it allocates US$28 to the military “hammer” of the Department of Defense, effectively ensuring that force becomes a first rather than last resort.
“Kinetic diplomacy” – in the Venezuela case, regime change by force – becomes the default not because it is more effective, but because it is the only tool of statecraft immediately available. On Jan. 4, Trump told the Atlantic magazine that if Delcy Rodríguez, the acting leader of Venezuela, “doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”
 Lessons from Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya

The consequences of this imbalance are visible across the past quarter-century.
In Afghanistan, the U.S.-led attempt to engineer authority built on external force alone proved brittle by its very nature. The U.S. had invaded Afghanistan in 2001 to topple the Taliban regime, deemed responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But the subsequent two decades of foreign-backed state-building collapsed almost instantly once U.S. forces withdrew in 2021. No amount of reconstruction spending could compensate for the absence of a political order rooted in domestic consent.
Following the invasion by the U.S. and surrender of Iraq’s armed forces in 2003, both the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Defense proposed plans for Iraq’s transition to a stable democratic nation. President George W. Bush gave the nod to the Defense Department’s plan.
That plan, unlike the State Department’s, ignored key cultural, social and historical conditions. Instead, it proposed an approach that assumed a credible threat to use coercion, supplemented by private contractors, would prove sufficient to lead to a rapid and effective transition to a democratic Iraq. The United States became responsible not only for security, but also for electricity, water, jobs and political reconciliation – tasks no foreign power can perform without becoming, as the United States did, an object of resistance.
Libya demonstrated a different failure mode. There, intervention by a U.S.-backed NATO force in 2011 and removal of dictator Moammar Gadhafi and his regime were not followed by governance at all. The result was civil war, fragmentation, militia rule and a prolonged struggle over sovereignty and economic development that continues today.
The common thread across all three cases is hubris: the belief that American management – either limited or oppressive – could replace political legitimacy.
Venezuela’s infrastructure is already in ruins. If the United States assumes responsibility for governance, it will be blamed for every blackout, every food shortage and every bureaucratic failure. The liberator will quickly become the occupier.
 Costs of ‘running’ a country

Taking on governance in Venezuela would also carry broader strategic costs, even if those costs are not the primary reason the strategy would fail.
A military attack followed by foreign administration is a combination that undermines the principles of sovereignty and nonintervention that underpin the international order the United States claims to support. It complicates alliance diplomacy by forcing partners to reconcile U.S. actions with the very rules they are trying to defend elsewhere.
The United States has historically been strongest when it anchored an open sphere built on collaboration with allies, shared rules and voluntary alignment. Launching a military operation and then assuming responsibility for governance shifts Washington toward a closed, coercive model of power – one that relies on force to establish authority and is prohibitively costly to sustain over time.
These signals are read not only in Berlin, London and Paris. They are watched closely in Taipei, Tokyo and Seoul — and just as carefully in Beijing and Moscow.
When the United States attacks a sovereign state and then claims the right to administer it, it weakens its ability to contest rival arguments that force alone, rather than legitimacy, determines political authority.
Beijing needs only to point to U.S. behavior to argue that great powers rule as they please where they can – an argument that can justify the takeover of Taiwan. Moscow, likewise, can cite such precedent to justify the use of force in its near abroad and not just in Ukraine.
This matters in practice, not theory. The more the United States normalizes unilateral governance, the easier it becomes for rivals to dismiss American appeals to sovereignty as selective and self-serving, and the more difficult it becomes for allies to justify their ties to the U.S.
That erosion of credibility does not produce dramatic rupture, but it steadily narrows the space for cooperation over time and the advancement of U.S. interests and capabilities.
Force is fast. Legitimacy is slow. But legitimacy is the only currency that buys durable peace and stability – both of which remain enduring U.S. interests.
If Washington governs by force in Venezuela, it will repeat the failures of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya: Power can topple regimes, but it cannot create political authority. Outside rule invites resistance, not stability.

Wired for Profit: Second in a series about Alabama Power’s influence over electric rates, renewable energy, pollution and politics in the Yellowhammer State.
There’s a curious sight on the far-left wall of the Alabama Public Service Commission’s main hearing room.
Framed 8-by-10-inch photos of the previous commissioners dating back to 1881 line the wall. The photos are black and white. The commissioners are just white, but that’s not the strange part.
The strange part is that in the bottom left quadrant of the photo wall, directly above the most recent former commissioner, Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, hangs the smiling mug of one of the most notorious faces in Alabama history.

Eugene “Bull” Connor, the former Birmingham police commissioner whose brutal suppression of civil rights demonstrations with police dogs and firehoses drew worldwide condemnation, stares back at the observer with his slicked-back white hair, horn-rimmed glasses and the slight vestige of a smile.
Connor, after his presence became an untenable black eye for the city of Birmingham, was shuffled off to Montgomery and the Alabama Public Service Commission, where he served as PSC president from 1965-1973.
Alabama’s civil rights history is inescapable, even in places most people wouldn’t expect. Their electric bills, for example.
George Wallace, the four-term governor who famously stood in the schoolhouse door in an attempt to prevent Black students from enrolling at the University of Alabama, was never on the commission, but may be as responsible as any single political figure for the state of Alabama’s electric regulation today.
That’s because throughout the 1970s, when crying “segregation forever” was no longer a viable political strategy, Wallace needed a new target for his brand of populist demagoguery. He found it in Alabama Power.
Wallace railed against what he called Alabama Power’s “exorbitant rates” for years, attempting to thwart or delay nearly every rate increase or construction project the company proposed. That campaign turned the state’s regulatory environment into a circus, pushed the state’s largest utility to the verge of bankruptcy and provoked a backlash that still clouds the ratemaking process
David Rountree worked at the PSC for 12 years in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, including stints as chief of staff or principal advisor for three different commissioners. Rountree said Wallace’s actions still reverberated through the PSC building decades later. Years before joining the PSC staff, Rountree had actually covered some of the hearings as a reporter for the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper.
“Those rate hearings were just a nightmare,” Rountree told Inside Climate News. “Nobody wanted to get sent over to have to cover a PSC rate hearing. It was like, ‘Can you just pull my fingernails out?’ And they would last for months on end.”
After years of Wallace’s chaotic attacks on the system, the PSC snapped back hard in the other direction. The commissioners attempted to create a system that would take political chaos out of utility ratemaking and prevent another George Wallace from hijacking the regulatory process. Rate increases were put on “autopilot,” Rountree said, going up automatically whenever Alabama Power’s earnings fell below a certain percentage.
The commission voted to approve the new system, called rate stabilization and equalization, or RSE, in 1982. That was the last time Alabama Power held a formal rate case that nearly all other states require. The RSE process did its job of averting contentious and costly rate cases, but there were serious side effects. One, according to environmentalists and public interest lawyers, has been a lack of transparency and almost any meaningful public participation.
The public rate cases that had become so toxic under Wallace had been eliminated, but those hearings served as the best method for the public to gain insight into how their power bills were calculated, and which utility decisions they were paying for. Now the public and advocate groups have to fight and claw for information that is public and easily accessible in other jurisdictions.
In a 2013 white paper titled “Public Utility Regulation without the Public,” the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis writes that Alabama’s RSE process “allows Alabama Power to adjust its charges each year without any public evidentiary hearings and, indeed, without any participation by ratepaying consumers whatsoever other than off-the-record and after-the-fact comments at an informal hearing that completely lacks public transparency.”
The paper states that only Louisiana and Mississippi have similar processes for utility regulation, but notes that those states have more “meaningful opportunities for public involvement.”
A spokesperson for Alabama Power told Inside Climate News that the RSE process still ensures oversight over the company, even if it differs from other states.
“Alabama’s Rate RSE framework provides continuous, formula-based oversight with monthly filings, annual PSC review, and automatic refunds or adjustments when earnings fall outside the approved range,” Alabama Power said. “Different structure does not equal lack of regulation.”
The Alabama Public Service Commission is in the process of completing its required review of Rate RSE that takes place every six years. It is not clear when the findings of that review will be made public.
“Following the review process engaged in by staff with representatives from Alabama Power and the Alabama Attorney General’s office, staff will consult with the Commission and provide an assessment of the effectiveness of Rate RSE and discuss any potential modifications deemed necessary,” a PSC spokesman said in an email. “The Commission will determine whether any further course or courses of action are necessary based on those consultations with staff. Any determination regarding the need for outside input will not be made until the Commission has made an assessment of the findings compiled by staff.”
Alabama Power went from the precipice of bankruptcy to being one of the most stable and profitable utilities in the country. But its customers shouldered the highest total electric bills in the country last year, according to an Inside Climate News analysis, and pay the highest electric rates in the Southeast.
Advocates who have criticized Alabama Power’s high returns point to the RSE process as a key reason that the company’s profits are so high.
Here’s how it happened.

George Wallace v. the Power Company

To say Wallace was popular in Alabama through the 1960s and ‘70s is an enormous understatement. He was elected governor of Alabama four times from 1962 to 1982, bouncing in and out of the governorship as term limits allowed. He didn’t leave the governor’s office for good until 1987.
In 1966, the Alabama constitution did not allow governors to serve consecutive terms, blocking Wallace from seeking reelection. So Wallace’s wife, Lurleen Wallace, ran for governor in his stead, explicitly stating that her husband would stay in control. Her name appeared on the ballot as “Mrs. George C. Wallace,” and she won handily, winning the primary without a runoff and garnering 63 percent of the general election vote. Alabama would not elect another female governor until 2018.
Lurleen Wallace died of cancer 16 months into her term, casting the Wallaces temporarily out of the governor’s office. Doctors reportedly told Wallace of his wife’s cancer as early as 1961, but he insisted she not be told, delaying any possible treatment for years. She remained unaware of her condition until 1965, when a different doctor told her directly. Despite her condition, she handled a rigorous campaign schedule throughout 1966, but her health began to deteriorate shortly after taking office.
Lurleen Wallace died in 1968. That same year, Alabama voters approved a constitutional amendment to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms, setting the stage for George Wallace to run and win in 1970, 1974 and 1982.
In 1970, as Wallace campaigned to retake the governor’s office after his first interregnum, he campaigned against “banks and utilities and the rich on Wall Street who don’t pay their taxes,” former Newsweek columnist Stewart Alsop wrote at the time.
Alsop added that Wallace’s “attacks on the big newspapers, the banks, and the utilities account for that electric current in his shirt-sleeved crowds at least as much as the race issue.”
After his reelection, Wallace hired well-known attorney Maurice Bishop to formally intervene in the rate cases at the PSC. A handful of commissioners elected in the next several years had close ties to Wallace or at least shared his views on Alabama Power’s rates.

Meanwhile, Wallace held rallies and gave televised speeches criticizing the power company and called multiple special sessions of the legislature in unsuccessful attempts to give the governor’s office and/or the Alabama Supreme Court the power to directly overrule the PSC on electricity rates. Wallace was unwilling to compromise on any of those issues, which never advanced past the state Senate. He blamed Alabama Power for wielding “undue influence” over senators who balked at his proposals. Some of the senators pushed back.
“George Wallace had made a career out of raising emotional issues and demagoging his way into office,” state Sen. Joe Fine said, according to the Montgomery Advertiser. “First he used the race issue, black against white, but [now] that’s run out.”
In June 1976, the PSC rejected a rate increase request from Alabama Power, which the company’s president Joseph Farley called “shocking and dismaying.” The company appealed the PSC’s decision to the Montgomery County Circuit Court, which ordered the PSC to grant at least a partial increase. Alabama Power appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court.
The pattern would continue for several years, with rate cases bouncing between the PSC and the courts, and with Alabama Power repeatedly filing emergency rate cases before the courts had ruled on its previous rate increases.
People angry over their electric bills were bussed to PSC meetings from across the state. PSC hearings were moved to larger venues to accommodate the crowds.
Financial firm Standard and Poor’s dropped Alabama Power’s credit rating from A- to BBB. The company was forced to rely on high interest, short-term loans to stay afloat due to the long lag between rate increase decisions.

1977: ‘The terrible year’

In the book “Developed for the Service of Alabama,” a company history published by Alabama Power in 2006, historian Leah Rawls Atkins calls 1977 “the terrible year,” though 1978 and 1979 may have even been worse.
Skyrocketing prices caused by inflation and the oil embargo were creating huge costs for the company, and the clashes in Montgomery put the company on its most perilous financial footing since its early days of existence.
In January, an emergency rate case hearing was relocated to Montgomery’s Garrett Coliseum, where huge crowds packed the arena for what was, by most accounts, a circus.
Media reports at the time estimated the crowd ranging from 800 to 2,000 people, more or less evenly split between those who supported Alabama Power’s rate increases—power company employees, steelworkers, construction workers, economic development officials—and those who opposed the increases.
More than 50 witnesses testified, ranging from Alabama Power executives and expert witnesses to everyday Alabamians worried about their ability to pay higher bills in times of economic downturn and inflation.
Stewart B. Clifford, a senior vice president at Citibank, testified as a representative of a nine-bank syndicate that had granted Alabama Power $350 million in short-term loans over two years.
“None of them are willing, under present conditions, to extend any additional credit to Alabama Power,” Clifford said, according to The Birmingham News.
Meanwhile, numerous residents, many elderly, testified that they would not be able to pay their power bills if the increase were approved. So did construction workers who said they would be laid off if Alabama Power were not allowed to build the infrastructure it was planning.
One of the commissioners stated he believed the rate increase to be illegal because a previous rate increase was still awaiting judgment in the Alabama Supreme Court.
At one point in the two-day hearing, officials resorted to playing Simon and Garfunkel’s “Bridge Over Troubled Water” over the PA system to ease the tensions.
In the end, the PSC approved a smaller increase than the company asked for, but the struggles continued for the next two years.
In 1978, after Alabama Power reported a dramatic drop in earnings due to the newly constructed Joseph M. Farley nuclear power plant, the PSC approved an emergency rate increase to steady the ship in November, after that year’s elections. Wallace appealed and got a court to issue an injunction blocking the rate increase.
In December, the company filed a request for an emergency $288.8 million rate increase, saying its return on equity had fallen to a “disastrous” 4.5 percent.
According to Rawls’ book, Alabama Power responded by freezing officer salaries, cutting back construction projects and paying its bills only on an as-needed basis. The company sold five of its buildings with agreements to rent the spaces instead, freeing up cash, but losing out in the long run.
In January 1979, the Alabama Supreme Court denied Alabama Power’s motion to lift the injunction blocking its rate increase. The court found the PSC’s rate increases null and void and dismissed all appeals.
Rawls’ book quotes Alabama Power comptroller Jack Minor as saying the company had $45 million in unpaid bills and was unable to borrow money or sell stocks or bonds to cover them. He reported stacked invoices on his desk, not to be paid “until someone demands payment.”
The company put word out that it would remember which vendors were forgiving of its struggles, and which were not. Rawls says that there were some major suppliers that showed a “lack of support during this critical time,” and that Alabama Power “never did business with them again.”
Alan Martin, who held many executive positions in Alabama Power, including senior vice president, said executives in the company who experienced those times came out stronger for it.
“The enduring effect was positive,” Martin said in Rawls’ book. “Those who lived through those years were like the World War II generation. We were tougher. Our leadership has been real conservative, but when the company is criticized, we are quick to jump like a tiger to defend it.”

A solution emerges

By 1982, it was clear that the situation was untenable. Even Wallace and those in his administration conceded that something had to change.
Billy Joe Camp, Wallace’s former advisor and spokesman, had been elected PSC president, and he and the other commissioners implemented the rate stabilization and equalization system.
The goal of the system was to put utility ratemaking on autopilot, removing the possibility of messy rate case battles and political grandstanding that dominated the previous decade.
“At times the rate structure was used as a political football,” Camp said, according to the Associated Press. “I was part of that irresponsibility sometimes. We had to get to a new environment.”
An approved rate of return range was set for Alabama Power at 13 to 14.5 percent of the value of its common equity. Every December, if the company’s earnings for the coming year were projected to fall below that range, rates would go up automatically in January. If the company earned more in the course of the year than its allowed range, some of that money would be refunded to customers the next year.
The new system did not require a vote by the commission to increase rates, nor were there any public rate hearings or formal testimony from the utility on its revenue. In trying to stop political manipulation of the rate system, the PSC nearly removed the public from the process altogether, limiting the opportunities for public engagement or even understanding of the ratemaking process.

Instead, the PSC hosts informal hearings each year in December. The company presents its latest revenue figures for the year in progress and projections for the coming year, as well details about its environmental compliance plans for the next five years.
Company representatives answer questions from PSC staff, the attorney general’s office or members of the public, but they are not under oath as they would be in a formal rate case. The commissioners, if they attend, sit in the audience with everyone else. Proceedings are not streamed online, as regular PSC meetings are.
Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, attends the informal sessions on behalf of SELC clients, asking questions about Alabama Power’s profits, or issues like renewable energy adoption, coal ash cleanup plans, energy efficiency or electric vehicle charging programs offered by the company.
The one-day hearing typically lasts about four hours.
“The informal meetings held in December are the only opportunity for the public to ask Alabama Power questions about its environmental compliance costs or its profits,” Tidwell said in an email. “They are limited in scope—there is no discovery or opportunity to offer expert testimony and Alabama Power’s witnesses are not under oath. There is also no transcript of the meeting.
“It’s unclear to me what role these hearings play in overall utility regulation.”

High interest rates preserved for decades

One criticism of the RSE process is that utility return rates were locked in at 1982 rates for more than 40 years. And the early 1980s featured the highest interest rates since at least the 1950s thanks to inflation control measures taken by the Federal Reserve.
As Alabama Power demonstrated during its turbulent times in the 1970s, a utility company needs to earn returns higher than benchmark interest rates in order to attract investors to fund its operations and construction projects. If investors can get similar returns on government bonds, there’s little incentive to wade into the slightly riskier waters of utility companies, where politicians could scuttle or delay needed rate increases.
In 1981, the U.S. average interest rate spiked to 16.38 percent, dropping to 12.26 percent in 1982. But after 1982, interest rates dropped sharply for decades. This year, it is 4.21 percent after spending much of the past 20 years at near-zero levels in the wake of the 2008 economic crash and the COVID pandemic.
Utilities in other jurisdictions had to appear before state regulators periodically to justify their return rates, which dropped as well in many cases. Yet Alabama Power kept earning the same margins.
The only major change to the system occurred in 2013, when the PSC switched from using the industry-standard return on equity metric to evaluate Alabama Power’s profit margins to a novel weighted retail return metric developed for Alabama. The new metric gives Alabama Power additional incentives for having a higher percentage of equity as opposed to debt, a good thing when measuring financial health of the utility, but also made it harder to compare Alabama Power’s returns to other utilities.
By then, the 13 to 14.5 percent returns guaranteed by RSE were among the highest in the nation. After the adoption of the weighted return, Alabama Power’s return on equity remained around 13 percent through 2020, but has since dropped to around 11 percent.

Rountree, the former PSC employee who served as chief of staff to then-Commissioner Terry Dunn when the switch was made in 2013, said the change seemed mostly cosmetic, to deflect criticism over the high allowed returns.
By that time, Rountree said Dunn was being boxed out by the other commissioners, having advocated strongly for formal rate hearings that the other commissioners opposed.
“I crunched a lot of numbers back in the day when they were doing that, because I wanted to make sure that I understood it, and Commissioner Dunn wanted to make sure that we knew what they were doing,” Rountree said. “It looked to me like basically what they were trying to do was refashion the presentation of the numbers so that they look more benign.”
Dunn was the lone PSC commissioner to oppose the change to weighted returns, as he had been the only commissioner criticizing Alabama Power’s high return rates. Dunn lost the Republican primary the next year, after what he called a “smear campaign” linking him to national environmental groups and criticism from other Republicans.
Alabama Power’s return on equity, based on figures included in its federal Securities and Exchange Commission filings, remained above 13 percent through 2020, falling to around 11 percent after that. It is on track to earn about 11.1 percent this year, per filings with the PSC.
Last year’s nationwide average return on equity for an electric utility approved by state regulators was 9.74 percent, according to S&P Global.
Those handful of percentage points can add up. The Energy and Policy Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group, calculated in 2020 that from 2014 through 2018, Alabama Power earned over $1 billion more in profit than it would have if it earned industry-average returns.
The group found that Alabama Power’s profits over those five years totaled $4.26 billion at around a 13 percent return on equity. The group estimates that at industry average rates of return 9.75 percent, Alabama Power would have earned $3.24 billion.
Alabama Power is projected to earn $1.56 billion in profit this year, according to its filings.
The utility agreed to a two-year rate freeze this year with the PSC, intended to avoid increases through 2027, as concerns mount about high rates and the potential need for new generation to accommodate hyperscale data center projects that are currently being planned in Alabama.
U.S. Sen. Katie Britt has, on multiple occasions, said that Alabama Power has the “highest rates in the Southeast,” and called the situation “unacceptable.”
Alabama Power and the PSC have said that any data center customers will pay the “full and fair costs” of their operations, including any new infrastructure that is required. Specific details of those contracts however will likely not be made publicly available.
Rountree said he believes it is vital that utilities be allowed to earn a fair return on their investments.
“In utility regulation, you’re trying to have your public utilities do the job they’re supposed to do as best they can, and as efficiently as they can,” Rountree said. “It’s very important to make sure that you don’t starve them to death, that they have the wherewithal to do it well.”
Rountree credits Alabama Power for being a “first-rate utility” and for helping recruit major industries like Mercedes-Benz and Hyundai to build facilities in Alabama. But he also believes the returns are too much.
“Perhaps in the earlier years, giving Alabama Power that extra boost of return to build itself into a well-operating, good utility, maybe there was some wisdom there,” Rountree said. “But by God, I think it’s unfair, and I think it should be less than it is, the allowed rate of return.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/George-wallace-horizontal-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 07:11:40.876744

Among contaminants the city found exceeding state health thresholds on some home demolition sites are arsenic, chromium, lead, and PAHs, a highly toxic class of chemicals that suggests parking lots or roadways were used as backfill. 
Test results show the city is not testing dirt on the demolition sites’ surfaces. The surfaces must be checked to fully and accurately gauge the health risk, independent experts say. That and other testing gaps may leave residents living next to unsafe toxic waste sites as Duggan leaves to run for governor. 
The gaps show “total ignorance,” of proper testing protocol, said Allen Burton, an ecosystems management researcher with the University of Michigan who studies the health risks in sites contaminated with toxic substances. 
“They don’t really know what’s going on at these sites,” Burton told Michigan Advance. “They should go out and sample the part that people are exposed to – the surface. That would answer the question of ‘Is there a health risk?’”

The Duggan administration has maintained there was no way to prevent the problem, a claim public health advocates say is untrue. The failure to address the contaminated soil, and the ongoing “dirtgate,” as some observers have dubbed it, raises questions about the success of Duggan’s blight elimination program, which he touts as he runs for governor as an independent.
“If you want to find fault, it’s in them not having a robust method for avoiding this,” said Steve Hoin, a former state regulator who worked on previous Detroit demolition site remediations. “How did this fail in the first place? It doesn’t lend confidence to the whole thing.” 
 A Duggan gubernatorial campaign spokesperson in an email statement said, “None of that is true. Every time there [w]as an issue, the dirt was tested.” 
However, no experts suggested the dirt was never tested – they allege the testing is inadequate to determine a risk. 
The Duggan administration has previously said the fact that it caught the contaminated dirt is evidence of its protocols’ success. 
Duggan announced on Dec. 22 that around 425 Detroit home demolition sites were potentially backfilled with toxic dirt that may in effect create hundreds of small toxic waste dumps throughout the city’s neighborhoods. That came after a Detroit Office of Inspector General report found 42 of 47 home sites it reviewed had dirt that was “unsafe for direct human contact.” 
The December announcement marks the fifth contaminated dirt discovery during Duggan’s tenure, in which his administration demolished around 30,000 abandoned structures.
Duggan and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, or EGLE, did not release which contaminants were in the dirt until Dec. 29, after The Guardian published a report stating that the information was being withheld. 
Officials have said some debris from the demolished Northland Shopping Mall was used to fill former basements and level demolition sites. Other sources of contaminated construction slag were used, but officials have not disclosed which. 
Some of the contaminants found on the sites are carcinogens, linked to neurological damage or present other serious health risks at very low exposure levels. Those living around the sites face a long-term health risk from dust. The situation presents a more immediate risk for kids playing in the neighborhood, or for those gardening, experts say. 
The city tested dirt samples from between 1-2 feet and 5-6 feet below the surface. It is removing dirt at sites where there are exceedances of state health thresholds for direct contact or inhalation. 

DRAFT_DETR0060_3526_Beatrice.TCLP_.RPT_REV.12.12.25 
Independent remediation experts said the testing and removal was a good step, but it does not cover the most likely exposure risk for neighbors – the surface dirt. Even if the dirt was removed, residents may have been exposed for years. 
Hoin, a former EGLE geologist, said the city’s testing did not aim to determine whether surface dirt had put neighbors’ health at risk. Instead, it aimed to determine if the backfill was toxic to a level at which state law triggered a cleanup. 
“The goal was to determine if the bulk fill material was contaminated and needed to be removed, not to determine whether there was a risk to hypothetical neighborhood kids,” Hoin said. 
Hoin praised the city’s testing, which he said looked for a wide range of contaminants and took a “conservative” approach to determining removal. But he said asking whether residents have been, or are, safe is a different question. That would require testing the surface, Hoin said. 
Nick Leonard, director of the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center in Detroit, said it is “commonplace” in these situations for the surface to be tested because “that is typically the dirt that people are going to be exposed to.” 
The city may not have sampled the surfaces because the sites were allegedly covered with a foot of clean topsoil. During his December 22 press conference, Duggan downplayed the health threat, stating that there would only be a risk “if you were to dig through the foot of topsoil and spend a lot of time digging in the dirt.”
However, the contractors have allegedly lied about the source of their dirt, raising questions about whether topsoil was actually spread, whether it was clean, or whether a full foot was spread across each site.  
Even if a foot of clean topsoil was spread, that depth is not considered an adequate toxic waste cap for residential redevelopment, U of M’s Burton said. Caps require a thicker layer, a membrane, or several feet of clay. 
Meanwhile, the city is not removing dirt at sites in which it did not find exceedances of state health thresholds for individual contaminants. But multiple toxic chemicals are at the sites, and low levels of lead, PAHs, arsenic, chromium and other toxins in combination could present a risk, even if the individual levels do not exceed health thresholds. 
Regulations do not cover multiple exposures at once. The leaves people living next door to sites that have been determined to be safe facing a potential health threat. Leonard said exposure to multiple carcinogens can especially increase the risk of cancer.  
Most of the contaminants found at high levels are carcinogens, though Leonard added that there are a number of factors that determine cancer risk, like the route and length of exposure. 
“But it’s certainly not a good thing to be exposed to a multitude of different environmental risks, particularly for Detroiters who in some respects are more susceptible to these risks for a variety of reasons,” Leonard said. 
The inadequate testing is not unique to Detroit. The government often develops testing plans or protocols that are not designed to fully determine a health risk. 
In a late December email, then-Duggan administration spokesperson John Roach said it is impossible to stop contractors from using contaminated dirt. 
“There is no protocol that suggests the City of Detroit has any legal authority to supervise and regulate the day-to-day operations of landfills or gravel pits in Oakland County – that authority belongs to EGLE,” Roach said. 
But Leonard said the city could contractually require dirt contractors to test dirt, or the city could sample the dirt. However, that would have slowed the demolition program on which Duggan is now campaigning. 
“I think it’s safe to say that the city prioritized getting things done quickly, and at the price of getting things done in a proper way that protected people,” Leonard said.

She’s pro. He’s against.
As city council members in Pasco and Lynden, respectively, they fought two of seven battles in Washington in the past two years over fluoridation in public water supplies. Those fights reflect a spike in skepticism about the long-time, dental-related practice supported by health experts. Washington already is below the national average in residents served by fluoridated water.
Barajas, who left office in recent weeks after not seeking reelection, grew up in Salinas, California, where she began raising two sons.
Salinas’ water system did not have fluoride. Barajas had to stretch a small family budget to provide fluoride to protect her boys’ teeth. After moving to Pasco 20 years ago, she got heavily involved in the community, becoming a city council member in 2018 and later serving as mayor.
A proposal went to the Pasco City Council last year to eliminate fluoride from the city’s water system because of concerns about the health effects and wanting citizens to make their own decisions about fluoride.
With one seat empty, the council split 3-3 on taking this matter to a public ballot. A follow-up vote on just the council making the decision passed 4-2 to remove the fluoride. Mayor David Milne hesitantly switched sides to apparently put the issue to bed on Nov. 17.
“It’s a disservice to those children. It’s a disservice to those families,” Barajas said.
Meanwhile, Bode has been on the Lynden City Council for 26 years. He has read lots of literature criticizing fluoridation as a health risk — lower IQs, softening bones in senior citizens, and damaging pineal glands, part of the brain that helps regulate sleep cycles.
“There’s a laundry list of studies,” Bode said.
More than two years ago, and minus one member, Lynden’s council began holding hearings and debates on ending fluoridation. It voted 4-2 to remove fluoride, but the mayor vetoed the decision. The council went through the whole process again to get a veto-proof 5-2 vote on April 21.
“This is the most important thing I’ve done for public health,” Bode said.
Health and dental experts say there appears to be an increase in anti-fluoridation efforts involving local governments, although they do not collect statistics for comparison.
Along with Pasco and Lynden, the city councils of Aberdeen and Camas have voted to remove fluoridation from their water supplies in 2024 and 2025. The Longview and Battle Ground councils voted to reject anti-fluoridation efforts. Yakima’s council is pondering the issue.
Washington’s state health department policy is to leave this matter up to local governments. “Some people think it infringes on their autonomy in their decisions on what goes into their bodies,” said state health officer Tao Kwan-Gett of the Washington State Department of Health.
This year, 46% of Washington residents have access to public fluoridated water, according to the department. It did not have percentages for previous years. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that about 72% of Americans had access to fluoridated water in 2022.
The state health department, the Washington State Dental Association and the statewide dental lobbying organization, the Arcora Foundation, are not aware on any coordinated effort to remove fluoridation, but pointed to U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s national push to stop fluoridation. 
So far, Utah and Florida have banned fluoride in public water systems.
“These (Washington efforts) are grassroots organizing. But the national narrative is driving it,” said Chris Dorow, outgoing president of the Washington State Dental Association and the only dentist in Othello. The natural water around Othello is already high in fluorides.
The use of fluoride in drinking water dates back to Colorado Springs in 1901. Spearheaded by a Colorado Springs dentist, wondering why brown stains showed up in children’s teeth, he and other researchers spent the next 30-plus years trying to figure out why those stains occurred in Colorado Springs and a few other western areas, and not elsewhere, according to the federal National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research.
During that research, it was found that the brown-stained teeth were stronger and more resistant to cavities than other teeth. Fluorides in the natural water was pinned down as the source of brown stains and stronger teeth in the 1930s. Researchers then tackled finding a fluoridation sweet spot on strengthening teeth without causing brown stains.
Researchers found that balance, and Grand Rapids, Michigan, decided in 1945 to become the first city to fluoridate its public water supply. Fluoridation has a good track record on dental health. The CDC says the proper levels of fluoridation reduce tooth decay by 25%.
Poor oral health can cause pain and handicap a person’s ability to eat, sleep, learn and work, according to Arcora. Untreated oral disease can make chronic health conditions, like diabetes, worse. Medical costs can increase.
Percentages of tooth decay in Washington can vary from city to city. Hispanic, Native American, and Black children have consistently higher rates of tooth decay than their white counterparts, according to Arcora.
Lynden’s Bode pointed to numerous articles that linked fluoride with the loss of IQ points in children. The most commonly cited figures are a loss of 5 to 7 IQ points.
The peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association looked at 74 articles on studies on the links between IQ points and fluoride. Authors of the JAMA article determined that there is a high risk of scientific bias in 52 of those studies and a low risk of bias in 22. Forty-five of the articles originated from China.
The links between fluoride and loss of intelligence show up when the fluoride levels in water are above 1.5 milligrams per liter, the JAMA review found.
“There were limited data and uncertainty in the dose-response association between fluoride exposure and children’s IQ when fluoride exposure was estimated by drinking water alone at concentrations less than 1.5 mg/L,” the JAMA review said.
“That’s much higher than what we use for public water fluoridation,” said Washington state health officer Kwan-Gett.
The CDC says the recommended level for fluoride in a public water system is 0.7 milligrams per liter. Dorow pointed to the centuries-old concept that the dose of a substance often dictates whether or not it is poisonous, not the substance itself.
“There are no negative impacts at normal levels,” Kwan-Gett said.
Regarding Bode’s concerns about pineal glands and bone health, the state health department emailed a number of observations.
The agency said that while some animal studies suggest that high levels of fluoride could affect the pineal gland, studies in humans are inconclusive and limited. And the American Dental Association says that there is no known effect of fluoride on the functions of the pineal gland.
Additionally, the department pointed to a recently published review of scientific literature that concluded low concentrations of fluoride have no significant harmful effect on bone health. A recent study reported a link between fluoride exposure and bone density and fracture risk, but that was at fluoride levels that are more than twice what is used for community water systems.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/water-faucet-1024x746.jpg,,,2026-01-06 07:11:40.876744

(Photo courtesy of the Indiana Department of Transportation)The number of nixed road and bridge plans is rising, the Indiana Department of Transportation told state lawmakers on Monday, citing “funding constraints.”
“We’ve continued to cancel projects. They’ve continued to have to be postponed,” Legislative Director Aaron Wainscott said.
INDOT reported hitting the brakes on 300 projects this time last year.
“I don’t have a specific number, but I can tell you for sure that number has continued to increase over the last 12 months,” Wainscott told the House’s Roads and Transportation Committee.
“It probably wouldn’t be real hard to get that number,” replied Committee Chair Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, who also requested the dollar amount associated with those projects.
Priority initiatives have been among those trimmed, per Wainscott.
INDOT had planned a “major” interchange improvement project northwest of Indianapolis, near Whitestown. But “due to funding constraints, we’ve had to break that into about three different projects that are going to be carried out at different times,” he said, instead of all at once.
Strategic legislative revisions aid renewed Indiana drive for tolling

Another priority project, which could cost $1 billion to build, took some heat.
The Mid-States Corridor is intended to better link State Road 66 to Interstate 69 in southern Indiana, according to its dedicated website. INDOT is still working on environmental review but plans to begin construction next year, Wainscott said, prompting disbelief from Pressel.
“We canceled over 300 projects in the last year and a half, but we’re going to spend a billion dollars on a brand-new roadway,” Pressel said. “… I’m not — I’m not getting it. … I’m really looking for some guidance on how we’re doing this, but yet we’re killing other projects.”
INDOT has eyed tolling as a potential revenue generator.
U.S. law generally bans user fees on federal-aid highways, including those that make up the Interstate Highway System. There are exceptions: two “mainstream” programs, which don’t require any state-federal tolling deal, and two application-only, limited-slot pilot programs.
Wainscott confirmed INDOT submitted a tolling application late last year to the Federal Highway Administration specifically for Interstate 70, but didn’t provide it to committee lawmakers or the Capital Chronicle.
“I’m not sure if it’s necessarily public, publicly displayed. That would not be up to me to make that decision,” he told Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis.
“Well, I’m officially requesting it,” she responded.
Wainscott also said INDOT has received “good feedback” on the application but noted the agency doesn’t know how long approval will take.
Gov. Mike Braun has said that he wants to capture dollars from out-of-state vehicles traveling through Indiana that don’t fill up at the gas pump.
The federal highway department previously referred the Capital Chronicle to INDOT regarding the application but didn’t say why it couldn’t disclose a copy.
Wainscott additionally reviewed early results from a highway construction speed enforcement pilot — reporting that “excessive” speeding of 11 miles per hour over the speed limit or more has dropped by 70% in camera-enforced zones. Ticket revenue goes to the state’s General Fund, not INDOT.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Mississippi’s 174 legislators will return to the Capitol at noon on Tuesday for their 2026 regular session. 
This will be the third year of the current Legislature’s four-year term. Over the next three months, lawmakers will likely file 3,000 or more bills, winnow them down to a few hundred that are passed into law, and also set an over $7 billion state budget.

Already, legislative leaders have telegraphed that “school choice” and other K-12 public education policy will likely dominate the session.

Here are some of the major issues the Legislature is expected to focus on during this year’s session. 
School choice 
School choice policy, which includes allowing families to pay for alternative education options with public dollars, is set to be the top issue of the session.
Over the past year, House Speaker Jason White has led the charge to expand school choice. 

Proponents, who often refer to the policies as “education freedom,” say expansion would give parents more say over their children’s education. Opponents of school choice say the policies will siphon money away from an already underfunded public system and give it to private schools with little oversight.

The House committee White created to study school choice has met several times ahead of the session, and is stacked with pro-school choice advocates. Meetings of the Senate Education Committee, on the other hand, have centered on the public education system’s achievements, potentially setting up a clash between the two chambers of the Legislature.

White has vowed to bring the issue, and a bill, up early in the session. Public school advocates who oppose a universal voucher or school choice system in recent days on social media have told their followers a House vote on the issue could happen on day one of the session.
Mississippi already has some version of school choice — a limited education savings account system, some charter schools, and a plethora of private schools. But none of those are accessible to every student.

Teacher pay 
Mississippi teachers are among the lowest paid in the country, and legislative leaders have indicated they want to change that this year. 
The average teacher starting salary, $42,492 a year in Mississippi, ranks 40th in the nation, according to the National Education Association.
In 2022, state lawmakers passed the last meaningful teacher pay raise, an average annual increase of $5,140. But health insurance premium increases and inflation almost immediately started chipping away at the extra pay, and many other states in the region raised their salaries as well.
Even when adjusted for cost of living, Mississippi educators are the third-lowest paid in the country, nearly $9,000 less than the national average, according to a report from State Auditor Shad White.
Teachers recently told Mississippi Today that they have to keep second jobs and cut corners financially to make ends meet.

Ballot initiative 
For the fifth year in a row, lawmakers plan to introduce legislation to restore the ballot initiative, a way for citizens to circumvent the Legislature and place issues directly on a statewide ballot. 
The Mississippi Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that the prior initiative process was invalid due to some legal technicalities.
Over the last four years, the House and Senate failed to reach an agreement over how the process could be replaced.

Prison health care reform 
House Corrections Chair Becky Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, said she will introduce legislation based on findings gleaned from numerous tours of Mississippi’s prisons as well as instances of alleged denial of medical care documented by Mississippi Today in its “Behind Bars, Beyond Care” series.
Currie last year drafted a bill that introduced several reforms, including giving authority to the Mississippi Department of Health to review prison health care and make policy changes. Other central tenets of the bill included ensuring that inmates have access to 24/7 medical care, dispensing medication in a way that ensures inmates who need it actually receive it, requiring prisons to provide communal electronic kiosks for prisoners to request medical appointments and waiving fees for a wide range of medical services.
Long considered one of the most conservative members of the Mississippi House, Currie last year secured support from the entire House, winning over everyone from tough-on-crime Republicans to criminal justice reform-minded Democrats. The bill passed 118-0 in the House. It was amended and whittled down before passing the Senate, but ultimately died in late negotiations between the chambers.
Currie believes the bill contained too many provisions, drawing opposition from the office of Gov. Tate Reeves and some of his Senate allies. To avoid a similar impasse this year, Currie will introduce many of the same measures, but in separate bills.
One key policy fix Currie plans to reintroduce this year is revamping the process by which inmates request medical attention at many prisons. Prisoners often still need to rely on guards to bring them to an infirmary. This arrangement gives guards, who are not medical professionals, the power to determine whether a prisoner receives immediate care.
Another prison health care issue Currie plans to tackle again is the spread of hepatitis C. Documents and private conversations reported by Mississippi Today show the problem appears to be widespread in state prisons.
Currie plans to keep pushing for the Department of Corrections and VitalCore to purchase hepatitis C medication through health care organizations enrolled in the federal 340B program, which requires pharmaceutical companies to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices. The program can offer discounts on drugs in the range of 20% to 50%.
In an interview, Senate Corrections Chairman Juan Barnett, a Democrat from Heidelberg, said that he “vaguely remembered” Currie’s bill and supported some of its key provisions, but wanted to center efforts in his committee around reducing Mississippi’s prison population to free up more money for health care services.

Opioid settlement spending 
The Legislature must decide how to spend over $100 million Mississippi is receiving from a national opioid lawsuit settlement. These funds are intended to help address the state’s ongoing opioid crisis that has killed thousands of Mississippians over the past decade. 
One portion of the funds is specifically earmarked for programs to prevent and treat opioid misuse, and another smaller pot can be used for any public purpose. But the Legislature must eventually appropriate money from both of the funds. 
Lawmakers in 2025 created the Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council to review grant applications from organizations proposing addiction prevention projects and make prioritized recommendations to the Legislature. The council recently recommended more than $80 million in the two highest tiers for specific projects.

Public Employee Retirement System 
Legislative leaders once again want to address the financial sustainability of the state’s public pension system, which has a $26 billion unfunded actuarial liability.
They will also likely debate concerns over the massive changes to the system they passed into law last year, including creating a new system for new hires that will be a hybrid of a defined contribution plan, similar to the 401(k) system many private employers offer, and a defined benefit plan which the state has had for decades. Opponents of the new hybrid plan say its more austere benefits will make it hard for the state to hire and retain workers, particularly first responders and teachers.
First responders, through their associations of chiefs of police and firefighters, are calling on lawmakers to create a separate retirement plan for them.
Speaker White and the House leadership aim to establish a dedicated, recurring revenue stream for PERS, but Hosemann and his Senate leadership have favored a direct cash infusion to address the liability. 
Specifically, House leadership has favored diverting the bulk of the state’s lottery proceeds to PERS, or legalizing mobile sports betting and taxing a portion of the bets.

(Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s largest state employee pension fund can’t recover losses from investments in Ontario-based capital funds, a Cole County judge ruled last month as he closed out a five-year court battle.
The Missouri State Employees Retirement System, or MOSERS, spent at least $21 million pursuing the case accusing Catalyst Capital Group Inc. of mismanaging $175 million entrusted to its care. In a Dec. 19 decision, Circuit Judge Daniel Green ruled MOSERS failed to prove its allegations of misconduct against Catalyst and ordered MOSERS to pay the defendants’ costs to contest the lawsuit.
The ruling comes as lawmakers return to the Capitol this week to start working on the state budget for the coming fiscal year. MOSERS is again asking for an increase in the pension contribution rate — to 32% of state payroll costs — as investment returns lag behind increases in promised benefits.
For fiscal 2027, which begins July 1, MOSERS is asking lawmakers for $864 million, including $533 million in general revenue. The total request is almost $330 million more than the state’s contribution for fiscal 2023.
The final ruling from Green came after several preliminary decisions pared the lawsuit down by dismissing several claims. One barred MOSERS from seeking damages on behalf of other investors because MOSERS had not attempted to make other investors, including the University of Missouri, parties to the lawsuit.
Chuck Hatfield, the attorney representing Catalyst, said the decision vindicated the investment group’s actions. MOSERS claimed losses linked to three funds created by Catalyst that have purchased companies like Cirque du Soleil and Canada-based Gateway Casinos were due to misconduct by fund managers.
“These funds all still own companies that are not sold yet,” Hatfield said. “When they do (sell), MOSERS is probably going to make a fair amount of money on that sale.”
MOSERS filed the lawsuit in 2020 when Catalyst called for the pension system to fulfill $10 million of its $100 million commitment to one of the three funds. 
In a statement to The Independent, MOSERS spokeswoman Candy Smith said Green’s order didn’t address the merits of the allegations.
“The judge’s rulings did not evaluate the actual misconduct at issue,” Smith wrote. 
The lawsuit outlined what MOSERS considered to be loans that were made to an insider at Catalyst that also put too much of the funds into a single entity. 
The system’s board of trustees will consider whether an appeal has a likelihood of success, Smith wrote.
MOSERS is the general pension system for state employees, covering workers in most state agencies and state universities. There are 56,494 retirees and their dependents currently receiving benefits and 44,673 active state employees, with another 17,943 vested and scheduled to receive a benefit at retirement age.
According to the latest annual report, MOSERS had $12.1 billion in cash and investments at the end of June, with net assets of $9.6 billion. At the end of June, it had enough money to cover 55.4% of current and future obligations. That is down from 59% in fiscal 2021, when the lawsuit was filed.
During arguments in court, attorneys for MOSERS said it invested $120 million of $175 million in commitments to Catalyst Funds III, IV and V, pledging to invest up to $50 million, $25 million and $100 million, respectively.
At a hearing in 2020, MOSERS said it lost $34 million from $50 million invested in Fund III, $18 million from $25 million invested in Fund IV, and $7.2 million of the $45 million invested to that point in Fund V.
In the investment section of the most recent annual report, the market value of the funds were listed as $11.2 million for Fund III, $6 million for Fund IV and $61.2 million for Fund V. The report does not state how much has been received as distributions from those funds.
One reason MOSERS saw several of its claims dismissed in early 2025 was because its attorneys did not bring other investors into the case as co-plaintiffs. Instead, MOSERS sought to assert the claims on their behalf — and recover the damages — without their participation.
“MOSERS argues that defendants engaged in rampant, potentially criminal misconduct for the better part of a decade, and that such conduct caused more than $1 billion in damages to these investment funds,” Green wrote in the January 2025 decision. “If that were true, it is reasonable to think that MOSERS could muster evidence that even one other investor (some of whom contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the funds) shared MOSERS grievances.”
Green refused to issue an order at that point to bring other investors into the lawsuit.
“The judge said they were a day late and a dollar short,” Hatfield said. “Many of their claims were time-barred and they should have known long ago. And many of their claims were just wrong on the law.”
Through the end of June, MOSERS had paid $20.6 million for legal help, including $15 million to the law firm Quinn Emanuel, $3.6 million to  Thompson Coburn and $2 million for expert witnesses.
Changes in investment assumptions, not the payments to attorneys, are the reason MOSERS is falling behind in its actuarial evaluations, Smith said. The return on investments for fiscal 2025 was a strong 9.8%, she said.
The board “implemented positive changes to the funding policy, fully aware that these changes would cause a short-term decline in the funded ratio and an increase in the contribution rate,” Smith wrote, “but work toward the long-term goal of being fully funded.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050523_Mosers2-1024x640.jpg,,,2026-01-06 07:11:40.876744

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)LGBTQ advocates urged New Jersey lawmakers Monday to protect health care for the state’s transgender community, demanding action on stalled legislation at a midday rally outside the Statehouse in Trenton as federal threats mount.
A bill that would shield both patients and providers in New Jersey from criminal or civil liability for getting or giving health care related to gender dysphoria and gender incongruence has languished since it was introduced in June 2024. Almost half of the Legislature has signed on as sponsors, and the bill’s backers say it has enough other legislative support to pass.
The bill would codify protections Gov. Phil Murphy (D) outlined in a 2023 executive order.
“Everyone deserves health care without discrimination, and trans people are part of everyone. It’s just health care, legislators! It’s nothing to be afraid of!” said Melissa Firstenberg, a transgender woman from Marlton who emceed the rally.
Louise Walpin, an advocate who helped lead the fight to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey more than a decade ago, said lawmakers have failed to act despite a flood of constituent calls and emails supporting the legislation.
“This is not how a democracy works. This is a failure of government, and we will call it out,” Walpin said. “Delay is not neutrality. Delay is collaborating with hate. Delay is harm.”





















































































The delay is also “batsh*t crazy,” said one lawmaker who joined the rally to support the bill.
“If New Jersey wants to be a state that protects people instead of targeting them, if we are going to be choosing compassion and courage over cruelty, then this bill needs to pass and be enacted swiftly,” said bill sponsor Sen. Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson).
Rich McGrath, a spokesman for New Jersey’s Senate Democrats, said Senate President Nicholas Scutari had no comment on why the bill hasn’t moved. Spokespeople for Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin did not respond to a request for comment. Both men control what bills advance in their chamber.
Assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester), a bill sponsor who also joined the rally to talk up the bill, conceded lawmakers have a rapidly shrinking window to get the bill to Murphy’s desk, with the next two-year legislative session set to begin on Jan. 13. But if they fail to act, he added, the bill will just be introduced again in the new session.
“We’re hoping to get it done. Speaking personally, I’d like to get it done this week. If not, the game goes on. We regroup very quickly,” he told the New Jersey Monitor.
It’s unclear if Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) would support the legislation. Her spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment.
The legislative inaction comes as hospitals around New Jersey, following a national trend, have increasingly scaled back or abandoned altogether gender-affirming care, fearing federal funding cuts and other reprisals.
On his first day in office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring his administration would recognize only two sexes. The Trump administration also issued a report critical of gender-affirming care, and threatened to withhold funding from hospitals that provide such care to youth.
Trump loomed large at Monday’s rally.
Tina Neal, who heads the transgender-supportive nonprofit Tertium Quid, said the Trump administration’s strategy of threatening to defund hospitals to force compliance is a “mafia tactic.”
“I don’t blame providers for making impossible choices under financial coercion. That’s exactly why this administration is doing it. But you know who has money? The state. You know who has the power to keep this care alive for those who need it? The state,” Neal said. “So New Jersey, we ask you: Are you going to stand up for your children?”
Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, have passed similar shield laws, and outgoing New York City Mayor Eric Adams created a $2 million emergency fund last month to ensure access to such care, according to Andy Bowen, a former Garden State Equality executive director and the group’s first transgender leader.
New Jersey legislators should protect gender-affirming care because restricting it for transgender people is discriminatory, said Nathan Rodriguez, executive director of the Trans Equity Coalition. Cisgender people receive gender-affirming care every day already in the form of hormone treatment for menopause, breast reconstruction for cancer survivors, hair transplants, and testosterone for men with low hormones, Rodriguez said.
“That is gender-affirming care, and there’s no outrage, no legislation, and no moral panic,” he said. “If you are willing to let the government strip these rights from trans people, please ask yourself this: Who will be next? How far are you going to let them go before they are knocking on your door, deciding what care you are allowed to receive?”

According to our recent survey of officials in Michigan communities, local democracy is humming along and city hall is taking care of business.
The federal government was shut down in October and November 2025, but cities and towns around the United States continued to fill potholes, purify drinking water, respond to emergency calls and issue construction permits, mostly with little fanfare.
But Michiganders should not take this local resilience for granted. Officials – especially in rural communities – are also raising some red flags about declining public engagement, deteriorating public discourse and harassment.
 The view from city hall

At the University of Michigan’s Center for Local, State and Urban Policy, we have been surveying local officials in Michigan’s 1,856 cities, villages, counties and townships since 2009. About 70% of local governments in the state complete our survey each year, which means that our results reflect the opinions of everyone from township clerks in the Upper Peninsula to mayors of larger cities in the Metro Detroit area.
This Michigan Public Policy Survey has covered a wide variety of local issues over the years. One topic we track closely is how democracy is functioning in local communities.
While many public opinion surveys ask how Americans feel about democracy, very few examine the viewpoints of local officials whose job it is to carry out the daily work of democratic governance. For example, instead of asking whether people trust their government, we flip the question around and ask local officials whether they trust their residents to be responsible participants in policymaking.
 Democracy at its grassroots is strong

To get a high-level understanding of local democratic health, we ask Michigan local officials to rate the overall functioning of democracy in their communities on a scale of 1 to 10, from total breakdown to perfectly functioning.
Statewide, 82% reported a score of 7 or higher when we surveyed them in the spring of 2025. This percentage has remained remarkably steady since we first began tracking it in 2020.
At the other end of the scale, only 2% of communities this year rated democracy poorly – 4 or below – falling from a high of 7% in 2024.

 Small and rural communities are falling behind

While these high ratings are good news for local democracy in general, when we break down the results by whether communities consider themselves more urban or rural, we see some divergence. While 82% of communities overall reported relatively good democratic health this year, this reflects 92% of urban communities and 79% of rural communities.
We also see evidence of a growing urban/rural divide in resident engagement, an essential ingredient of democratic health. When we asked local officials how engaged their residents were with their local governments, 64% of urban communities said their residents were somewhat or very engaged, but only 41% of rural communities felt the same. In fact, 13% of rural communities said their residents are not engaged at all, compared with only 5% of urban communities.

Similarly, local officials in urban communities have higher levels of trust in their residents to be responsible participants in local policymaking – for example, by contributing ideas, volunteering or speaking with elected officials. In Michigan’s urban communities, 48% of local officials said they trust their residents nearly always or most of the time. However, only 38% of rural local officials had the same level of trust in their residents.
 The big picture looks less rosy

While rural communities currently appear to be struggling more than urban communities to engage with their residents, looking over time, democratic participation is getting worse everywhere. For example, 18% of Michigan communities statewide reported this year that civic discourse among residents was somewhat or very divisive, up from 11% in 2012.
Between 2012 and today, despite their efforts to expand engagement opportunities, particularly online, local officials’ satisfaction with their residents’ level of engagement has plummeted from 58% in 2012 to 38% in 2025. Among the most common frustrations are that their efforts attract the same people over and over and that a small vocal minority of residents is negatively affecting overall engagement.
Even more troubling, about half of local officials who responded to the 2022 version of our survey have experienced some kind of personal harassment, with 39% reporting in-person harassment such as hostile or aggressive comments, 31% reporting online harassment and 3% reporting violent actions like assault or destruction of property.
 Looking ahead

While only 17% of Americans currently trust the federal government to “do what is right” “just about always” or “most of the time,” according to a recent Pew survey, 65% of Americans still trust their local government. And as our survey results suggest, most local officials feel pretty confident that they’re being good stewards of local democracy, despite declining help and input from their residents.
To any Americans worried about the state of their democracy, may we suggest heading to the next meeting of the local planning commission? We hear there are sometimes even snacks.

(Photo by Paul Bradbury/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — A legislative measure that seeks to slap restrictions on where homeless shelters can operate across most of Oklahoma is a misguided effort that will cause more harm to an already marginalized community, some advocates say.
Critics of Senate Bill 484, which prevents new homeless shelters from being built within 3,000 feet of a school or school property, said while the legislation appears targeted at registered sex offenders, it would create unintended consequences for unhoused families. They said there are better solutions to address the issue.
Kori Hall, chief programs officer for City Care, an Oklahoma City service provider for homeless people, said lawmakers envision schools and churches as a place where children can access services, and they pass legislation restricting sex offenders from accessing those areas.
But Hall said this bill, which could be considered by the House when lawmakers reconvene in February, has the potential to harm those youth too because a lot of people experiencing homelessness and utilizing services and shelters are families with children.
“Children need to be able to have access to shelters and also to school,” she said. “So creating that distance barrier can kind of be a barrier for them to receive both of the services that they need.”
Hall said her organization is located less than a 0.5 miles from three different elementary schools, and they’ve never had an issue.
“Those schools partner with us because people staying in our shelter have kids who go to their schools,” she said. “It’s actually a benefit for them to have those families close because it makes sure that their kids can go to school and not have truancy.”
The bill would apply to every Oklahoma city with populations of less than 300,000. Only Oklahoma City and Tulsa have populations greater than that. Existing homeless, domestic violence and youth shelters and those operating within places of worship would be exempt.
According to the 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to Congress, a report compiled by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 5,467 people experienced homelessness in Oklahoma in 2024, a 17.6% increase from the previous year. Of those, 1,060 were “people in families with children,” and 450 were “unaccompanied youth,” a term for minors who are not under the care of a parent or legal guardian.
State Sen. Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, who authored the measure did not respond to requests for comment, but in January 2025 said the bill is intended to address public safety.
“That’s a constituent bill from my town of Norman which is absolutely a Dumpster fire right now, and what they’ve done to allow the homeless to establish a vagrant nation, if you will … The public safety at Norman is at risk,” she said.
Standridge’s bill narrowly cleared the state Senate last year and is available to be considered by the House when lawmakers reconvene in February.
Norman Mayor Stephen Tyler Holman, whose city would be impacted by the legislation, said the measure seems “arbitrary, capricious, potentially discriminatory” in that it exempts Oklahoma City and Tulsa.
 “It obviously doesn’t really address or solve the issue of homelessness at all,” Holman said. “And it aims to take away the ability for local residents to decide for what we think is best for our own communities. (I am) hoping that we can work with Senator Standridge and other state representatives on ways to actually address the root causes of homelessness and why it’s such a big issue in the state of Oklahoma statewide.”
Cleveland County, where Norman is located, experienced an approximate 12.7% increase in the total number of homeless in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to a 2024 Point in Time Count, an annual census of people experiencing homelessness.
Holman said lawmakers could help his community by determining the future of the state mental hospital that is in Norman, as well as the future of the services it provides to the homeless population located in that area.
“And, if we can more adequately address the shortage of housing, we can prevent more people from becoming homeless, then the homeless issue is easier and less expensive to deal with, ideally,” he said.
He said it would also help if lawmakers also adequately funded mental health services.
Alissa Gilmore, program director and treasurer of the Micah Community Movement, an Oklahoma City-based homelessness service organization, said she doesn’t see any positives to Standridge’s bill.
She said systematic issues in society create homelessness.
Increased access to mental health and affordable drug addiction treatment would both be better solutions.
“Those are things that help to solve homelessness, not just move it around,” Gilmore said. “This kind of bill does nothing to solve homelessness. It basically just moves it around. It’s not an attempt to  make anything better.”

Mike Braun discusses Indiana public safety in an interview on Monday, Jan. 5, 2026, in his Statehouse office. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun on Tuesday touted what his administration called major public safety gains in its first year, pointing to large drug seizures, stepped-up traffic enforcement and a sharp decline in overdose deaths as evidence that Indiana is “safer” under his watch.
In a news release, Braun credited the Indiana State Police with disrupting drug trafficking networks operating in and around the state and removing impaired drivers from Hoosier roads.
The governor said those outcomes are the clearest way he judges whether his administration’s public safety strategy is working.
“You look at statistics — overdose deaths, what we’re taking off the streets — that’s how you measure it,” Braun said in a sit-down interview with the Indiana Capital Chronicle on Monday. “Hopefully, you see big improvements at first, and then over time, you see it trend down and compare favorably to other states.”
‘Safer’ Indiana roads
Public safety was a central theme of Braun’s campaign and transition agenda, which emphasized tougher enforcement against violent crime and drug trafficking, stronger penalties for repeat offenders and closer coordination between state and local law enforcement agencies. 
The plan specifically singled out methamphetamine and fentanyl as major drivers of crime and overdose deaths in Indiana and posited that drug trafficking networks exploit gaps in border enforcement.
Indiana State Police roll out new fleet of Dodge Durangos, Ford Mustangs

“When you look at the consequences of open borders, many of us think every state, every county, every town pays the consequences of it,” Braun said.
“There was such an infrastructure built up with cartels basically having easy ways to enter, and that’s been disrupted” by federal efforts, he added, but every state “still has to do its own part.”
Since taking office, Braun has also highlighted traffic safety as a key component of that approach. The governor’s office said Tuesday that operating while intoxicated arrests increased 17% in 2025 — from 3,406 the year before to 3,985. Braun attributed the increase to ISP’s intensified enforcement efforts aimed at impaired driving.
Those arrests coincided with a decline in fatal crashes statewide. Indiana saw 737 fatal crashes in 2025, down from 804 the previous year, according to the governor’s office. Braun’s administration said the 8.3% decrease is the result of greater traffic enforcement by state police and local law enforcement.
Late last year, for example, the state police rolled out a new fleet of patrol vehicles as part of a broader push to modernize the agency’s roadway enforcement tools and increase visibility on Indiana’s highways.
ISP leadership said the updated fleet — which includes a handful of high-performance Ford Mustang GTs —  is intended to help troopers more effectively deter reckless driving, aggressive behavior and street racing.
“We’re paying more attention to it,” Braun said of impaired driving enforcement. “That OWI number went up because we’re ferreting it out. We’re finding it. If it increased by 17%, that tells you there were way too many people still out there driving while intoxicated.”
State police up drug seizures
ISP interdiction teams additionally seized hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs in 2025, according to the governor’s office, including nearly 1,100 pounds of cocaine found in a U-Haul truck and more than 70 pounds of heroin recovered from a semi-truck. 
State police also confiscated roughly 70,000 THC vape cartridges, which officials said were unregulated products intended for illegal distribution.
Altogether, ISP reported seizing 630 kilograms of cocaine and 38 kilograms of opioids last year, which Braun’s administration described as a significant blow to cartel supply lines feeding Indiana communities.
The release said ISP detectives relied on advanced investigative tools, including wiretaps, to dismantle drug rings operating in small and midsize Hoosier communities, targeting “not only couriers, but the suppliers directing distribution into the state.”

As a result, opioid seizures increased by 117% in 2025, according to the governor’s office.
State officials further pointed to a reported 60% drop in overdose deaths statewide as the most consequential outcome of those efforts.
“Overdose deaths — that’s one of the biggest indicators,” Braun said. “A lot of what was coming across the border illicitly is not anymore, and when you’re taking millions of dollars of drugs off the street, that’s how you start to see those numbers change.”
And Braun’s team said drug interdiction efforts have continued into 2026. 
Over the weekend, ISP seized 140 kilograms of cocaine during a traffic stop — an estimated $7 million street value, according to the governor’s office.
Braun championed several public safety-related measures during the 2025 legislative session, including policies that increase penalty levels for crimes involving fentanyl and provided additional tools for prosecuting impaired driving and drug-related crimes.
Lawmakers returned to the Statehouse on Monday for the 2026 short session, which is scheduled to conclude by the end of February. Neither the House nor Senate Republican supermajority caucuses have released their priority agendas yet.
Braun isn’t expected to release his newest legislative priorities until next week. He admitted that state lawmakers “might already be worn out” from hectic work during last year’s budget-setting session and a legislative battle over redistricting in December, “but they’re going to have some good ideas” on public safety matters.
“A lot of what we did through executive orders is already being used as a template for legislation,” Braun said. “When something makes sense, you want to codify it. So, we’ll keep pointing that out.”

Wyoming's small towns struggle to maintain law enforcement services in the face of unstable funding, sparse populations and vast distances.
The post Policing in Medicine Bow went boom, then bust, reflecting statewide funding challenges appeared first on WyoFile .","During a recent Medicine Bow Town Council meeting, a local radio station owner asked if the town could cite a resident for a barking dog. The answer is no, Mayor Justin George explained, because no local ordinances can be enforced without a functioning marshal’s department.
Nestled in the northeastern corner of Carbon County, Medicine Bow is home to fewer than 250 people. Made famous by Owen Wister’s 1902 novel “The Virginian,” the small town today struggles with sustaining law and order in such a remote enclave.
In early 2024, the Medicine Bow Town Council voted to dissolve its local law enforcement, the town’s Marshal’s Office. Soon after, the council traded three unused patrol cars, three rifles and $55,000 to the Carbon County Sheriff’s Office in return for 360 hours of annual patrol time. Before the agreement was finalized, Sheriff Alex Bakken made it clear that his deputies could not enforce local ordinances. Instead, deputies would spend the contracted time in Medicine Bow responding to emergency calls and monitoring traffic on Highway 30.
Last summer, the contract came up for renewal. During their regular August meeting, Medicine Bow Town Council members publicly criticized the coverage the sheriff’s department provided, citing multiple alleged instances of deputies’ vehicles facing away from the highway as traffic passed through town without slowing down. Due to those allegations, and a lack of funding, the council unanimously voted not to continue the partnership, leaving the community without a law enforcement contract.
Sheriff Bakken did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication. 
Small-town justice
Between its founding in the late 1860s and 2019, Medicine Bow relied entirely on Carbon County to provide law enforcement. In 2019, flush with impact assistance funding from nearby wind projects such as the Ekola Flats wind farm, the Town Council voted to allocate $1 million to establish a Town Marshal’s Office. The plan was to maintain local law enforcement as long as possible using the impact money, while the marshal and his deputies supplemented the operating budget by writing citations.
But the experiment came to an abrupt end. In early 2024, with less than $400,000 left in the budget, the council decided to close the department and return law enforcement duties to the sheriff. Councilors said they had anticipated the funds would last longer than they ultimately did.

With the Medicine Bow Marshal’s Office now shuttered, the town was left with tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of equipment, including guns, ammunition and patrol vehicles. In July of 2025, the council voted to sell the weapons and equipment to a local firearms dealer. That’s when the council concluded that much of the money allocated to the marshals had been spent inefficiently.
In November 2025, Mayor Justin George ticked through an itemized list of leftover equipment from the closed office along with the cost to the town. As a whole, the governing body expressed disbelief at the amount of equipment purchased by the Medicine Bow Marshal’s Office during its five years of operation.
As an example of waste, the mayor reported that the department spent nearly $2,000 on 5,200 rounds of 9mm ammunition for mandatory firearms training. However, an inventory revealed that every bullet was present, indicating no training had occurred.
Additionally, the Marshal’s Office had purchased six $600 spike strips, three $200 combat-ready trauma bags with folding stretchers, three $120 bolt cutters, a $500 pair of Vortex-brand binoculars, and a black cowboy hat, valued at between $100 and $300.
“That was ridiculous, that stuff they had,” Councilwoman Kristi Wickizer said at the November meeting. “It was beyond ridiculous.”
Town policy allows department heads to spend up to $5,000 without prior approval from the council, the mayor said, adding that many of the questionable purchases fell just below the spending threshold.
Medicine Bow is set to recover $8,000 from the firearms sale, money that will be used to pay off outstanding debts from the marshal’s five-year stint, including a $17,000 Motorola radio service bill.
But two former mayors defended the marshal’s department, including its spending, and told WyoFile that they’re disappointed to see it disbanded.   
In 2022, voters elected Sharron Biamon, who was on the council when the marshal’s department was established, as mayor. She resigned the following year, and Councilor Lucy Schofield was appointed to replace her as mayor. Schofield resigned that summer.
While none of the elected officials responsible for the formation of the Medicine Bow Marshal’s Office are still on the council, both Biamon and Schofield said their councils fully supported how the department was run. Purchases had been approved and backed by the council, they said. They added that if the roughly $200,000 in annual ticket revenue had been reinvested into the Marshal’s Office, instead of going into the town’s general budget, the department would still be operating today.
The price of enforcing laws
Medicine Bow isn’t the only Wyoming town struggling to maintain a dedicated law enforcement agency. Twenty miles to the west, in the former coal-mining town of Hanna, local officials continue to wrestle with the cost of operating their own marshal’s office.
Hanna was once a major supplier of coal for the Union Pacific Railroad. After more than a century of mining, however, the seams became increasingly difficult to reach, and by the early 2000s the last coal company had shut down. During the height of the coal era, the town established the Hanna Marshal’s Office to police its few thousand residents. With the mines now closed, Hanna’s population has fallen to fewer than 700. Despite the decline, the town continues to maintain its own law enforcement operation, now staffed by only two part‑time marshals. The Hanna Town Council has repeatedly said it cannot afford to hire any full-time officers.
Many municipalities in Carbon County are turning to the Sheriff’s Office for the entirety of their law enforcement coverage. Like Medicine Bow once did, the towns of Riverside and Baggs signed memorandums of understanding, agreeing to pay the county to have deputies spend a set number of hours in each community. Carbon County commissioners have said towns that rely on the Sheriff’s Office for policing should help fund the department, especially in light of recent state property tax relief measures.
When Carbon County saw 2025 property tax revenue drop by more than $900,000, commissioners cut services across a county spanning nearly 8,000 square miles.
Providing legally required core services, such as water, sewer and law enforcement, is becoming increasingly expensive. In Saratoga, rising equipment costs have led the town, which still maintains its own police force, to cede emergency dispatching duties to the Carbon County Sheriff’s Office. Sheriff Alex Bakken has spent years studying if all dispatching services should be consolidated under his supervision, a prospect the Rawlins Police Department doesn’t fully support.
Even as counties and municipalities struggle to provide law enforcement coverage, state legislators are pursuing additional cuts to property taxes — a primary mechanism of funding county and local governments — including proposals to eliminate residential property taxes entirely. Sheriff Bakken has said that consolidating all emergency dispatching services under one roof is inevitable. Facing increased costs and decreased funding, some local officials wonder whether the same may eventually apply to law enforcement departments themselves. 
In the meantime, Medicine Bow residents must continue relying on the Sheriff’s Office, 40 miles away, for emergency response.

Barrasso and Lummis ""sanewash"" president's dangerous behavior in attack on Venezuela, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post Wyoming’s dynamic Senate duo blindly follows Trump downhill appeared first on WyoFile .","Is there a lie that Donald Trump can tell to distract Americans from his incompetence that Wyoming’s U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis won’t stand up and applaud?

Opinion

I don’t think so, based on their response to Saturday’s reckless military strike against Venezuela. Trump’s administration didn’t even tell Congress it had invaded the country and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife until after the mission was completed.
Neither Barrasso nor Lummis questioned why the U.S. would attack a sovereign nation to force regime change that was certain to be condemned by dozens of other countries for breaking international laws, including China, Russia, most of Europe and Venezuela’s neighbors.
Whatever happened to Trump’s “America First” agenda that stoked his base in the last election? It sounds like he pushed it off the table to focus on his own dictatorship dreams.
The two senators didn’t say a word about how the move will destabilize the world and give bad actors like Russia an excuse to seize control of any country and its assets. 
Lummis went on social media to praise Trump’s “decisive leadership.” Both she and Barrasso branded Maduro a “narco-terrorist” — the GOP’s catch phrase of the day — and characterized his arrest as saving thousands of American lives.
Let’s be clear: Both senators were right when they called Maduro a dictator and said the world is safer with him out of power. But to contend that he posed an imminent threat to the U.S. and had to be forcibly removed without even consulting Congress just isn’t true, no matter how many stories Trump invents.
The Poynter Institute’s PolitiFact examined Trump’s justification for blowing up more than 30 boats off the coast of Venezuela since September, killing at least 115 people. It noted he never provided any evidence about what illegal drugs were supposedly on the ships or where they were headed. In one high-profile case, a second strike was ordered to kill two survivors who were clinging to wreckage to keep from drowning. 
If that’s not a war crime, what is?
At his post-invasion press conference, Trump claimed drugs on each boat would kill, “on average, 25,000 people.” If true, the mini-armada would have killed some 800,000 people, nearly 11 times as many drug overdose deaths as the U.S. reports annually.



But Trump gave himself credit for knocking “out 97% of the drugs coming in by sea.” In less than four months! Do you believe it? Of course not, but Barrasso and Lummis apparently have to if they don’t want to get knocked around on Truth Social.
In reality, experts in crime, drugs and Venezuela say the country plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the U.S. compared to Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico. But we aren’t toppling those nations’ leaders and rushing them to New York City for criminal trials.
Trump repeated his ridiculously false claim that Maduro emptied Venezuela’s mental institutions and prisons and sent them all to the U.S. “They were drug dealers. They were drug kingpins. They sent everybody bad into the United States, but no longer,” he said. “And we now have a border where nobody gets through.”
Then the president told us the real reason he invaded Venezuela. The South American nation, he said, “unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets, and American platforms costing us billions and billions of dollars.” Trump is pissed off, and he wants his revenge.
“Massive oil infrastructure was taken like we were babies, so we didn’t do anything about it,” Trump said. “I would have done something about it. America will never allow foreign powers to rob our people or drive us back into and out of our own hemisphere.”
I never expected the truth to suddenly burst from Trump’s lips, but he spelled out how he intends to help his billionaire oil buddies clean up. He said — again without evidence — that our country’s role in governing Venezuela “won’t cost us anything” because U.S. oil companies will invest in new infrastructure.
“It’s going to make a lot of money,” the president added, though many Americans would probably come to that conclusion on their own.
I think Wyoming voters still wearing blinders when it comes to Trump’s huge credibility problems, should ask themselves what’s more plausible: Is he actually kicking ass and fixing our national drug problems by taking over another country in total upheaval, or is Trump trying to make us forget all those phony promises to lower prices and turn the economy around?
There are myriad reasons why starting an illegal war probably seemed like a great option for Trump, who certainly won’t view it as a moral issue as long as people give him proper credit for doing it. 
His first year back in the White House must have been a miserable experience, except when he demolished the East Wing to build a garish $300 million ballroom, or added his name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Arts, or got his kicks ridiculing a famous Hollywood couple who’d just been stabbed to death.
The national media is finally focusing attention on Trump’s rapid physical and mental decline, though not nearly as much as it did by being complicit and railroading Joe Biden out of office.
Then there’s that pesky scandal about Trump’s dead pedophile pal, Jeffrey Epstein, and the treasure trove of documents yet to be released about the infamous crimes. It’s even driven a wedge between the president and some of his most previously loyal MAGA followers, like U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Who could have seen that coming?
There won’t be any splits like that from the Wyoming delegation. Barrasso can’t keep his position as the No. 2 Senate Republican without Trump’s backing. Lummis is leaving the Capitol at the end of her term next year, but she won’t rock the boat. And her likely successor, Rep. Harriet Hageman, was strangely silent about the Venezuelan attack over the weekend, but she owes her political career to the president. 
If Secretary of State Chuck Gray continues his unlikely climb up the state’s political ladder and lands Hageman’s U.S. House seat, he’ll remain a loyal lapdog.
It would be great to see a Wyoming candidate who would dare question why Trump bypassed Congress. Even his chief of staff, Susan Wiles, told Vanity Fair that Trump would need a green light from Congress to approve land strikes in Venezuela.
A president can use military force as commander in chief, but only Congress can constitutionally declare war or fund one. If Trump used this mission just to take the heat off himself for the moment, I can see him simply declaring victory and looking for the next big magic trick to avoid accountability. 
But will any Wyoming Republican politician ever be held responsible for allowing Trump’s madness to be “sanewashed?”

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Five years ago today we were transfixed by the surreal spectacle of the attack on the U.S. Capitol. The violence and horror of that day was made more bearable when the insurrectionists were arrested and the election results they tried to overturn were certified.
But now they’re back, pardoned by President Donald Trump and released from prison and planning to parade triumphantly today through the streets of Washington, D.C. 
Among the people convicted and later pardoned by Trump, at least 33 have been arrested and charged with new crimes, according to the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Their alleged continuing criminal behaviors include rape, illegal possession of weapons, firing on police officers, and, in the case of Chrisopher Moynihan, threatening to murder House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. 
Some of the most violent offenders are back behind bars. But the most powerful proponents of the Big Lie, including Trump himself, the enablers who staff his administration and the Wisconsin Republicans who hatched the fake electors scheme to try to overturn the results of the 2020 election, continue to work to undermine our democracy. 
“We must continue to defeat election deniers and the threats they pose,” the Wisconsin-based progressive firm Law Forward declares on its website, in a section devoted to a timeline of the fake electors scheme. Law Forward brought the first class-action lawsuit against Wisconsin’s fake electors, and forced the release of documents, text messages and other evidence showing how the plot unfolded. They present the timeline “as a call to action for every American to see how close our democracy came to toppling and how the freedom to vote must continue to be protected, not taken for granted.” 
For a few years it seemed as though we had dispelled the nightmare of Jan. 6. But the lawless, emboldened second Trump administration has dragged us back to that scary, dangerous time.
The brave work of people like Jeff Mandell, founder of Law Forward, and the other lawyers, judges and investigators who continue to struggle against the agents of authoritarianism trying to destroy American democracy is still making a difference. 
Last month, Dane County Judge John Hyland found probable cause to continue the trial of Wisconsin attorney James Troupis and Trump campaign aide Mike Roman, charged with felony forgery by Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul in connection with the fake electors scheme. Hyland  rejected Troupis’ desperate effort to scuttle the case by claiming another judge had a personal bias against him.
Wisconsin attorney Ken Cheseboro, the originator of the fake electors plot, is also facing felony charges.
As Trump and his gang openly defy the U.S. Constitution, pursue baseless, vindictive prosecutions of their political enemies, launch military actions without the consent of Congress, threaten to seize other countries and use their positions to enrich themselves while destroying the public welfare, it feels as through that dark moment on Jan. 6 when American democracy was under physical attack was just the beginning.
But as Mandell told me last year, a few months after Trump took office, “I think building a stronger, more resilient democracy in Wisconsin is its own form of resistance.”
“When things feel most shocking and unstable at the federal level,” at the state and local level, Mandell said, “we can show our institutions still work and provide some reassurance.” 
We need that reassurance today more than ever.
“We are slow to realize that democracy is a life and involves continual struggle,” said Robert M. La Follette, the great governor and senator from Wisconsin and founder of the Progressive movement. I’m grateful for the Wisconsinites today who, like La Follette, are committed to that life and willing to continue the struggle.

(Photo: Getty Images)Despite the urging of county mayors, child advocates, clergy and educators, Gov. Bill Lee has declined to secure millions of dollars in federal funding to provide food to low-income kids by the government’s Jan. 1 deadline.
Lee has remained quiet about the apparent decision to forgo approximately $84 million from the federal government’s Summer EBT program, also known as SUN Bucks. In the past, the federal funding has helped feed 700,000 Tennessee kids during summer months when school is out. The governor’s office, for weeks, has not responded to reporters’ questions about whether he planned to participate in the federal Summer EBT.
On Monday, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that “Tennessee has not submitted their intent to participate in Summer EBT for 2026.” 
Gov. Bill Lee stays mum as a deadline looms to opt into a summer food program for kids

Lee rejected the funding last year, too, aligning with more than a dozen Republican governors who cited reasons ranging from opposition to “attempts to expand the welfare state” to administrative costs. In 2025 Tennessee spent $5 million to administer the federal program. 
In its place, the governor established a Summer Nutrition Initiative operating in 15 counties, providing 18,000 kids the same per-child funding as the federal program: $120 for each child. In total, the state spent $3 million on the program.
Hundreds of thousands of children in Tennessee’s other 80 counties, including the state’s urban centers in Shelby and Davidson, weren’t eligible.
It remains unknown whether Lee intends to reintroduce the state-funded Summer Nutrition Initiative again this year. Lee’s office did not respond to questions Monday.
Tennessee launches its summer food benefits this week. Most students in the state will miss out.

In the weeks leading up to the January 1 deadline set by the federal government for states opting into the Summer EBT program, Tennessee lawmakers, faith leaders and county mayors have publicly urged Lee to take advantage of federal dollars, noting high levels of food insecurity among children in Tennessee. 
The funding, made available in the form of debit cards to use while food shopping, impacts more than just hungry children, they noted. 
Before Lee rejected the funding, the Food Research & Action Center estimated the federal funding flowing into Tennessee had a $115 million positive economic impact on the state, a result of virtually all funding spent on buying food in Tennessee grocery stores, farmers markets and convenience stores.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)There is, of course, nothing new about the spectacle of everyday people being forced to endure great suffering because of the whims, foibles, fears and egos of powerful rulers and politicians. From the forced labor that helped construct the pyramids to the countless wars waged to boost a leader’s domestic political standing, millions of people throughout history have suffered greatly because of a powerful man’s – and it’s almost always been a man’s – desire for power.
We Americans sometimes like to think that our country has advanced beyond the kind of crude politics in which a leader issues edicts that sentence innocent people to pain and even death based on a personal desire for wealth, glory and power (or even just their mood on a particular day), but as President Donald Trump has made clear on numerous occasions, it has not.
And today, here in North Carolina, we are experiencing this phenomenon at the state level in the maddening actions and inactions of the state’s Republican legislative leadership – and in particular, one especially powerful leader, state Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger.
Berger, as you may or may not recall (and if you don’t it’s understandable, because it’s been a very long time), was elected to the Senate a quarter-century ago and has presided over the chamber for 15 years. Like a lot of other Republicans who entered politics around the turn of the century, Berger was elected during a time in which the North Carolina GOP was, rather ironically as it turns out, championing term limits for lawmakers and regularly decrying then-Senate President Pro Tem Marc Basnight’s long tenure in office. Basnight led the Senate through nine two-year sessions – a number that Berger clearly aspires to match or exceed. 
Basnight ultimately lost his Senate presidency when Democrats lost their Senate majority in the 2010 elections, but for Berger, the threat to his position comes not from the opposing party, but from within his own. 
Thanks to aggressive GOP gerrymandering, Republicans have almost no chance of losing their state Senate or House majorities anytime soon – even if Democrats win far more votes in legislative elections. But an interesting side effect of that gerrymandering is the way it has emboldened far-right candidates in GOP primaries to seek to outdo incumbents in demonstrating their slavish allegiance to Trumpism.
Hence, the current remarkable situation in Senate District 26, in which Berger, a hard right Republican who has adhered diligently to the Tea Party/MAGA line throughout his time in office, is nonetheless being challenged in the upcoming March primary by Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page. From all indications, it appears to be a credible challenge by a man who has long been a Trump backer and campaign chair and who has won national attention as a loud promoter of anti-immigration policies.   
And that brings us to the crazy and deeply harmful situation that this primary electoral battle in a mostly rural state Senate district – a race that could be decided by a few thousand (or hundred) votes — is inflicting on millions of average North Carolinians. 
Because Berger is clearly determined to cling to power, he has chosen not to allow the Senate to take any actions that might provide fuel to Page – even if he knows deep down from years of experience in Raleigh that doing so will harm the state’s residents. 
And so it is that as the New Year dawns, six full months into the 2026 state fiscal year, North Carolina is the only state in the nation not to have enacted a budget. The central issue: taxes and tax cuts. 
As fiscal analysts have repeatedly noted, now is not the time for North Carolina to plunge ahead with another round of income tax cuts benefiting the wealthy and profitable corporations. Overall public investments are already down effectively by more than a third since the GOP gained power 15 years ago, and the state is failing miserably to meet its basic obligations in numerous core areas of governmental service like schools, health care and fighting hunger. 
The new cuts that took effect January 1 will make this situation much worse. Even Republican leaders in the state House acknowledged the need to at least slow the tax cut rush in the budget proposals they crafted last summer.
Unfortunately, Berger has determined that such a pause would, if enacted, provide red meat for the Page challenge. 
The result: scheduled tax cuts are now in place and the funding shortages that are starving our schools, keeping thousands of children malnourished, and precipitating scores of preventable deaths among people who’ve lost their health care coverage will continue to metastasize.
Will things go on like this? One fantasizes that after the primary Berger might somehow relent and allow common sense policy to prevail.
If Basnight’s 18-year record remains the goal, however, that seems like a longshot. And as has been the case with Trump and so many other power-obsessed leaders throughout history, average North Carolinians will continue to pay the price for Berger’s ambition.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3951-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 06:12:16.094844

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)In the wake of the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, President Donald Trump quickly took up the cause of a 35-year-old veteran named Ashli Babbitt.
“Who killed Ashli Babbitt?” he asked in a one-sentence statement on July 1, 2021.
“An innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman,” Trump said during a Fox News interview a few weeks later.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

To Trump and his Make America Great Again movement, Babbitt was not an insurrectionist shot while trying to get close to the members of Congress who were certifying the election results, the sole rioter killed by police that day. She was a martyr, someone who died for her beliefs. She was a woman who had died for lack of protection.
Trump’s framing of Babbitt’s death in the months after he left office served as one of the guiding principles of his second term: the necessity of “protecting women” and an insistence on identifying and eradicating those he sees as posing a threat to them.
Who was Ashli Babbitt?
She was an Air Force veteran who had done tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. She was married and divorced and then married again. She faced criminal charges after an altercation with an ex-girlfriend of her second husband. She voted for Barack Obama. She bought a pool care business with her husband. She discovered the far-right conspiracy theory QAnon, which asserted that Trump was trying to save the country from a cabal of Satan-worshipping child molesters installed within the United States government.
Over time, Babbitt became increasingly steeped in QAnon and was primed to believe the robustly disproved conspiracy that the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. So when Trump encouraged his followers to go to Washington to support him on January 6, 2021, she did. While the election results were being officially certified by Congress, Trump addressed a crowd that included Babbitt. And when he encouraged them to go to the Capitol, many did — Babbitt among them.
Not everyone who went to the Capitol broke into the building, but she did. With a Trump flag draped over her shoulders like a superhero’s cape, Babbitt was part of the group who tried to gain access to the Speaker’s Lobby, just outside the House chamber. Another rioter smashed glass. As Babbitt tried to crawl through, a Capitol Police officer shot her from inside the lobby.
Video footage from the day shows Babbitt falling backward into the crowd as blood pours out of her mouth. After the shooting, many rioters began to flee the Capitol grounds. Babbitt was transported to Washington Hospital Center. She was declared dead upon arrival. 

The officer who killed Babbitt was cleared of wrongdoing; Lt. Michael Byrd potentially saved lives by stopping the mob, lawmakers and police said.
But her death gave Trump’s Make America Great Again movement something it needed: a martyr.
Religiosity moves in
A religious frame has been present in Trump’s politics since his rallies in the leadup to the 2016 election.
Jeffrey Sharlet, a veteran journalist and professor at Dartmouth College who was an early chronicler of the rise of Trumpism and its ties to religiosity, said these rallies were shaped by the prosperity gospel, a branch of Protestantism rooted in the supposition that, effectively, God wants you to be rich.
In 2020, the religious tenor was still there — but it had shifted to a more conspiratorial approach. Trump stopped merely “winking at QAnon” and began “invoking that level of conspiratorial thinking that has been absorbed into the DNA of the movement,” Sharlet said.
Before Babbitt’s death, Sharlet said, Trump had already been working to incorporate martyrs into his rhetoric, invoking a list of names, usually people who had been killed by immigrants in the country without legal status. They would typically fall into two categories, he said: “blonde white women and promising young Black men” — think Jamiel Shaw Jr., a rising football star in the midst of college applications who was shot and killed by a gang member who was in the country illegally, orSarah Root, who was killed by an undocumented drunk driver the day after her graduation from college.
Sharlet calls Babbitt “a perfect storm”: a White woman killed on camera in footage seen by millions, a Black man —  the Capitol police officer — responsible for her death.
“That changed everything,” Sharlet said. “The first real martyr who really takes hold of Trumpism is a woman, and it gives the movement a real religiosity.”
And it set the stage for Trump to ascend into a kind of religious figure himself after a would-be assassin shot him in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024.
“Every martyr disappears into the cult of personality,” Sharlet said. “She was a placeholder. She keeps the cross warm until Trump gets up there and he’s the martyr. Now, he’s the martyr for us all — but it started with a certain appeal to women.”
Martyrs can’t speak
Babbitt was an active participant in the insurrection — but that didn’t mean she couldn’t be reassigned the role of someone who needed protecting.
Sharlet recalled watching videos of Trump supporters talking about Babbitt in the wake of her death: “They’re aging her backward, they’re lowering her weight, they’re lowering her height, they’re turning her into a little girl.”
It was a blueprint for what was to come, he said of Babbitt: “The blondeness is important, the smallness is important, but so is the camouflage of being a veteran.”
Her race, too, was important, Sharlet said.
“It’s about the Whiteness of things. It’s not enough for them that a woman be murdered,” he said. “She has to be a little girl. She has to be White.”
Meghan Tschanz, a former missionary who has emerged as a critic of patriarchal systems in evangelical Christianity, drew a connection between Babbitt and Laken Riley, a college student whose murder by an immigrant who was in the country illegally was highlighted by Trump. Both women’s deaths became part of a larger narrative — one designed to accomplish a political goal, not mourn the victims.
Tschanz, who lives in Athens, Georgia — where Riley was killed — stressed that criticizing the politicization of Riley’s death is in no way a dismissal of the reality and severity of her killing. Rather, she said, politicization can dilute the pain of the loss in service to a larger narrative.
“Again and again, we see women die and the response isn’t, ‘Let’s make it so women don’t die.’ It’s, ‘Let’s make it so that I can use this to further my narrative that immigrants are evil,’” she said.
Riley’s father, Jason Riley — a Trump supporter — told NBC News about the pain of watching his daughter become a political tagline after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, at the time a strong Trump ally, heckled President Joe Biden during his State of the Union speech in 2024, urging him to say Riley’s name.
“I think it’s being used politically to get those votes. It makes me angry. I feel like, you know, they’re just using my daughter’s name for that. And she was much better than that, and she should be raised up for the person that she is,” Jason Riley said. “She was an angel.”
It’s a dynamic also echoed in Babbitt’s death. Though Babbitt’s mother, Michelle Witthoeft, emerged as a leading advocate for the release of those who were arrested for their actions on January 6, she also has publicly grappled with the way in which her daughter’s death became something other than an acute family tragedy.
Witthoeft told The Washington Post in 2021, “Half the country loves her and half the country hates her,” she said. “It’s weird to have your child belong to the world.”
For Trump, Riley’s and Babbitt’s  deaths helped reinforce the message that women’s lives are in danger and that they need to be saved — something he emphasized in his campaigns as he painted immigrants and his political opponents as threats.
“It all plays into the fears and vulnerabilities that women have to navigate, which is that women are more vulnerable to sexual and gender-based violence and women are tasked culturally with caring for the home and for their children,” said Hilary Matfess, an assistant professor at the University of Denver and the co-author of an analysis done by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University on gender and the January 6 insurrection. “So this message of scary immigrants are going to come in and destroy your communities with drugs and rape your women and children is intended to strike fear into a very specific demographic — namely, suburban White women.”
Matfess pointed to how the role of martyr cemented a view of Babbitt for Trump’s followers. She became someone who needed protecting, a figure whose memory is in need of constant, everlasting protection.
“Being put on a pedestal means you can’t move around too much,” Matfess said.
The ‘protection racket’
Matfess said there is a long-standing academic notion of the “protection racket,” in which a government offers protection from an imagined threat to deflect from the threat posed by the government itself. It’s something that can be used to keep women in subservient roles — and thus effectively in need of some form of protection from others.
“The Trump administration is not saying, ‘Wow, we should really expand access to prenatal health care’ or ‘We need more resources for women that are victims of domestic violence,’ because it is not about protecting women,” she said. “It’s about protecting certain men’s ability to wield power and influence under the banner of protection.”
Babbitt’s death in some ways challenged the narrative, too — she was part of the group trying to stop the certification of the election, not sitting by.
Matfess noted the ways that the Proud Boys — the far-right, all-men neo-fascist group that have become rigorous defenders of Trump and his agenda — insist on the fact that there are in fact no Proud Girls, often suggesting that the best way women can support the politics they espouse is by staying home and reproducing.
Matfess points to early rumors from within the far right that Babbitt was part of a false flag mission — evidence that the movement had to grapple with a woman who was attacking, not asking for protection.
“There’s a lot of utility to narratives that talk of attacks against women and children, and so it becomes that once they decided it wasn’t a false flag, that she was there of her own political beliefs, it becomes a compelling narrative of a woman sacrificing herself for this movement. Whether or not the movement would have been kind to her had she lived is besides the point,” Matfess said.
“The memorialization takes away the kind of difficult questions of how this movement would deal with women who are taking on more transgressive gender roles. Once someone’s a hero, you can leave it at that.”

Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, speaks on the Senate floor on March 19, 2025. He has asked for an attorney general's opinion on the scope of authority for the State Investment Board. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Two North Dakota lawmakers have asked Attorney General Drew Wrigley to formally weigh in on whether the State Investment Board has the authority to offer bonuses to staff responsible for managing the Legacy Fund. 
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, and Rep. Mitch Ostlie, R-Jamestown, requested the opinion as the board considers $1.3 million in proposed bonuses for 12 employees of the Retirement and Investment Office. 
“This is a fairly new program and a unique one,” Cleary said of the bonuses to state employees. “A formal opinion by the attorney general could just provide clarity for everyone, for myself, for the State Investment Board, for RIO.”
Wrigley said he couldn’t comment on the specifics of the request because his office is actively working on the legal opinion.
“I’m prioritizing the matter and I expect to be able to publish my attorney general opinion on that in the relative near term,” the attorney general said Monday. 
The incentive program was approved by legislators in 2023 and implemented in 2024 by the State Investment Board, which oversees the Retirement and Investment Office. This would be the first time bonuses would be awarded under the program.
The incentive pay is based on the performance of the state’s investment funds compared to earnings benchmarks that represent standard market performance. But the approval of the bonuses was tabled at the November meeting of the State Investment Board because of questions about whether the board has the legal authority to do so without a specific legislative appropriation. 
The Attorney General’s Office later verbally advised that the agency could safely proceed with the approval of the bonuses, Retirement and Investment Office Executive Director Jodi Smith said during a December meeting. 
The bonuses are expected to be on the agenda for the State Investment Board’s Jan. 16 meeting. Cleary said “it would be prudent” for the board to delay that decision until the extent of its authority to award the bonuses is clarified by the attorney general. 
“There was ambiguity in how the law was interpreted and discussed across multiple meetings. When public dollars are involved, the responsible step is to get clarity in writing so taxpayers have certainty, not confusion, about how their money is spent,” Cleary said.
North Dakota investment board delays action on $1.3 million in employee bonuses

Seven of the 12 proposed bonuses exceed $100,000 and the largest is $293,000, for the chief investment officer. The agency created the program to encourage investment managers and other staff to focus on bringing in more money for the state, as well as to improve staff recruitment and retention. 
The four largest funds managed by the State Investment Board are the Legacy Fund, the Public Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Fund for Retirement and Workforce Safety and Insurance.
Those funds outperformed benchmarks by $191 million between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025. 
A spokesperson for the Retirement and Investment Office declined to comment at this time, noting any action on the issue must be approved by the full State Investment Board. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the board, declined to comment through a spokesperson, who said he anticipates the topic will be on the Jan. 16 agenda. The governor has previously expressed reservations about the proposed bonuses. 
The State Investment Board is composed of the governor, legislative leaders and other state officials.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A former House staffer — pardoned for a federal corruption conviction — is asking to delay a hearing before the state’s campaign finance watchdog to testify about a political action committee he formed secretly in 2020 to affect the election.
The move is drawing opposition from at least one key member of the Registry of Election Finance.
An attorney for Cade Cothren, ex-chief of staff for former House Speaker Glen Casada, requested that a January hearing before the Tennessee Registry of Election Finance be postponed to allow more time to prepare. The Registry board voted in November 2025 to drop a subpoena against Cothren and, instead, order him to explain the formation of the Faith Family Freedom Fund, a PAC that worked to defeat a Casada nemesis, Republican Rep. Rick Tillis of Lewisburg, in 2020.
Cothren’s attorney, Cynthia Sherwood, notified the Registry that because of the holidays and changing legal issues related to the subpoena, she needs extra time to work on the case. In a Dec. 30 email, she also asked for a one-week continuance from Jan. 2 to turn in sworn documents.
Registry staff attorney Seth May told Sherwood that neither he nor Executive Director Bill Young have the authority to delay items on the board’s agenda and that the request would be scheduled for consideration when the board meets Jan. 22, according to email documents obtained by the Lookout.
May added a note of caution, saying, “Just for purposes of your preparation, it is my instinct that the Registry will not grant a continuance.”
Tennessee campaign finance agency seeks probe of secret PAC

Registry member Tom Lawless, a Nashville attorney who will chair the meeting, said there is “absolutely no reason why this matter cannot proceed at this time.” 
“There has been sufficient time and energy put into this matter, and I cannot foresee how continuing it would necessarily benefit the public and provide the transparency that is so incumbent upon what we do in the Registry,” Lawless said.  
In addition, asked which statutes Cothren allegedly violated, May told Sherwood that state law requires a political campaign committee to accurately certify the name and address of its political treasurer.
“The Registry’s concern is that the treasurer listed on the committee’s filing was not correct, and that in fact Mr. Cothren was acting as treasurer for the committee,” May wrote.
An immediate decision by the board could muddy Cothren’s potential political rebound after he resigned from his post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal that also led to Casada’s departure in 2019.
Since receiving a pardon from President Donald Trump late last year, Cothren has made overtures toward a state House bid for the District 71 seat held by Republican Rep. Kip Capley that takes in Lawrence, Hardin, Maury and Wayne counties. If Cothren refuses to pay any civil penalty levied against him by the Registry board, he would be ineligible to run for state office.
The state House qualifying deadline is March 10, which likely falls before the Registry board’s next regularly-scheduled  meeting.
The Registry board subpoenaed Cothren in 2022 after a former girlfriend, Sydney Friedopfer, testified he asked her to form the political action committee, listing herself as treasurer, so he could run it secretly. She also said in telephone testimony that Cothren told her she didn’t need to worry about responding to questions from the Registry.
Cothren refused to comply with the board’s subpoena and never appeared before the Registry, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Registry board sent the matter to the Attorney General’s office, which took it to Chancery Court to be enforced. It remained there until Cothren’s federal corruption case wrapped up with a presidential pardon following a conviction on multiple charges involving a bogus campaign vendor.
The Registry board also asked the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office to investigate the matter, and that was put on hold until Cothren’s federal case wrapped up.
The Faith Family Freedom Fund spent money donated in the 2020 campaign by a North Carolina restaurateur, whom the Registry was unable to locate, to pay for campaign ads attacking Tillis, a political enemy of Casada’s. Rep. Todd Warner of Lewisburg, who enlisted Cothren for political work, defeated Tillis that year, and two months later the FBI raided the offices and homes of Warner, Casada, Cothren and former Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson. Smith, whose sentence was changed to one year of probation house before was slated to check into federal prison on Monday, continues to seek a pardon after pleading guilty and cooperating with federal prosecutors in their case against Cothren and Casada.
The Registry board initially audited the Faith Family Freedom Fund PAC because of a complaint filed by Greg Hazelwood, the treasurer for Tillis, who claimed the political action committee illegally coordinated with Warner’s campaign. Auditors were stonewalled but finally found Friedopfer, who registered the PAC, in Utah.

Brad Little gives his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, on the House floor at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The Idaho Legislature and our governor have noted the influx of disenfranchised Californians moving into our state. They have heard the boom of the economic growth. And they have asked, as Dorothy did, “Is this Kansas?” And they have said “Yes Dorothy, we are in Kansas.”
The Idaho Legislature and our governor have cut taxes so much we now face a budget deficit while our population grows. I know Gov. Brad Little thought this was unwise, but he signed it. Our Republican Legislature voted for this whole hog. We will pay. Our population increases and our state funding declines.
Idaho’s projected budget deficit estimated at $40 million heading into 2026 legislative session

Kansas did this. In 2012, the Kansas Legislature and Gov. Sam Brownback passed huge income tax cuts. The supply side people cheered. Grover Norquist, the pseudo economist who argued he wanted government to be so small he could drown it in a bathtub, was in ecstasy. The Koch Brothers, Texas billionaires who pull Idaho state legislators’ strings, grinned. The Kansas model would prove all their points.
But it didn’t.
Cutting taxes does not make an economy boom. It didn’t for Kansas. They depleted their reserves and struggled to fund schools. Idaho has this on the horizon.
Especially when tax cuts just benefit the wealthy and corporations. Us pogues drive the consumer economy, and we have not gotten these Idaho gifts. We are hurting. But our schools and our roads and our lives will suffer.
So how did the Kansas Experiment work out? Not so great.
Kansas is almost as Republican as Idaho, but Gov. Brownback ended up leaving the state to serve as “Ambassador at Large for Religious Freedom.” A Democrat succeeded him in the governor’s mansion in Topeka.
Idaho would never do that. And we don’t have a governor’s mansion.
I doubt Brad has international ambassadorial dreams.
He loves Idaho. And he knew these tax cuts were stupid. He said so. But he signed them.
Idaho has seen growth. People love the Treasure Valley. Do they need schools and roads? Maybe they are over 60 and just want a small ranchette. At least they have escaped the liberals in California.
Is this the Idaho Brad Little said he wanted?
No.
He said he wanted this to be a state where the kids born here would find good jobs and want to raise their  families. I can’t think of a higher aspiration. Three of my four daughters are Idaho taxpayers. I love this state too. It’s why this Idaho Democrat voted for him.
I realize such an endorsement might not be welcome. That’s his problem.
But then he signed the ruby slippers tax cuts. And he’s holding back money to balance the budget. That’s his job. But he did sign the bills. We will dip into reserves, so the pain isn’t felt this year, but it’s coming. The budget will be balanced. And we will feel it.
Brad knows state finances better than anyone. And he can see the coming crash. But he signed the bills.
The problem is the Idaho Legislature, who we elect from these bizarre districts. Our legislators write these laws.
But then Brad signs them.
We, the voters, need to be seeing this issue. Please study Kansas. They did the experiment. Why do we need to redo it here?
Maybe the problem isn’t with Brad or those clowns in the Capitol. It’s with us. We don’t learn.
Maybe we don’t care about Kansas.
Maybe we’ll just have to learn this lesson here in our beloved state.
We deserve the representation we vote for. And they, no we have brought this upon us. When it comes, look in the mirror and think what you/we could have done different.
For the twister comes.

(Photo of Blue Ridge mountains by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)In June, North Carolina launched its long-awaited program to rebuild single-family homes damaged by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina.
For state officials, it represented the most expansive, highest-stakes slice of an unprecedented hurricane recovery effort. The single-family program, funded with more than $800 million in federal grant money, would take years to complete. And it would be forced to follow a troubled homebuilding operation in the eastern part of the state, wracked by accounting woes and bureaucratic slog.
Six months later, the state now has a grip on the scale of that program as it prepares to close applications: more than 5,000 eligible submissions. A separate program, launched in mid-December, will rebuild small rental projects. Later in 2026, large rentals and workforce housing projects will be eligible for rebuilds.
Eager to distinguish themselves from a long-struggling recovery effort in the east, the state hustled to launch this program — “faster than we’ve ever done it in this state and faster than any state, for any storm, in ten years,” Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley said in an interview.
“We’ve got a big chunk of folks who are ready to go,” Lilley said of applicants in the single-family housing program. “I think in 2026, we’ll see a pretty significant increase in our pace in putting people through construction and closeout.”
The state in mid-December extended applications for the program through the end of January. Meanwhile, officials keep closely watching the numbers on tourism — the lifeblood of many western communities. And they continue to push FEMA and the federal government for more aid, amid increased frustrations with months-long delays.



A six-month sprint to get homeowners signed up
Applications were slow in the opening weeks of the program, as households first learned about its requirements and details. By Aug. 11, roughly two months after launch, the state had 862 active applications. (Applications that were deemed ineligible or inactive are not included in that count.)
Two weeks later, that number had almost doubled as the state and its prime contractor, Horne LLP, began to expand their outreach in western North Carolina. That included door-to-door canvassing and tables at community events. Outreach staff made more than 24,000 phone calls in addition to paid messaging like billboards, radio and social media.
Advocates, wary of alternative recovery efforts that might not come through for survivors, have aimed to recruit more eligible households in the final weeks. 
“A thing I am concerned about is there may be people who right now are counting on a different kind of program,” said Emma Smiley of Legal Aid of North Carolina, which has helped households apply to the program. “It might be Samaritan’s Purse, it might be a local church, something like that.”
Those nonprofit and religious groups have played a key role in recovery, taking on smaller repair projects on faster timelines than the state is capable of doing with federal funding. But Renew NC’s case managers and leaders alike have encouraged eligible homeowners to apply for the state program regardless to get their foot in the door.
The governor himself echoed that sentiment in early December, pleading for last-minute applications as the deadline approached.
“It’s not an onerous application at all,” Stein said during a press conference on Dec. 3. “We want people living in safe, habitable homes. Especially as we come into winter.”
As of late December, the vast majority of active applications for the program are under intake review, the first of eight phases. That includes a review of “duplication of benefits,” in which applicants have to prove that insurance and FEMA are not paying for the same aid — often the most laborious part of the application process. 
The state is hoping to have most, if not all, of applicants through the intake review by the end of Q1 of 2026, Lilley said. 
In the coming months, Smiley said attorneys would be particularly watchful for issues that pop up with heirship — or proof of property ownership that’s been passed down. Some western homes are generations old, without written deeds or formally drawn property lines. 
“We haven’t seen any of those cases so far, but it’s also very early days,” Smiley said. “So I expect that we will see them.”

FEMA buyout applications still pending in Washington
State officials began submitting applications for a key FEMA property buyout program in early February 2025. Almost a year later, they’re still awaiting approval within the agency’s layers of bureaucracy.
The initiative, called the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or HMGP, is designed to offer relief for landowners of destroyed or flooded properties. Those properties can be bought out entirely, elevated or made less hazardous with federal dollars.
Homeowners can’t apply for the program directly. Rather, local governments submit batches of homeowners’ applications, reviewed by the state, to FEMA. As of mid-December, North Carolina had submitted 585 total applications in 22 batches. Those requests total $218 million.
Earlier this year, shortly after the one-year anniversary of Helene, FEMA sent the state a letter saying it was eligible to get around $1.5 billion in federal funds through the program. But getting those projects approved to use that money is another matter.
“[Applicants] are in some cases paying mortgages on damaged or destroyed homes,” said Matt Calabria, who leads the governor’s team for Helene recovery. “So these delays are very acutely felt by so many of these families, who are essentially waiting in limbo until we get word from FEMA.”
The delay of the HMGP applications is among the longest bureaucratic slowdowns at FEMA, but it’s far from the only one frustrating state officials. 
Earlier this month, the director of North Carolina’s emergency management department and groups representing local governments in western North Carolina wrote to express their frustration with proposed changes to how FEMA reviews and approves Public Assistance applications, NC Newsline previously reported.
As of mid-December, the state still has no indication of when those buyout applications — or the more costly Public Assistance requests — will be approved, or whether they will be approved in the first place.
State is wary of ‘sluggish’ tourism in 2026, even amid positive recovery signs
Tourism, the engine of western North Carolina’s economy, has steadily recovered over the past year and culminated in a “leaf peeping” fall season that left state officials feeling encouraged about the region’s long-term health. 
But the state’s tourism head is still wary of broader economic trends that he said are almost certain to impact revenue over the coming year. North Carolina is still seeing a steady stream of visitors, Visit NC director Wit Tuttell said, but they’re spending less — on dining, attractions and “just about everything but hotels.”
“That’s not a great thing for the industry, because we really want these people to come here and spend,” Tuttell said. “People have kind of got this recession mindset, it seems. Even though we’re not in a recession, people are behaving like we are in one.”
Still, there are reasons for optimism in the mountains, even if the state won’t have exact data on spending for months. 
In particular, tourism officials have been pleased with an uptick in activity in smaller tourism spots. In the aftermath of Helene, there were widespread concerns that more rural locales would be unable to bounce back like Asheville and Boone. That hasn’t been the case.
“We’re seeing places like Burnsville, Spruce Pine, some of those places that were hit hard and don’t have as many resources – they’ve really done an excellent job of getting back together quicker than we expected,” Tuttell said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WNC-view-of-the-Blue-Ridge-Mountains-from-Biltmore-Kingdollar-1024x524.jpg,,,2026-01-06 06:12:16.094844

Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss nearly gave up football, won a Division II national championship and has shone since being unexpectedly thrust into the spotlight.
Their paths will converge in the desert at Thursday’s Fiesta Bowl, with a spot in the national championship game on the line.
“Only four teams have the opportunity to go play this week,” Beck said. “I’m super grateful for that.”
Beck has been building toward this since starring as a high schooler in Jacksonville, Florida.
The 6-foot-4, 225-pound pro-style passer won a national championship in 2022 — the Bulldogs’ second straight — as a backup to Stetson Bennett IV, learning as he went. Beck took those lessons onto the field, throwing for more than 7,000 yards and 52 touchdowns in the next two seasons while leading Georgia to 24 wins.

A knee injury kept Beck out of the Bulldogs’ College Football Playoff loss against Notre Dame in early 2025 and, after initially declaring for the NFL draft, he opted to transfer to Miami, a school with a potent offense and plenty of NIL cash to throw around.
He’s been a perfect fit.
Poised and steady, Beck has thrown for 3,313 yards and 27 touchdowns on 74% passing with 10 interceptions. He led the Hurricanes (12-2, CFP No. 10 seed) to wins over Texas A&M and Ohio State in the playoffs and is 36-5 as a starter as he winds down his college career.
“He’s very experienced, he’s been successful everywhere he’s been,” Ole Miss coach Pete Golding said. “He’s always had his teams competing at a championship level and being in the playoffs.”
Chambliss’ career took a different trajectory.
With no Division I offers out of high school, the quarterback from Grand Rapids, Michigan, opted to play at Ferris State, where he redshirted the first two seasons — the second due to respiratory issues. He considered transferring to a Division III school to give college basketball a try, but chose to give football one more shot.
Good decision.
Chambliss led the Bulldogs to the Division II national championship in 2024, leading to offers from numerous Division I programs. He chose to play at Ole Miss, figuring he would be a backup but at least have the DI experience.
Chambliss’ fate changed when starter Austin Simmons went down with an ankle injury during the second game of the season. Chambliss took off and kept going, throwing for 353 yards against Arkansas in his first start and playing so well he kept the starting job once Simmons was healthy.
The dual-threat quarterback put pressure on defenses all season, rocketing passes into tight windows with his strong arm while extending plays with his legs.
Chambliss has thrown for 3,660 yards and 21 touchdowns with just three interceptions on 66% passing, adding 520 yards and eight more scores rushing. He led the Rebels (13-1, CFP No. 6 seed) to a win over Tulane in the CFP opening round and picked apart Georgia in the quarterfinals with 362 yards and two touchdowns in a 39-34 win.
“He’s a limitless football player,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “Certainly, you could see on the sideline and watching some of the stuff on TV, his leadership skills and the way people gravitate to him. He’s had a tremendous impact on the program and plenty of respect for him.”

“I don’t remember anything about the woman I was taking care of,” recalled Gilpin, now a sexual assault nurse examiner of more than 20 years who works at Med Center Health in Bowling Green. “I remember paying attention to the instructions on the kit, making sure the police officer got it.” 
She knew after that experience that she needed more education and resources so the next time a sexual assault survivor came to her emergency room, she was better prepared. She had to learn how to balance the human connection and the forensic exam. In 2004, she was finally able to take the class she needed to become a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE). 
Two decades later, Kentucky still needs to improve access to — and incentives for nurses to pursue — SANE education, a report released in December by the Legislative Research Commission shows. 
The report is the culmination of research sought by Rep. Rebecca Raymer, R-Morgantown, who in 2025 sponsored a resolution directing the LRC to study access to sexual assault nurse examiners across the state. Raymer wasn’t surprised by the report, which she said provides the General Assembly with a good foundation for addressing gaps outlined in it. 
“One of the reasons why we wanted to do the report is we knew there were gaps in coverage. I suspected that … urban versus rural was going to be a big part of it,” she said. “To do good legislation, you really need good data. So, I felt like before we just started passing bills, we really needed to see what that data looked like.”

The report shows an increase in recent years of nurses getting credentialed in sexual assault examination, but an urban-rural divide persists and 100 of Kentucky’s 120 counties do not have a SANE-ready hospital. Hospitals must have a sexual assault nurse examiner on call 24/7 to qualify for SANE-ready certification. 
Of those 100 counties without SANE-ready hospitals, 44 don’t border a county with a SANE-ready hospital, according to the report. This was among the most “concerning” findings to Raymer, she said. During the 2026 legislative session, she plans to introduce a bill that would create a statewide SANE coordinator, a recommendation that came out of the report.
This person would be housed in the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and would help more hospitals get SANE-ready, Raymer said. She also plans to add an appropriation request to make sure the position has adequate state funding.
“We’re still having those conversations of what that price tag would be,” she said, but: “I do plan on putting that in the bill.”
The number of SANE credentials increased from 296 in 2019 to 556 in 2025, according to the report, though Gilpin said that may not accurately represent access to this specialized care. 
“I know of at least a dozen who have those same credentials, and they’ve never taken care of a patient for various reasons,” she said. “So having those credentials doesn’t necessarily mean they’re working as a SANE anywhere.” 
Raymer’s proposed statewide coordinator would also keep a more accurate database of who both has a SANE credential and who is using that credential, she said.

Kentucky Board of Nursing Executive Director Kelly Jenkins said the report wasn’t surprising to her and the recommendations were “very thoughtful and very much in line with the work that’s already been underway.” 
For example, the report recommends hospitals should train all staff to work with sexual assault survivors. A law passed in 2025 already directed facilities to conduct such training. 
Sexual assault nurse examiners are “a very unique, dedicated, compassionate group of people,” said Jenkins. 
“I just have the utmost respect for SANE nurses,” she said. “They’re seeing somebody in their worst moment. It takes a lot to deal with that trauma, especially those that (handle) multiple facilities, so they’re being called out a lot. It’s a lot going through that trauma. They definitely have a lot of respect, for sure, from me. It’s … the gold standard of care for survivors.” 
Kentucky emergency departments are required by law to be able to examine, collect and report evidence of sexual assault and treat victims. Without a sexual assault nurse examiner with advanced forensic training on hand, though, the nurse using a rape kit may experience what Gilpin did in 2001 before she was certified as a SANE: A heavier focus on reading rape kit instructions than on caring for the patient in the room. 
Findings and recommendations 
According to the report: 

Access to training and the costs and time commitments associated with training are major obstacles to becoming a sexual assault nurse examiner. Burnout and lack of incentives for becoming a SANE are additional barriers to nurses qualifying for and maintaining their credentials.
Kentucky has  45 hospitals that employ at least one SANE full time, and 25 hospitals contract with at least one SANE for on-call services.
As of July 2025, there were 512 nurses with a SANE credential in Kentucky. Of those, 491 had a sexual assault nurse examiner adult or adolescent credential and 66 had a sexual assault nurse examiner pediatric or adolescent credential. There were 45 nurses with both credentials. These nurses were mostly concentrated in urban counties.
The number of SANE credentials increased from 296 in 2019 to 556 in 2025.
Six counties have 10 or more SANEs living in them. 
There are 81 counties with three or fewer SANEs living in them. Of those 81 counties, 30 counties have no SANEs living in them. 
As of October 2025, there were 25 SANE-ready hospitals in Kentucky. That number has increased steadily since 2017. 
As of October 2025, most SANE-ready hospitals were located in Louisville, Central Kentucky and Northern Kentucky. There are no SANE-ready hospitals west of Owensboro. 
There are 100 counties without a SANE-ready hospital, and of those, 44 counties don’t border counties with a SANE-ready hospital. 
From 2019 to 2024, there were 4,468 sexual assault forensic examinations that were logged in the Kentucky State Police kit tracking portal.

The report’s recommendations include: 

Hospitals should consider developing monetary incentives and specialized job codes to incentivize more nurses to become SANEs.
The Kentucky Board of Nursing should consider working with SANE training programs to make them more accessible to potential candidates.
The General Assembly may wish to consider requiring that hospitals have a sexual assault nurse examiner on call 24 hours each day.
All applicable medical providers should receive training that includes information on the treatment of survivors of sexual assault. 
Kentucky hospitals should consider developing potential monetary incentives and job codes for SANEs. 
The Cabinet for Health and Family Services and the Sexual Assault Response Team Advisory Committee should consider developing a statewide SANE coordinator position, which would coordinate the efforts of different state agencies and hospitals in order to increase access to sexual assault nurse examiners, promote standards in training and practice, provide technical assistance to build and maintain SANE programs, and to collaborate with community partners and appropriate state agencies.

SANE-Ready-Hospital-Map
Overall, the Board of Nursing, the Kentucky Hospital Association and Gilpin support the recommendations outlined in the report. 
The suggestion that hospitals provide a 24/7 SANE nurse, however, could be a challenge for some. 
“Although we think that is a great goal, and we’ve been trying to help work toward it for a long time, just (with) the reality of the financial situation of many of our very small hospitals, particularly our rural hospitals — I just would hate to have that probably-unfunded mandate in place,” said Deborah Campbell, the vice president for clinical strategy and transformation at the Kentucky Hospital Association. 
That recommendation, said Campbell, is “really the only one that gives me any heartburn.” 
Deborah Campbell is theVice President, Clinical Strategy and Transformation with Kentucky’s Hospital Association.
Creating job codes specific for SANEs could help ensure certified SANEs can work in that role.  
“Many of the SANEs now are working in labor and delivery, or the ED. They have their regular job, and the only difference in pay is if they sign up as ‘on call’ (for SANE work) outside of their hours, and then if they get called in,” Campbell explained. “Is that enough incentive for someone to do the training and keep up the continuing education that needs to happen?” 
Additionally, access to SANE education — and help paying for it — varies by location. 
“I think it is fair to say that if you are working in rural Eastern Kentucky and you want to go to a training, it’s not going to come to you,” Campbell said. “And it’s several days of training for just the didactic part of it. Either their hospital has to pay for them to go and have a hotel and food and travel expenses, or they have to have that burden themselves.” 
“If they have children, they have to have sitters or arrange for their family,” Campbell said. 
“It’s a bit burdensome, depending where you live,” she added. “That’s something that we really want to work on.” 
Having a statewide coordinator to connect survivors to resources, and SANEs with various facilities, as recommended in the report, would be a huge help, Gilpin and others said. 
“I would not be opposed to having such a position at the (Board of Nursing),” said Jenkins. Funding would have to align to make it happen, she said, but “it would just help align resources and try to cover some of those regional gaps that we’ve got.”  
“We know we need more training in the far east and far west,” she said. 
Hybrid training opportunities have and will continue to help bridge that gap as well, she said. 
“SANES are a vital role in providing care to citizens in the state,” Raymer said. “We would hope that nobody ever needs that type of care, but if we find our citizens needing that, I think that it’s an expectation that we make sure that that care is available to our citizens.”
Being a SANE in Kentucky: Part of the healing 
Gilpin, who is the clinical educator for the emergency department at Med Center Health, started her career as a sexual assault nurse with a clear goal: “I wanted bad guys to go to jail. I wanted to get good evidence so it could go to trial and put a bad guy in jail so they couldn’t hurt another person.” 
She’s learned over the last 20 years that real life justice is slow, if it happens at all. 
Now, she’s more focused on how her presence makes her survivor patients feel. 
A sexual assault exam is a success when “the person that I’m taking care of — that’s right there in front of me — is glad that they came, feels that coming to the hospital, having the exam was a positive, and they’re leaving knowing that they were cared for, knowing that they have a connection to what they need going forward to begin that healing process,” Gilpin said.

Still, the stress of seeing so many people — including young children who can’t yet talk about being assaulted — can wear with time. Gilpin has her own mental health “touchstones” that she uses to support her mental health. 
“I like to just be outside, walking in quiet, or spending time with family,” she said. “But I always encourage nurses who are getting into this field to have a recharge, to know when they need a break, to know when they need to talk to somebody else. And I think everybody deals with trauma and stress a little bit differently.” 
It also helps to stay connected to other nurses in similar roles, she said, who will understand the unique stressors of the job. 
“But I certainly encourage every nurse that takes this class: This is very difficult, and it compounds over the years, right?” Gilpin said. “All of the things that we hear and see; the worst part of what humans do to other humans. So I think that having other nurses who are in similar roles that you can talk these things through is very helpful, and then having a plan for your own mental health is super helpful, whether it is in exercise or in activities that just recharge you. I think that that is critical to not allowing this to sort of overtake everything that you do.” 
The hard truth, Gilpin said, is that rape and sexual assault are much more common than some may realize. 
According to the Kentucky Association of Sexual Assault Programs, around 39% of women in Kentucky will experience sexual violence at some point in their lives. Around 23% will experience a rape. And, about 18% of men will experience sexual violence in their lifetime, according to KASAP’s data, which only represents what is reported. 
“What I’ve learned over the years of doing this is this is so much more prevalent than we realize,” Gilpin said. “I learned early on in my career that a lot of the survivors that I served would disclose to me that this was not the first time that they had been assaulted. It may be the first time they sought help, or even felt comfortable telling anyone, but this wasn’t the first time they’d experienced rape.” 
Over time, Gilpin said, sexual assault nurses learn the skills needed to correctly gather evidence, which frees them up to show personalized compassion and humanity to their patients. 
“Collecting evidence is one aspect, and we need to do that and we need to do that well, but more importantly, we need to take care of that human being and ensure that we are helping that human on their path to healing, rather than re-traumatizing,” she said. “And that’s always the goal, that we’re not part of the problem, that we’re part of the solution and part of that healing process.”

Kennedy Profile in Courage Award that he received in 2024 for increasing voting days in Kentucky and protecting election integrity. (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — Thinking beyond this new year to 2027, Kentucky Republican Michael Adams is weighing a complicated question — could he be the type of candidate who gets Kentuckians to focus on the state’s challenges instead of the national politics of the day. 
Adams, who was the top vote-getter in 2023 statewide elections and carried all but two of the state’s 120 counties, is about halfway through his second term as secretary of state, Kentucky’s top elections official. The 49-year-old from McCracken County earned praises from Republicans and Democrats alike on his election policies, but he told the Kentucky Lantern in a recent interview that he cares deeply about other issues too, like the state’s housing shortage and bettering education. 
At the national level, “there’s only one brand” for the GOP, Adams said, but a Kentucky governor’s race is different. 
‘Profile in Courage:’ Kentuckian Michael Adams honored for protecting election integrity

“I feel like at the state level, there’s a little more room for a Republican official or candidate to have an identity of his own, to have a brand,” he said. “There’s a little more room to be a nice guy, and to be modest in your style, and to be substantive.”
Adams said Kentucky Republicans should not “nominate somebody for a governor who is going to be seen as angry or partisan or difficult or unpleasant, nasty.” 
Controversies beset the last two Republican governors, he said, tarnishing their images, and both were defeated by Democrats named Beshear.
Kentuckians, Adams said, “want a nice guy to be the governor, to solve problems, to stay focused on state issues, to be the kind of person you can be proud of when there’s a disaster.” 
“I think people, including Republicans, want a reasonable, decent person who will go do the job, and I feel like there’s an appetite for that, and we see that in who wins these races,” Adams told the Lantern. “But it also comes down to: Would I have the funding available to get that message out right and remind people of what they like about me, and can I get voters to care about the stuff that I care about? I care about civics. I care about housing. I care about education. If we’re voting on stuff that’s not really about our state government, then I shouldn’t win.” 
How will Kentuckians view Trump next year?
Some Kentucky political observers think Adams could have a chance if he decided to run for governor. Trey Grayson, a former Republican secretary of state, said that he jokes “that we secretaries of state are good enough to become credible candidates in our primary, but never good enough to win it.” After leaving office, he was his party’s nominee for U.S. Senate, as was former Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, and they did not win. Bob Babbage, another Democratic secretary of state, lost a primary bid for governor in 1995. 
Yet, nationwide, secretaries of state have moved on to higher office. Grayson pointed to Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who was previously a secretary of state. 
Adams has had “a pretty high profile, probably the highest profile any of us have ever had in performing our job,” Grayson said. In Adams’ first term, he had to navigate access to elections amid the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, which was also a presidential election year. 
Also while he’s not the “most MAGA” Republican, Grayson noted that Adams has previously endorsed President Donald Trump and supported policies Trump cares about, like enacting photo ID laws for voting. 
“I think he’s got some credibility, having won a couple times,” Grayson said. “But the question becomes: can he convince people that he’s the kind of Republican that they want? And he won’t know until he tries.” 
Danny Briscoe, a Democratic political consultant, told the Lantern that Adams has earned respect across the aisle because he “hasn’t let politics interfere” with his job. 
Briscoe added that nationwide, politics are changing, pointing to the election of Zohran Mamdani as the next mayor of New York City with more than 50% of the vote. That “wouldn’t have fit the bill of any previous mayoral election that I can remember,” Briscoe said. 
Briscoe said U.S. Rep. James Comer would be “the Trump disciple” of a hypothetical 2027 GOP primary. The congressman has previously said he is interested in the 2027 race. 
However, if Trump’s popularity in Kentucky changes by then, that could be a disadvantage for Trump-aligned candidates, Briscoe said. The president has won elections in the Bluegrass state for nearly a decade, though he will not be on the ballot in 2027 and Republicans are hoping to maintain control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. 
“Whether (Adams) can get elected or not depends on the mood of this state, and I think it’s a little too early to judge that, because a lot of it depends on Trump’s positives and negatives,” Briscoe said. “If he’s still popular, Comer would be the one to beat. If he’s unpopular, maybe Adams could do it.”
Legislative session
Heading into what will be the final budget legislative session of his last term as secretary of state, Adams said he would focus on things that can be improved, such as increasing state funding to county clerks, strengthening laws around personating election officials and ensuring funding for the Safe At Home program which protects victims of domestic violence.
Kentucky county clerks have hoped to attract more poll workers in recent election cycles. A big issue that often comes up is increasing the pay for poll workers, Adams said. A state formula that determines how much money county clerks get for elections “was set in the ’80s, and it’s never been adjusted for inflation,” he added. 
“I’m conservative. I don’t like to spend money, but it costs money to pay poll workers, and it’s hard to get people in the labor force today,” Adams said. “And when I was a poll worker 30 years ago in McCracken County, they’d pay me 100 bucks, and they pay the same 100 bucks today, 30 years later.”
Adams previously asked lawmakers to make it illegal in Kentucky to impersonate an election official and expressed concern about a political consultant using robocalls to mimic President Joe Biden during the 2024 primary. The calls encouraged Democratic voters in New Hampshire to not cast ballots in the primary. The consultant later received a $6 million fine from the Federal Communications Commission and faced criminal charges in New Hampshire because of a state law that makes it a crime to impersonate a candidate. 
Adams said that while he doesn’t know if voters fell for the scam, “it showed us what people are capable of doing.” 
A 2023 law established the Safe at Home program, which allows victims of domestic violence to hide their addresses when registering to vote without a protective order from a judge. It also allows the state Capitol to be the address on public records and lets those moving from out of state easily join the program.
Participation in the program has grown to more than 1,000 people, Adams said, but a small amount of money goes toward funding it each year. The dollars come out of a joint fund from fines for breaking laws and are split multiple ways. 
Adams would “like to have a stable fund for that,” and doesn’t think an extra appropriation would be needed, but his office needs authorization from lawmakers to touch restricted budget funds to reallocate dollars to the program. 
One issue he hadn’t yet decided on pursuing this session was pushing again for improving civics education in Kentucky. His office previously released a civic health assessment of the state, giving Kentucky a C grade as residents are generally more knowledgeable about civics than the average American, but there’s still room to improve. 
Adams made national headlines in November after sharing on social media that his office was getting calls asking why polls were closed in Kentucky. The state had no statewide elections in 2025. 
“We’re getting calls about polls being closed. They are closed because we do not have elections today. Kentucky votes next year,” Adams wrote on X. “You cannot vote today in Kentucky for the mayor of New York City or the Governor of Virginia. Sorry.” 
Adams told the Lantern that those calls “proved my point that it’s getting bad out there.” It also showed that more and more people aren’t getting local news from local journalists, he added. They instead are reading about elections and national news from elsewhere in the country. 
Adams previously called on lawmakers to implement civics education requirements for public school students, which led to instituting a graduation requirement for students to pass either a citizenship test or civics course. Adams said the law ended up being a “really watered down bill that just didn’t make a difference.”
Adams said he’s talked about the issue with lawmakers since then, but keeps hearing that it’s not a high priority for parents who contact lawmakers about issues. 
“Of all the things people are talking to legislators about, it’s just not on the list. It’s just not a thing that people are talking about right now,” Adams said. “There’s so many other things that compete, so we’ve not decided if we’re going to make a push for it or not. If so we’ll probably decide in the middle of the session.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5483-e1767656350741-1024x971.jpg,,,2026-01-06 05:56:45.501462

(Getty Images)Mark Batterson’s new book is a provocative read. Titled “Gradually Then Suddenly,” the author details how the biggest dreams sometimes seem as if they will take forever and then … POOF! … it happens seemingly overnight.  
One of my favorite examples from the book is Olympic gold medal winner Rowdy Gaines. Batterson reminds us that the United States boycotted the 1980 games in Moscow, which means Gaines trained for eight years in preparation for the 100-meter freestyle, a race that lasted less than a minute. Add up all the practice laps for those eight years, and you’ll see that he swam some 20,000 miles for a race that lasted 49 seconds. 
Gaines won that gold medal for the U.S. gradually before winning it suddenly.
When it comes to policy, wins for kids have been coming far too gradually. There have been too many “wait until next year” and far too few lightning strike wins. As the opening gavel falls on the 2026 General Assembly, our lawmakers must turn the “gradual pace” into 2026 “sudden action.” Kentucky’s kids need that pace — perhaps more now than ever. 
Our boys and girls need leaders in Frankfort who don’t just say they care, but who act with a sudden urgency on that commitment.
As laid out in the Blueprint for Kentucky’s Children 2026 priority agenda, Kentucky’s kids need budget investments to support kinship families and hard-hitting policies that reduce sexual abuse and exploitation. Our young people need budget investments to strengthen their legal representation and policies to promote housing and food stability. Young kids with disabilities need more responsive early childhood settings and our teenagers need real supports on issues from vaping to mental health.  
Kentucky needs to lift the well-being of our children in every corner of the commonwealth. Our kids need to win suddenly. While the latest KIDS COUNT Data Dashboard shows improvements in several indicators of child well-being, 1  in 5 young Kentuckians live in poverty and face food insecurity, among other immense challenges often exacerbated by where the child grows up.
For me the seminal question around the 2026 state legislative session is learning exactly where kids stack up in our legislators’ priorities. Are our kids going to get substantial, common sense and focused policy wins in 2026 or merely political rhetoric?
Batterson quotes the heroic Christian missionary Hudson Taylor about turning gradually into suddenly. Taylor asserts there are three stages of any great work: “First, it’s impossible, then it is difficult, and then it is done.” I, for one, am tired of hearing that this policy is impossible and that policy is difficult. 
Kentucky needs good policy for kids done, and done suddenly.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1408386651-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 05:56:45.501462

(Photo courtesy of Virginia DBE Transportation)States including Virginia are responding to changes by the U.S. Department of Transportation that removed the presumption that women- or minority-owned businesses are socially and economically disadvantaged. 
Now, every business owner in the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program must recertify and show evidence that they have faced actual disadvantage — regardless of race or gender. The change has prompted concerns from minority business owners and groups in Virginia, and calls for VDOT to better support entrepreneurs who have historically faced barriers. 
Future of federal support for Va. minority-, women-owned businesses in transportation in question

While the Virginia Department of Transportation has paused measuring progress toward Disadvantaged Business Enterprise goals, the agency said Monday it is actively supporting business owners by providing guidance to the transportation community and holding information sessions to help businesses understand and comply with the new federal requirements.
All DBE and Airport Concessions DBE firms, current and new, must submit a personal narrative and personal net worth statement to demonstrate they are socially and economically disadvantaged based on individual circumstances under the new federal rule.
Further, VDOT said it has stopped tracking progress toward DBE goals and has paused certain reviews until the Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity completes checks of all currently approved DBEs and makes the required updates to the certification process.
Joanne Payne, federal lobbyist and president of Women First, said VDOT is working hard under new rules, facing tight deadlines, and appears highly concerned about its responsibilities.
“I know that they have been very concerned and working as best they could possibly do under the rules and their authority to do what was best for the DBEs,” said Payne.
She said that after the federal agency changed the Unified Certification program — which allows small, disadvantaged businesses to get certified once and be recognized by multiple transportation agencies — liability concerns have also grown. These worries could trigger lawsuits, potentially caused by “subjective” evaluations, Payne said.
Virginia’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Transportation Association, which supports minority and disadvantaged businesses, was more critical of the state’s efforts. The association said VDOT is merely repeating guidance from the federal transportation secretary and not addressing the need for new opportunities for diverse business owners.
The association said this could be an area for incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger to address. Spanberger’s administration recently signaled support for diverse groups by appointing Sesha Joi Moon as the state’s diversity, equity, and inclusion officer.
“Our members need opportunities now. Some businesses are teetering and can’t wait six months or a year for a workable solution,” the association told the Mercury.
In November and December, the agency hosted an informational session on the new Interim Final Rule to update firms on key provisions and the reevaluation process. It also held an event on preparing personal narratives and required documents under the new DBE eligibility standards. The agency said it worked in collaboration with the Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity (DSBSD) and the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority (MWAA), to assist firms in understanding and preparing personal narratives.  
“As the certifying entities for Virginia, the agencies also have dissemination notification to firms of the recent changes affecting the DBE and Airport Concessions DBE (ACDBE) programs,” VDOT said in a statement.   
VDOT said it will provide updates on the program as additional information becomes available. If business owners or advocates have questions or concerns, VDOT’s Office of Civil Rights Division can be contacted at CRLMS@vdot.virginia.gov.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)One year after backup power systems at the city of Richmond’s water treatment plant failed to switch on following a winter storm and left residents without water for days, city officials showcased plant repairs and new protocols on Monday, and highlighted ongoing efforts to keep the region’s largest municipal water system flowing smoothly. 
Addressing reporters at the plant, Mayor Danny Avula said last year’s water crisis — which unfolded just a few days into his term — sparked his administration’s wholesale attempt to dismantle a culture of complacency and manage deferred maintenance. 
Roughly $7 million has been spent on immediate fixes to water pumps, the switch gear, and other repairs to make the plant less vulnerable to problems, Avula said. About $1.4 billion will need to be invested into water system upgrades over the next ten years, according to the city’s long-term plan. 
In an Oct. 8 letter, Avula requested $80 million over two years in the state budget. The money would have been used to help strengthen the water plant’s infrastructure, which serves over 500,000 people across Richmond, Henrico, Hanover, and Chesterfield counties. However, Gov. Glenn Youngkin did not include the funding in his final budget proposal that he presented to lawmakers last month.
“But the reality is we are an old city, we are the capital city,” Avula said. “There are more needs and so our job is to continue helping our state representatives understand that, and showing them that we’re going to be good stewards of that money when they give it to us.” 
If the state does not provide the funding, that cost will be passed on to rate payers to ensure the improvements are made. The city has not stated how much residents’ water bills would increase if the state does not come through with the funding. Still, there are a number of projects that are critical to the longevity of the plant that will be prioritized with or without state funding, officials said.
“When we start talking about not getting the funding and getting funding, it’s going to be a very difficult conversation about prioritization of which projects come to fruition sooner versus later,” said Richmond Department of Utilities Director Scott Morris. “It’s basically picking which part of your broken car you want to replace first.”
As part of the improvements following the crisis, Richmond has been working with the surrounding municipalities that rely on the water system to improve communication. There has also been a change in management and additional engineers added to the staff to help prevent last year’s mistakes being repeated.
Avula said the city’s conversations with Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s administration about the funding are ongoing.

Think of the Washington Monument. Imagine it sitting on the surface of the sea, with blades as long as a football field slowly spinning. It’s futuristic and white with rounded edges, like a rocketship. But there are no blasts or flares. There is no noise at all but calling gulls.


 
This story was originally published by Canary Media.

	Sitting on the stern of a shrimp boat in early November, this is what I saw. The captain steered us directly under one of two ​“pilot” turbines. In the distance, I saw foundations for 176 more, poking a few dozen feet out of the sea. The Hoover Dam came to mind, another landmark feat of energy engineering. Each new turbine will be roughly the same height as the famous dam, from blade tip to the surf below.


“Why do people think they are an eyesore? Doesn’t bother me none,” said the captain, Bob Crisher, a commercial fisherman. He’s in favor of the wind farm and believes it will bring down his electricity bills.


Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, America’s largest planned offshore wind farm, was then being built about 27 miles east of Virginia Beach. It’s slated to power up to 660,000 homes in a region with the highest concentration of data centers in the world. With energy demand skyrocketing and electricity costs rising, Virginia needs the last construction push on this project to go smoothly. The developer, utility Dominion Energy, promised the turbines would start feeding the grid by March 2026.


How quickly things fell apart.
Maine AG praises ruling declaring Trump’s offshore wind halt unlawful



Last month, the Trump administration ordered a pause on all five in-progress offshore wind projects in America — including Virginia’s — citing unspecified risks to ​“national security.” It was the largest blow yet to a once-growing industry that Trump has brought to its knees in just 11 months. While Trump spent much of 2025 slowing the incredible rise of renewables, his unrelenting war on so-called ​“windmills” has been more vicious and personal.


In many ways, Trump’s attacks on offshore wind this past year encapsulate this new era of politics. He throttles long-held norms in favor of retribution and personal grievance, acting with dizzying speed. He contorts facts and pushes officials in his administration to do the same.


Left in the wake are everyday citizens — including dozens I’ve interviewed over the past year — who are losing the prospect of good-paying jobs. They and their neighbors are also losing access to public goods like lower emissions, revitalized ports, reliable electricity, and a buffer against skyrocketing power bills driven by an AI boom.


Trump’s grudge against offshore wind began more than a decade ago, when he tried — and failed — to stop 11 turbines from being built within view of one of his Scottish golf courses. He has been disparaging offshore wind turbines as ​“ugly” and ​“eyesores” ever since.


He cranked up the intensity when he embarked on his second presidential campaign in 2023, branding big ocean turbines as dangerous. “[W]indmills are causing whales to die in numbers never seen before,” he said that year — a false statement. Still, attacking offshore wind seemed little more than an odd punchline for his campaign rallies. After all, the Trump administration backed the sector for much of his first presidential term, executing multiple offshore wind auctions that had been queued up by the Obama administration.


But Trump’s hyperactive second term has turned fringe movements and personal grudges into full-blown policies. Like his attacks on vaccines and higher education, his blitz on offshore wind farms is having far-reaching implications that will take years to fully enumerate.


Here’s some initial accounting: In-development wind projects have been paused, delayed, and paused again. One fell apart. Two are essentially mothballed after Trump sunsetted wind tax credits. Port revitalizations got cancelled. Developers lost billions. Related manufacturing is drying up. Tens of thousands of once-promised jobs may never be created. Workers already on the job are sitting idle.


One Trump-voting fisherman called the president’s anti-wind campaign ​“madness.”


But while vaccines and universities will endure through Trump’s political attacks, in one form or another, the U.S. offshore wind industry may not. Despite the ubiquity of offshore turbines in northern Europe and China, there is only one large-scale wind farm fully operational in American waters today. When Trump moved back into the White House, the industry was just taking off.


J. Timmons Roberts, a Brown University professor of environmental studies who tracks opposition to offshore wind, put it simply: ​“They’re killing the baby while it’s still in the cradle.”
 Dismantling offshore wind


When Trump’s first term ended, there were no federally approved plans for offshore wind farms. When President Joe Biden left office, there were nearly a dozen — and at least 40 more were in various stages of planning and early development in waters along the East Coast from Maine down to the Carolinas, across the Gulf of Mexico, and along the California coast.


But, on the first day of his second term, Trump signed an executive order that froze offshore wind permitting, blocking proposed projects that didn’t already have federal approval. And he ordered a new review of the projects that did have federal permits but were not yet fully completed, throwing their future into doubt. (The executive order was ultimately struck down by a federal court on December 9.)


Unease amongst state leaders, developers, and investors immediately took root.


Within days, the first permitted project began to fall apart due to ​“uncertainty” over federal actions. In late January, Shell — one of two developers of the Atlantic Shores wind farm slated to be built east of New Jersey — announced it was withdrawing from the project. New Jersey then abandoned plans to purchase power from the installation. The final blow came weeks later when Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency revoked a Clean Air Act permit for the project. One former EPA official called the move ​“unusual.”


Research cuts and funding clawbacks soon followed.


In May, Lincoln Varnum was called into his supervisor’s office at the University of Maine, where he worked as an instrumentation engineer. Varnum was one of nine employees laid off from the university’s high-profile engineering and offshore-wind research center due to the Trump administration pausing funding. The administration also cancelled federal funding for Maine’s first floating offshore wind array, which had been fully permitted; the project was then mothballed.


“I obviously got a little emotional in the meeting … Something that I cared about was getting terminated,” Varnum told me. ​“It was also the first time I had ever been laid off.”
He sees himself and others who’ve been working on offshore wind as collateral damage.

In the following weeks, Varnum, who once identified as a conservative, was hopeful that some Republican members of Congress would speak up about the funding cuts, but none of them did — not even Maine’s Sen. Susan Collins, a long-time offshore-wind supporter. He described Collins’ silence as ​“rough,” especially since he had voted for Collins in the past.


“We’re a poor state. We need industry. To have a new industry that is unique to us, floating offshore wind, now targeted by the feds … It feels like a kick in the teeth,” said Varnum.











We’re a poor state. We need industry. To have a new industry that is unique to us, floating offshore wind, now targeted by the feds … It feels like a kick in the teeth.


– Lincoln Varnum, former instrumentation engineer at the University of Maine




Trump yanked funding in other ways.


In September, the Department of Transportation pulled back $679 million for infrastructure projects that supported offshore wind, including one that would have cleaned up and revitalized a massive California port. Mandy Davis, a California resident and anti-wind activist, aligns herself with Trump’s false narrative that turbines harm the ocean environment. She was elated by cuts that might block turbine construction in California’s waters, but her joy was short-lived.


In November, when the Trump administration announced plans for new oil drilling off the California coast, she told me it was a ​“betrayal.”


New England communities, which spent over a decade preparing to build America’s first offshore wind farms, also felt betrayed. Prior to Trump’s December halt, two massive projects had been paused by the Interior Department earlier in the year. One of the projects, Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island, was already 80 percent completed.


“It’s like having the rug pulled out from under you,” Jack Morris, a Massachusetts-based scalloper and Trump voter, told me earlier this year. ​“Nobody understands why Trump did it. I don’t know what Trump’s agenda is.”


Revolution Wind had employed 80 local fishermen, including Morris, to help with construction. The project’s pause caused Morris and others to lose some of the part-time income that helps them pay their bills as fishing revenues dry up.


The stop-work orders for Revolution Wind and New York’s Empire Wind were each lifted or reversed after about a month. But some damage was permanent. According to Harrison Sholler, an energy analyst for BloombergNEF, the orders were a signal to companies that America is not a sound investment. Foreign firms had invested heavily in the sector, lost billions, and are now looking for the door.


Trump’s more sweeping wind halt last week only reinforced that assessment.
 What America lost


“What exactly will America have lost? How do you even begin to answer that question?” pondered Elizabeth Wilson, a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College.


We could start by looking at how much new electricity capacity won’t be added to America’s increasingly strained grid.


Before Trump was elected last November, BNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind to be built in the U.S. by 2035. BNEF’s latest forecast is for just 6 gigawatts by 2035 — and even that number could come down thanks to Trump’s latest pause.


Another lens is employment. Together, the five wind farms currently underway have been slated to generate about 10,000 jobs. Now some of the highly skilled workers who have already trained for those projects face an uncertain future. And the 77,000 offshore wind jobs that the Biden administration had projected the country would see in the coming decades may never materialize.


Varnum, the laid-off engineer, said that if Maine’s nascent offshore wind industry rises from the ashes sometime in the future, he ​“certainly would want to help. It’s not something I’m turning my back on.”


He has since found a job working for a hydroelectric company. But Varnum said he fears for America’s energy future and how far Trump might take his broader war on carbon-free energy. The president has already boosted fossil-fuel production and nuclear power while trying to tamp down clean energy. His political revenge against offshore wind may be paving the way for more.


“The guy torpedoes us on Day One and how far is he going to go? How far will this go?” wonders Varnum.
Wilson of Dartmouth says that Trump’s assault on offshore wind is ultimately a battle over facts and truth.
Republican lawmakers again ask Trump administration to revoke offshore wind leases in Gulf of Maine



Fossil fuel–backed activists and groups have for years been spreading misinformation about wind turbines harming whales. They lit the match and Trump fanned the flames. The president ranted and made false claims about offshore wind throughout 2025, in front of reporters, foreign heads of state, and the entire United Nations General Assembly


Meanwhile, his administration quietly axed over $5 million for research into the impact of offshore wind on the giant mammals, ending the best and longest-running studies on the issue, as Canary Media first reported.


Interior Secretary Doug Burgum justified the Trump administration’s pause of the Empire Wind project by claiming the Biden administration approved it based on ​“flawed & bad science” about impacts on marine life, but the Interior Department refused to share the report that supposedly backed that up. The project’s developer and Democrats in Congress are still waiting for an unredacted version.


“There’s no proof, right? There are no receipts,” Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, told me in June. He said the administration hid the report and then used the permitting process as a ​“political tool,” something he sees as typical of ​“a banana republic.”


Without new offshore turbines going up, millions of households across the Northeast will soon pay more money for dirtier and less reliable electricity. According to a recent report, offshore wind power could help keep the lights on year-round in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, especially during harsh winter weather when gas plants can fail. Cuts to planet-warming pollution, mandated by several East Coast states, are also now out of reach. All signs point to Trump’s second term creating a hotter and less affordable future for Americans.


Few people interviewed for this story expressed hope that the damage from Trump’s war on ​“windmills” could be reversed anytime soon.

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderTwiggs County commissioners recently approved a massive data center project, sparking a legal battle and deepening distrust between citizens and their elected officials in the rural middle Georgia community.
The decision was made despite vocal opposition aired at a contentious public hearing and accusations that the process was improperly rushed to bypass a state review that was at the time paused.
The Eagle Rock Partners proposal was ultimately approved at a mid-September county commission meeting. A couple months later, a state panel in November officially added data centers to the list of large-scale developments that must undergo a regional impact review. Waiting “would kill” the project, Ken Loeber with Eagle Rock Partners told the commissioners at the time, but he did not say how. 
The Twiggs County data center project did not undergo this review process, which opponents argued should have been mandatory under the county’s own local laws. County residents, concerned that the commission rushed the rezoning process with few details, filed a lawsuit asking the court to overturn the approval, arguing that the county violated its own ordinances and that the commission’s actions “were an abuse of its police and zoning powers.”

The project was under consideration during a months-long window when the Georgia Department of Community Affairs had paused the developments of regional impact process, which the agency says is designed to be a communication mechanism for local officials – and not a state regulatory tool. According to information submitted by the developers, the data center would be built on about 300 acres of land, but there is no specific information regarding the facilities’ square footage or the amount of water it needs to operate, which would have been included in the impact review.
Rob Fricks, a Twiggs County resident and a lawyer in the lawsuit, speaks during the public comment period during the Sept. 18, 2025 commission meeting in Jeffersonville, Ga. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder
Rob Fricks, a Twiggs County resident and lawyer, said to the commissioners at a public hearing in the fall that developers were rushing to receive approval “while the dogs are away” and that the commissioners did not “have the facts” needed to advance the proposal.
“I don’t know if this is good or bad. I cannot make a decision because the only thing I heard is that which the applicant has provided, and you guys should not blindly make a decision because the citizens of Twiggs County … are relying on you guys to make an informed decision,” Fricks said. “If you vote in favor of this tonight, you are not making a good decision because you do not have the facts.”
But Kerry Howell, an attorney for Twiggs County, had a different interpretation of the county’s ordinance about which projects are subject to the regional review process and said that it did not apply while the process was paused for data centers. He said he disagreed “with any contention that it is not proper to go forward with the zoning application tonight.”
To win approval, the developer offered a series of financial concessions that were read aloud at the meeting. These included a guaranteed real property tax return of at least $175 million on the land and infrastructure, a $100,000 payment to the school district for career training programs, and another $100,000 to the county for fire, public safety, or recreation. The developer also agreed that the data center would not be a cryptocurrency mining operation, a condition added late in the process after a resident discovered the possibility and alerted the commissioners.
In the county’s December response to the lawsuit, the county pushed back against claims that its rezoning decision was made in haste or as a result of “fraud, corruption, or a manifest abuse.” The county also denied that the concerned citizens “have a substantial interest in the zoning decision” or that they “will suffer permanent, special, or irreparable injury and damage as a result of the zoning decision.”

The situation in Twiggs County, which is home to about 8,000 people, highlights the different approaches local governments in Georgia are taking to manage a surge in data center proposals with little guidance or regulation at the state level. Without state regulations, counties are adopting widely different approaches.
DeKalb County, for example, took a more cautious approach by passing a moratorium on data center applications and holding auditorium-packed town halls where residents could learn about their potential negative and positive impacts.
“The greater benefit may not be in only creating 30 to 70 jobs but in the revenue that you create as a result of the tax digest that could be utilized for revitalization of a community that has been in decline,” said DeKalb County CEO Lorraine Cochran-Johnson at an October town hall.
DeKalb recently extended its moratorium on data center applications until June 2026 and deferred proposed regulations at least until January to allow for further study. The proposed regulations would reclassify data centers from “minor” facilities to massive “campus” developments, which would require special land-use permits and restrictions to industrial zones.
This is playing out as the county faces significant community pushback against a proposed 1-million-square-foot data center in Ellenwood.

Nancy Lubeck, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Twiggs County government officials, said that local communities are left “flying blind” regarding the long-term impacts on the state’s power grid and water supply. She said that without a centralized system to track or limit the cumulative impact of these massive facilities on the state, their rapid growth could lead to a boom-and-bust cycle, leaving counties with resource shortages and abandoned infrastructure.
“Somebody needs to be watching to see what the impact is going to be overall,” Lubeck said. “How many of these things can Georgia safely support? And if nobody’s looking at that, then we could end up being in a lot of trouble.”
In nearby Monroe County, county officials unanimously raised concerns about the infrastructure demands of a proposed $8.4 billion data center in Forsyth, a city of about 4,300 people, warning that the massive development could strain local water supplies and county roads. The project’s DRI report projects the data center will require 1.5 million gallons of water per day, and commissioners questioned whether the city can meet this demand, saying that the city struggled to supply existing customers as recently as 2025.
“Major infrastructure would need to be done through Macon, Monroe County, and Forsyth to provide this amount of water,” Monroe County officials wrote in response to the Forsyth data center’s DRI report.
Local officials are often drawn to data centers because they can generate massive amounts of tax revenue. Some of them view data centers as a “cash cow,” a term Clint Mueller with the Association County Commissioners of Georgia used to describe their profitability, which can offset the tax burden on local residents. While the buildings themselves generate property tax, Mueller said that “the real money” comes from the personal property taxes on the computer equipment inside the facilities. Because this equipment is replaced every few years, it can provide a tax stream for the county.
“Probably the biggest positive aspect that a lot of county commissioners are looking at is they’re trying to lower taxes for their other residents, and they look at this as a sort of a cash cow to do that with, so that’s why they like them,” Mueller said.
The revenue can be transformative for local budgets. Cochran-Johnson told DeKalb residents that a data center investment of roughly $125 million per megawatt could yield $6 billion in real and personal property value over a 15-year period. That translates to about $27 million in annual tax revenue.

“Data centers are like the modern-day gold rush,” said Shane Short, executive director of the development authority of Walton County, who was invited to speak at the October town hall in DeKalb about how their local government addressed the proposals.
Counties seem to be racing to approve data centers, primarily because officials view the current boom as a finite “window of time” that could close. Mueller said there is a fear that if a county does not secure a data center now, the opportunity may be lost forever.
“I think we have a period of time where we’re going to kind of run out of new capacity,” Mueller said.

But instead of fishing for shrimp, black drum or blue crabs, these days the 77-year-old is an environmental activist looking for “nurdles”— tiny plastic pellets that are polluting beaches and waterways in Texas and around the country.
The minuscule spheres, typically less than 5 millimeters in diameter, are the basic building blocks of nearly all plastic products. But when they are mishandled during manufacturing or transport, they can slip through storm drains and into waterways, posing a health threat to both wildlife and humans. They are difficult to clean up, and act like sponges for toxins as they progress through the food chain.
An estimated 445,970 metric tons of nurdles make their way into oceans annually.
“They’re everywhere,” said Wilson, who is now executive director of San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper, an environmental group focused on protecting Matagorda Bay, on the Texas Gulf Coast. “They’re a real threat to human health and the planet, and we’re trying to protect the communities and the fishermen and the bays.”

California enacted a law designed to curb nurdle pollution in 2007. Now the issue is gaining attention elsewhere: In 2025, legislators in Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia introduced bills.
But the threat of nurdle pollution is beginning to resonate even beyond such left-leaning states. In Wilson’s deeply conservative Texas, a coalition of environmentalists, fishermen, business leaders and local officials is pushing for more nurdle regulation, arguing that the pellets pose an economic threat to coastal communities.
State Rep. Erin Zwiener, a Democrat from the Austin-area town of Dripping Springs, said in an interview that even some in the plastics industry “want to see this issue get solved.” Zwiener has introduced nurdle bills during the past two legislative sessions and plans to do so again when the legislature reconvenes in 2027.
“I think some members of industry know the black eye they’re getting on this and would like to see some curtailment of the worst actors,” Zwiener said.
The plastics industry has long acknowledged that many nurdles leak into the environment. In 1991, it created a voluntary program called Operation Clean Sweep, under which participating nurdle-handling operations commit to certain practices to prevent spills.
Charlotte Dreizen, who oversees Operation Clean Sweep for the Plastics Industry Association, said more than two-thirds of U.S. plastics production occurs at a participating facility.
But Wilson and other critics say the program doesn’t include meaningful reporting requirements, oversight or consequences.
“They’re just being sloppy, and they can do better, but nobody’s making them do it,” said Wilson. “They obviously have to be forced into it.”










They’re a real threat to human health and the planet, and we’re trying to protect the communities and the fishermen and the bays.

In 2019, Wilson was a victorious co-plaintiff in a lawsuit that resulted in a record $50 million settlement against Formosa Plastics, a petrochemical manufacturer that illegally dumped billions of nurdles and other pollutants into Lavaca Bay and other Texas waterways. It was the largest-ever settlement of a Clean Water Act suit filed by private citizens. Instead of being awarded to the plaintiffs, the money went into a fund to pay for projects to reverse pollution in the affected waterways.
Now, Wilson is gearing up for another lawsuit: In December, she filed a 60-day legal notice of intent to sue Dow Chemical Company, alleging it has been illegally discharging plastic pellets from its plant near Seadrift.
Part of a larger problem
Nurdles are a type of microplastic pollution, but not all microplastics are nurdles. Microplastics also include microbeads, which are used as exfoliating agents in cosmetics and toothpaste, and tiny particles from broken-down plastic litter, packaging and synthetic fibers. Some are so small they can’t be seen without a microscope.
Microplastics have been detected in cities’ tap water, in bottled water, in rivers and throughout the Great Lakes. Scientists estimate that adults ingest the equivalent of one credit card per week in microplastics, and studies in animals and human cells suggest they could be connected to cancer, heart attacks, reproductive problems and other harms.
States need to keep PFAS ’forever chemicals’ out of the water. It won’t be cheap.

Nurdles are larger than many other microplastics. They can be seen with the naked eye, and their uniform shape and size make them easier to identify and collect. This past spring, volunteers scooped up nearly 50,000 plastic pellets over an 11-day period at more than 200 sites across 14 countries, 29 U.S. states and Washington D.C.
Texas sites, mostly on the coast, yielded the highest count: 23,115 nurdles. California (4,167), Michigan (3,681), South Carolina (3,094) and Ohio (2,851) also reported substantial amounts.
In the Upper Midwest, environmental advocates are rallying behind pellet-control legislation to protect the five Great Lakes that collectively serve as an economic engine for eight states.
“I think there’s concern up and down and all around in terms of making sure we can prevent this from having a devastating impact in our regions,” said Andrea Densham, senior policy adviser for the Alliance for the Great Lakes.
On the West Coast, nurdles washing onto the coast of Oregon from the Pacific Ocean can be so numerous that “it looks like pellets have become part of the sand,” said Celeste Meiffren-Swango, director of Environment Oregon. “More and more pellets are ending up in the environment and they’re not getting taken out of the environment.”
A question of economics
In Texas, which has at least 36 plastic production plants, Zwiener’s bill — which stalled in committee — would have classified nurdles as non-hazardous industrial waste, triggering record-keeping and containment rules. It also would have required plastics facilities to monitor surrounding waters and conduct monthly audits of spills.
A Slew of State Proposals Shows the Threat of ‘Forever Chemicals’

During a 2025 hearing on the legislation, Logan Harrell of the Texas Chemistry Council told lawmakers that the “industry is already voluntarily addressing the issue,” by improving how it responds to spills and doing more to prevent them. The bill “would result in overregulation and likely add complications based on some ambiguous language and other burdensome requirements,” Harrell said.
Though Zwiener’s bill and a companion bill in the state Senate failed to advance, supporters say the mood may be shifting as more plastic pellets show up on Texas beaches.
In October, organizations representing recreational fishermen, oyster harvesters, tourism groups and others sent a letter to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, urging him to direct the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to adopt standards to prevent the discharge of nurdles into waterways as part of its scheduled revision of water quality standards.
The letter emphasizes the potential economic impact of the pollution, noting that the state’s outdoor recreation industry supports nearly 300,000 jobs, $14 billion in salaries and adds $31 billion in total value to the Texas economy.
The agency was considering a ban on plastics discharges during its last revision of the rules in 2022, but reportedly backed away amid industry pressure. Abbott’s office and the agency declined to comment on the letter.
Community members from across the Houston-Galveston region, along with visitors to Galveston, Texas, joined Turtle Island Restoration Network for the statewide Nurdle Patrol.

No city in Texas is more dependent on clean beaches than Galveston, a coastal city of more than 53,000 that draws up to 8 million visitors each year. In October, the city council unanimously approved a resolution echoing the letter the fishing and tourism groups sent to the Texas governor.
“It’s been a problem, long term,” said Joanie Steinhaus, ocean program director at the Galveston office of the Turtle Island Restoration Network, a California-based nonprofit that advocates for oceans and marine wildlife. The group sponsors regular nurdle patrols on Galveston beaches, and volunteers have collected more than 17,000 nurdles in the past five years, according to Steinhaus.
Recently, the anti-nurdle effort has gotten a boost from J.P. Bryan, a prominent Texas oilman and historic preservationist who founded the Bryan Museum in Galveston. Bryan wrote a widely publicized op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, in which he shared his childhood memories of the beaches of Freeport, Texas, and called for action to curb nurdle pollution.
“For Texans who value both economic growth and environmental stewardship, addressing the scourge of plastic nurdles is not only an ecological imperative, but an economic necessity,” Bryan wrote.
“This problem needs solving, preferably by those causing the problem,” Bryan continued, “but if they won’t, then good government can and should prevent companies from causing economic and environmental damage through plastic pellet spills.”

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)As the current Ohio General Assembly goes into its second year in 2026, abortion will still remain a topic of legislation, in small efforts to change laws, and large attempts to codify or prohibit the practice.
Republicans and Democrats have clearly drawn their lines in the sand when it comes to where they’d like the state to go on reproductive rights, but the GOP supermajority certainly has the edge when it comes to hearing out bills on their side of the aisle.
A constitutional amendment was passed in 2023 with 57% of the vote, enshrining reproductive rights including abortion into the Ohio Constitution, but Republican lawmakers are looking at ways around that.
While Democrats introduced Ohio House Bill 128 in February to further drive home the amendment, including attempting to repeal laws that don’t align with it, Republicans introduced Ohio House Bill 370, which has been called another “personhood bill” because of its attempt to apply 14th Amendment rights to “preborn persons,” and repeal any state law that would “otherwise allow a person to direct, advise, encourage, or solicit a mother to abort her child.”
The bill emphasizes the U.S. Constitution’s overriding provision, taking precedent over anything the Ohio Constitution “contrary to it,” according to the language of the bill.
The Democrats’ bill does the opposite, seeing to repeal “archaic laws in our state that do not improve outcomes or access to care,” as bill co-sponsor Rep. Anita Somani, D-Dublin, put it when the bill was introduced.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While neither bill has seen a hearing since being assigned to their committee, this new year is likely to be more friendly to the GOP bill because of the party’s supermajority, though previous attempts at “personhood bills” haven’t fared well, and pro-abortion advocates say they are unpopular nationwide.
Somani previously introduced a similar bill to the year’s attempt, trying to repeal anti-abortion regulations in state laws, but that bill died at the end of the previous General Assembly, having only received one hearing.
The Dublin representative, who is also an OB/GYN, is pushing forward with attempts to further change language in state law with another bill, Ohio House Bill 245.
The bill seeks to change rules for the Ohio Parenting and Pregnancy Program, which provides grants to entities who help with pregnancy services and parenting education. Currently, the program specifies that those receiving grants must “promote childbirth, rather than abortion, through counseling and other services, including parenting and adoption support.”
The new bill would delete that language, along with a provision in the law that excludes entities from receiving grants if they are “involved in or associated with abortion activities, including providing abortion counseling or referrals to abortion clinics, performing abortion related medical procedures, or engaging in pro-abortion advertising.”
The bill removes anti-abortion language and adds text including abortion in the options allowed for counseling individuals who come to grant-funded facilities.
Information on contraception, reproductive health care, and sex education would also be allowed under the new bill.
The Ohio House Children and Human Services Committee received the bill in April, but have not held a hearing on it.
 Abortion, directly and indirectly
The General Assembly is considering other bills that directly and indirectly point to abortion care.
Before abortion is even considered, certain facilities may have to determine whether they can afford to continue, as a bill moves forward seeking to take away state Medicaid funds in the same way as a federal effort in the most recent budget bill.
Ohio House Bill 410 has had three hearings in the House Medicaid Committee since being sent there in September.
It cites language in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in its effort to prohibit federal funds from going to nonprofit organizations who received more than $800,000 in federal and state Medicaid payments in 2023.
Federal Medicaid cuts have already been named as the cause of Ohio Planned Parenthood clinic closures and staff cuts this year.
Multiple bills currently being considered by committees in the Statehouse have to do with informed consent, the requirement that patients receive state-mandated documents on specific risks of abortion procedures and potential civil action that could be taken against providers and facilities.
Ohio Senate Bill 309 was heard once in the Senate Health Committee in October. That bill would require doctors to provide patients with a written statement to sign on the risks of abortion services, except in a medical emergency.
It also states that patients and patients’ families could sue the physician, the health care facilities, or others if complications arise that weren’t disclosed before the procedure.
Ohio House Bill 347, referred to the House Health Committee in June, has also had one hearing in its effort to permit “elective abortion” only after a physician meets with a pregnant individual at least 24 hours before the abortion to “provide specific information and document the woman’s informed consent.”
This may put the bill in conflict with an ongoing court case that struck down a previous provision in state law requiring a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion procedure.
A judge in Franklin County blocked the provision in August 2024, citing the constitutional amendment on reproductive rights in his decision. The case will extend into at least the spring before a final decision is released.
The Ohio House bill also creates civil liability against a physician who violates the bill, liability that lasts up to one year after the abortion procedure, or one year after “reasonable discovery of harm,” according to the bill.
The measure also permits the State Medical Board “to adopt rules specifying adverse physical or psychological conditions arising from abortion that a physician must disclose as possible complications.”
The State Medical Board currently includes Michael Gonidakis, a former leader for the anti-abortion lobby Ohio Right to Life, who is still affiliated with the organization.
OB/GYNs and pro-abortion advocates have said patients are already informed of the risks of abortion before a procedure is done under the medical training and rules that exist for medical professionals. Studies show severe complications are statistically rare.

(Getty Images)Most of the tuition spending in the education freedom account program continued to go to private religious schools last school year, new numbers released by the Children’s Scholarship Fund indicate.
In total, $11.5 million of EFA money was spent on tuition in the 2024-25 school year, or about 57% of total EFA expenditures that year. A review by the Bulletin found the majority of that tuition spending went to religious institutions. The rest of the spending went to a combination of instructional resources, online educational programs, technology, home-schooling resources, and other spending categories.
Launched in 2021, the education freedom account program allows families of students who are not in the public school system to access state education funds to use toward private school and home-schooling expenses. The program currently provides an average of $4,900 per student per year. 
The program remains politically divisive: Republicans say it provides needed financial support for choices outside public schools, while Democrats say it is an improper use of money that should go to public schools.
With no legislative majorities to repeal the program, Democrats have in recent years called for financial accountability. 
In late December, the Children’s Scholarship Fund, the nonprofit organization that runs the program, released updated reports showing how much approved vendors received. The release came months after the organization took down similar reports for the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years, citing concerns over harassment of vendors. 
The new spending figures do not capture the latest expansion of the program. In June, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed legislation to remove the income cap on the program, but limit it to about 10,000 students. The December reports show a school year in which EFA recipients were restricted to households making up to 350% of the federal poverty level, or $102,200 for a family of four in 2024. 
Here are some key takeaways in the new spending reports. 
Private Christian schools continue to dominate tuition use
Of the $11.5 million that went toward tuition at 131 different schools, a majority went to religious schools, the numbers indicate. Of the top 20 recipients of the program, all but one was a Christian academy. Those top 20 recipients made up more than half — $6.8 million — of the total tuition spending.
The numbers follow a trend in EFA spending that has continued for years. And while the use of state funding for religious education has drawn Democratic objections — who cite the potential for discriminatory practices — the U.S. Supreme Court has approved the practice, ruling in 2022 that it is unconstitutional for states to block religious schools from accessing funding for which they would otherwise qualify. Republicans argue that denying the use of EFA funding toward a school because of its religious affiliation would be discrimination, and note that many of the most affordable options for private education are Christian. 
In New Hampshire, Portsmouth Christian Academy topped the list, receiving $543,000 in EFA money in the 2024-25 school year, or 2.7% of total EFA tuition spending. Trinity High School, Trinity Christian School Concord, Concord Christian Academy, Mount Royal Academy, Dublin Christian Academy, St. Joseph Regional School, Laconia Christian Academy, Claremont Christian Academy, and St. Christopher Academy, all received at least $300,000 in EFA funding that school year.
Religious education dominates online programs, too
For those EFA recipients not attending private schools, the reports indicate that religious education is still a major focus. 
For instance, two of the top three recipients under the category of “textbooks, curriculum and other instructional materials” are Abeka, a Bible-based home school education platform, and The Good and the Beautiful, a similar Christian-based website offering English Language Arts, STEM, and history courses. The two received about $131,000 and $120,000 in the 2024-25 school year, respectively.
And Liberty University Online Academy, a K-12 online program associated with the Episcopalian higher education institution in Virginia, received the second-highest amount of tuition amounts for online tuition payments, or $107,000 of EFA funds in total.
But the program also attracted many secular homeschool programs, too. The number one recipient in Liberty University’s category was Outschool, a website that provides virtual lessons for children.  
Some EFAs used for public school programs, college courses
As education freedom accounts become more well-known, some public schools are opting to recoup some costs through the EFA program. 
Sunapee School District, for instance, took in $14,510 in EFA money; Pembroke received $7,200; and Greenland $6,500. Other public school recipients included Bow and Dunbarton, Pinkerton Academy, Milford, Nashua, Henniker, Amherst, Timberland Regional School District, Dover, Hillsboro, Concord, Gorham, Berlin, Coe-Brown Northwood Academy, Governor Wentworth Regional School District, Mountain View Middle School, and Somersworth High School. 
EFA funds can be used to reimburse public schools for a host of courses and activities, from arts classes to sports. 
Community colleges also received EFA money to cover tuition for dual enrollment programs and other course offerings. New Hampshire Technical Institute received $6,613; Manchester Community College $4,864; and Nashua Community College $4,588. In total, the funding for community colleges amounted to $49,000. 
Some of the EFA money was spent on career technical education, with a large proportion aimed at health care jobs, the Children’s Scholarship Fund reported. 
Dance classes, skiing passes top list of extracurriculars
The numbers reveal a wide diversity of uses of EFA funds. One of the highest recipients of EFA funds in the category of “tuition and fees for summer education programs and specialized education programs” was Gunstock Ski Area, the Gilford ski mountain owned by Belknap County. Gunstock received about $63,000 in funds in the 2024-25 school year. 
Other recipients indicate the range in extracurricular use. The Concord Community Music School, Impact Gymnastics Academy in Bow, the Concord USA Ninja Challenge, and the Creative Dance Workshop Ultimate All Stars all featured in the top 20 extracurricular uses of the funds. 
Some families used EFA funds for driving schools, Boy Scouts of America, piano lessons, and circus lessons. 
Then, there were the material expenses. In that category, Amazon continues to dominate. The online retailer took 14.6% of the total EFA spending on textbooks, curriculum, and supplemental materials, and an additional 3.5% of spending on computer hardware and other tech services, for a total of about $3.6 million of total spending.
Some spending details withheld
While the new reports present broad spending trends, some information has been left out. 
Last summer, the Children’s Scholarship Fund removed the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school year vendor expenditure reports, according to records from the Internet Archive, which tracks website changes. In November, responding to questions from the Concord Monitor, Executive Director Kate Baker Demers said the organization was concerned the records would encourage harassment of the EFA vendors by those opposed to the program.
In interviews, Baker Demers told the Monitor and the Bulletin that the Children’s Scholarship Fund would upload the records by the end of 2025, but said it was considering removing the statistics showing how many individual orders a vendor received if it received fewer than 10 orders. Those statistics, which had been included in previous reports, could allow people to harass smaller vendors and potentially discern the EFA recipient families using those vendors, Baker Demers said. 
But the newly uploaded reports left out the number of orders for all vendors, not just smaller ones. While the total amount of EFA money going to each vendor is included, it is no longer possible to determine how many EFA recipients are using their funds for each vendor, nor what the average spend was per order. 
Administrative rules passed by lawmakers require the Children’s Scholarship Fund to upload certain numbers. According to Rule 803.02 (f) of the Department of Education’s rules for the EFA administrator, “A list of all approved education service providers shall be posted on the scholarship organization’s websites, reported to the department, and made easily accessible to the public to include education service provider name, eligible services, fee amounts received for services, and number of EFA students served.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/scanlon-ct-must-solve-its-medicaid-problem-now/,"Surging Medicaid costs and dramatically shrinking federal aid are a recipe for fiscal crisis, CT Comptroller Sean Scanlon warned Monday.","Surging Medicaid costs and dramatically shrinking federal aid are a recipe for fiscal crisis, state Comptroller Sean Scanlon warned Monday.
And while Connecticut’s chief fiscal watchdog didn’t call for changing state budget caps that hamper the General Assembly’s ability to solve the Medicaid dilemma, Scanlon said all solutions need to be reviewed.
“I think that every option should be on the table for us as we explore how to make sure that the million or so people who get Medicaid can continue to get that … health care that they need,” Scanlon said during a mid-afternoon online press conference on fiscal and economic trends.
“We have an overspending problem,” he said, “and 60% of that overspending right now is happening with Medicaid.”
An omnibus federal program run cooperatively with states, Medicaid in Connecticut supports medical and behavioral health services, substance abuse treatment, and nursing home and in-home elder care in Connecticut.
The state Department of Social Services’ $3.7 billion line item is one of Connecticut’s largest annual expenses, representing about 14% of the budget’s General Fund.
Enhanced federal funding ordered in response to COVID expired in 2023, but Medicaid demand has remained much greater than pre-pandemic levels, leaving Gov. Ned Lamont and the General Assembly struggling to keep costs under control.
The social services department overspent its Medicaid budget by almost $160 million two fiscal years ago and by more than $300 million last year, according to the comptroller’s annual reports. Lamont’s budget office already projects more than $110 million in cost overruns this fiscal year.
That’s challenging enough, Scanlon said. But President Donald Trump and Congress last July ordered federal Medicaid spending cuts of more than $900 billion nationwide by 2034, with states beginning to feel significant pain by 2028.
Analysts here haven’t projected yet how much Connecticut expects to lose, though the hit is expected to be significant. Further complicating matters, Scanlon said, pulling back Medicaid spending would be a huge mistake.
“We do need to make bigger investments in the Medicaid program,” he said, adding it would be more harmful — both to patients and to the state’s economy — if residents had less regular access to both primary and specialist care.
“It sounds somewhat counter-intuitive, but the more money you spend [up front,] the less money you spend” in the long run, Scanlon said.
At first glance, replacing tens or even hundreds of millions of vanishing federal Medicaid dollars each year is not an unsolvable problem in Connecticut.
The state has run up unprecedented surpluses topping $1.8 billion, equal to 8% to 9% of the General Fund, since aggressive budget caps were installed in 2017. But Connecticut has used those surpluses to build reserves and whittle down a considerable pension debt that still exceeds $33 billion, according to Lamont’s budget office.
And the fiscally moderate governor has been wary of adjusting these caps, despite criticisms from many of his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority that they divert too much toward debt and weaken health care, education, municipal aid and other core services.
In recent years, the legislature and Lamont have underfunded Medicaid, authorizing amounts that ignore clear growth trends in demand rather than using special procedures to override budget caps.
Instead, they allow the Medicaid program to operate at a deficit, then cover the cost overrun shortly before the fiscal year ends on June 30, when budget cap rules are more flexible about dealing with crises.
“I think that the issue that’s happening right now is less an issue of overspending and more an issue of under budgeting,” the comptroller said, calling on officials “to craft more realistic budgets.”
The Lamont administration has been researching options to contain the growth in Medicaid costs, though most of his fellow Democrats in the legislature agree with Scanlon that Medicaid spending needs to grow.
“We know we have a Medicaid problem,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, “and it’s something we’re going to have to address.”
But Osten said all state officials must acknowledge the full reality of the situation. Even as the budget caps are limiting spending, federal cutbacks on health care, nutrition and other human service programs likely will push demand for Medicaid-funded services to new heights, she said.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said only that the administration would release its next Medicaid funding proposal on Feb. 4 when the governor recommends his budget adjustments for the 2026-27 fiscal year to the legislature.
The goal, Collibee added, would be “to enhance affordability and opportunity for all Connecticut residents.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/scanlanscreenshot-1024x599.jpg,,,2026-01-06 05:12:29.709413

Lawmakers would need a three-fifths vote from each chamber to override the veto, meaning 20 votes in the Senate and 60 votes in the House. 
The bill passed in the Senate with 24 votes and with 62 votes in the House. 
The Ohio Senate would have to start the override process since state Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster, introduced the bill.  
“That’ll be a conversation,” Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, said when asked if the Senate will try to override the veto. “If we do, it will happen in January, in all likelihood.”
The Ohio Senate will be in session on Jan. 28.
Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, was glad DeWine vetoed the bill. 
“I sent (DeWine) a text and said bravo,” she said. “I think it’s a dangerous precedent to set. I think it opens the door to child labor in the state of Ohio.” 
A child’s first responsibility is to be in school and doing their school work, Antonio said. 
“I can think of a million different ways to encourage more people to come to the state of Ohio and work and have jobs here,” she said. “I don’t think we have to start with our children.”
Ohio law currently allows 14 and 15 year olds to work till 9 p.m. during the summer or during a school holiday, meaning they are not able to work past 7 p.m. on school nights.
In his veto message, DeWine said it would be “unwise” for 14 and 15 year olds to work that late on school nights. 
“I believe the current law has served us well and has effectively balanced the importance of 14- and 15-year-old children learning to work, with the importance of them having time to study,” DeWine wrote in his veto message. 
Ohio is unable to change the law without the federal government making changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
Ohio lawmakers also passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 3 which urges Congress to alter the Fair Labor Standards Act to let a teenager younger than 16 work between 7-9 p.m. during the school year if the teenager has their parent or guardian’s permission. 
The Ohio Restaurant and Hospitality Alliance was disappointed to see DeWine veto the bill. 
“Legislative initiatives such as Senate Bill 50 recognize the importance of employment in shaping future careers by fostering skills that cannot be taught in a classroom, including customer service, problem-solving and time management,” Ohio Restaurant & Hospitality Alliance President and CEO John Barker said in a statement to the Capital Journal. 
“These fundamental skills that young people learn in the workforce, especially within the foodservice and hospitality industry, are invaluable to their future.”
Extending working hours for children can have negative consequences on their academics, said Brianna Booker, policy associate for Children’s Defense Fund of Ohio. 
“If you extend working hours for young people, then they’re more likely to drop out of school or their grades are likely to suffer,” she said. “We’re putting the future of young people at risk for a short term economic relief for the state of Ohio.”
Booker said overriding DeWine’s veto would be bad for young people. 
“Children should not have to be the solution to adult problems and I think that if they make a choice to override the veto, they’re essentially making children responsible for adult choices,” Booker said. 
Ohio businesses can pay 14 and 15 year olds the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which is less than the state’s minimum wage of $10.70 per hour, according to the Ohio Department of Commerce.

(Getty Images) It is unhealthy to ask the average citizen, even if he or she is serving as a New Hampshire legislator, to understand the intricacies of nursing home reimbursement, but such an occasion has arisen given changes to Medicaid rates on Jan. 1.
Last November, nursing home providers found out that they would be experiencing, on Jan. 1, the first average rate cut since January 2015. It turned out that the state appropriation could not sustain a rate increase granted at the start of the fiscal year July 1.
To their credit, the Department of Health and Human Services came up with an innovative strategy. Nursing homes had volunteered a fee increase toward a legislative appropriation to retain a contractor to help Health and Human Services address a backlog in Medicaid applications. As luck would have it, the contractor selected is doing the work for far less than the appropriation, so the department recommended the surplus be used to mitigate Jan. 1 rate cuts. Gov. Kelly Ayotte, the Executive Council, and the legislative Fiscal Committee all approved the fund transfer. An average rate cut of 3.91% — or $10.36 per resident, per day — turned into an average increase of two cents per resident, per day.
However, an average does not tell the whole story, which is where things get wonky. Nursing home reimbursement is based upon the medical complexity of Medicaid residents as captured on a particular “picture day” — Aug. 31, 2025, in the case of the Jan. 1 rates. That medical complexity results in what is called a “case mix index,” or CMI, score.
The Medicaid CMI is then divided by the CMI for your residents paying privately or admitted, post-hospitalization, on Medicare. This is called the all-payor CMI. The state “rebased” the system to state fiscal year 2024, and it turns out that the all-payor CMI on Aug. 31, 2023, was a lot higher for many facilities than their Aug. 31, 2025, Medicaid CMI. I’m a liberal arts major, but I know that if your divisor is bigger than the number you are dividing into you’re going to end up with a negative number.
Thus, even with the fund transfer, many facilities were left with a rate decrease on Jan. 1 — some quite severe. Consider, for example, a small nonprofit losing almost $46 per resident, per day. A Keene for-profit facility with New Hampshire-based ownership lost $34.49 per resident, per day, or 11.49% of its funding. The Rockingham County Nursing Home lost $26.77 per resident, per day.  Examples abound of for-profit and nonprofit facilities alike taking enormous hits to their care funding.
No margin exists for these cuts. Upset that the price of eggs is higher, or that the price of beef is up 13% just since last January? Try feeding, say, 100 people each day. Hourly earnings in nursing homes have gone up over 35% since the COVID-19 pandemic began, and yet facilities are still struggling to recover their pre-pandemic workforces within constrained Medicaid means.
New Hampshire’s hospitals, too, have not gotten back to pre-pandemic staffing levels, creating workforce competition between health care partners in a landscape of scarcity — with the irony being that inadequate nursing home staffing creates a barrier to hospital discharges. On the health care workforce front, at least, our hope is that the $204 million Gov. Ayotte secured from the federal government in a Rural Health Transformation Program grant can bring some eventual relief.
In the near term, some respite must be found in the 2026 legislative session for the biggest losers in the Jan. 1 rate change, or care access will be further restricted (many facilities already have waiting lists) and outright facility closures will occur. And in the future we must consider the perverse repercussions of a methodology that, in effect, punishes facilities in their Medicaid rate for caring for those on Medicare, as a facility cannot be all-Medicaid without certain bankruptcy.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/medicaidtrump-1024x650.jpg,,,2026-01-06 04:59:07.923695

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)An Ohio judge is determining whether or not two retired teachers’ pension fund leaders should be punished for allegedly participating in a corruption scheme, but investigations into the men are still ongoing.
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Karen Held Phipps is set to decide if State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum should be removed from his position, and if he and former board member Wade Steen should be banned from ever returning to public pensions.
“It’s an erosion of confidence in the institution that safeguards retirement security for Ohio’s teachers,” Assistant Attorney General Chad Kohler said during the trial.
The scandal centers on Steen and Fichtenbaum and their relationship with startup investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
“What I was trying to do was to provide benefits that were promised to planned beneficiaries — that were taken from them, like the cost of living adjustment — and reduce expenses when we had excessive investment costs,” Steen testified.
Attorney General Dave Yost’s team has submitted its closing argument on a case we’ve been uncovering for years — an alleged $65 billion scheme inside STRS.
“The question at trial was did they violate their fiduciary duty to the retired teachers, and I think we unquestionably proved that and proved it over again,” Yost said in a one-on-one interview in mid-December.
How we got here
In May of 2024, the governor received a 14-page anonymous whistleblower memo alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS. In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The documents claim that they tried to convince STRS members to partner with them and provide them with $65 billion.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
All of this failed, and finally, a whistleblower reached out to state officials.
Days later, Yost filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract steering “scheme” that could benefit them. Yost started the investigation after the memo, now known as being prepared by STRS employees, alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been bidding on QED.
“Their promotion of QED—a two-person startup with no clients, no assets under management, no track record, no infrastructure, and personnel lacking sufficient experience—was not only a lapse in judgment,” Kohler wrote in his closing.
“It was a calculated campaign that disregarded fiduciary obligations, subverted board governance, and jeopardized the financial future of over 500,000 current and retired educators.”
The state said that Metcalf worked behind the scenes to try to illegally secure the deal, pointing out concerns that the board members were too close to him.
Communications obtained via a records request of a court filing reveal that QED associates consistently told then-board member Steen what questions to ask, gave him documents to propose, and pushed him to follow its plan.
Fichtenbaum joined the conversations, too.
“We’re trying to explain their idea,” Fichtenbaum said.
However, the defense argued that seeking advice isn’t a crime, and they were simply trying to get better financial returns for educators. They also had a focus on increasing their cost-of-living adjustments.
“We need a lot of money in order to restore the COLA, no question about that,” Fichtenbaum said on the stand.
Each of Fichtenbaum and Steen’s attorneys wrote in their closings that the state didn’t prove that they would gain anything financially from this, and no harm was done because the proposal never went through.
Both also adamantly said that they never really proposed $65 billion. This was disputed by the state.
Fichtenbaum’s lawyer, Richard Kerger, added that there is no rule about asking questions that someone else submitted, nor was it harmful that Metcalf was getting access to confidential documents.
“There is no indication that any harm whatsoever occurred from that,” Kerger wrote. “And it is quite likely the information was not entitled to the confidential stamp.”
Then, the attorney added that in the case Fichtenbaum had done something wrong, being removed from his role wouldn’t be “appropriate” because that isn’t fair to the educators who elected him.
Steen’s attorney, Norm Abood, argued that the former board member was a “hero” to pensioners, stating that this has been a sham case.
“‘I’m going to do a thorough and impartial investigation,'” Abood said, imitating Yost. “And [Yost] filed five days later, that’s when he filed this case. No investigation.”
The attorney general had been criticized by the defendants for the quick turnaround time.
“Every defendant I’ve ever prosecuted, civilly or criminal, has either said that I had improper motives, didn’t do the investigation right, screwed something up,” Yost said. “That’s what defendants do.”
This is just a civil case, but the Ohio Ethics Commission has been investigating for at least a year and a half. They would be able to refer criminal charges.
It’s not Yost’s jurisdiction, he said, but it may be warranted.
“I do think they acted unethically,” the attorney general said.
The OEC is unable to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, but we obtained subpoenas that the commission sent to witnesses.
“It’s not unusual for them to let independent legal processes work out before they duplicate a process,” Yost said.

(States Newsroom file photo.)This story was originally published by Canary Media. 

Extreme weather is making the grid more prone to outages — and now FirstEnergy’s three Ohio utilities want more leeway on their reliability requirements.


Put simply, FirstEnergy is asking the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to let Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., Ohio Edison, and Toledo Edison take longer to restore power when the lights go out. The latter two utilities would also be allowed slightly more frequent outages per customer each year.


An administrative trial, known as an evidentiary hearing, is currently set to start Jan. 21.


Consumer and environmental advocates say it’s unfair to make customers shoulder the burden of lower-quality service, as they have already been paying for substantial grid-hardening upgrades.


“Relaxing reliability standards can jeopardize the health and safety of Ohio consumers,” said Maureen Willis, head of the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, which is the state’s legal representative for utility customers. ​“It also shifts the costs of more frequent and longer outages onto Ohioans who already paid millions of dollars to utilities to enhance and develop their distribution systems.”


The United States has seen a rise in blackouts linked to severe weather, a 2024 analysis by Climate Central found, with about twice as many such events happening from 2014 through 2023 compared to the 10 years from 2000 through 2009.


The duration of the longest blackouts has also grown. As of mid-2025, the average length of 12.8 hours represents a jump of almost 60% from 2022, J.D. Power reported in October.


Ohio regulators have approved less stringent reliability standards before, notably for AES Ohio and Duke Energy Ohio, where obligations from those or other orders required investments and other actions to improve reliability.


Some utilities elsewhere in the country have also sought leeway on reliability expectations. In April, for example, two New York utilities asked to exclude some outages related to tree disease and other factors from their performance metrics, which would in effect relax their standards.


Other utilities haven’t necessarily pursued lower targets, but have nonetheless noted vulnerabilities to climate change or experienced more major events that don’t count toward requirements.


FirstEnergy’s case is particularly notable because the company has slow-rolled clean energy and energy efficiency, two tools that advocates say can cost-effectively bolster grid reliability and guard against weather-related outages.


There is also a certain irony to the request: FirstEnergy’s embrace of fossil fuels at the expense of clean energy and efficiency measures has let its subsidiaries’ operations and others continue to emit high levels of planet-warming carbon dioxide. Now, the company appears to nod toward climate-change-driven weather variability as justification for relaxed reliability standards.


FirstEnergy filed its application to the Public Utilities Commission last December, while its recently decided rate case and other cases linked to its House Bill 6 corruption scandal were pending. FirstEnergy argues that specific reliability standards for each of its utilities should start with an average of the preceding five years’ performance.
From there, FirstEnergy says the state should tack on extra allowances for longer or more frequent outages to ​“account for annual variability in factors outside the Companies’ control, in particular, weather impacts that can vary significantly on a year-to-year basis.”


“Honestly, I don’t know of a viable hypothesis for this increasing variability outside of climate change,” said Victoria Petryshyn, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Southern California, who grew up in Ohio.


In summer, systems are burdened by constant air-conditioning use during periods of extreme heat and humidity. In winter, frigid air masses resulting from disruptions to the jet stream can boost demand for heat and ​“cause extra strain on the grid if natural-gas lines freeze,” Petryshyn said.

“All the weather becomes supercharged,” Petryshyn said. ​“We can all expect stronger storms, stronger winds, and more frequent extreme weather that threatens grid stability.”


 Contributing to the problem?

FirstEnergy has a long history of obstructing measures that would both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate stress on the power grid.


In February 2024, the company abandoned its interim 2030 goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and said it would continue running two West Virginia coal plants. Before that, FirstEnergy backed plans to weaken Ohio’s energy-efficiency goals. And during the first Trump administration, the company urged the Department of Energy to use emergency powers to keep unprofitable coal and nuclear plants running.


FirstEnergy also spent roughly $60 million on efforts to get lawmakers to pass and protect House Bill 6, the law at the heart of Ohio’s largest utility corruption scandal. HB 6’s nuclear and coal bailouts have since been repealed, but the state’s clean-energy standards remain gutted.


Meanwhile, regulators have let FirstEnergy’s utilities charge customers millions of dollars for grid modernization, ​“which are supposed to support the utility’s ability to adapt and improve the electric grid to rigging challenges from climate change,” said Karin Nordstrom, a clean-energy attorney with the Ohio Environmental Council.


“However, FirstEnergy has not provided the same investment in energy-efficiency programs, which can help manage rising demand at lower cost than expensive capital investment,” Nordstrom said. FirstEnergy should fully exhaust those tools and customer-funded grid-modernization investments before regulators relax the company’s requirements, she added.


Limited transparency makes FirstEnergy’s plan even more problematic, according to Shay Banton, a regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Earlier this year, Banton reported on grid disparities in FirstEnergy’s service territories that leave some areas more prone to outages.


“It feels too early for them to request leniency without proposing or implementing more comprehensive mitigations based on a detailed understanding of the root cause,” Banton said.


It’s also likely that FirstEnergy’s rate increase of nearly $76 million for Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.’s roughly 745,000 customers, approved on Nov. 19, already accounts for some weather-related factors. This summer, spokesperson Hannah Catlett told Canary Media that ​“the Illuminating Co. service territory generally sees bigger storm impacts” than areas served by FirstEnergy’s other Ohio utilities.


“Our request to adjust the reliability standards is not a step back in our commitment,” Catlett told Canary Media this fall. ​“We are confident in the progress underway and remain focused on improving reliability through continued investment in the communities we are privileged to serve.”


But fundamentally, additional leeway for weather variation is unnecessary, said Ashley Brown, a former Ohio utility commissioner and former executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group. Averaging utility performance over several years — the way most regulators do as part of setting reliability standards — should already account for that.


“In fact, the standard should always be going up,” Brown added. ​“You should expect more productivity from the company.”

(Getty Images)My father was a brilliant communications professor who had a doctorate and earned tenure at the university where he taught. He wrote books that had been published and took many speaking engagements. He also served as a part-time pastor.
I would have never guessed that my dad would struggle with dementia because of his Parkinson’s disease. I watched my dad and his mind fade away. It was very distressing to me and my family. It’s very distressing to many families.
Dementia, along with memory loss and cognitive decline, affects millions in the United States. Many of them live in Kansas. Too many families are not prepared for this next stage and don’t know what to do. The other issue at play here is the high cost of assisted living and senior care. It’s almost like trying to purchase a high-cost apartment these days. Families are suffering.
My mom works part-time for Home Instead Senior Care. She does non-medical work and helps take care of seniors in their homes. My sister and I tease her by saying she is a senior taking care of seniors.
My mom’s clients love her. However, not everyone can afford services like in-home care. Home Instead does a fantastic job of looking after folks. To try to find care for a loved one is so difficult. It’s hard enough that the family member is struggling, but then to find affordable care is really a challenge.
To have a family member lose their former ability to think and process information is a harrowing experience. People struggle so much these days, and now there is so much dementia going on among the population. Families don’t know where to turn.
I felt as though part of me was gone when my dad’s mind started declining. It was difficult to communicate with him. He had been a brilliant thinker and teacher and now this? I turned to my faith for solace and comfort during those challenging times.
Families need to know they are not alone when a loved one is suffering with dementia, memory loss or cognitive decline. I know of men whose wives have died because of their dementia, and it has been quite a blow to their peace of mind. They had been power couples, and now they lost their true love. It’s simply tragic.
How can we help family members experiencing this grief with their loved one? How can we make sure that people who need help are taken care of by dedicated professionals? We need to reach out and check in on the family and take them a meal or ask how we can help. We need to help them know they are not alone.
There is comfort, there is solace. Let’s reach out and help those in need.

As the world slept, the U.S. dropped bombs in the middle of Caracas, captured a sleazy dictator and his wife, and declared that Washington would henceforth “run” Venezuela and appropriate its oil fields. 
From Mar-a-Largo, Donald Trump bragged on Saturday about the unprovoked warfare they launched unilaterally on a sovereign nation to commandeer it for ExxonMobil, Chevron, and other U.S. oil conglomerates.
All the shifting Trumpian justifications for lawlessly blowing up alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and ordering a large-scale military attack on Venezuela’s capital city to topple a “bad hombre” were simply cover for seizing the spoils of an oil-rich South American country. 
We have been dragged into another ill-defined, open-ended war on a ruse. Shades of Iraq, 2003. Back then the pretext was WMD’s or phantom Iraqi “weapons of war.” A “shock and awe” military campaign in Baghdad followed to overthrow another brutal dictator with another open-ended “nation-building” disaster that cost the U.S. dearly in blood and treasure. Over 4,400 U.S. soldiers died in the conflict with a price tag in the trillions. American troops are still there. But at least Halliburton, a massive U.S. oil service corporation, walked away with billions in profits.

It is déjà vu all over again in Venezuela, which has the world’s largest oil reserves. But there is one significant difference. 
In a grave abuse of power, (and defiance of the U.S. Constitution) Trump secretly took the U.S. to war on his own. Without congressional approval — or even knowledge. Without buy-in from the public. 
He acted without any checks or balances on his illegal use of military force to compel regime change, take Venezuelan oil and, as he repeatedly vowed, run the country indefinitely. 
He threatened sovereign nations in the region with similar action if they did not genuflect to him and insisted he was “not afraid to put boots on the ground.”  
Sorry, what?! Besides a power-hungry president on an empire-expansion kick in the Western Hemisphere and Big Oil on board for big dividends, exactly how are the interests of Main Street, America served by the Trump war on Venezuela? 
How has the U.S. military’s months-long buildup near Venezuela, bombing of Caracas and capture of Nicholas Maduro helped over 500,000 Ohioans whose health insurance premiums just went through the roof when ACA tax credits expired in 2025?
How do the billions of tax dollars spent on the U.S invasion/occupation of Venezuela alone, plus the hundreds of billions needed for long-term stabilization and reconstruction, and the estimated trillion for a decade of potentially protracted conflict/insurgency lower the cost of living in Ohio, increase the supply of affordable housing or bring down grocery bills? 
Not at all. 
How will running Venezuela fix Ohio’s shredded safety net decimated by Trump’s historic funding cuts to support systems like SNAP (food stamps), Medicaid, community health services, child welfare, and environmental programs? 
Not at all. 
How will a war of choice rescue overwhelmed food pantries in the state as more Ohioans lose benefits and go hungry? 
Not at all. 
“At a time when families here at home are struggling with rising costs, health care bills, and economic uncertainty, Americans should not be asked to take on the burden of governing another country,” said Ohio Democratic U.S. Rep. Shontel Brown, of Cleveland. 
Did “America First” Trump supporters vote for gratuitous U.S. military conquests in foreign countries at the expense of affordability, health care, and job creation? 
Not at all. 
As more learn that Venezuela is not, in fact, a major drug trafficker to the U.S. and that Trump pardoned a major drug trafficker to the U.S., the propaganda for going to war in South America may be a hard sell. 
Cincinnati Democrat Greg Landsman from Ohio’s 1st congressional district wants to know “what the threats were that could justify military action and putting Americans in harm’s way.”  
Other Democrats stressed the suffering of the Venezuelan people under Maduro did not give Trump the right to wage war on Caracas with no clear goals, explanation, or consent from Congress or the public. 
Most Republicans in the Ohio congressional delegation — save 7th District Rep. Max Miller — parroted the party line about Maduro being a bad guy who had to go for the good of Venezuela and America. 
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno hailed Trump, of course, for eliminating “a clear and present danger to our nation” despite evidence to the contrary. 
Only Miller noted, “History teaches that regime changes imposed from the outside rarely deliver peace, stability, or democracy. America’s role in the world is not to remake nations in our image.”
Scattered protests erupted in Ohio against Trump risking American blood for oil. 
Venezuela is chaotic and corrupt but not a demonstrated imminent security threat to the United States. 
I suspect protests may spread if Congress sits on its hands as Trump continues to issue direct warnings to Venezuela’s new leader and other heads of state in the hemisphere who get in his way as he eyes more territory to invade and pillage in our name. 
What do we get for his saber rattling and war-making besides a rerun of towering costs and grim casualties in a hot mess with no escape? We get Iraq 2.0 and a foreboding new year.

Once Gov. Wes Moore (D) receives Coley’s name, he has 15 days to appoint him to replace former Del. Jazz Lewis, whose resignation took effect Monday. Lewis stepped down to accept a job as a lobbyist for his alma mater, University of Maryland, College Park, and is leaving with just over a week to the start of the 20-26 General Assembly.
If chosen, Coley would work alongside fellow Democrats Dels. Tiffany Alston and Andrea Fletcher Harrison in the district that includes Fairmount Heights, Glenarden and Glenn Dale.
But there could be competition in the June 2026 primary election.
LaTasha Ward, one of the four candidates who appeared before the committee Monday, said after the hearing that she plans to run for the seat.
Ward ran for the District 24 seat in the 2018 primary election and came in fourth among 11 candidates vying for three seats in the District. She also came in fourth in the 2022 primary, when she trailed Alston by 101 votes.
“Service is not something I do seasonally. It is who I am,” said Ward, who is a community activist and founder and executive director of a nonprofit called Solid Foundation Inc.
According to the state Board of Elections calendar, the filing deadline is 9 p.m. Feb. 24.

The other two candidates Monday were Crystal Carpenter, chief operating officer at the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth based in Washington, D.C.; and Glenarden City Councilmember Cashenna Cross, who has also served as mayor. She works as a corporate planning officer with the National Security Agency based in Fort Meade.
The candidates were asked six questions each, such as how they would work with elected officials, community leaders and residents to build coalitions in the district.
Cross acknowledged society is in the digital age, but not everyone has access to modern technology.
“We send an email, and we think that’s enough,” he said. “But I’m from the old school, where we walk about and we meet and greet” people.
Carpenter said she’s already doing similar work such as serving as chair on the county’s Lynching Memorial Project.
“I’ve always ensured that our community came first,” she said. “We disagree sometimes, but I think coalition building is in my blood. It’s in my spirit. It’s what I do. Nothing’s going to change.”

Coley becomes the third person selected by the central committee to fill a vacant legislative seat in a little more than a month.
The committee convened Nov. 25 to choose Kevin Harris as a state senator to represent District 27, which includes portions of Prince George’s, Calvert and Charles counties. He replaced former Sen. Michael Jackson, now the State Police superintendent.
The committee convened more than a month later, on Dec. 30, to nominate Darrell Odom Sr. to serve as a state delegate in District 27A to replace Harris. Because that district also serves a portion of Charles County, however, the Democratic central committee there also has a say.
Charles County Democrats went in a different direction Saturday, choosing Yonelle Moore Lee, chair of the Charles County Board of Education.
Both Moore Lee and Odom will be sent to the governor, who will have to decide which person to choose as the next District 27A delegate.

Southern California Edison received 1,500 applications for its Eaton fire compensation program and only paid out 82 after close to two months.


After just over two months, Southern California Edison has drawn more than 1,800 customers to a compensation program meant to settle scores of lawsuits against the company over the deadly Eaton Fire. As of Monday, the company has made offers to 82 of those who applied,  Pedro Pizarro, CEO of Edison’s parent company Edison International, told CalMatters.
Fire survivors, who have been providing feedback to Edison since before it launched the settlement program  still have strong criticisms of the utility’s compensation effort, called the “Wildfire Recovery Compensation Program.” They complain that it requires participants to forego lawsuits against the company and blocks them from seeking further compensation for fire-related health claims. Many said the program’s payment caps, which limit the amount claimants can receive, were too low and enable Edison to pay less than the utility might otherwise owe should it be found responsible for the fire.  
The Eaton fire burned 14,000 acres of Los Angeles County in January and killed 19. While the official cause has not yet been determined, a leading theory is that Edison’s equipment sparked the blaze. The U.S. Department of Justice is among those who have blamed the utility for the fire.
Insurance money and personal savings are running out for people who lost homes, livelihoods and loved ones in the fire, they and their advocates say. Many are unhoused or facing housing insecurity. One survey estimated 80% of Altadena residents were still displaced by the fire as of October. The Eaton Fire Survivors Network, a prominent grassroots organization, called on Edison to provide up to $200,000 per displaced household “based on verified costs” to help cover housing costs.
“It’s Edison’s responsibility to solve all of this,” Joy Chen, executive director of the group, said. “It’s their fire.”
About $7.6 billion in insurance claims related to the Eaton Fire were paid out as of November, according to the California Department of Insurance, the most recent figures available. About 90% of the payout was for residential property.
Edison offered a collective total of $34.4 million to settle the 82 claims, and none of the offers were declined, it said.
About half of the claims that received an offer from Edison as of December, Pizarro said, were for total losses, and about half were related to smoke and ash damage. While he did not provide specific numbers, Pizarro said that the claims were spread across geography, income levels and home values. Many of those that have been made offers are part of the program’s fast-track option.
At a Dec. 16 press conference held by the survivors network, displaced residents spoke about how unstable housing and the loss of their homes has affected their lives. Gabriel Gonzalez, a plumbing company owner, lost his home, business and about $80,000 worth of tools in the fire. He lived out of his car for an extended period before receiving a small amount of financial assistance that helped him stay in a rental for a few months. But that money is expected to run out this month.
“As of the first of January, I’ll probably be back in my car,” he said at the event.
Pizarro told CalMatters that Edison will not be providing money to residents for housing outside of its compensation program, citing the need to validate expenses. The survivors network request for housing cost assistance was limited to verifiable costs. 
One criticism of the program was that children do not receive the same compensation as adults. Under the current version of the program, children receive between 50% and 65% of the compensation adults receive for a loss of their residency, depending on the damage category. If their primary home that they live in was destroyed, adults would get $115,000 and children would receive $75,000. These rates are slightly higher than a draft version of the plan Edison released in the fall.
An open letter at the time from the Eaton Fire Survivor’s Network said giving children less than an equal valuation to adults “treats their suffering as lesser when it is, in reality, greater.”
Pizarro said Edison went with a lower valuation because children often don’t receive as much as adults do under similar programs and adults “end up bearing more responsibility and more cost” for the household and “arrangements for the children.”
“The reality is that adults carry much more burden here,” he said, “and so it’s fair that they, you know, that we have more compensation targeted at the adults.” 
Another frustration those affected by the fire expressed was the requirement that participants waive their right to sue the company. Legal representatives of fire survivors who are suing the company cautioned that the settlement program through Edison could short people of any damages and suffering compensation a court might award, as well as potential long term health care compensation or monitoring. 
“We are approaching this as a way to settle litigation,” Pizarro said. “It is a form of legal settlement, and legal settlements are typically settlements of all matters, otherwise they’re not really, you know, they’re not really a conclusion to litigation.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_28.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 08:59:42.018184

Jose Angel Amezcua
Jose Angel Amezcua is a formerly  incarcerated firefighter from Salinas


On a cold January day at our fire camp in Northern California, I learned my crew was being sent south. On the bus, I kept wondering why they would need our help with a fire in the winter. 
As we got closer, I saw towering black smoke rising miles into the sky and spreading across the horizon. 
For the next three weeks, I was one of hundreds of incarcerated firefighters who helped battle and contain the deadly LA fires. During the blazes, I moved through ash-covered Eaton Canyon, creating fire breaks, hauling sandbags to prevent mudslides and clearing fallen trees and debris in Altadena. 
Before then, I had only fought wildland fires. I had never seen such devastation in a city. In  neighborhoods I saw homes and structures reduced to rubble and people trying to salvage whatever they could. It was heartbreaking to witness the destruction.
But it was also a stark reminder that I was right where I was supposed to be — helping to save the communities I had once harmed.
Early in my incarceration I knew I had to better myself, so I attended as many classes and groups as I could. Then the opportunity came to join a fire camp, which would allow me to leave the prison and spend time outside. I joined knowing I could earn time off my sentence — but what I gained was so much more.
I joined the Youth Offender Fire Camp Program at Growlersburg, a pilot program launched in 2023 that allowed young people under 26 to train as wildland firefighters, instead of being held in a high-security prison. At Growlersburg, I noticed a big difference from my time in prison: we had better food, better living arrangements and we got to be outside in the woods. 
The Cal Fire Captains treated us like equals. I trained as a handcrew firefighter, creating firelines to contain wildfires and clearing vegetation with hand tools. Then I started to fight fires.

Nothing can mentally prepare you for being on a fire line. You feel the adrenaline, and it pushes you to your limits. Fighting a fire means working 24-hour shifts, sometimes climbing mountains in the dark, using heavy tools to create a fire line. 
I didn’t realize our impact until, in a stereotypical moment, we helped a woman find her cat during a wildfire. That showed me the difference our work made in helping someone during their darkest moments.
Over time, I became a sawyer, someone who cuts down trees with a chainsaw. I began to enjoy the work and imagined a different future as I watched my crew members get released and become firefighters with Cal Fire’s support.
During the LA fires, the Rose Bowl became our base camp, where we were greeted with gratitude from elected officials, celebrities and community members. For the first time, we realized that people wanted to hear our stories, that the world saw us as more than our past mistakes. 
It was an incredible feeling to know our hard work mattered and that others believed we were deserving of a second chance.
At firecamp, the rehabilitation and reentry preparation classes I took with the Anti-Recidivism Coalition helped me get ready to come home and prepare for my next journey.  Fire camp reduced my 10-year sentence to 5½ years, and I came home from prison a few months ago. 
Since then I’ve been cherishing every moment with my family and my wife. Life on the outside is harder than I expected, but fire camp prepared me for the mental challenges of rebuilding my life. It taught me to push forward, no matter what.I had never held a job before. I came to prison at a young age. I never believed in my future. Now, becoming a firefighter is my calling. I’m working to expunge my record so I can keep saving lives and stopping fires from spreading.When people think of incarcerated people, they often see us as a danger, with our past mistakes magnified. Amid the smoke, ash, and destruction of the LA fires, people saw us as heroes, recognizing the good we could achieve when given a second chance. 
It’s been one year since the fires. California has raised wages for incarcerated firefighters and made the Growlersburg Fire Camp program permanent. During the LA fires, the attention to our stories showed that people want to see second chances given not just to firefighters, but to all incarcerated people working to turn their lives around.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/012225_Incarcerated-Firefighter_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 08:59:42.018184
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-06 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,AI is stunting critical thinking,Robert T.F. Downes,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/ai-is-stunting-critical-thinking/,We can either defend the habits of mind a robust democracy requires or preside over the automation of thinking and the training of automations.,"“Just use ChatGPT.”  
 That’s the whisper in lecture halls, the temptation in browser tabs, and the callow counsel passed among today’s undergraduates as though it were an indispensable life hack, or even a godsend.   
More and more, large language models (LLMs) are becoming the silent co-authors behind too many “perfectly fine” paragraphs that look fluent and polished on the surface but are weightless, insipid, and shallow in substance. Put differently, generative AI capabilities tempt students to stop thinking after the initial prompt, producing vapid prose that sounds like thought while saying almost nothing at all.  
This view shouldn’t be read as alarmism. It’s prudence. Nor does it fall into the trap of personifying AI, as if the machine itself had motives or malice. It is simply an acknowledgment and description of consequences now plain to anyone who reads students’ written work for a living. When we outsource the agency of young learners, whose central task is curiosity and growth in an educational environment, rather than meeting workplace productivity quotas, we also outsource the formation of the mind.
 LLMs are undeniably useful. Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are accessible, fast, and relatively frictionless, handling tasks like summarization, translation, outlining, practice-question generation, and troubleshooting with ease. In the right place, they offer a real utility. But they ought not gain a strong foothold in pedagogy, for a tool’s value depends on what it displaces. When it displaces the very work education is meant to train — attention, judgment, synthesis, revision, and the willingness to sit with uncertainty — it doesn’t help at all. It hollows.  
 Educators don’t get to be neutral about that, especially those of us who insist that education is not simply a product, but a public good. In our classrooms, we can either defend the habits of mind a robust democracy requires or preside over the automation of thinking and the training of automations.  
 The reckoning has already begun. In a    Washington Post    article   published on December 12, 2025, professors explain how they are returning to oral and in-class, hand-written exams because take-home assessments have become so easy to counterfeit with generative AI. One professor quoted in the    Washington Post    article tells students that using AI to do the intellectual lifting is like “bringing a forklift to the gym when your goal is to build muscle.” She describes the classroom as a “gymnasium” and wants students “to lift the weights” themselves. Assessments conducted in live settings force students to own their understanding of course material, explain claims and concepts in their own words, and make their own connections, without a hidden prompt smoothing over gaps in comprehension.  
 The gymnasium metaphor deserves to stick, because it names the real danger of AI-in-education: i.e., not wrong answers, but atrophied faculties. You can still “lift the weight” with a forklift. You just won’t get stronger. And the more we, as educators, normalize the forklift, the more we quietly redefine the purpose of schooling, shifting the focus from cultivating the quality of creativity and critical thinking to producing quantifiable outputs that never probe beyond the superficial. Worse yet, our inaction will train students into a kind of learned helplessness: if the forklift is ever unavailable — offline, paywalled, restricted, or simply wrong — many will discover they no longer know how to lift at all.  
 Research is beginning to validate what teachers have been sensing. A    Microsoft Research study    published in April 2025 surveyed 319 “knowledge workers.” It reported that higher confidence in generative AI (as opposed to higher self-confidence) is associated with reduced critical-thinking effort, with people dropping the cognitive work of discovery and synthesis to supervise and verify an LLM’s output.   
 This finding does not constitute a moral indictment against those who use AI tools and benefit from productivity boosts. However, one must understand that efficiency is not the same thing as education. A polished paragraph is not the same thing as a formed mind.  
 There’s another loss we should put plainly out in the open: the detriment to the craft of writing itself. Students already tend to treat revising as a tedious task — something that “takes time” rather than something that clarifies thought and strengthens reasoned argumentation. This is a detriment precisely because drafting, editing, and rewriting are not simply cosmetic steps at window dressing the real work of jotting down one’s ideas. They    are    the real work.   
 We write to find out what we think. We revise to discover what our claims can actually bear. The sentence you cut, the transition you refine, the example you sharpen — none of these are mere ornaments on good writing. They are the mind training itself through reflection. A tool that promises to eliminate revision might save time and labor, but at what cost? For students, it can short-circuit the organic process by which ideas become arguments, and arguments become convictions disciplined by evidence.  
 Creativity is vulnerable, too, in a subtler way. The promise is that AI will “supercharge” imagination. The cost is that it can standardize it. A    paper    published this year in the peer-reviewed scientific journal    Nature Human Behaviour    reports that ChatGPT-assisted brainstorming tends to reduce idea diversity across groups — narrowing and homogenizing the range of available sources and solutions, even when individual outputs appear clever. Similarly, a    Science Advances    study    published last year found that generative AI can be useful for “creative writing,” while still making the overall pool of stories more similar. In other words, outputs are better-looking but less novel. This screams    inauthentic   .   
 The danger isn’t that students will stop producing. It’s that they’ll sow their various seeds of thought into a terrain only capable of producing rearrangements of the same thing, mistaking fluency for originality and coherence for creativity and understanding.  
 So yes: returning to tried-and-true methods is one option. In-class writing. Oral exams. Live defense. Not because we long for grading blue book exams, but because we’re serious about the mission and purpose of education.  
 However, educators shouldn’t respond by fortifying the old walls alone. We should also build smarter, more innovative classrooms that encourage students to interact with one another and actively grapple with the objects of knowledge before them.  
 This is especially urgent for those of us in political science, history, philosophy, and humanities departments, for we are explicitly charged with the duty of forming responsible, inquisitive, and informed citizens.   
 Our aim is not only for students to recite civics. It’s that they can appreciate and practice it. They should leave our courses with the ability to weigh evidence, interpret institutions, argue in good faith, and reach compromise, while concomitantly recognizing trade-offs, resisting manipulation, and revising their views with a budding sense of intellectual maturity.    Democracies    do not fail only because people lack information. They fail because people lose the habits of thought that underlie deliberation and informed consent.  
 That’s why, when designing my undergraduate Introduction to American Government course, I’ve opted to replace the midterm and final exams with a moot court and a mock Congress. The pedagogical aim of these exercises is active learning and interactive immersion. It moves students from rote memorization and recitation to collectively inhabiting the process and stakes of governance. For instance, in the mock Congress, students will certainly learn how a bill becomes a law, for we need a common vocabulary to conduct the exercise in the first place. The idea is that they will then apply what they have learned from our readings, not on paper but through first-hand experience with agenda-setting, coalition-building, bargaining, and the hard calculus of compromise.  
 This functions like an oral exam with an interactive twist that transforms the classroom into an animated learning community. It makes thinking public, accountable, and alive. Students cannot prompt their way through discussion or automate their intellectual courage.  
 The classroom should be one of the few places where students are expected to try, experiment, take intellectual risks, and fail with low stakes. These are all elements of personal and intellectual growth. When AI becomes the ever-present escape hatch, students lose permission to participate in this process. They stop drafting and start generating. They stop thinking and start submitting.  
 So here’s the call, educators. Fight back! Neither panic nor resignation will take us far. But thoughtful, creative design can. Bring back assessments that make thinking visible and accountable. Create assignments that involve trial and error and demand spontaneity. Defend the classroom as a civic workshop, a space where minds are trained for free inquiry rather than optimized for productivity.  
 If we don’t protect critical thinking now, we won’t merely see worse essays. We’ll see a weaker, incurious citizenry.

For attention and power, President Trump’s political campaigns and propaganda have been punctuated with repeated, frightening lies about immigrants, calling them rapists, terrorists, invaders, and murderers.  He falsely claimed they were replacing American workers, stealing their benefits, voting for Democrats, and even eating their neighbors’ dogs.
Responsible journalists have documented and analyzed his record as a serial liar.  The Washington Post documented 30,573 false or misleading claims during his first presidential term, an average of 21 per day.   The Los Angeles Times said during his first Presidential campaign that “Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has. 
Historian Douglas Brinkley stated that U.S. presidents have occasionally “lied or misled the country,” but none were a “serial liar” like Trump. And New York University’s professor of psychology Donnel Stern, said, Trump “lies as a policy,” and “will say anything” to satisfy his supporters or himself.  Stern, Donnel (May 9, 2019). “Constructivism in the Age of Trump: Truth, Lies, and Knowing the Difference.” 
Trump illustrated Stern’s assessment when the president instructed his former press secretary Stephanie Grisham, “As long as you keep repeating something, it doesn’t matter what you say.” To this end, Trump continues to claim falsely that the 2020 election had been rigged and that he never lost.
And though Trump’s supporters know that the president likes to cry “Wolf,” they’ve excused his lies the way adults may indulge those of a child.
As in Aesop’s fable, the good neighbors’ tolerance for these lies eventually runs out, and it seems Trump’s supporters, too, may have reached the end of their tolerance for his manipulating lies.
That’s because in this case, the wolf has arrived at the doors of the American public.  It has crept up on them in the form of rising inflation, grocery prices, housing costs, insurance rates, and the national debt.  It has pounced in the form of tariffs that Trump falsely promised would be paid by foreign countries but have come at the expense of American businesses and consumers.  This wolf has clawed at the social safety net, cut food stamps, and slashed Medicaid.  It has skulked into American towns and cities in the form of masked ICE agents who racially profile, terrorize, arrest, and deport their neighbors without due process of the law.  It has raided the Department of Education and left it a hollow shell.
And now just when Trump’s long-term supporters need the president to come running to their aid for a change, he has preposterously denied the wolf’s presence.  “We have no inflation,” the president declared in his nationally televised “60 Minutes” interview.  “Our groceries are down,” he lied.  According to the president, the economic wolf is a “hoax.”
Further, the president similarly has denied the wolf at the door of our allies.  After telling the monumental lie that he would end the war in Ukraine during his first 24 hours in office, the American President has instead reduced support for the victim of the Russian wolf’s attack that has killed the Ukrainian people, ravaged their lands, destroyed their infrastructure, kidnapped their children, and threatened the future of a democratic Europe. Perversely, Trump has instead secretly conspired with the Russian wolf to make future business deals with America, and to force Ukraine’s permanent subservience to the predator.
In other words, in an ironic twist to Aesop’s fable, the wolf now threatens the flock of the shepherd boy’s good neighbors. But instead of the shepherd boy shouting a warning and coming to their aid, he not only denies the wolf’s presence, but he colludes with the predator at the expense and peril of its innocent victims.
But now the American public has had enough.  The President’s favorability poll numbers have sunk, even within his own political party, and Democrats recently swept November elections.
Consequently, for the first time in his political life, Trump has indirectly admitted the truth, (of course for his own political survival.) He’s bailed out farmers hurt by his tariffs with taxpayers’ money.  He’s cut tariffs on some goods, like beef, coffee, tomatoes, and bananas, which amount to an admission of his lies about inflation, grocery prices, and the failure of his tariff policy.  
His consideration of extending Obamacare subsidies admits to the high cost of healthcare that threatens to economically devour his constituents.  He’s rehiring lawyers at the Department of Education to handle the backlog of discrimination complaints.  Perhaps most importantly, he has been forced to face the truth that nobody, including his supporters, believes anything he says.

April McClain Delaney (D-6th) said Monday that House Democrats “must imminently consider impeachment proceedings” against President Donald Trump for the unauthorized raid in Venezuela and his claim that the U.S. would “run” the county for the timebeing.
“This move follows a year in which he has illegally dismantled federal agencies, conducted cruel immigration raids against our neighbors – including American citizens – instigated an unlawful trade war, called for the execution of sitting Members of Congress, and now is escalating international tensions even further with military threats against Colombia and Greenland,” McClain Delaney said in a statement released by her office.
“These individual actions are impeachable offenses in their own right, but their ever mounting cumulative impact on our country’s stability and health puts everything in a new light. I now believe that our Democratic Caucus must imminently consider impeachment proceedings,” her statement said.
It’s a slight step forward for McClain Delaney, who said on her campaign’s X account Saturday that the invasion of Venezuela was an impeachable offense, but that, “Whether it makes sense to pursue impeachment as the best strategy to end this lawlessness is a tactical judgment that our Caucus needs to seriously deliberate.”
McClain Delaney’s statement comes as she faces a challenge from David Trone, the millionaire who held the 6th District seat before her. In announcing his bid for the seat last month, Trone made criticism of Trump the main pitch, saying while in the House he “confronted him [Trump] head-on — voting twice to impeach him and backing reforms to rein in his abuse of power. McClain Delaney responded by saying she has and would “continue to take on Trump’s assault on our government workers, defend our diverse community, protect choice and women’s reproductive rights, and work against inflation-creating tariffs.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The House tried to impeach Trump before, of course, twice sending articles of impeachment to the Senate, which refused to convict him both times. And that was when Democrats controlled the House and, for at least one of those votes, the Senate. With both chambers now in Republican hands, odds of an impeachment are shakier.
McClain Delaney may be the latest Democrat to call for impeachment, but she’s not the first: Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) and Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) filed impeachment motions in April and May, respectively — which Green followed with additional impeachment motions in June and December.
Wilkins passes torch
You can be chair of a committee, and you can be chair of a caucus, but apparently you can’t be both.
Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), who will become chair of the House Ways and Means Committee when the General Assembly convenes next week, announced that because of that responsibility she will step down as chair of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland later this month. She has been caucus chair since December 2022, when she succeeded former Del. Darryl Barnes.
“From the outset of her leadership, Chair Wilkins brought a vision that was both expansive and grounded, strengthening the Caucus internally while elevating its stature within the General Assembly and across the state,” according to a statement from the caucus Monday.
Through three legislative sessions with Wilkins as chair, the caucus got more than three dozen bills signed into law, including bills creating a correctional ombudsman to assess Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services programs, allowing those incarcerated a second chance at release and expanding the authority of the state’s current Prescription Drug Affordability Board.

The Black Caucus made history in July 2024 when it convened its first-ever meeting in Harford County that was called by Del. Andre V. Johnson Jr. (D-Harford), the first state Black lawmaker from that county. The caucus also led a discussion last year on contested circuit court races, which some members supported and others did not. The measure was eventually tucked away, at least for now.
The caucus also endured some tough battles, such as the shock of Gov. Wes Moore (D), the first Black governor of Maryland, vetoing a bill in May to create a statewide Reparations Commission.
The legislature overrode that veto in a special session last month. That clears the way for a 23-member commission that will study the possibility of reparations in light of  specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction to Jim Crow eras, and examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from policies that led to discrimination. The commission is also charged with recommending appropriate reparations, from a statement of apology to monetary compensation or social service assistance.
Peña-Melnyk brings back Mizeur
Incoming House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) announced late Monday that she is bringing on former Del. Heather Mizeur as her communications director, along with a number of additional committee appointments.
Mizeur, a Democrat, represented Montgomery County in the House from 2007 to 2015, when she ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for governor. She moved to her Eastern Shore farm where she hosted a podcast that featured guests ranging from Democratic former Sen. Barbara Mikulski to then-Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, before running unsuccessfully against Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) in 2022.
Peña-Melnyk said she is bringing Mizeur on for her focus “on disrupting division and bridging the differences that fuel polarization in politics, She believes democracy is not sustained by rhetoric alone, but through daily acts of faith in one another—expressed in how leaders listen, speak, and show up in moments of challenge.”

“She brings unique skills to our communications team that will help humanize public leadership, lower the temperature of public discourse, and ensure our work reflects clarity, restraint, dignity, and truth,” said Peña-Melnyk, who was elected to the House in the same class as Mizeur. “At a time when trust in democratic institutions is fragile, how leaders communicate matters profoundly.”
Peña-Melnyk also announced the creation of a House Study Group on Economic Stability, which will evaluate policies and programs aimed at reducing poverty and improving economic stability, with a particular focus on “the needs of working families who earn too much to qualify for assistance programs but lack a meaningful safety net,” according to a release from her office.
The 12-member committee will be co-chaired by Dels. Robbyn Lewis (D-Baltimore City) and Lily Qi (D-Montgomery).
Peña-Melnyk also named the members of a new rural caucus, to be co-chaired by Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-Upper Shore) and Del. Natalie Ziegler (D-Howard and Montgomery, that will be charged with bringing concerns of the Eastern Shore, Western Maryland and Southern Maryland to the table in Annapolis, she said.

(Annie Knox, Utah News Dispatch)For members of Utah’s Venezuelan community who have long hoped to see the country’s socialist government brought down, Patricia Quiñonez described the United States’ capture of President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend as having a “bittersweet taste.” 
“More than 25 years fighting for the return of democracy, to defeat the dictatorship, and it happens under a foreign military intervention,” Quiñonez, who runs Utahzolanos, a social media outlet and community, said Monday.

“We are deeply grateful that the United States is supporting us in the fight for freedom and that Maduro and his wife are now imprisoned, but the weight of uncertainty overwhelms us, preventing us from celebrating as we would like,” Quiñonez told Utah News Dispatch. 
Now the community is left to wonder what will happen to its members seeking asylum in the U.S., she said, and what will become of the South American nation, its government, economy, and oil reserves. 
That the capture of Maduro occurred without notice or approval from Congress troubled about 50 protesters who gathered Monday in downtown Salt Lake City, chanting “No blood for oil” and echoing similar demonstrations across the nation.  
“It really is shocking, and it can’t shock us into silence. It has to shock us into action,” Sarah Buck, a protest organizer with Salt Lake Indivis
ible, told the group outside the Wallace F. Bennett Federal Building. 
The group urged Utah Sens. Mike Lee and John Curtis to vote in favor of legislation before the U.S. Senate that would block further military intervention without congressional authorization.

Outside the senators’ offices in Salt Lake City, demonstrator Kathy Van Dame, of Murray, held a sign that said “No war for oil.” 
“I’m afraid we’ll wind up with something that’s like Afghanistan and Iraq,” Van Dame said. She added that her mind was on her own relatives serving in the U.S. military. 
“It upsets the international rule of law,” Van Dame said of the strike. “It goes along with Putin and Xi’s idea of the new world order, that might makes right.”
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox shared a social media post Monday from Vice President JD Vance, in which Vance defended the strike and said “The United States, thanks to President Trump’s leadership, is a great power again. Everyone should take note.” 
“This is exactly right,” Cox said on the social media site X. “I’m grateful to @POTUS for taking decisive action to confront narco-terrorism and hold bad actors accountable, including in Venezuela.”

Wes Moore (D). It's the first time Moore and AFSCME have missed the Dec. 31 deadline to reach agreement on annual salary increases.","Gov. Wes Moore spoke to a gathering of state workers represented by AFSCME at a Sept. 9, 2025 event at the University of Maryland, College Park. (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The largest union in state government said it has rejected a contract proposal offered by Gov. Wes Moore.
The announcement came hours before Moore, a Democrat, announced reaching an agreement with unions representing six other groups of state employees. The failure to reach an agreement with AFSCME Council 3 represents the first time Moore’s administration has missed the annual Dec. 31 deadline to reach agreement on annual salary increases.
“AFSCME Maryland Bargaining Team members did not accept Governor Moore’s proposal that continues to lag behind the rate of inflation and understaff state services,” the union said in a statement. “Throughout bargaining, the administration had offered wage increases that did not keep up with inflation and failed to fully correct the AFSCME wage scales that lag behind a majority of state employees.”
Over the last several months, the union has taken to social media to highlight the state of contract negotiations and urge members to pressure the governor by contacting his office. The union represents about 50,000 workers statewide with more than half of those working in state government positions.
Two days before Christmas, the union ramped up pressure and unveiled a series of unfair labor practice complaints it had filed against the administration.
A spokesperson for the governor said at the time that Moore “has consistently stood up for Maryland’s workers, making clear that supporting labor and protecting our workforce are central to this administration’s work.”
Maryland union files unfair labor practice claims against the state

But Moore also faces another difficult budget year.
Last year, Moore and the legislature raised $1.6 billion in taxes to close a projected $3.3 billion structural budget gap. The solution was meant to fill that hole and offer a $300 million cushion for the coming year — a brief election year respite before having to face crushing deficits driven by required spending on K-12 education.
Another component of that effort was a buyout program. More than 300 employees took a payout to leave their jobs. In all, the state eliminated more than 500 positions including 170 that were vacant.
But last fall Moore and lawmakers were told those efforts fell short. The state again faces a $1.5 billion budget gap in the coming fiscal year.
A legislative panel is recommending that Moore hold the line on hiring except in critical positions. Such a recommendation adds another hurdle to Moore’s promise to rebuild state government.
On Monday, Moore’s office said it reached agreements with six other labor unions. The agreements include a 2% on average pay increase for more than 11,000 state employees, according to a statement issued by Moore’s office, which said the raises will cost roughly $37 million.
“These economic agreements represent an important step and are the result of months-long good-faith negotiations, reflecting a shared commitment between the State and its labor partners,” Moore said in a statement. “Our goal has always been to balance fair compensation with fiscal discipline. At a time when families and governments are both facing real financial pressures, the State of Maryland is continuing to prioritize the employees who work in service of Marylanders every day.”
The state negotiates annually with various unions on salary increase for the coming year. The deadline for such agreements in Dec. 31.
The statement said Moore “remains committed to reaching agreements with all employee organizations and looks forward to continuing discussions in the spirit of collaboration and transparency.”

The unions agreeing to contract terms were the American Federation of Teachers — Healthcare, the American Federation of Teachers — Maryland School for the Deaf, the Fraternal Order of Police for Maryland Transporation Authority officers, the International Association of Fire Fighters for firefighters at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, the Maryland Professional Employees Council and the State Law Enforcement Officers Labor Alliance.
AFSCME, however, was unsatisfied with Moore’s offer.
The union said in a statement it wanted raises that kept pace with the rate of inflation, provided additional pay increases on top of the cost-of-living offerings, and offered more job security for state employees.
In a statement, the union said it offered Moore “proposals that raise revenues, curtail wasteful spending and procurements, as well as combine duplicative programs that would generate millions in savings. Despite these efforts, the Governor has not embraced these suggestions.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_2115-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-05 22:11:44.188103
,New Jersey Monitor,2026-01-06 01:59:16+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,NJ panel advances bills aimed at shielding immigrants from federal agents,Sophie Nieto-Munoz,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2026/01/05/nj-bills-immigrants-federal-agents/,One of the bills would codify a 2018 state order that restricts when local law enforcement can help federal immigration agents.,"Bill sponsor Assemblywoman Ellen Park said the legislation is “about the future of New Jersey.” (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A group of Assembly lawmakers advanced a trio of bills Monday afternoon intended to protect New Jersey immigrants from federal immigration enforcement.
The broadest bill the Assembly Judiciary Committee approved would codify the 2018 Immigrant Trust Directive, an order from the Attorney General’s Office that restricts when state, county, and local law enforcement can aid federal immigration authorities. Immigrant advocates have urged lawmakers to codify the directive, noting that it could be withdrawn unilaterally by a future attorney general.
“This is about the future of New Jersey, not just America,” said Assemblywoman Ellen Park, a Bergen County Democrat whose voice broke as she cast her vote in support.
All three bills passed in a party-line vote, with the committee’s two Republicans voting no.
The bills were introduced last week, in the waning days of the current legislative session. The next session begins on Jan. 13.

In a statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson cited the story of an undocumented man accused of killing a mother and her 11-year-old daughter in a drunken driving crash in Lakewood last year. The Trump administration has used the story before to target New Jersey’s practice of restricting when local law enforcement can aid federal immigration agents.


“This tragedy is far from the only example of illegal aliens killing innocent bystanders. The New Jersey legislature should focus on protecting law-abiding citizens, not the criminal aliens who kill them,” Jackson said.

The hearing for the much-anticipated legislation was moved to a larger room in the Trenton Statehouse to accommodate the hundreds of people in attendance. Some people watched from two separate rooms, and legislative staff had to print more slips because of the number of people who wanted to testify.
Immigrant advocates and local activists who spoke during the three-hour hearing said New Jersey’s immigrant communities are plagued with fear because of President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation effort. The legislation would make New Jerseyans feel safer, they said, because it would allow them to report crimes to police without fearing they themselves would end up charged with immigration-related crimes.
“When your child’s classmate is struggling with their friend who has a missing parent, when people are too scared to report a crime or seek assistance, when a teacher finds empty seats in their classroom, or when grocery stores and restaurants find that foot traffic has gone down, when health care professionals see fewer people coming in for preventative care — all of those are impacts on all of us,” said Ami Kachalia of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.

The bill’s provisions would:

Prohibit law enforcement officers from engaging in “racially influenced policing,” including stopping someone based on their actual or suspected citizenship status and asking someone’s immigration status unless relevant to an investigation.
Bar state, county, and local police from assisting in federal civil immigration enforcement.
Require law enforcement agencies to create procedures to address certain visa certification requests from potential victims of crime or human trafficking, and post those procedures on their websites.
Mandate that prosecutors inform criminal defendants of immigration consequences.
Require law enforcement agencies to annually report their interactions with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to be published on the state Attorney General Office’s website.

Amy Torres, head of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, noted that the directive has been in place for nearly a decade. Under the directive, people have felt free to report their landlords for not turning on the heat, report their employers for wage theft, or come forward as the victims of crime without fearing they would get arrested by federal immigration agents.
Monmouth County Prosecutor Raymond Santiago said that since the shift in immigration enforcement over the past year, there has been less cooperation from victims and witnesses over fear of retaliation. Years of increased trust from some communities has “evaporated” because of ICE activity in neighborhoods, Santiago said.

Francesca Chabla, an immigration attorney with immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New Jersey, said she’s received countless calls from clients who are unsure whether they should enroll their children for free and reduced lunch programs out of fear that they could be targeted. Many residents don’t know who to trust, she said.
Chabla said the package of bills would provide clarity not only for residents, but for immigration attorneys who can “confidently tell the community members that they can safely access health care, schools, and food pantries” without fear of losing their due process rights.
States like California, Illinois, and Washington have passed similar legislation, Kachalia noted.
One of the other bills advanced Monday would require the attorney general to develop policies for so-called sensitive locations that would be barred from assisting or participating in federal civil law enforcement, and it would prohibit enforcement on their premises. The locations include health care facilities, public schools, and domestic violence shelters, among other places.
The third bill would bar government entities and health care facilities from requesting or collecting certain information from residents unless “strictly necessary” to assess eligibility for the requested public service. The information would include a person’s immigration status, place of birth, social security number, and individual taxpayer identification number.
For more than a year, Park and some of her Democratic colleagues have pushed for passage of a separate bill, called the Immigrant Trust Act, that includes provisions from the three bills advanced Monday. The older bill has languished, and Park said it was easier to get support by breaking the bill into three parts. She sponsored two of the three bills advanced Monday.
“I think if we were to put this all in one bill, it would’ve been too much to kind of comprehend and digest … so I think it was just better formatted for three pieces of legislation,” she said.
The Republicans on the committee — Assemblywoman Vicky Flynn (R-Monmouth) and Assemblyman Bob Auth (R-Bergen) — questioned whether the bills would withstand legal scrutiny. Auth read aloud a description of the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, which bars states from regulating the federal government’s actions.
Auth asked a housing attorney who said she represents tenants who are scared of reporting bad landlords what the “genesis of that fear is.”
“What is it? What’s causing the fear? If you’re here as a citizen, you go to court, you get equal justice, right? If you’re here as a resident alien and you go to court, you get equal justice, right? So what is the problem?” Auth asked her.

Karen Bennett of Stone Mountain resigned effective Jan. 1, and Monday was the last day for Rep. Lynn Heffner of Augusta. The House and Senate are set to gavel in Monday for a legislative session set to last through early spring.","Former Rep. Karen Bennett of Stone Mountain has been charged with allegedly taking advantage of a program meant for people who lost their jobs because of the pandemic. Official Georgia House of Representatives photoA Democratic state lawmaker resigned her seat days before she was charged with fraudulently receiving nearly $14,000 in unemployment benefits intended for people who lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Former Rep. Karen Bennett of Stone Mountain became the second Georgia House Democrat accused of illegally exploiting the program after Covington Rep. Sharon Henderson was arrested and charged on similar grounds last month.
Bennett holds a doctorate in physical therapy and the allegations center around her company called Metro Therapy Providers.
According to a charging document from the U.S. District Court in Atlanta, in May 2020, Bennett applied for federal pandemic relief funds listing two employers, the state General Assembly and Metro Therapy.
According to the document, Bennett stated in her application for pandemic unemployment relief that her job included providing in-home physical therapy services and that she was unable to perform her job because of pandemic guidelines. Prosecutors say those were lies.
“Before the pandemic her actual role with Metro Therapy was an administrative one and she worked from her home office; she did not provide in-home services for clients,” the charging document reads. “She was not prohibited from reaching her home office because of the pandemic. She was able to continue working as usual from her home to support Metro Therapy throughout the pandemic, and the therapists who provided actual services to clients were able to continue their work after a brief disruption.”
Bennett faces one count of making false statements in connection with the benefits.
Prosecutors also allege Bennett did not disclose that she had separate employment through a church, which paid her $905 each week she was claiming pandemic benefits.
According to court documents, Bennett pleaded not guilty and was released on $10,000 bond. She did not immediately respond to a call and email seeking comment Monday evening.
In a resignation letter to Gov. Brian Kemp, Bennett, who was first elected in 2012, did not give a reason for her departure.
“I am proud of the work accomplished by the Georgia General Assembly when we came together to advance policies that strengthened our state and improved the lives of all Georgians,” she wrote. “Serving in this capacity has truly been a labor of love and one that I will miss.”
Henderson’s future in the chamber is uncertain. She was charged with fraudulently collecting more than $17,000 in pandemic unemployment benefits but has not resigned.
Henderson maintains her innocence, and in a statement posted to social media, asked supporters for donations to help her fight what she called wrongful accusations.
Another Democratic state lawmaker, Rep. Lynn Heffner of Augusta, resigned effective Monday citing damage to her home from Hurricane Helene and the state law requiring representatives to live in the districts they represent.
“As recovery efforts have continued, the rebuilding process has reached an impasse, creating uncertainty that makes it difficult to confidently maintain constitutional residency while continuing legislative service,” Heffner wrote.
Prior to her election in 2022, Heffner served in the U.S. Army and worked as director of motor vehicle registration in Richmond County. She sat on committees including the House Committee on Defense and Veterans Affairs.
The House and Senate are set to gavel in Monday for a legislative session set to last through early spring.
With the two departures, the House now includes 98 Republicans and 79 Democrats. A vacancy left by the death of Canton Republican Rep. Mandi Ballinger is set to be filled with a special election runoff Tuesday between Republican Bill Fincher and Democrat Scott Sanders.
Kemp will declare special elections to fill the seats. As of Monday, Kemp’s office said no timeline has yet been set.

(Photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)The end of 2025 meant the end of federal tax credits that helped keep health insurance costs down for some 190,000 Marylanders, but it wasn’t the end of all help for those policy holders.
The state, anticipating the possible loss of federal assistance, set aside millions this year and next. And state officials gathered Monday to urge people to take advantage of the state’s Easy Enrollment program, which could help families get connected to more affordable health care by checking a box on their state tax forms.
“As the clock struck midnight on Dec. 31, thousands of Marylanders greeted the New Year not with cheers, but with increased anxiety,” Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) said at the Center for Urban Families in Baltimore Monday. “With increased worry and concern at the prospect of going without health insurance because they are now facing higher health insurance premiums.”
Lierman joined other state officials and health care advocates to raise awareness of Easy Enrollment, which has helped thousands of Marylanders get connected to affordable insurance over the five years since its launch. Under the program, Marylanders can check a box on their state tax return saying they are interested in learning about their health care options through the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The exchange then reaches out with information about available health insurance options and whether those households qualify for subsidies to bring those costs down further.
Advocates say Easy Enrollment is especially important due to the expiration of a popular COVID-19 era expansion of a federal tax credit under the Affordable Care Act, which will lead to a hike in health insurance costs. State fiscal analysts estimated that the expiration of the federal advanced premium tax credits would mean the loss of about $150 million to Maryland.
In anticipation of that, legislators created a state-based health insurance subsidies program, aimed at countering some of the federal cuts. The state program is not expected to generate more than $75 million this year, half the federal loss, so the state program was oriented towar lower-income families. Some will see the same savings they got from the federal program, while others may not be eligible for a state subsidy.
The expiration of the federal Enhanced Premium Tax Credit is expected to lead higher premiums for some 20 million Americans who directly benefited from the assistance through the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, the end of the tax credit has already led to increases in the private insurance market, with Maryland regulators approving an average 13.4% premium rate increase this year.
State OKs 13.4% average premium hike for state’s health care marketplace plans

That’s why lawmakers like Health and Government Operations Vice Chair Bonnie Cullison (D-Montgomery) urge Marylanders to use the Easy Enrollment option on their state tax forms to see if they qualify for more affordable health care coverage.
“The Easy Enrollment program was designed to use government processes to the absolute benefit of Marylanders,” Cullison said. “When given information from the Comptroller’s office … the exchange can quickly determine the eligibility for free or reduced health care options — or help folks compare plans that will best meet their needs.”
Vincent DeMarco with Maryland Health Care All coalition announced a $100,000 informational campaign to help uninsured Marylanders learn about the Easy Enrollment option, as those who qualify for Medicaid can still get enrolled in health care coverage.
“If you’re uninsured and you missed Open Enrollment, and you’re eligible for Medicaid – check the box at tax time and you could get enrolled,” DeMarco said. “It is especially important now.”
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said any effort to make access to insurance easier can help combat changes coming to health care through the Republican-controlled Congress and the Trump administration.
“Because they rolled those (expanded tax credits) back, allowed them to die at midnight on Dec. 31,” Van Hollen said, “as a result, 20 million Americans will no longer get the benefit of that tax credit. They’ll see their premiums go through the roof.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tax-forms-1.jpg,,,2026-01-05 21:56:54.189774
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-06 01:28:19+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s Grand Old Party tries to go viral with mockery of Lamont,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/05/ct-gop-ned-lamont-pizza-video/,The CT GOP opened a digital advertising campaign with a 1-minute video portraying Gov. Ned Lamont as indifferent to the high cost of living.,"Facing strong headwinds in the midterms, the Connecticut Republican Party opened a digital advertising campaign Monday with a 1-minute video portraying Gov. Ned Lamont, a wealthy Democrat seeking a third term in 2026, as indifferent to the high cost of living in Connecticut.
The piece offers a mocking twist on the Lamont administration’s light-hearted marketing campaign declaring “Connecticut home of the pizza capital of the United States,” a boast on social media and on some highway signs at the Connecticut border with New York.
“You know, Ned Lamont is, we think, channeling his inner Marie Antoinette and [saying] ‘Let Connecticut eat pizza!’” said Ben Proto, the chair of the Republican Party.
Proto said the campaign, at least initially, would be “mostly organic, our social media.” The state GOP has not been a reliably effective player on social media, unable or unwilling to engage in posts with the potential to go viral, fueled either by humor or outrage.
The piece was shown to reporters at 1 p.m., copies provided on thumb drives — not online. The video was not posted on the party’s Facebook or Instagram pages for nearly four hours. It did not appear on the party’s rarely updated X account.
It can be seen here. on the GOP’s Facebook page.

Proto said the party was ramping up with the start of 2026, when the governor, the other statewide constitutional officers, the General Assembly and the U.S. House delegation will be on the ballot. He said the party was quick to defend the Trump administration’s arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro against criticism from Connecticut’s Democratic senators and one of its congressmen.
“We’re doing far better on social media,” he said.
Proto was elected in June 2021 as state party chair, an increasingly ill-defined job in an era when political power and influence has migrated to Super PACs — even more so in Connecticut, where the GOP controls no levers of government and has been unable to win a congressional race for 20 years.
“What I’ve really learned over the last four and a half years is what my job is and what the job of this party is,” Proto said. “And the job of this party, ultimately, is not to define the issues. That’s up to the candidates. Our job is to help our candidates amplify their message. And we know the message on our side is that the Democrats have made this unaffordable.”
The press conference at the party’s headquarters in Middletown was a rarity.
“The election cycle has officially begun,” Proto said. “Some will say it started the day after the November elections, and that’s true, because that’s the day Ned Lamont found the word ‘affordability’ in his vocabulary. Prior to that, it didn’t exist. And we all know that the issue here in Connecticut is affordability, as it is across the country.”
Acting as a surrogate for the Lamont campaign, state Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, waited outside the GOP headquarters to insist that emphasizing the cost of living is not without risk for Republicans who mostly have remained silent over the trade war that President Donald Trump is waging against economic rivals and allies alike, his suspension of job-producing off-shore wind projects, and his support for the expiration of tax credits that will produce an increase in health costs under the Affordable Care Act.
“I just thought it was a stunning display, incredibly out of touch at a time when the country is reeling from tariffs from Donald Trump and Republicans in Washington, the same week that health insurance prices for tens of thousands of Connecticut residents just tripled because of Donald Trump and Republicans in Washington,” Lesser said.
Each of Trump’s presidential victories have been followed by Republican losses in Connecticut.
When Trump first took office in January 2017, Republicans were on the rise at the General Assembly. They still were a minority but strong enough to influence fiscal policies, including the adoption of stronger spending caps as part of a bipartisan budget deal in 2017.
The GOP held 18 of the 36 seats in the Senate and were only five short of the 76 seats necessary for a majority in the 151-member House. Democrats made huge gains in 2018, and they now outnumber Republicans by at least 2-1 margins in each chamber of the General Assembly.
As was the case after Trump’s first election, Democrats flipped control of municipal governments in 28 communities in November, the first general election since his return to the White House. Proto said his goal for 2026 was progress, not a legislative majority.
“I do not expect that we are going to have 19 senators and 76 members of the House come January of 2027,” Proto said. “It’s an incremental change. And how do we bring about incremental change? You bring about incremental change by changing a couple of districts.”

Mayor Justin Elicker named Assistant Chief David Zannelli to step in as acting chief. The mayor held a 6:30 press conference with the department’s three assistant chiefs to answer questions about the development. (Click here to watch a video of the press conference.)
Police officers discovered that money was missing from the confidential informant fund and told the department’s three assistant chiefs, Elicker said at a press conference held Monday evening at police headquarters at 1 Union Ave.
The assistant chiefs Monday morning confronted Jacobson, who “admitted to taking the funds for personal use,” Elicker said. The confrontation took place in the chief’s office. The assistant chiefs relayed the information to city Chief Administrative Officer Justin McCarthy, who then notified the mayor.
Elicker subsequently told Jacobson on Monday that he was going to be placed on administrative leave because of the allegation. Jacobson retired instead.
The mayor praised the officers for stepping forward: “When they saw something wrong, they did the right thing.”
“Rest assured that the process does work,” Zannelli said.

“We don’t have any information that anyone else was involved in this theft,” Elicker said.
Elicker declined to say how much money was stolen and over what time period, given the ongoing nature of an investigation into the matter.
The city informed the state’s attorney’s office, which along with state police will now determine whether and how to pursue a criminal probe.
Jacobson can retire and collect a pension, but that pension might be in jeopardy in the case of a criminal conviction, Elicker said in response to a question from the press. He noted that it’s “very early” in the matter.
Police union attorney Marshall Segar said he was disappointed by the news. “We’ll see where the investigation goes,” he said.
The mayor and chief had scheduled a 2 p.m. press conference to address Sunday’s double-fatal car crash in Westville. The press conference was cancelled moments before it was set to begin.
Jacobson became the city’s chief in July 2022 after serving in an interim capacity. He earned wide respect for his connections to people in the community on all sides of law enforcement, for his support of officers, and for his work with federal and state agencies partnering with New Haven police.
Days before he officially took over the job, his decision to provide fast, complete information about police misconduct that led to a transported suspect being hospitalized and paralyzed helped calm what could have been an explosive public crisis. That incident “opened my eyes that we needed change as a police department,” Jacobson subsequently reflected, as he pursued policy changes for handling of prisoners.
“We talk about it in dog years: Being chief [for a year] in New Haven is like seven years if you were chief somewhere else,” Jacobson reflected about the daily pace of intense developments in a 2024 radio interview.
“I remember a time six months into the job where I said, ‘Man, I don’t know if I can take this. It’s very stressful. It’s wearing on me.’ I just wanted to slow down. I wanted it to be quiet. Then I realized it’s never going to be quiet. It’s how I approach each issue.”
Jacobson has also worked to replenish the ranks of officers after years of departures.
Jacobson could not be reached for comment for this article.
Asked for comment at Monday’s full Board of Alders meeting at City Hall, Board of Alders President Tyisha Walker-Myers spoke highly of Jacobson’s tenure as police chief.
“He led the police department in a way that made me proud,” she said. “He worked along with the board when we talked about community policing, police officers who know the community. … I lived through the ’90s policing. It’s a totally different feel. We’ll be fine — no one person does it by themselves. We’ll continue doing the things that he started.”

Mark Baisley, right, seen speaking outside the Ralph L. Carr Colorado Judicial Center in Denver in December 2023, is running for a seat in the U.S. Senate. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state Sen. Mark Baisley is ditching his campaign for Colorado governor to run for U.S. Senate instead. 
Baisley, a Woodland Park Republican, announced on a conservative podcast this week that he will challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper in November. He leaves behind a crowded GOP primary field for Colorado governor, where he said the electorate “will have some good choices there for moving forward with a new governor.”
“My focus is now on the United States Senate, where I frankly feel more suited,” Baisley told Brandon Wark of Free State Colorado. “I’ve been in the Legislature for seven years, this is my eighth year now, and it would be transitioning to the legislature at a bigger stage in Washington D.C. rather than in Denver, Colorado.”

Baisley is the most experienced Republican to enter the 2026 race for the Senate. Janak Joshi, a Republican former member of the Colorado House of Representatives and past candidate for Colorado’s 8th Congressional District, is also running for U.S. Senate. Other Republican candidates include Montrose County Commissioner Sean Pond, George Markert and Dathan Jones. 
Colorado state Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat, is also challenging Hickenlooper. Baisley said he hopes the internal battle for Democrats in the June primary will benefit his campaign. Other Democratic candidates include attorney Karen Breslin, software engineer Brashad Hasley and accountant A.J. Zimpfer.
Hickenlooper, a former Colorado governor and mayor of Denver, beat former U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican, by 10 percentage points in the 2020 election. Hickenlooper’s campaign characterized Baisley as “too extreme for Colorado” and said he joins a group of Republican candidates campaigning to “prove who would be more loyal to Trump.”
Baisley did not respond to a request for comment from Newsline. 
Other Republican candidates running for governor include state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, state Rep. Scott Bottoms, Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell, Bob Brinkerhoff, Jason Clark, Jon Gray-Ginsberg, Kelvin “K-Man” Wimberly and Will McBride.
Greg Lopez, who briefly represented Colorado’s 4th Congressional District in Congress following former U.S. Rep. Ken Buck’s resignation, announced Monday he will continue his campaign for governor, but as an unaffiliated candidate. 
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser are running in the Democratic primary for governor. Colorado hasn’t had a Republican governor since Gov. Bill Owens left office after the 2006 election.

Rep. Hageman, who’s running to replace Lummis, has been mum on the military strikes and Maduro’s capture.  
The post Wyoming’s Barrasso, Lummis back Trump’s Venezuelan invasion, Hageman silent appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s two senior members of Congress are backing the Trump administration’s military strikes on Venezuela and the capture of the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro. 
Republican Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis posted statements over the weekend on social media that called Maduro a “narco-terrorist” and thanked the U.S. military, which carried out the Saturday raid on Caracas. 
“Maudro is a dictator, a narco-terrorist, and an indicted criminal in the United States,” Barrasso posted on X. “Venezuela, America, and the world are safer with this dangerous dictator removed from power.”
Likewise, Lummis posted on X that she was “grateful to President Trump for his decisive leadership and to our military and law enforcement personnel who executed this operation with extraordinary courage and skill.” 
“Peace through strength works,” Lummis wrote. “Maduro will finally answer for his crimes in American courts.” 
Maduro had led Venezuela since 2013. But many countries, including the United States, refused to recognize him as a legitimate head of state. In 2024, the Biden administration accused Maduro of stealing the presidential election, citing “overwhelming evidence” that his opponent, Edmundo González Urrutia, won. 
A 2020 U.S. indictment accused Maduro of overseeing “Cartel de los Soles,” which the Trump administration has described as a violent drug organization. However, a range of specialists in Latin American criminal and narcotics issues, including former Drug Enforcement Administration officials, maintain that “Cartel de los Soles” is instead a figure of speech, dating back to the 1990s, for Venezuelan military officials corrupted by drug money. Since the 2020 indictment, both the Trump and Biden administrations offered millions in reward for information leading to his arrest. 
At least 80 people were killed, including military personnel and civilians, during the Caracas raid, the New York Times reported. No Americans were killed. Following Maduro’s removal, Trump announced the United States would “run” the country for an indefinite period.
But Venezuelan leaders gathered Monday for a swearing-in ceremony to project independence in running their country, the Associated Press reported. 
Republican Rep. Harriet Hageman, who recently announced plans to run for Senate now that Lummis is retiring, has so far not made a public statement on the invasion, via the press, press release or social media. Neither her campaign or congressional press contact responded to WyoFile’s request for comment by publishing time. 
Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who is running to replace Hageman in the  U.S. House, released a statement backing the invasion. 
While most conservative, congressional lawmakers have voiced support for Trump’s actions, some have raised concerns that such a strike supersedes Congress’ authority to declare war. 
“If the President believes military action against Venezuela is needed, he should make the case and Congress should vote before American lives and treasure are spent on regime change in South America,” Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, said on the House floor last month as the chamber considered a pair of resolutions to force Trump to secure approval from Congress before attacking Venezuela. 
Both resolutions failed. Massie reposted a video of his floor comments Saturday following the raid. 
“Let’s be honest about likely outcomes. Do we truly believe that Nicolás Maduro will be replaced by a modern-day George Washington? How did that work out in Cuba, Libya, Iraq or Syria?” Massie said in his comments last month. 
The Kentucky Republican also expressed skepticism about the Trump administration’s stated motivation behind the strikes. 
“If it were about drugs, we’d bomb Mexico, or China, or Colombia,” Massie said. “And the President would not have pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández. This is about oil and regime change.”
Last month, Trump pardoned Hernández, the former Hondruan president, who had been convicted in the U.S. for helping smuggle more than 400 tons of cocaine into the country. 
“They basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country,” Trump told reporters. “And they said it was a Biden administration set-up. And I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.”

(Courtesy of Stephen Ausmus/Animal Research Services, USDA)LINCOLN — With a recent case of bird flu confirmed in a commercial flock in Nebraska’s Butler County, state officials are reminding poultry owners to monitor for and protect their birds.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Inspection Service confirmed the late December case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in a chicken flock of about 144,600 commercial laying hens in Butler County.
Since November, other bird flu cases have been confirmed in small backyard flocks in Keith, Howard, Washington and Scotts Bluff Counties, state ag officials said in a statement Monday.
“While these cases are not unexpected and coincide with the ongoing wild bird migration and what we are seeing in other states, it does serve as an important reminder for Nebraska poultry producers to stay vigilant in protecting their flocks,” said state veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley. “Producers should know and monitor for HPAI symptoms and follow strict biosecurity practices, which can significantly reduce the risk of the disease affecting their flocks.”
HPAI is a highly contagious virus that spreads easily among birds through secretions, infected food, water and manure. It can spread in various ways including by equipment and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.
Symptoms include lack of energy and appetite, decreased egg production and diarrhea. HPAI can survive for weeks in contaminated environments. It can cause sudden death in birds even if they show no other symptoms.
Resources are available for poultry producers at nda.nebraska.gov/animal/avian/ and from the USDA at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza. Poultry showing signs of HPAI or unusual death should be reported to the NDA at 402-471-2351 or the USDA at 866-536-7593.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The commissioner of Alaska’s Department of Family and Community Services has departed that position to take a job with the Trump administration.
Kim Kovol has accepted a job with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced last week. Her last day working for the state was on Friday, and Tracy Dompeling, the department’s deputy commissioner, assumed the role of acting commissioner, the statement said.
The department’s primary divisions are the Division of Juvenile Justice, the Alaska Psychiatric Institute, the Alaska Pioneer Homes and the Office of Children’s Services.
Kovol was the first commissioner of the Department of Family and Community Services, which was created in 2022. Up to then, its functions were part of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. Through an executive order, Dunleavy split that department into two: the Department of Health and the Department of Family and Community Services.
In his statement, Dunleavy said Kovol was a “strong and dedicated leader” for the redesigned department. “As the first Commissioner of DFCS, she built a foundation focused on service, accountability, and support for Alaska’s most vulnerable populations. I thank her for her service and wish her every success in this next role,” he said.
Kovol said she was honored to have served in that role. “I am incredibly grateful to the staff, partners, and communities who have supported our work. Together, we have made meaningful progress for Alaska families, youth, and elders, and I will always be proud of what we have accomplished,” she said in the statement.

Kovol’s last day working for the state was Jan. 2. She has taken a job with the U.S. Department of Health and Social Services.

	Kovol is the second Alaska department head to leave state service to join the Trump administration. Almost a year ago, Emma Pokon left her position as commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation to become the Pacific Northwest regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Dunleavy in May chose Randy Bates to be the department’s new commissioner. Bates was formerly director of DEC’s Division of Water.
With Kovol’s departure, there are now five state departments with leaders who currently lack legislative approval.
In addition to Bates, Dunleavy has named commissioner-designees for the Department of Law and the Department of Natural Resources. Dunleavy in August named Stephen Cox, a former U.S. attorney in Texas, as Alaska’s attorney general, replacing Treg Taylor, a Republican who is running for governor.
Dunleavy also named John Crowther, a DNR veteran, as his choice to be permanent commissioner. Crowther became acting commissioner after John Boyle resigned from the position in October.
Bates, Cox and Crowther are subject to legislative confirmation after lawmakers convene later this month for their 2026 session.
The state Department of Revenue is currently being led by an acting commissioner, Janelle Earls, who assumed the job in August after Adam Crum left the commissioner post. Crum is another Republican candidate for governor.
Dunleavy has not yet named his choices for the commissioner posts at the Department of Revenue or the Department of Family and Community Services, said Jeff Turner, the governor’s spokesperson. Earls and Dompeling are currently acting commissioners and it is not clear whether the governor will name commissioner-designees for those positions, he said.
Dunleavy is in the last year of his second term. He is term limited and may not run for reelection.

White, a Republican and one of the most powerful government officials in the state, held the closed-door press conference inside his office at the Capitol. White conducted a question-and-answer session with numerous members of the media about the 2026 legislative session that begins Tuesday, according to a press release obtained by Mississippi Today. 
The decision by the speaker’s office followed a Mississippi Today exclusive report in April that White, his staff and some of their spouses were treated to a trip to the 2025 Super Bowl by a sports-gambling company. After that story was published, Mississippi Today was removed from the speaker’s press distribution list, and his office stopped responding to requests for comment 
But Monday marked the first time that Mississippi Today, a credentialed member of the Capitol Press Corps and the largest newsroom outlet in the state, was denied access to a press event in the speaker’s office attended by numerous media organizations. 
Minutes before the press conference started, Tammy Cowart, White’s assistant, emerged from his office with a clipboard and asked reporters if they had been invited. When Cowart asked a Mississippi Today reporter which news outlet he worked for, she said she would need to check with other staffers before letting him inside.  
“They sent out an exclusive invitation out to attend this. If you’re not on my list, I’ll just have to check, because you’re not on there,” Cowart said. 
She then said the event was not a press conference, but a “specific Q&A.”
The event was not an exclusive interview. Numerous media organizations attended, including print, broadcast and radio outlets.  
Cowart then returned to the speaker’s office and came out again minutes later to inform Mississippi Today’s reporter that he would not be allowed into the press conference. 
“I checked, and it’s not an open press conference. It’s invitation only. You’re not on my list, you didn’t get the invitation, so you won’t be allowed in,” Cowart said. 
Cowart said other news outlets were also not invited to the press event, but declined to say which ones. 
A press release announcing the event and reviewed by Mississippi Today, said “only media directly receiving the media advisory” would be invited to attend. 
“Mississippi Today is the largest newsroom in the state, and our journalists are careful to cover the news accurately and with context,” Mississippi Today Editor-in-Chief Emily Wagster Pettus, who covered the Mississippi Legislature for 31 years for The Clarion-Ledger and The Associated Press, said in a statement Monday. 
“We and other news organizations are the eyes and ears of the public at the state Capitol,” she said. “It is petty and wrong for Speaker Jason White — or any other elected official — to cut off media access.”
Layne Bruce, executive director of the Mississippi Press Association, said in a statement Monday that White’s office should “treat all press outlets fairly.”
“We would urge the speaker’s office to open its doors and allow representatives from all press outlets to be included,” Bruce said. “We believe that in the spirit of transparency, and since this is taking place in a public building that is funded by the taxpayers, it is only proper.” 
Bruce also pointed out that Mississippi Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, also a Republican, took questions about his legislative agenda from media outlets, including Mississippi Today, at a luncheon just hours before the event in White’s office. 
The denial of press access in Mississippi comes amid broader tensions between the federal government and the press. Under the Trump administration, the White House has restricted Associated Press journalists from certain presidential press events after the outlet refused to adopt administration-preferred language, a move the AP has described as retaliatory and a violation of press freedoms. Separately, the Pentagon has altered press access rules, prompting concern from major news organizations that new restrictions limit independent coverage.
In a statement to the Clarion Ledger, White said: “The Media Q+A hosted in my office today was an invitation-only media opportunity, not an open, public press conference.” 
Charlie Mitchell, an attorney and former newspaper editor who has taught media law at the University of Mississippi, said White’s decision raised questions about whether the speaker has complied with the First Amendment.
“The speaker may have been thinking about his complete discretion when it comes to interviews and responding to inquiries, Mitchell said. “If, for instance, he wanted to return a phone call to one journalist and not another, that’s perfectly OK. Press events are very different.”
The scenario could parallel a federal court decision in favor of the AP, which “made clear the First Amendment does not allow officials to exclude credentialed journalists from otherwise open press events.”
Mississippi Today received an audio recording of the speaker’s press conference from multiple organizations that attended the event. The news outlet reported on the speaker’s comments along with those made hours earlier by Hosemann on the 2026 legislative session. 
Taylor Spillman, White’s spokesperson, did not respond to multiple questions sent via text message and email about the decision by the speaker’s office to bar Mississippi Today from its press conference and remove it from its media distribution list. 
Spillman and Cowart were both photographed on the trip to the 2025 Super Bowl with White. DraftKings, a sports gambling giant pushing for the legalization of mobile sports betting in Mississippi, confirmed with Mississippi Today that the gambling industry paid for the game-day tickets.  
Mississippi Speaker of the House Jason White, some staff and spouses attended the Super Bowl.
Spillman and her husband, Trey Spillman, documented Super Bowl festivities on social media.
A day after the Super Bowl, Trey Spillman took to social media to thank DraftKings for the experience. 
“Unforgettable experience at Super Bowl LIX. Thank you @draftkings for the hospitality! #sports”
But after Mississippi Today asked the Spillmans about the trip, the social media post was changed to remove any mention of DraftKings and the company’s “hospitality.” 
“Unforgettable experience at Super Bowl LIX. #sports,” the edited post reads. 
The sports gambling lobby, as it has done in other states, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Mississippi politicians trying to convince them to legalize mobile sports betting. 
The issue is likely to become another priority for the House this legislative session.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/07125657/Jason-White-2.jpg,,,2026-01-05 19:11:43.704027

(U.S. Coast Guard photo, Courtesy Clean Gulf Associates)The Trump administration has assessed what it’s calling the largest civil fine ever for an offshore oil spill in 2023 off the Louisiana coast.
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration sent notice Dec. 31 to Panther Operating Co. of Houston that it has proposed a $9.62 million fine for the failure of its Main Pass Oil Gathering pipeline system. An estimated 1.1 million gallons of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico when a connector on the pipeline malfunctioned, allowing oil to flow for more than nine hours, according to the agency. The leak was visible nearly 20 miles off the Mississippi River Delta. 
Panther Operating Co., a subsidiary of Third Coast infrastructure, has 30 days to respond to the notice to explain how it will address the leak, contest the allegations or request a formal administrative hearing. Company representatives did not respond immediately to a request for comment Monday. 
According to the notice, a Panther controller was aware of the leak at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 15 based on pressure gauge observations and noted a zero flow rate for the pipeline five hours later. However, the controller did not order the pipeline shut down before his shift ended the next morning at 6:00. His replacement called for it to be closed around 6:30 a.m., which was 13 hours after the pressure issues were first noted, the agency said.
No new or continuous oil flow was reported after Nov. 21, 2023.  
The U.S. Coast Guard, the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator’s Office and the state Department of Wildlife and Fisheries conducted response and cleanup activities after the spill until April 2024.
The notice from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said Panther Operating Co. failed to account for underwater landslides and tropical storm impacts on the Gulf seabed in its maintenance of the pipeline. 
“PHMSA’s focus on safety and holding operators accountable when they fail to comply with federal safety regulations will never change,” PHMSA Administrator Paul Roberti said in a news release. “It is important for pipeline operators to remain vigilant in their operations to prevent these types of failures or there will be serious consequences.”

His keen understanding of sports, deep journalistic connections to coaches and athletes and conversational storytelling style have won Cleveland legions of admirers during his 60-year career. This is the 15th time he has been named sportswriter of the year – more than anyone in the state.
In announcing its awards Monday, the association also named Ross Dellenger, senior college football reporter for Yahoo Sports, as the 2025 National Sportswriter of the Year.
This is the first such honor for Dellenger, who grew up in Biloxi. He is a graduate of Mississippi State University and a former sportswriter for the Clarion Ledger. Dellenger started working for Sports Illustrated in 2018 and moved to Yahoo Sports in 2023.
Cleveland is a Hattiesburg native and University of Southern Mississippi graduate. He has worked for the Hattiesburg American; the Monroe News Star World in Louisiana; the Jackson Daily News and The Clarion-Ledger as a reporter, editor and columnist.
He has been Mississippi Today’s sports columnist since 2016. He and his son, sportswriter Tyler Cleveland, host the Mississippi Today podcast “Crooked Letter Sports.”

Rick Cleveland is in Arizona this week to continue covering the most successful football season in Ole Miss history. The Rebels play Miami on Thursday in a college football playoff semifinal in the Fiesta Bowl, with the winner advancing to next week’s national championship game.
During the past few weeks, Cleveland has thoroughly covered the Ole Miss coaching turmoil, as Lane Kiffin departed for rival LSU, defensive coordinator Pete Golding was named the Rebels’ new head coach and Ole Miss defeated higher-ranked Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day.
His columns over the past year include a sharply-worded piece about the obscene amounts of money that college coaches continue collecting after they’re fired; an insightful description of how former NFL player Tommy Kelly became the head football coach at Jackson’s Lanier High School and led the Bulldogs to their best season in years; and thorough coverage of Mississippi’s only PGA tournament, the Sanderson Farms Championship.
Cleveland is a member of both the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and the Mississippi Press Association Hall of Fame, and he is from a family of sportswriters. His late brother, Bobby Cleveland, was a longtime outdoors writer for The Clarion-Ledger.

That’s according to a new report released Monday by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute that was commissioned by the Clark and Christine Ivory Foundation. 
According to the report,only 50.3% of Utah third graders in 2025 had grade-level proficiency in readying. Earlier grades saw similar rates. 
Reading proficiency also varies widely, the report says, from below 30% to above 70%. “Large gaps” exist for English-language learners, students with disabilities, Hispanic and Latino students, and economically disadvantaged students show significantly lower proficiency rates, the report says.

Last month, Gov. Spencer Cox and first lady Abby Cox highlighted a need for improved reading and literacy for young learners. Cox made it a centerpiece issue in his budget recommendation, which he announced at the Salt Lake County Library in Kearns. 
As part of his budget proposal to the 2026 Utah Legislature, Cox recommended using $80 million for paraeducator grant programs. That includes $60 million for “targeted behavioral interventions in K-3 classrooms” and $20 million for reading support in elementary schools that have not met the statewide proficiency benchmark of 70% of third graders reading at grade level.
During his budget announcement, Cox also urged lawmakers to follow the example of Mississippi, a state that once sat at the bottom of national elementary literacy rankings and now ranks near the top. A policy known as the “Mississippi Miracle” requires third graders to score high enough on a reading test before advancing to fourth grade.

Cox, during his budget recommendation, called on Utah lawmakers to pass a similar law. 
“We’ve implemented some of the things that have happened in Mississippi, (but) we need to implement the rest of those things and get everybody pulled together,” the governor said. 
The Gardner Institute report included a section on the “impacts of third-grade retention” policies, pointing to states including Mississippi, Indiana and Florida. 
“A large body of research has examined these test-based retention policies and show that most retained students experience reading gains, though long-term outcomes are mixed,” the report says. “That said, more recent evaluations occurred in states that provide extensive supports alongside retention, making disentanglement of reading retention and intensive interventions difficult.” 
However, “the strongest evidence suggests that the supports students receive when flagged for retention — not retention alone — primarily drive the improvement,” the report said. 
By passing SB127 in 2022, Utah lawmakers have set a statewide goal of 70% third-grade reading proficiency by 2027. The bill requires the State Board of Education to administer programs to improve early literacy in K-3 kids, which came with an estimated price tage of more than $9.1 million in ongoing funding and $9.4 million in one-time money to hire staff and provide training, according to its fiscal note.

“State and district implementation of SB127 continues in phases, reflecting the time required for the state board of education, schools, districts, and preparation programs to adopt new materials, strengthen training, and build capacity,” the Gardner Institute report says. “Research shows that the impact of early literacy reforms depends not only on policy design but also on consistent, high-quality implementation, underscoring the importance of continued attention to fidelity, monitoring, and support.”
Cox, however, also said “70% is too low of a goal.”
“It should be 100%. We know we can get there,” he said. “We’re seeing it in places like Mississippi.” 
The report’s author, Andrea Thomas Brandley, senior education analyst at the Gardner Institute, wrote in the report that research shows strong early literacy skills help “build the foundation needed for lifelong learning.” 
“Early childhood literacy is not just an academic benchmark; it is the cornerstone of a child’s future success,” Thomas Brandley said in a prepared statement. “The ability to read proficiently by third grade profoundly impacts a student’s entire educational journey, their economic opportunities, and their capacity to engage fully in civic life.”
The governor, first lady Abby Cox and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson are scheduled to hold a Literacy and Reading Symposium on Tuesday in Ogden, aimed at discussing “practical ways to strengthen literacy and get more kids and adults reading,” according to the governor’s office. 
Last month, Abby Cox said social media has created a “big hole” in kids’ and adults’ lives that needs to be filled with books. 
“It’s not unconnected to social media,” Abby Cox said. “The issues that we’re having with literacy is a direct result of us not reading and children not having access to books and not being read to.”

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho state Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, announced Monday he has been appointed co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s powerful budget committee ahead of the upcoming 2026 legislative session.

The appointment is important because Tanner must immediately begin addressing state revenue shortfalls and projected budget deficits as soon as the new legislative session begins next week. 
As the new co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, Tanner succeeds outgoing state Rep. Wendy Horman. In December, Horman announced she would resign from the Idaho Legislature to take a job with the federal government in Washington, D.C.
JFAC is a powerful legislative committee that sets every budget for every state agency and department. 
In his press release, Tanner said he would help lead the Idaho Legislature’s budget process by focusing on fiscal constraint, limiting government growth and applying accountability to agency spending. 
“Serving as Co-Chair of JFAC is a serious responsibility to Idaho taxpayers,” Tanner said. “Every dollar appropriated represents money trusted to us by working Idahoans. That trust demands discipline, accountability, and a firm commitment to spend only what is necessary — and nothing more.”
 As state faces projected budget shortfall, Tanner says Idaho must balance its budget

The 2026 legislative session starts in a week on Jan. 12. Traditionally, the two co-chairs of JFAC are among the most powerful and influential legislators in Boise.

Tanner will work alongside Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, who will return as the other co-chair of JFAC during the 2026 legislative session. 
This year’s budget process will face even more scrutiny than normal because of state revenue shortfalls that are occurring following five years of tax cuts approved by the Idaho Legislature. After several years of consecutive multimillion dollar state budget surpluses, Idaho’s state budget is projected to end the current fiscal year 2026 and next year with budget deficits, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The latest state budget report projects Idaho’s state budget will end the current fiscal year 2026 on June 30 with a deficit of $40.3 million. But this year is only the start. The budget deficit could increase by more than 10 times that amount next year. 
In his announcement, Tanner emphasized that Idaho must find a way to balance its state budget.
“Idaho families balance their budgets every day, and state government must do the same,” Tanner said. “When revenues fall short, lower-priority programs must be reduced and agencies held fully accountable. Government should work to keep money in the pockets of Idahoans, not locked inside bloated bureaucracy.”
The Idaho Legislative Services Office reported in the fall that the projected state budget deficit for fiscal year 2027 could be $555.2 million. In late November, the state’s top budget official, Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff, told the Sun that the state may need to come up with an additional $600 million to $1 billion for the fiscal year 2027 budget to pass a balanced budget, conform with federal tax changes championed by President Donald Trump and still leave an ending cash balance to guard against additional budget uncertainty. 
Notably, the Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget and prohibits the state from running a budget deficit where expenses exceed available revenue. 
State legislators and officials from Gov. Brad Little’s office have said that state officials will intervene during the 2026 legislative session to prevent the state from running a budget deficit. Although plans have not been made public, the most likely tools for avoiding a budget deficit include implementing new, deeper budget cuts and/or tapping into state savings and reserve accounts. 
 Moyle offered prominent JFAC role to Tanner, a second term legislator

Although Tanner’s appointment was widely expected in political circles, the choice to promote Tanner to budget co-chair may have been a slightly unconventional pick in a legislative environment that historically values experience and seniority.
In his second term in the Idaho Legislature, Tanner was not the most experienced Idaho House member serving on JFAC. JFAC Vice Chairman Steve Miller (who has five total, nonconsecutive terms of office in the Idaho House), Rep. Dusting Manwaring, (who has four total, nonconsecutive terms in the Idaho House) and Rep. Rod Furniss, (who is serving his fourth term) all have more legislative experience and JFAC experience than Tanner. 
By contrast, Horman had completed five terms in the Idaho Legislature and was the most experienced Republican on JFAC when she was named JFAC co-chair heading into the 2023 session. 
However, Tanner is an ally of House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, and has served as House assistant majority leader on the Republican leadership team with Moyle.
Moyle, as speaker of the Idaho House and the highest ranking member of the Idaho House’s leadership team, took the lead on appointing committee chairs and filling vacancies atop of committees. 
Efforts to reach Moyle and Tanner were not immediately successful on Monday, but Moyle told the Sun last month that loyalty would be a factor in his decision. 
“I like to pick chairmen that are loyal, that work hard and that have what’s best for Idaho at heart,” Moyle said in a Dec. 19 interview. “To replace Wendy (Horman) is going to be tough. The fact is, between you and me, nobody can replace Wendy.”
In his press release, Tanner did not directly address whether or not he will continue to serve as assistant majority leader in the Idaho House now that he has new responsibilities with JFAC. Tanner told Idaho Reports in December that he would give up his assistant leader position if he became JFAC co-chair. Over the past 15 years, members of Idaho legislative leadership teams have not also served at the same time as co-chairs of JFAC.

Vermont’s legislative session this year will be one for the ages. Can lawmakers pull off the generational transformation of the public education system they started last year, or will they take an easier way out? What state programs will be on the chopping block during an agonizing budget cycle? How will electeds try to counteract the neverending stream of policy changes coming out of Washington, D.C.? Is affordability just a talking point, or could Vermonters see real relief?
On top of this session’s heavy issues, it’s also an election year. Do lawmakers dare pass potentially unpopular policies months before their names are on the ballot?

In the know
So what’s on tap this week? Legislators convene for the new session on Tuesday, Jan. 6, for the start of the second year of the biennium. In theory, that means lawmakers should hit the ground running. In practice, that’s to be determined.
Last Friday, just days before the session’s kickoff, Gov. Phil Scott appointed two new legislators to fill vacancies. John Benson will take over the Senate seat of Orange County Republican Larry Hart. In the House, Val Taylor will fill the seat being vacated by GOP Rep. Jim Harrison, which covers Killington, Chittenden, Mendon and Pittsfield. Both new lawmakers are Republicans, too.

Off to the races
Molly Gray, the former Democratic lieutenant governor who also ran, unsuccessfully, for a seat in Congress, wants her old job back.
Gray announced her campaign for the state’s second-highest office Monday morning at a coffee shop in the South End of Burlington. She also released a slate of endorsements from nine current senators and 22 current House members, among them Senate President Pro Tem Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central.
Also on Monday, after Gray’s announcement, a second candidate signalled he may enter the race. Ryan McLaren, a former aide to U.S. Sen Peter Welch, D-Vt., told VTDigger he was “seriously considering” running for lieutenant governor.
Republican John Rodgers, the current LG, has previously said he would run for reelection in 2026.
Meanwhile, Deputy State Auditor Tim Ashe is seeking his office’s top job. 
Ashe, a Democrat/Progressive who previously served as Senate President Pro Tem, announced late last week that he is running this year to succeed his boss, State Auditor Doug Hoffer. Hoffer — who is also a D/P — is stepping down after a dozen years as the top state government watchdog. 
In a press release, Ashe said he would “work with the executive and legislative branches to identify risks to Vermonters’ interests, such as financial mismanagement, inadequate preparation for weather-related emergencies, and the policies of President Trump.”

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Fifty immigrant detainees at a New Mexico jail say they’ve been largely unable to receive or send mail, including time-sensitive legal documents, for more than a month, according to letters provided to Source New Mexico.
Detainees at Torrance County Detention Facility from Mexico, Venezuela, Cameroon, Cuba, Portugal, Belarus, India, the United Kingdom and other countries signed two open letters dated mid-December that Source New Mexico received via email Friday.
“The postal service (USPS) is not working, or is working very poorly and intermittently,”  the letters say in Spanish. “This is very damaging and detrimental to us (ICE detainees) because we cannot, for example, receive essential evidence for our defense within the proper timeframes, nor can we send important and vital documents such as appeals, habeas corpus petitions, and others. For example, this past week the mailperson came only once to deliver mail and never to pick it up.”
A CoreCivic spokesman denied the allegations regarding the mail interruption.
The uproar over mail at the facility in Estancia occurs as the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency begins paying private prison operator CoreCivic about $300,000 more per month to provide services under a modified contract county officials approved without debate last week.
Until the contract abruptly expired Oct. 31, 2025, ICE paid CoreCivic about $2.1 million a month to house detainees. It did so via an agreement with Torrance County, which receives the payments from ICE and then passes them along to CoreCivic.  
The contract’s abrupt expiration ended those payments and prompted renewed calls from advocates and U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, for ICE leaders to explain what authority the agency had to continue housing detainees at the jail without a contract in place. He never received a response, according to his office. 
Torrance County immigration detention center continues operating without ICE contract

ICE and CoreCivic refused to say what prompted the expiration or why it took so long to negotiate an extension. Then on Dec. 30, the Torrance County Commission met to approve a new contract that pays CoreCivic $2.4 million a month, backdated to Nov. 1 through April of this year. 
The modified contract also appears to allow the company to reduce its staffing requirements to 85% of what is typical, though ICE, CoreCivic and county officials did not respond to Source’s questions about the provision. 
Detainees and advocates at Innovation Law Lab, a Portland-based immigrant advocacy group that conducts weekly jail visits, told Source NM the mailroom issue has been ongoing for more than a month. They say it resulted after an employee who used to run the mailroom left without being replaced. 
Ian Philabaum, a program director for Innovation Law Lab, told Source that CoreCivic should not be receiving more funding when it has not been adequately providing services. 
“It is absolutely egregious that CoreCivic would be rewarded with a more-lucrative contract, while they’re simultaneously failing to meet their contractual obligations, including the most basic tenets of due process,” he said. 
Brian Todd, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, told Source on Monday, in response to a list of questions submitted last week about the inmates’ complaints about the mail service, that their allegations are “false.” For other questions about the extended contract, he referred Source to an ICE spokesperson, who did not respond to a request for comment. 
Private prison operators like CoreCivic that subcontract with ICE to house detainees are contractually obligated to provide adequate mail services, according to ICE’s Performance-Based National Detention Standards. The standards say detainees “shall be able to correspond with their families, the community, legal representatives, government offices and consular officials consistent with the safe and orderly operation of the facility,” and that incoming and outgoing letters shall be held for no more than 24 hours.
Newly released data shows sharp decline of inmates at New Mexico ICE facility 

Alexie Taylor, the brother of Jamaican detainee Andre Taylor, told Source New Mexico on Monday that mail delays put his brother in jeopardy of being deported. Public records show a judge issued a final deportation order on Nov. 17, giving Andre Taylor 30 days to file an appeal. 
According to his brother, Andre Taylor prepared all the necessary materials by Dec. 9, more than a week before the Dec. 17 deadline, and paid express postage to deliver his appeal to the federal Board of Immigration Appeals in Virginia. Alexie Taylor said that according to his brother, the jail staff did not send the document until Dec. 18.
Two weeks later, ICE transferred Andre Taylor from Estancia to a detention facility in El Paso, which is often the last stop before deportation. He’s being held there now and exploring what options remain, if any, to plead his case to the appeal board about missing a deadline through no fault of his own, Alexie Taylor said. 
Todd at CoreCivic did not immediately respond to Source’s question about Andre Taylor’s case. But the alleged mail delay is just the latest violation his brother has faced in more than eight months of detention, Alexie told Source, “so honestly I’m not surprised,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3109-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 18:58:22.563937

Sept. 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceCourt of Claims Judge Sima G. Patel on Monday denied the state of Michigan’s request to rehear a motion to toss a lawsuit filed by cannabis industry advocates against the 24% wholesale tax on marijuana which took effect on Jan. 1.
In October the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association filed a lawsuit against the state, arguing that the Legislature’s decision to create a 24% tax on wholesale marijuana violates the state constitution by modifying the 2018 law established when Michigan voters approved a ballot proposal legalizing recreational marijuana in Michigan. 
Industry advocates have also warned that the tax would bring irreparable harm to Michigan’s marijuana industry, forcing small retailers out of business and pushing buyers into the black market. 
In her early December ruling, Patel largely rebuffed arguments from industry advocates, denying the association’s request to block the wholesale tax from taking effect alongside its request to have the case resolved without a full trial. 
However she did permit the case to move to trial, raising questions on whether the Legislature’s decision to create the tax violates the intent of the initiated law, partially denying a similar request from the state to resolve the matter without moving to trial. 
While the state filed a motion to have their request reconsidered, Patel denied it on Monday, determining that there had been no palpable error in her previous ruling and reemphasizing that questions of fact remained around the new tax violates the purpose of the 2018 law.
“It is not certain on this record whether the 24% wholesale excise tax will impact prices to the extent purchasers will be driven to the illicit marijuana market,” Patel wrote. “Discovery is required to examine how the tax will impact the purposes of the [voter initiated law.]”
Rose Tantraphol, the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association’s spokesperson, called Monday’s decision a win for voters and the industry. 
“In issuing this order, the court recognizes the serious questions about whether this discriminatory tax violates the intent of the cannabis legalization that Michigan voters approved in 2018,” Tantraphol said. “We’re looking forward to making our case that this tax will push Michiganders, who are already feeling stretched financially, into the illicit market.”
In a separate filing, the association has asked the Michigan Court of Appeals to hear the case, arguing it would allow them to pursue the full range of arguments they made in their initial lawsuit.

Though Wyoming politicos regard Trump's actions as necessary, oil executives do not anticipate immediate windfall.
The post Venezuela takeover has Wyoming oil industry bracing for market changes appeared first on WyoFile .","Soon after Saturday’s military raid in Caracas and the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump said the U.S. will “run” Venezuela for the time being, and that U.S. oil companies will “spend billions of dollars” to fix the country’s oil infrastructure and presumably increase oil sales.
Many politicos assert that wresting access to Venezuela’s oil — the world’s largest reserves — from adversarial nations such as China and Russia is ultimately an advantage for the U.S. Trump’s actions drew praise from Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming. 
Yet, the situation doesn’t immediately appear to be a windfall for Wyoming or its producers.
“I don’t know that many of the smaller or even intermediate-type companies are going to want to go down to Venezuela,” said Peter Wold, a partner in Casper-based Wold Oil Properties. “That would be a big jump.
“We would not be interested in doing that,” Wold added. “We have attempted international drilling and production, and it’s difficult. It takes a lot bigger company and deeper pockets than anything that we’ve got.”

More practically, Wold indicated, oil producers big and small rely on strong market prices and production fields where there’s political stability to ensure a return on investment. He agreed with recent assessments that it will take years to stabilize and significantly increase Venezuelan oil production. And if that happens, it may be to the detriment of Wyoming producers that provide a significant source of tax revenue in the state.
“I think any kind of increase in production [in Venezuela] is going to see a reduction in the price of crude oil, and that would impact Wyoming’s oil and gas producers,” Wold said.
A glut in global oil supply sapped U.S. market prices for much of 2025, according to federal sources, including a 15% drop in spot prices for Wyoming producers from October 2024 to October 2025, according to a University of Wyoming analysis. 
“We’re getting close to marginal prices here where people are going to cut back on their drilling capitalization,” Wold said, noting that spot prices in the low $50 per barrel range gives many operators pause when it comes to coaxing production. The daily spot price that most Wyoming producers track stood at about $57 per barrel on Monday.

For now, oil market watchers are generally on edge as the aftermath of U.S. actions in Venezuela still plays out globally.
“Oil is a global commodity and, as such, any shock to the system will impact prices,” Petroleum Association of Wyoming Vice President and Director of Communications Ryan McConnaughey told WyoFile via email. 
“It will likely take more than $100 billion in investment and 10 years of stability before we see much in increased oil exports from the South American country,” McConnaughey added. “We at PAW believe that the best case for national security, environmental responsibility and economic prosperity is to continue development of natural resources right here at home, regardless of external factors.”
Chevron is the only major U.S. producer active in Venezuela. While the company had been active in the Cowboy State for decades, it shed most of its assets here about 10 years ago. Two other global producers with historic ties to Wyoming, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, mostly exited Venezuela under then-President Hugo Chavez, according to national reports. ExxonMobil operates the Shute Creek gas plant in western Wyoming, while ConocoPhillips has divested much of its Wyoming assets. 
Though final calculations have not yet been tallied, Wyoming oil production was on track to total about 106 million barrels for 2025, likely securing a spot among the nation’s top 10 oil-producing states, according to state data. About 80% of the state’s oil production comes from the Powder River Basin in the northeast.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s $340 million settlement with the owner of the Conowingo Dam can now move forward, after a group of Eastern Shore counties dropped their challenge of the deal.
The withdrawal came less than a month after the administrative appeal was originally filed. Officials at the Maryland Department of the Environment, which brokered the key settlement deal, had lobbied hard for the handful of counties to back down.
That’s because the appeal had the potential to derail or delay the funds from dam owner Constellation, which are designated for various environmental projects. The state negotiated to receive the funds in exchange for issuing the hydroelectric dam a crucial water quality certification, which it needs in order to obtain a 50-year license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
“We are very excited to move out of the courtroom and into action. After nearly a decade of legal challenges we can now put this $340M to work to accelerate progress on the Bay,” wrote Maryland Department of the Environment spokesperson Dave Abrams in a statement. “Thank you to the local governments who worked closely with us to reach this resolution. We are all on the same team and will work closely with them and other stakeholders as we move forward.”
After Maryland officials promised counties they could have input on the rollout of the environmental projects in the settlement, several counties pulled out in late December. Cecil County — which hosts the dam and has complained about the impacts of sediment build-up — was the final hold-out, but dropped out on Friday.
“Over the holidays, MDE and Cecil County Government held productive, transparent discussions that clarified the settlement and secured assurances on Upper Shore project focus, municipal reimbursement for sediment and debris damage, front-loading $18.7 million for dredging studies, and Cecil County’s participation in an advisory council with other Shore counties. As our concerns were addressed, we felt comfortable withdrawing our appeal,” wrote Cecil County spokesperson Robert Royster in a statement.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The counties had expressed frustration that they were not given input on the settlement arrangement until after it was made final. But the negotiations were confidential, because they were also meant to resolve litigation between the state, Constellation and several waterkeepers groups who intervened. The Eastern Shore counties did not intervene in that legal battle.
The appeal was filed by an advocacy group called the Clean Chesapeake Coalition, which includes many Eastern Shore county officials who have long voiced frustration with the dam’s impact on the environment, and specifically the Chesapeake Bay.
The dam, which was built in 1928, once trapped damaging pollutants racing down the Susquehanna River, which contributes about half of the bay’s fresh water, and serves as its largest tributary. But now, the reservoir behind the dam is essentially full, meaning it can no longer trap sediment, and can release large amounts during storm events, with the potential to bury underwater life, and carry harmful nutrient pollution along with it.
Under the settlement, Constellation will put tens of millions of dollars toward tree and underwater grass planting, improvements to fish passage, trash and debris removal and invasive species remediation.
But the agreement also includes provisions about an oft-discussed but controversial strategy for dealing with the dam’s sediment: dredging. Over the next 25 years, Constellation will pay $18.7 million into a fund focused on dredging. But first, all eyes are on an upcoming study from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which will assess whether dredging the Conowingo reservoir is advisable.
If the Army Corps determines dredging is feasible, Maryland can use the funds from Constellation to conduct further study or begin the permitting process for dredging. If the Army Corps deems dredging inadvisable, Maryland can designate the money for other environmental purposes.
For now, though, Constellation will be focused on obtaining its 50-year license from FERC after a federal court reversed the last one. That occurred because Maryland had not issued a water quality certification for Conowingo, instead waiving its right to do so. This time, Maryland has issued the certification, and is aiming for its conditions to be incorporated into the dam’s new federal license to operate.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC06857-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 18:58:22.563937

(Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Three more confirmed cases of measles have been reported in Nebraska’s Platte County, bringing the total reported over the past week to four, state health officials announced Monday. All four are in the same household.
Two of the cases still are in the infectious stage, which lasts nine days, according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. So far, the state health agency reports no evidence that the spread of the highly contagious airborne disease moved into the larger community.
Due to privacy concerns, state health officials offered no further information on the affected patients or household. The initial case was reported Dec. 30 and involved an unvaccinated child with a history of travel to Arizona.
As a result, the East Central District Health Department will host vaccine clinics this week: Monday, Jan. 5, from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. at 4321 41 Ave. in Columbus and Friday, Jan. 9, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. at 822 15 St.
DHHS officials said in a statement that immunization is the most effective way to protect against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. 
Children should receive the first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age, followed by a second dose between four and six years of age, health officials said. DHHS recommends Platte County parents of infants ages 6 to 11 months consult their healthcare provider to discuss early MMR vaccination.

Dr. Sydney Stein, the state epidemiologist, encouraged all Nebraskans to contact their healthcare provider to check their vaccination status against measles. 
“If you have not had two doses of MMR vaccine, talk to your healthcare provider or local health department right away,” she said in a statement.
There is no specific treatment for measles. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of Dec. 31, a total of 2,065 cases of measles had been reported in 2025, and three deaths had been confirmed. 
Last year’s number was reported as the highest annually since measles was declared eliminated in the country in 2000.
State officials have said individuals present at the following public places on the dates provided could have been exposed: 

Shell Creek Baptist Church in Columbus, Dec. 24, 4:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.

The state asks individuals who were at those spots between those times to fill out a risk assessment survey. Those needing help filling out the survey or with internet access are encouraged to call East Central District Health Department at 402-562-8969.

A federal judge on Monday declined to dismiss one of three criminal charges facing Rep. LaMonica McIver, a Democratic congresswoman who is accused of assaulting federal agents outside a Newark immigration detention facility last year.
The decision comes nearly two months after the same judge denied McIver’s pretrial motions to dismiss the other two charges. McIver has filed notice that she is appealing the earlier order.
In the new, eight-page decision, U.S. District Court Judge Jamel K. Semper rejects McIver’s arguments that her actions are shielded by the U.S. Constitution’s speech or debate clause, which protects lawmakers from prosecution for official legislative actions. McIver has argued that she was at migrant jail Delaney Hall on the day in question to perform oversight duties and cannot be charged with a crime for what transpired during the visit.
“The Court cannot find that Defendant’s alleged conduct was legislative in nature,” Semper wrote. “Her conduct was not tied to potential legislation or any other policy-making purpose.”
Oversight visit brings Rep. McIver back to migrant jail at center of her criminal case

McIver is accused of assaulting officers during the chaotic scene that unfolded outside Delaney Hall on May 9 when agents moved to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka for trespassing (a charge that was later dropped). Prosecutors later charged McIver, alleging she shoved officers as they detained Baraka.
McIver was indicted on three counts. Semper in November allowed counts one and three to move forward, but said he needed to learn more facts before deciding whether count two should be dismissed.
Monday’s ruling says Semper initially believed that the officer at the center of count two’s allegations initiated contact with McIver by preventing her from entering Delaney Hall’s property. But video later introduced as evidence shows McIver initiated physical contact with the officer, according to the ruling.
McIver, who joined Congress in 2024, pleaded not guilty in June and last week said she plans to appeal Semper’s earlier ruling on her motions to dismiss the charges. She faces up to 17 years in prison if convicted on all three counts.
Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“From the beginning, I’ve fought back against this administration’s cruelty and attempts to silence dissent—this appeal is the next step in the fight. The Trump administration’s case is dangerous, baseless, and designed to stop me from doing my job. I won’t,” she said in a statement last week.

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)State Rep. Carla Cunningham, the Charlotte Democrat who sparked controversy in July 2025 with a House floor speech castigating immigrants, filed a petition Monday asking a Mecklenburg County judge to remove Sheriff Garry McFadden from office.
Mecklenburg Co. Sheriff’s Office Public Information Manager Sarah Mastouri said the sheriff is aware of the complaint, but declined to comment.  
According to the petition, McFadden called Cunningham to lobby her not to vote to override Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of House Bill 318, which requires sheriffs to hold ICE detainees without a warrant for 48 hours. 
McFadden had been a vocal critic of the bill, which he said would damage his office’s relationship with the immigrant community in Mecklenburg County and lead to higher jail costs. 
According to Cunningham’s sworn affidavit, McFadden said to her that the people in her district would “come after” her if she voted to override the veto, and said, “I don’t want to see you get hurt; you live in my county.”
Cunningham, the affidavit says, understood those statements to be “a threat by McFadden to either physically harm her, or to withdraw or refuse her any protection from members of the public who would physically harm her.”
The petition alleges that McFadden was attempting to extort or bribe Cunningham to change her vote to override the veto. 
Cunningham’s controversial floor speech during H318 veto override vote angered many immigrants and advocates as well as members of her own party, who accused her of working with Republican leaders to undermine the governor. 
Cunningham has said she received violent threats and had to hire private security in the aftermath. The longtime lawmaker is facing several primary challengers in March.
NC Newsline asked Cunningham’s spokeswoman Kate Payne if the lawmaker had a recording or any other evidence of the conversation. Payne did not immediately respond. 
The petition was jointly signed by several former sheriff’s office employees who also accuse McFadden of misuse of resources, retaliation against whistleblowers, understaffing the detention center and other alleged misconduct.
The filing of the complaint comes the same day N.C. House Republican leaders announced they’ve subpoenaed McFadden to appear before an oversight committee Jan. 22 to testify about the killing of Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte transit in August 2025, and to answer questions about allegations that he is still promoting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in defiance of a state law prohibiting them.
McFadden, a Democrat in his eighth year as sheriff, is seeking a third term in 2026.

Net general revenue totaled $618.6 million, which was $7.8 million below December 2024 collections and $5.8 million below the forecast amount, the Department of Finance and Administration said.
The state’s net revenue for the fiscal year, which began July 1, totals $3.4 billion. That’s nearly $103 million above forecast.
Arkansas has consistently lowered corporate income taxes over the past few years. As of June 2024, the top corporate income tax rate is 4.3%, a decrease from 5.1% since April 2023.
Corporate income tax collections in December totaled $78.1 million, a decrease of $3.4 million from December 2024 and $5.5 million below the forecast amount.
Gross general revenue and individual income tax refunds were both above projected amounts, according to the report. Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson called the state’s revenue collections stable. 
“The department will issue an updated forecast in late January for the remainder of fiscal year 2026 and for fiscal year 2027 in preparation for the upcoming fiscal legislative session,” Hudson said in a statement.

(USDA/FPAC photo by Preston Keres)An animal tested positive for brucellosis in Gallatin County, the state Department of Livestock reported in late December.
The state received confirmation that the animal was positive on Dec. 24, and the herd has been quarantined and an epidemiological investigation is “ongoing,” a news release said. 
The Department of Livestock does not identify the species of animal as a rule for confidentiality.
Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that can spread between animals, attacking their reproductive system, and can cause abortions in pregnant cattle, elk and bison. The disease can be transmitted to humans, though Montana hasn’t had a positive human case in nearly a decade.
The surveillance areas are in southern and southwestern Montana, and are mostly areas near Yellowstone National Park. Some Yellowstone bison and elk test positive for brucellosis and can move up and intermingle with populations not in the park boundary.
While the source of the brucellosis transmission is not currently known for the Gallatin County animal, all 14 prior tests have come back as transmission from elk, the press release said.
The positive test is the 15th since 2010, when the Designated Surveillance Areas were put in place, the release said. The most recent case, prior to the Gallatin County one, was in Beaverhead County last year.
“Detections of brucellosis are inevitably burdensome for an operation,” Dr. Tahnee Szymanski, state veterinarian, said in a release. “Our goal at Montana Department of Livestock is that the work that (Designated Surveillance Area) producers do on an annual basis can be leveraged towards a highly tailored and focused investigation that reduces the impact to an operation when brucellosis is found.”
The state also outlined what disease investigations look like in the release, saying they may look as far as three years back in the herd’s history to see if the disease can be traced to  any other herds.
“In this case, the affected herd does not utilize shared grazing, has a minimal number of herds that run adjacent, and conducts voluntary annual whole herd testing, resulting in a relatively small scope investigation,” the state press release said.
The Gallatin County animal in question was caught via “voluntary whole-herd testing” and was pregnant at the time of the positive test. 
The animal “was removed from the herd before she was able to spread the disease through an abortion or during calving,” the release said, allowing the herd to be quarantined with “no expected impacts” to routine management practices.
Montana is considered to be brucellosis free, called “Class Free,” an important designation in the beef industry — if the state didn’t have it, livestock exported from anywhere in the state would need to be tested. Right now, only animals in what are called “Designated Surveillance Areas” are tested, to the tune of about 100,000 tests per year. It’s not cheap either — those tests ring up to more than $600,000 annually. 
Vaccinations of cattle against brucellosis are also required to be performed by a licensed veterinarian. Vaccination requirements also apply to seasonal grazers.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/52101044245_24d4c26759_k-1024x617.jpg,,,2026-01-05 18:12:28.217469

(Photo by David Talukdar/Getty Images)Fairfield’s Maharishi Foundation USA is suing a former student of transcendental meditation, claiming unfair competition and trademark infringement.
Maharashi University USA Inc. is suing Leif Bjelland of Missoula, Montana, and his company, Transcend Today, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
The foundation and its predecessors and affiliates have been providing instruction in transcendental meditation for 60 years. The foundation claims the practice is a proprietary form of meditation that can only be taught by the foundation’s program and its licensees and that the phrase “transcendental meditation” has been trademarked.
According to the lawsuit, Bjelland was a student in the program around 2020, attending trainings and workshops offered by the foundation. As a student, Bjelland is alleged to have completed a form in which he agreed the transcendental meditation techniques he learned would be for his own personal use and that he would not “instruct or impart the transcendental meditation technique” until he was certified by the foundation to do so.
The lawsuit claims Bjelland subsequently applied for a “Transcend Today” trademark to sell hoodies, T-shirts, sleep masks, yoga tops, baseball caps and beach hats, while offering single- or multisession workshops in what his Montana company calls “Heroic Breathwork.”
In its lawsuit, the foundation claims the name “Transcend Today” is “confusingly similar” to the foundation’s trademarked designs, and that it is being used to compete with the self-improvement, health and personal development services for which the foundation uses its trademarks.
The lawsuit alleges Transcend Today informs prospective clients and customers that the business operates “at your home over Zoom” and that it functions “over Zoom within the spaces you feel most comfortable.” As a result, the foundation claims, Transcend Today has caused its products to be sold in Iowa while infringing on the trademarks of the foundation.
According to the lawsuit, legal counsel for the foundation informed Bjelland in August 2025 that his “Transcend Today” trademark infringed on those of the foundation and that while Bjelland initially agreed to cancel his “Transcend Today” trademark, he later changed course and decided to maintain it.
The foundation alleges it has “been damaged, and is likely to be further damaged, specifically through the loss of competitive advantage in the market and revenue associated with sales regarding or participation in its transcendental meditation programs.”
Bjelland has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach him for comment.
On his website, Bjelland describes himself as a “breathwork facilitator, TEDx speaker, and founder of Heroic Breath.” The site describes Heroic Breathwork as a “sound-driven breathwork experience” that can calm the nervous system, reduce anxiety and enhance self-awareness.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota’s dairy industry has grown rapidly over the past two decades, but an industry leader warned Monday that maintaining the momentum could depend partly on the number of workers allowed into the United States.
During a Downtown Sioux Falls Rotary panel discussion focused on the state’s dairy industry, Tim den Dulk, a dairy farmer and processor, was asked if uncertainty around labor is a concern. The federal government has implemented stricter immigration enforcement during the current Trump administration.
“We expect it to be extremely difficult to find employees, especially if we don’t allow more laborers in,” den Dulk said.
The dairy industry in the state has been affected by immigration enforcement actions. Drumgoon Dairy, near Lake Norden, lost 38 of its 50 employees this summer after a federal Department of Homeland Security audit flagged workers for inaccurate, outdated or incomplete proof of U.S. citizenship or permission to work in the country.
Noem’s South Dakota neighbors hit with an immigration audit that decimates their workforce

Former Gov. Dennis Daugaard moderated the Monday discussion and opened it with a look back at the dairy industry’s growth. The number of dairy cows in the state increased 165% from 2006 to 2025, and is expected to grow another 18% this year to 253,475 cows. Most of the growth has taken place along the Interstate 29 corridor in the eastern part of the state. Panelists said the growth has helped generate jobs and broaden the state’s agricultural economy.
However, without a reliable pipeline of workers, den Dulk said the industry’s recent growth could be hard to sustain.
“We could pay some people $35, $40 an hour to milk a cow, and I still don’t think we would get them to be milkers for a 12-hour shift, five to six days a week,” he said. 
South Dakota also has the nation’s lowest unemployment rate, at 2%.
Jake Anderson, plant director at Bel Brands USA in Brookings, discussed the company’s ongoing expansion aimed at doubling production of its Mini Babybel cheese wheels. Anderson said a key strategy for staying competitive in the job market is positioning the company as an employer of choice, including offering higher wages.
“Certainly, it is something that we do need to keep an eye on,” Anderson said of workforce challenges. “It is certainly on the top of a lot of organizations’ minds.”

Upper Missouri Waterkeeper has sued the Montana Department of Environmental Quality alleging an unconstitutional failure of public process and lack of environmental review for a major sewer pipeline in Big Sky.
Waterkeeper, a nonprofit with a mission to protect and restore water in the Upper Missouri River Basin, said the DEQ is taking up smaller portions of a major regional wastewater system individually, but it said the agency must review the project as a whole.
Waterkeeper recently announced a Gallatin County District Court judge found the DEQ didn’t take a “hard look” at water quality impacts on the Gallatin River in a different case the nonprofit had filed about a proposed subdivision.
Also in Gallatin County District Court, the most recent lawsuit brings challenges related to the new pipeline that’s part of the larger Gallatin Canyon Sewer Project, a regional wastewater collection, treatment and disposal plan the plaintiffs estimate will push disposal gallons per day from as much as 120,000 to an estimated 600,000.
The plan is jointly proposed by the Gallatin Canyon County Water & Sewer District and Big Sky County Water & Sewer District. The DEQ has permitting and review authority over it.
The lawsuit said the pipeline project entails roughly 5,000 linear feet of sewage line and a second, treated effluent main line (two pipelines) adjacent to Highway 64 and running parallel to “reaches of the West Fork Gallatin River.”
The project collects sewage in Big Sky’s Canyon Area, a development corridor along the Gallatin. It moves it for treatment up to the Big Sky County Water & Sewer District, and then moves the treated wastewater back to the Canyon Area for disposal through a groundwater discharge permit being considered by the DEQ, the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit alleges the DEQ has failed to provide for meaningful public participation in the project, in violation of the Montana Constitution, and it’s making decisions before completing an analysis of significant environmental impacts.
The lawsuit also alleges the project could increase harms to the middle segment of the Gallatin River, already impacted with algal blooms, and even be a detriment to drinking water for people downstream.
Parts of the river are considered impaired by the Environmental Protection Agency.
In a statement, Guy Alsentzer of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper said the DEQ is blocking the public from participating in decisions that have significant public interest and deserve transparency.
For example, an impairment determination and related restoration plan for the Gallatin River drew more than 1,000 public comments, the lawsuit said.
“Massive infrastructure projects being approved behind closed doors, without public participation, is antithetical to democracy,” Alsentzer said in a statement. “DEQ is stacking the deck by considering pieces of a regional wastewater system in isolation.
“The public deserves — and the Montana Constitution guarantees — a transparent decision-making process that reviews the whole picture.”
He said the pipeline is integral to a pending new municipal-scale discharge permit application, but the public is being illegally shut out of decisions about it.
The lawsuit said the nonprofit only learned about the DEQ’s decisions in November from a public records request it filed under the Right to Know of the Montana Constitution.
But that was months after the DEQ approved a critical application for the pipeline, one at which the project would become viable or would stop, the lawsuit said. And the approval took place June 18 without any public notice or public participation opportunities and without any published environmental reviews, the lawsuit said.
It alleges the DEQ failed to perform any review under the Montana Environmental Policy Act, or MEPA, for the pipeline project, and it also failed to complete a review of the larger wastewater project.
In fact, the lawsuit said DEQ has been reviewing multiple segments of the same project, without meaningful environmental review or public participation, in an action the plaintiff alleges is a “systemic failure” that ignores the potential the overall project could be “cumulatively significant.”
In an email, a spokesperson for the DEQ said the agency does not typically comment on litigation and does not have comment at this time.
The Waterkeeper is asking the court to declare the DEQ violated the right to know and right to participate under the Montana Constitution; that it violated MEPA by failing to perform environmental analysis and by segmenting its reviews of the wastewater project; and that its “informal pattern” of exempting smaller projects from public participation requirements is unconstitutional.
The Waterkeeper also asks the court to vacate the approval of the pipeline project application and remand it for public processes. It asks the court to stop the DEQ from authorizing any action connected to the wastewater project until after it has completed environmental reviews.

The 32-page SB 1052, filed Monday by Vero Beach Republican Sen. Erin Grall, instructs public colleges and universities to exclusively admit students who are “citizen[s] of the United States” or “lawfully present therein.”
It also would prevent migrants illegally in the country from participating in state-funded adult general education programs, which include classes for GED and English as a second language that help “adult learners gain the knowledge and skills they need to enter and succeed in postsecondary education,” as defined on the Department of Education’s website.

This builds off of a provision in a Feb. 2025 law that nixed all in-state tuition for undocumented college students.
Grall’s bill comes amid a crackdown on undocumented immigration that surged in early 2025 when President Donald Trump re-took office. Trump’s administration soon imposed a deportation quota for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, increased the cost for certain work visas, and supported states like Florida that are building their own detention centers.
Florida became the first and only state to require all 67 counties to enter into 287(g) agreements, which are state- and local-level partnerships with ICE.
SB 1052, which doesn’t have a companion measure in the House yet, also would strike the requirement for a gender-equity plan in intercollegiate athletics.
Although the measure still demands universities comply with the Title IX prohibition on discrimination in athletic programs, the Florida College System would not have to draw up plans to consider equity in sports offerings, participation, availability of facilities, scholarship offerings, and funds allocated for administration, recruitment, comparable coaching, publicity and promotion, and other support costs.
This would rewrite a 2001 state law requiring these plans as extensions of Title IX protections.
Grall’s bill includes a waiver certain tuition fees for active members of the Florida State Guard.
Grall’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The classroom in Brown University’s Barus & Holley building where a shooting killed two students and injured nine others will remain walled off and sealed away in the upcoming spring semester, school officials announced Monday.  
“We know that resuming operations in Barus & Holley is particularly sensitive, and extensive work has taken place over the Winter Break to alter operations,” the school’s President Christina H. Paxson wrote in a letter Monday, adding that some of the spring semester’s engineering and physics classes will be relocated due to the closure of two lecture halls and eight classrooms in the building.
Paxson announced Monday that Brown is embarking on another initiative to process the campus’ collective trauma: Brown Ever True, a broad effort to strengthen the school’s mental health and community support offerings after the Dec. 13 shooting. 
Paxson wrote that Brown Ever True will consolidate certain university resources, programming and services to assist students, staff and faculty in what she described as the “gradual process” of recovering from the traumatic event.  
“The effects of Dec. 13 may surface in uncertain ways,” Paxson wrote. “And ‘recovery’ will at times seem elusive.” 
The university’s new initiative will be “informed by medical and public health experts and scholars who specialize in trauma,” Paxson wrote, and it adopts efforts at other colleges that have experienced similar tragedies. Brown Ever True will incorporate ideas and feedback from across student organizations and Brown’s administrative units — including campus life, human resources, and the college’s School of Public Health — to “help ensure that the initiative reflects what our community needs to heal and move forward,” Paxson added.
Paxson’s announcement comes roughly two weeks before the start of the school’s spring semester. The winter session began on Dec. 20 and will end on Jan. 20, a day before the spring semester begins. Paxson wrote that the recovery initiative is meant to prepare the Brown community ahead of the new semester and to help them feel safe in their surroundings.
Over winter break, Paxson wrote, the school is offering remote options for students such as TimelyCare Teletherapy and BetterHelp, and she stressed that counseling services and staff will be readily available to students when they return to campus later this month.
The university has also widened its support for employees. Faculty and staff could access an additional dozen counseling sessions through the end of 2025 via the school’s Employee Assistance Program, and the university is working with its provider Spring Health for similar offerings in 2026. 
Additional sessions and programming focusing on resiliency will be organized through the school’s diversity office and faculty in the Warren Alpert Medical School, with more details to arrive via the Brown Ever True website. The website currently includes an evolving, searchable list of on- and off-campus resources including 24/7 hotlines, counseling providers, chaplains, and mindfulness and meditation sessions.
Additionally, the university is planning a service for sometime in late January to remember Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, the two students who were killed in the attack.
“While all the injured students now have been released from the hospital, they and so many others continue to navigate through very real challenges of coping with tragedy,” Paxson wrote.
As of Monday morning, all nine students who were hospitalized with gunshot wounds had been discharged, according to Rhode Island Hospital spokesperson Kelly Brennan.
New carpets and paint 
A Dec. 23 letter from Brown’s Provost Francis J. Doyle III specified that the “sensitive areas” in the Barus & Holley building will remain inaccessible for now, as the school is being “mindful of the concerns that many community members have raised about continuing to use those spaces.”  
Among these spaces is lecture hall 166, where the shooting happened at the end of a review for an economics final. Barus & Holley mainly houses physics and engineering classes in addition to research activities. 
Room 166 and 168 will be sealed off — secured behind new walls and emergency access doors, Doyle wrote — and have their basement level access cut off. Eight classrooms and the hallways, bathrooms and entrances adjacent or close to the shooting site will be inaccessible, Doyle wrote, and basically hidden from view. 
“None of the closed areas will be visible to occupants and users of adjacent spaces, and no one will be able or allowed to enter those spaces,” Doyle wrote. “Nearby first-floor hallways that have a similar look and feel to the closed spaces will be updated with paint and carpet to change that look and feel.”
The school has not made any long-term decisions regarding the classrooms’ future, but Doyle noted that “the future of that area of the building, including consideration of appropriate memorialization, will be made over time in consultation and conversation with the Brown community.”
The Barus & Holley building comprises 117 laboratories, 150 offices, 15 classrooms, 29 laboratory classrooms and three lecture halls. 
While “most of the building remains generally closed while this work is ongoing,” Paxson wrote Monday, a “limited” number of people who will need to work in the non-restricted areas of the Barus & Holley, plus other physics and engineering research spaces on campus, are expected to regain building access before spring semester.
Doyle noted in his letter that “[t]he remainder” of Barus & Holley plus the “vast majority of the School of Engineering and Department of Physics complex will reopen in time for the spring semester,” while the closed areas will remain “inaccessible to everyone.”  
The non-restricted areas are expected to have their general access restored by Jan. 20, according to Paxson’s letter.

Steps to enhance campus security 
Alongside the mental wellness initiative, Brown’s new interim top public safety official  — the former Providence police chief Hugh T. Clements Jr. — announced on Dec. 30 a lineup of elevated public safety measures.
Under Clements’ leadership, the school is installing more security officers across academic buildings, residence halls, and events. The increased staffing will roll out in phases, Clements wrote, and will be “aligned with the ramp-up of operations and the increase of students, faculty and staff on campus as we transition from the lesser density of the holiday break and Winter Session, to the Jan. 6 end of the administrative Winter Break and resumption of medical school courses, to the start of the second semester on Jan. 21.” 
Brown will deploy additional officers via “coordinated mutual aid from partner agencies and well-trained private security resources” to ensure coverage of campus areas as needed, Clements wrote. 
“Buildings also will continue to require card access, a key or displaying a University ID for entry,” Clements wrote.
Also on Clements’ to-do list before the spring semester: Transitioning all buildings with key access to card access, expanding and installing cameras on blue light phones, and adding more surveillance cameras and panic buttons in select locations across campus.
Clements assumed his interim role on Dec. 22, when Brown announced it was temporarily suspending police chief Rodney Chatman amid a pair of investigations into the shooting commissioned by the school’s governing body, the Corporation of Brown University. Chatman’s leave was preceded by a no-confidence vote in Chatman from the school’s police union in October 2025, the Brown Daily Herald reported then.
Clements promised a change in public perception during his tenure: “[Y]ou will see a public safety leadership team that listens and acts,” Clements wrote. “Over the coming weeks, I will be active across campus listening, learning and working alongside colleagues to ensure that our approach is responsive, thoughtful and grounded in care for the people of this community and the values of Brown.”
“Our goal is not to create a campus defined by fear, but one defined by preparedness, vigilance and mutual care,” Clements added. 
The corporation commissioned two reviews from outside firms: One examining what happened leading up to the shooting and its aftermath and the school’s response and a more thorough assessment of Brown’s entire security systems and policies. Both are ongoing, according to Paxson’s most recent letter.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN —  Nebraska officials explored the statewide implications if the U.S. gets involved in a major war or “armed conflict” as part of a new state report issued this month on external threats. 
Gov.  Jim Pillen briefed the press Monday on the new legislatively required annual threat assessment. He was joined by Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, and Adj. Gen. Craig Strong at the Nebraska National Guard Air Base. 
The report comes after four meetings last year of the 11-member, legislatively created Committee on Pacific Conflict, required by a 2024 law from State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln. The group met to discuss the state’s vulnerabilities in agriculture, infrastructure, telecommunications and cybersecurity with experts. It includes four lawmakers, the lieutenant governor and the adjutant general. 
Kelly, a former prosecutor, said this year’s report focused on agricultural security. The report focuses on who owns farmland in the state and how it’s being used — especially land near military installations. Kelly said the committee will look into how the state should respond to “any threats by bad actors here in Nebraska when it relates to our farm security and our economy and our citizens.”
“We know that here in Nebraska, our defense starts with the 44 million acres of land that are in ag production,” Kelly said.
Strong praised another 2024 law, authored by state Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara, which updated an 1889 state law prohibiting certain entities from purchasing Nebraska ag land, primarily people and corporations with ties to countries that the U.S. Commerce Department deems foreign adversaries.

Bostar and U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., a former speaker of the Legislature, had highlighted the need to prevent foreign adversaries from buying land near military installations.
Nebraska is home to key U.S. military infrastructure, including Strategic Air Command near Omaha and to 80 intercontinental ballistic missile launch facilities and nine alert facilities, all serving national security.
Much of the press conference Monday discussed China and the national and state security threat of being too reliant on Beijing. Nebraska has passed its own laws focused on foreign adversaries that have partly focused on the country. 
Pillen said the U.S. has “been duped that we can buy happiness by buying cheap crap from China” and that the “greatest form” of security for the state is buying from “Main Street Nebraska” instead.

Last year, the state committee described China as a threat to Nebraska. Then, as now, Pillen and legislative leaders have expressed concerns about Chinese ownership of American ag land. Pillen has issued executive orders restricting state agency use of Chinese technology. 
Kelly highlighted one order from 2023, calling Nebraska is an “adversary-free zone” because of Pillen banning the use or download of “applications, software, and platforms created or owned by affiliates of the Chinese Communist Party on state networks and devices.” 
The governor said it’s “extraordinarily important that we really recognize we have severe foreign adversaries.”
“China wants to take us out. Iran wants to take us out. North Korea wants to take us out. Venezuela wants to take us out,” Pillen said. 
Asked by reporters about the U.S. capturing of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Pillen said he is  “incredibly proud of what the president’s done in going to Venezuela and getting a radical terrorist out of our hair.” 
The governor also said, “Nebraskans don’t need to worry about selling soybeans to China, because of the state’s “value added agriculture.” Nebraskans can raise and process 300 million bushels of soybeans, despite no “Nebraska soybeans going on barges to China.” Nebraska farmers are bracing for another tough year, plagued by low corn and soybean prices, which many ag experts blame partly on President Donald Trump’s trade war with China and other international ag customers. 
“We have to roll up our sleeves and not be duped anymore,” Pillen said. “So if anybody’s buying anything from China, stop it today … That’s important to get it across to all Nebraskans. Stop it today. We have to win this.”

Sign up for Chalkbeat Tennessee’s free newsletter to keep up with statewide education policy and Memphis-Shelby County Schools.
Most Tennessee public school students who use Education Savings Account vouchers aren’t leaving low-performing public schools, while ESA students overall are underperforming their public school peers in both academic achievement and growth.
Tennessee Comptroller Jason E. Mumpower’s office released these findings Monday in the first comprehensive review of the program.
The comptroller’s report also found that the Tennessee Department of Education has not yet established parameters for removing private schools with repeated low academic performance, nor could it provide documentation “used to measure schools’ performance or counsel schools that have multiple years of low academic performance.”
Republican lawmakers passed the Education Savings Account program in 2019, though legal challenges delayed implementation until 2022. The program was the precursor to the 2025 universal voucher program, which GOP lawmakers are already looking to expand this year after 20,000 students were enrolled last fall.
The ESA program could be limited to 12,500 enrollees under state law this school year, with a cap of 15,000 set to kick in next year. But the program has never been fully utilized, with just 3,693 students enrolled in the current school year.
The ESA program was designed to benefit public school students: First-time ESA applicants in 2022 had to be moving from a public school, entering kindergarten, or transferring into Tennessee from another state.
In 2022, 66% of ESA students came from a public school, and 33% were entering public school.
Tennessee Republican contends more details needed on voucher rollout

By the next school year, lawmakers had made a change to “grandfather” some students into the program who had attended public school at least one year since 2019, the year the law was passed. Those students accounted for 31% of ESA students. Overall, 15% of 2023 ESA students were entering kindergarten, 38% were coming from public schools, and 14% had reenrolled in the program.
In 2024, nearly half of all ESA students had reenrolled in the program, 28% came from public schools and 14% were entering kindergarten.
The program was a signature issue for Gov. Bill Lee, who has supported additional school choice policies as a way for parents to choose higher-achieving schools.
The comptroller’s report indicates this is not necessarily happening. The program was targeted at districts with a relatively high number of Priority schools, a federal designation for schools that underperform in certain categories. In practice, that meant the ESA program could only be implemented in Shelby, Davidson, and Hamilton counties, large districts that often have as many high-ranking, or reward, schools as priority schools.
“Most schools that students are leaving to participate in the ESA program are neither reward nor priority schools, which would indicate their performance is neither among the highest or lowest of public schools in the state,” the comptroller’s report states. “When considering schools that have received state and federal designations, more ESA students are leaving reward schools than priority schools.”
This varies significantly by county, though. In Davidson County, 80% of ESA students who previously attended public schools attended schools with A, B, or C letter grades, and 18% of students came from schools that received a D or F letter grade. In Memphis, 58% of students previously attended A, B or C-graded schools.
In Hamilton County, 50% of ESA students previously attended public schools with D or F grades.
The comptroller’s report also found the state education department did not do enough to advertise the ESA program to low-income students, a requirement in state law.
Overall, students receiving ESA money performed worse on the state’s standardized tests than students in public schools, although ESA students outperformed their peers in Memphis-Shelby County schools last year. The comptroller’s report also notes that scores from students receiving ESAs have increased over time.
Meanwhile, virtual schools participating in the ESA program for the first time last year performed worse than both private schools with ESA students and local public schools. Just 20% of ESA students enrolled in virtual schools were proficient in English language arts, and just 17% were proficient in math.
Parent satisfaction with the program remains above 95%, but the comptroller notes only 15% of participating families actually provided feedback on the program last year.
There could be major changes to ESAs this year. The comptroller report suggests lawmakers reconsider eligibility requirements and where the program is targeting, noting other districts like Knox County Schools could be drawn in.
Meanwhile, House Speaker Cameron Sexton wants to eliminate the income limit and enrollment cap altogether for the program and open it up to all students in the current three counties.
This current income cap is 200% or less of the federal income eligibility to receive free school lunch, which would be $83,590 this year for a family of four. Around 76% of families in ESA-eligible counties are already eligible for the program, according to an EdChoice analysis.
The ESA this year provides around $9,747 per student, which fell below the average tuition cost by about $3,000 for participating private schools, the majority of which were religiously affiliated.

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia Senate President Randy Smith has named Sen. Patricia Rucker to the new position of assistant majority leader, according to a news release Monday. She’ll also chair the Senate Committee on School Choice.
Rucker, R-Jefferson, currently serves on the Agriculture, Government Organization, Health and Human Resources, Judiciary, Rules, and Transportation and Infrastructure committees. She previously served as chair of the Senate’s Committee on Government Organization and the Committee on Education.
“Going into a new session, I knew that I wanted a strong leadership team that would be able to guide us through whatever challenges come our way,” Smith said in the news release. “Sen. Rucker’s years of service and experience combined with her expertise in critical policy areas like education make her a natural fit for a role that gives her even more of an opportunity to be a leader.”
The Committee on School Choice operated under former Senate President Craig Blair, R-Berkeley, but had not been operational during the 2025 legislative session. The resurrected committee will focus on the needs of children and families in West Virginia who are pursuing educational options outside of the traditional public school environment, including homeschools, microschools, public charter schools and private and parochial schools, according to the news release. 
The 2026 legislative session starts Wednesday, Jan. 14.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Despite criticisms from establishment Democrats and Republicans alike, former Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan opened the new year by saying he believes there is a path to victory for him leading toward the governor’s office, even as he stares down a daunting three-way contest between him, as an independent, versus the duopoly candidates who still need fight through a summer primary.
But Duggan, who officially became a full-time gubernatorial candidate after Detroit Mayor Mary Sheffield was sworn into office last week, still needs to make his policy case to a wide swath of Michigan voters before the November general election, and that includes many voters who are already locked in to vote for whichever Democratic and Republican candidates win out in the August primaries.
A media roundtable he hosted on Monday gave Duggan one of his first chances to do that in the new year, touching on his stance regarding AI data centers, which he said he is for with some caveats, raiding the state’s K-12 fund to pay for other priorities, which he is against, and whether he would stand up to or be cozy with the federal government and President Donald Trump, to which he has been a bit more elusive.
Either way, Duggan said no longer being mayor of Detroit allows him to refine his messaging and meet with “people who feel like they’ve been forgotten, who have been fed up or left out.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I’m going to be campaigning every day,” Duggan said. “When I’m talking to people in these communities, they aren’t talking about the nonsense in Washington. They actually want to know why their kids don’t have vocational training in their high schools; why reading levels in this state are slipping; why the young people are moving out and why, when their kids are ready to get jobs, they can’t afford housing in their communities.”
Duggan’s reasoning for why he left the Democratic Party last year in order to run as an independent gubernatorial candidate has been written about many times before. Although he still has to explain that decision to voters, who might view it as more politically advantageous than sincere, Duggan can now begin to shift his focus to talking policy instead.
Still, there are plenty of questions about whether he can pull in enough voters to elevate him from a big city mayor to becoming Michigan’s governor, and what he’ll do now that some key Democrats who have supported him in the past have turned on him in his indie era.
Case in point: the Rev. Horace Sheffield III, father to Mayor Sheffield, said he plans to endorse the eventual Democratic nominee in the gubernatorial hunt and not Duggan. That announcement came after Duggan vehemently endorsed now-Mayor Sheffield to replace him in Detroit.
Duggan was asked if he expected Mayor Sheffield to reciprocate, and if he was concerned over more key Democrats taking the reverend’s position.
The former mayor did not appear worried, at all.
“I got endorsed by more than 100 African American ministers, not just from Detroit, but from Flint and Lansing and around the state, including most of the prominent ministers in southeast Michigan,” Duggan said. “I won’t get every single endorsement … and those folks don’t need to bother paying attention to the campaign for the next 10 months. They’ve already made up their minds. I’m talking to the people who are troubled by the direction things are headed.”
Duggan has carved out an interesting group of Republican donors who have now supported his campaign, and the Democratic Party in Michigan has been pushing with full force to note that and other issues they have with Duggan and his campaign.
Just before Duggan’s roundtable event, Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel lambasted the former mayor on a number of issues during a call with reporters, including his coziness with Trump and his acceptance of money from Republican donors. Hertel was joined on the call by state Reps. Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor) and Joey Andrews (D-St. Joseph).
Union battles at Detroit Medical Center may shadow Duggan’s 2026 bid for Michigan governor

Hertel went on to say that Duggan has supported Trump’s health care cuts, refused to condemn Trump’s trade war with Canada and brought up his history of union busting allegations while leading the Detroit Medical Center before he became mayor.
“Let’s be clear, this campaign is nothing but an expensive and self serving ego trip on a road to nowhere,” Hertel said Monday. “Duggan has been consistently in last place with no path of winning a general election. He’s proven one thing, and it’s that he can’t be trusted to fight for Michiganders or stand up to protect our state from the worst of the Trump administration, while Trump and Republicans are causing prices to skyrocket and people lose their health care.”
While Hertel and the party has not endorsed a candidate for governor and won’t until after the August primary, Rheingans and Andrews have both endorsed Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, the frontrunner on the Democratic side of the race.
In response, Duggan said: “for a guy who doesn’t think I can win, he sure is spending a lot of time talking about me.”
“Curtis Hertel has a tough problem. We just had a Democratic trifecta for two years of complete Democratic control,” Duggan said. “Curtis Hertel has got to cover for the fact that Democrats don’t stand for anything, except they’re against Republicans. So he’s got the slogan of vote blue no matter who. He’s going to push it nonstop. And I’m a threat to that. … I’m pretty sure Curtis is going to continue to be obsessed with me.”
Duggan elaborated on what he believes went wrong during those trifecta years of 2022-23.
“I sat down with the Detroit legislators and said, ‘This is our chance. Let’s have a statewide affordable housing plan. Let’s deal with the schools, let’s deal with vocational training, let’s deal with long term secure mental health beds. Our police officers in this state are too often the first line of response to mental illness,” Duggan said. “They didn’t get any of those things done. They were so busy fighting with the far left that wouldn’t compromise with the moderates. And of course, they wouldn’t dare take some Republican votes. … And so you saw what happened in lame duck [in late 2023]. It blew up, and they all went home without getting anything done.”
One reporter noted that Duggan’s team reshared a post from the conservative outlet The Midwesterner questioning whether Benson would find a reason to exclude him from the ballot.
Asked if he thought Benson would do so, which would be abuse of her office, Duggan ducked a direct answer. 
“I’m going to file so many signatures, nobody’s going to bother to try to have me disqualified,” he said.
Other policy odds and ends
Moving away from his issues with Democrats, Duggan was asked if he would pledge to not raise taxes, but did not do so. He said new services might come up.
On Hertel’s insistence that he was for Trump’s controversial economic policies that have affected Michigan’s neighbor to the north, Duggan said he has criticized the tariff policies aimed at Canada. He also said that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was similarly attacked for going to Washington, working with Trump and acquiring a new fighter mission for Michigan’s Selfridge Air National Guard base in Harrison Township.
“If [Whitmer] can be attacked by Democrats [for not] being hard enough on Trump, I won’t let it bother me,” he said.

Republicans have called for the U.S. Department of Justice to monitor the November election given that Benson is on the ballot and her office controls the state’s elections, as the GOP has ginned up unfounded worries that she might meddle with the results. Benson has scoffed at the assertion, noting Michigan’s decentralized election system where ballots are counted by local clerks.
Duggan said he was confident that city, township and county clerks would do their jobs well and accurately count the votes.
A hot topic of late has been the numerous AI data center projects that have been cropping up across the state and Whitmer’s embrace of those projects. Residents from all walks of life have by and large opposed the facilities, their environmental impacts, land-use issues, and electrical power problems that have the potential to drive up rates.
Duggan noted that the issue is emblematic of the deep divide he sees between how Democratic and Republican politicians view the issue versus the people of the state.
“We have to build data centers to be competitive on the jobs of the future, but there needs to be a single statewide standard with leadership that says there will be no electrical rate increase on the existing residents, that the data warehouse will be guaranteed to pay those rates,” Duggan said. “There can’t be water being taken out of the water system and taken back. There’s got to be a closed loop system to protect the environment, and the local community has to have a say in it. You can’t override their objections. We should have a clear standard in this state that says this is how it works.”

It is an election day.
Sanchez, a Democratic member of the city’s Common Council, and Republican Jamie Vaughan are on the ballot in a special election for the 25th House District. 
They have competed with the weather, darkness that falls before 5 o’clock, and the distractions of holidays as much as they have against each other.
The off-cycle early-winter election is one of two this month for vacant seats in the state House of Representatives, each in districts that favor Democrats —overwhelmingly so in the 25th. The best showing by a Republican in the district over the past decade was 29.9% of the vote in 2024.
On the other side of Connecticut, voters go to the polls Jan. 13 in the 139th House District of Ledyard, Montville and Norwich. Republicans have been more competitive there, winning 47% of the vote in the midterm elections of 2018 and 2022.
Campaigns for special elections are sprints, condensing what typically occurs over the better part of a year into no more than 56 days. State law requires the governor to issue a writ of special election within 10 days of a vacancy, with the election to follow exactly 46 days later.

“I’ve got eight weeks to hammer out 10 months” of campaigning, said Vaughan, the Republican nominee in 2024. 
The tools employed in a special election are those found in any local or state election: door-to-door campaigning, direct mail, text messages, digital ads and social media. Vaughan also has spent $2,669 for billboards, his name and face looming over Route 9.
“It’s everything you would do normally — except on a condensed time frame,” said Mike Farina, a Democratic campaign consultant.
Sanchez and Vaughan each opened campaigns right before Thanksgiving after Bobby Sanchez, also a Democrat, resigned from the General Assembly to begin a two-year term as New Britain’s new mayor. He, too, first won the legislative seat in a special election in January 2011.
There have been no debates.
In the 139th, Democrat Larry Pemberton and Republican Brandon Sabbag are competing for the vacancy left by the death of Rep. Kevin Ryan, D-Montville, on Nov. 23. A third candidate, Mark Adams of Norwich, is suing to get on the ballot as an Independent Party nominee.
Vaughan and Sanchez are evenly matched on finances: Both are relying on public financing that provided grants of slightly more than $27,000. But Democrats outnumber Republican by more than a 3-1 margin in New Britain, and Vaughan said split is closer to 5-1 in the 25th.
Sanchez, 50, who moved to New Britain from Puerto Rico in 1994, has other advantages. The 25th House District is 56% Latino, and she had been elected five times to the council, most recently in November.
On Saturday afternoon, she campaigned door to door near Willow Park, where a housing project stood when she first came to the city. She encountered two men on the sidewalk, reminding them in Spanish of the election. Both promised to vote. She said her pitch at the doors is simple.
“I just won election as a councilwoman, my fifth, And I’m introducing myself again, saying that I’m running for state rep,” Sanchez said. “And I always tell people, anyone that needs a ride to let to let me know.”
Early voting was light: 72 Democrats, 26 Republicans, 20 unaffiliated voters and three registered Independents had cast in-person, early-voting ballots. Another 22 Democrats, six Republicans and seven unaffiliated had cast absentee ballots.
Turnouts in special elections tend to be low, drawing mainly the voters who also turn out for municipal elections. 
Vaughan, 51, a graphic artist who has lived in New Britain his entire life, other than a stint in the Marines, said he greeted volunteers Saturday morning with donuts, coffee and door-knocking assignments in a borrowed conference room.
The volunteers included Rep. Joe Polletta, R-Watertown, and Rep. Nicole Klarides-Ditria, R-Seymour. He was grateful for the help from the lawmakers and state party, but he wished the GOP was able to do more.
Republicans were not lining up to run after Bobby Sanchez won the open mayoral office, succeeding Republican Erin Stewart, one of the two declared Republican candidates for governor.
“I was like, ‘Yeah, you know what? Let me jump back in.’ We didn’t have anybody to really run in the district,” Vaughan said. “We need a voice.”
On Saturday, rather than go door-to-door, Vaughan drove to the homes of Republican voters who have turned out in part elections. 
At one stop, he ducked beneath the branches of the overgrown evergreens on either side of an unshoveled sidewalk leading to the home of an 81-year-old widow, a Republican who contributed $50 to his campaign in 2024.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A new political party hopes to gather enough signatures to appear on this year’s ballot.
The Sooner State Party must gather 35,000 signatures by Feb. 20 to become a recognized political party, said co-founder C.J. Webber-Neal.
Webber-Neal said supporters have gathered 22,000 signatures.
The Sooner State Party formed in July and has about 45 members, he said. If approved, the party plans to open its primaries to independent voters for every election, he said.
Currently, independent voters are barred from participating in all state’s partisan primary elections after the State Election Board last year determined no party submitted the proper paperwork to open its primaries.
State law presumes partisan primaries are closed to unaffiliated voters unless a political party notifies the state Election Board within a specific time frame that it will open them to independents, who are not a recognized political party. 
Democrats had previously opened primaries to independents, while Republicans and Libertarians had not.
Webber-Neal said when news broke that independents couldn’t vote in any partisan primary, the group received so much website traffic that it crashed their site.

Webber-Neal said the Sooner State Party is more aligned with independents than Democrats, Republicans or Libertarians. 
Webber-Neal said the Sooner State Party supports tribal sovereignty and abortion rights.
It also supports the Second Amendment and responsible gun ownership, he said.
The “party is not trying to go to the extreme and putting a bunch of bans on weapons, because that is an infringement,” Webber-Neal said. “But we do believe in responsibility. We do believe that if you take the responsibility to purchase a firearm, you should also take the responsibility to be able to know how to use that firearm.”
The party does support some of the state’s recent tax cuts, but believes reform is needed, he said.
The group also supports increasing the minimum wage to make it livable, he said.
The party does not yet have an official position on LGBTQ+ rights, but has formed an affiliated caucus to create one.
Generally speaking, the Sooner State Party does support LGBTQ+ rights, he said.
The Libertarian Party was the last to gain access to the ballot in 2016 and has retained that access, said Misha Mohr, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Election Board.
“There have been a number of groups that have attempted to get on the ballot over the years,” she said.  
Oklahoma law allows the formation of new political parties if supporters can collect signatures from at least 3% of the registered voters who cast ballots during the previous gubernatorial election.
In order to continue to exist, a political party then must have a candidate receive at least 2.5% of total votes for a statewide elected office in one of the two preceding general elections, according to state law.

“This partnership creates an incredible outdoor laboratory for hands-on learning,” said Buena Vista University President Brian Lenzmeier during an event celebrating the new partnership in the fall. “The Boettcher family has stewarded this land with exceptional care across generations, and we are deeply grateful for their trust in BVU. By sharing this legacy with our students, they are helping shape meaningful educational experiences rooted in purpose, service, and stewardship.”
Programming at the center will start “as soon as spring weather permits,” said Buena Vista University Senior Director of Marketing and Communications Megan Ogren in an email.
Iris Boettcher, owner of the Boettcher family farm, also spoke during the event, according to the release, saying the partnership between her farm and Buena Vista University fits both with the work her family has done and the future of agriculture. The release stated the Boettcher family has “demonstrated a strong commitment to conservation and responsible land stewardship” over the years, focused on soil health, water quality and conservation.
The Boettcher family farm spans 160 acres, Ogren said in an email. It is enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program, a voluntary program run by the federal Farm Service Agency that promotes planting vegetative cover over “environmentally sensitive” land.
“This farm has been in our family for over 150 years, and I have worked to honor the land and my ancestors through sustainable care of the soil and river,” Iris Boettcher said in remarks at the event. “I am inspired by BVU’s mission to learn through experience, and I hope this partnership provides an experimental lab for faculty and students to design innovative, sustainable, and regenerative agricultural practices.”
Lenzmeier added in his remarks that the work of the family farm “reflects the history, values, and future of agriculture in Northwest Iowa,” and he hopes the partnership and center inspire future “agricultural leaders and environmental stewards.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A bill that would expand the state’s corporate tax incentive programs by billions and extend new tax subsidies to Newark’s Prudential Center was advanced by Assembly lawmakers Monday over the objections of critics.
The measure, which won 10-2 approval from the Assembly’s economic development committee, would pour an additional $2.5 billion into the state’s marquee tax incentive programs and extend up to $300 million in state subsidies for renovations at the Newark arena. Assembly members Dawn Fantasia (R-Sussex) and Alex Sauickie (R-Ocean) voted no.
“It’s at the point where it needs to have major renovations in order to not only make sure the only professional sports team that New Jersey has, which is the New Jersey Devils, can continue to play, but also so that they’re able to compete and bring in different spectators and bring in different shows,” bill sponsor Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex) said.
Tax incentives for the publicly owned Prudential Center’s redevelopment faced resistance.
Though some witnesses praised safeguards in the bill that would allow the state Economic Development Authority to rescind awards under certain circumstances and require firms receiving incentives to make some public disclosures, they questioned whether the project would actually bring benefits to New Jersey.
“Almost every independent and neutral assessment of sports arena subsidies is that they are a bad deal for public investment broadly speaking,” said Peter Chen, a senior policy analyst at progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. “They almost never pay back the promised revenues, and when looking at municipality or countywide revenues, they tend not to make any effect at all.”
The bill would require the Prudential Center’s renovation to generate economic activity equal to at least 150% of the tax incentives it receives. Because awards are capped at 80% of a project’s costs or $300 million, whichever is less, the requirement could mandate the Prudential Center generate $450 million in economic activity.
Jake Reynolds, president of the New Jersey Devils and the Prudential Center, told the panel the arena had more than $680 million in annual sales and generated $30 million in state tax revenue and $4.5 million in Newark taxes annually.
Reynolds argued that investment is needed to keep the arena in good repair and competitive with other stadiums in the region and country.
“With the age of the building and the 23 million visitors that have continued to come through the doors since the opening, along with the more than 3,000 events we have hosted there, it has taken a toll on the facility’s infrastructure,” Reynolds said. “The time has come for a full-scale renovation.”
Though New Jersey’s constitution bars the Legislature from passing special tax legislation — bills that single out localities for special treatment, positive or negative — language in the bill advanced Monday would guarantee that only the Prudential Center is eligible for the award.
To be eligible for incentives, a venue must seat at least 15,000 and have operated for at least 15 years in a city with an international airport in a non-coastal county with at least 550,000 residents and a density of not less than 3,000 people per square mile.
New Jersey has only two international airports, Newark Liberty International Airport and Atlantic City International Airport, and Atlantic County does not meet the population or geography requirements.

Separate provisions expanding funding for the Aspire program, which provides gap financing, and the Emerge Program, which provides per-job tax credits to boost job creation, drew some opposition from witnesses, both over their breadth and the timing of the bill’s movement.
Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of New Jersey Citizen Action, cautioned lawmakers against advancing the bill outside of budget negotiations, noting the state already plans to spend about $1.5 billion more than it brings in through taxes during the current July-to-June fiscal year.
Outlays could expand that deficit in the budget lawmakers are set to approve in June, and the loss of federal funding and programs could further strain New Jersey’s finances, Jaborska said.
“We are in for a very brutal budget. Our communities that we serve … are already dealing with the loss of so many supports and benefits and programs, so you are talking about taxpayer dollars going towards these wealthy corporations, 3 billion dollars’ worth, at a time when we’re going to have a hard time balancing our budget heading into next year,” she said.
Other witnesses hailed the $11.5 billion tax incentive programs as boons for the state’s economy and said they need more money because existing funding had been drawn down since lawmakers created them in late 2020.
“[Aspire] is really chugging along, and has quite a robust pipeline of projects. At the end of 2025, as a result of that, we have run out of tax credits,” said Tony Pizzutillo, a lobbyist for the New Jersey chapter of the National Association for Industrial and Office Parks, a commercial real estate advocacy group.

Another bill advanced Monday would require film production companies receiving tax credits from the state to only use domestically produced original music and scores in their work.
Industry representatives cautioned that the bill could make New Jersey film production less affordable. The American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada argued the requirement would ensure taxpayers see the benefits of their tax dollars, a view that found some support among lawmakers.
“Tax credits are supposed to create in-state and in-country jobs, strengthen regional economies, and generate returns for taxpayers. When productions outsource music recording abroad, that purpose is undermined,” Fantasia said.
Assemblyman Brian Bergen (R-Morris) voted no.
Because tax incentives affect state revenue, the bills would need to advance through the Assembly Appropriations Committee before reaching the chamber’s floor. Senate companions for both bills have yet to reach the floor in the upper chamber. The new legislative session begins on Jan. 13.

Patrick Morrisey wants to accelerate cuts to the state’s personal income tax, and he’ll ask lawmakers to get behind the idea during the upcoming legislative session.  “I wanted to make clear that one of our top priorities during the session will be tax cuts and tax simplification, and I think that’s important because West […]","Gov. Patrick Morrisey announces a tax relief package proposal that includes a cut to personal income taxes on Monday, Jan. 5, 2026 in Charleston, West Virginia. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Gov. Patrick Morrisey wants to accelerate cuts to the state’s personal income tax, and he’ll ask lawmakers to get behind the idea during the upcoming legislative session. 
“I wanted to make clear that one of our top priorities during the session will be tax cuts and tax simplification, and I think that’s important because West Virginians are still feeling the impact of inflation,” the governor said Monday during a press conference at the state Capitol.
The legislative session starts Jan. 14 in Charleston, West Virginia.
Under previous Gov. Jim Justice, the Legislature cut personal income taxes by about 27% in recent years through bills and a trigger-based reduction plan. 
The tax cut trigger formula — passed by lawmakers in 2023 — put a system in place where income tax cuts will be triggered gradually if the state meets revenue goals. It measures general revenue collections in a fiscal year compared to 2019. If collections are ahead of that year, it activates the trigger for a tax cut.
West Virginia didn’t meet the revenue goal in this past fiscal year to trigger the tax reduction, so Morrisey said he’ll work with lawmakers to move forward with a cut. In the past, some Republicans in the Legislature have been hesitant to cut taxes without hitting the trigger.  
Morrisey’s goal is at least a 5 to 10% personal income tax reduction.
“I’ve had conversations with the House and Senate leadership, and I’ve expressed my interest in working closely with them on getting something that passes,” he said.
Personal income tax is West Virginia’s largest source of state revenue.
Morrisey said he believed the state could “deliver meaningful tax relief without sacrificing essential services” due to his administration’s work on agency budgets and cutting what he called inefficient spending. 
His administration has already asked state agencies to cut their budgets by 2% 
“I think we’re in a position to deliver real tax relief that strengthens families, supports our businesses and really continues to position West Virginia well in this backyard brawl effort,” Morrisey said, noting that Kentucky and Ohio have cut their income tax rates.
Kelly Allen, executive director at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the governor’s proposed tax cut was “a surprising development” after the state didn’t hit the tax cut trigger. 
“This is saying we can actually jump out ahead of the triggers and enact deeper income tax cuts as his own six year financial plan says we’re facing hundreds of millions of dollars in budget deficits in upcoming years,” she said.
Allen estimated that a 5 to 10% income tax cut would result in a $1 a week more for West Virginians. 
“We’ve had years of tax cuts that have not brought promised growth, but instead have caused austerity and cuts to public schools, infrastructure and child care. Greater investments in those amenities and services are all things that would move the needle more on affordability for everyday West Virginians and strengthen our overall economy,” she said.
The state’s general revenue collections are about 5% above estimate — $128 million more than estimated, the governor said. The number has been driven by personal income tax strength and consumer sales tax collections.
“We had a good close to 2025 and our fiscal projections are significantly above where we thought they would be,” Morrisey said. “This is very positive news, (and) I think, a direct result of so much of the hard work that our administration has put in over time.”
Morrisey also wants to expand the state’s tourism development tax credit with the goal of increasing lodging to support the state’s growing tourism industry. 
State Treasurer Larry Pack has urged lawmakers to eliminate state income tax on overtime and tips. President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” included provisions for no taxes on tips and overtime effective through Dec. 31, 2028.
“President Trump championed a policy at the federal level that would allow workers to deduct overtime and qualified tips from their federal tax return,” Pack said in a news release in November.

On December 30, US Health and Human Services deputy secretary Jim O’Neill announced the Administration for Children and Families froze all payments to Minnesota and that payments throughout the US would require “justification and a receipt or photo evidence” before funds are sent to states.
The changes are meant to address “the blatant fraud that appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country,” O’Neill said in a December 30 post on X.
“Funds will be released only when states prove they are being spent legitimately,” he said in the post.
Massachusetts officials have not received any new guidance from the Administration for Children and Families related to Child Care Financial Assistance funds, Early Education and Care Commissioner Amy Kershaw said Monday during an appearance on “The 9:30 Call,” a virtual call hosted by Strategies for Children that gathers early childhood and care system stakeholders. The Bay State is also not facing any disruptions in payments to Child Care Financial Assistance, which helps low-income families pay for child care.
“Obviously we are incredibly concerned about families across the country and in Minnesota who may lose access to Child Care Financial Assistance based on acts by the federal government,” Kershaw said.
The state appropriates funds for the Child Care Financial Assistance program, which the Department of Early Education and Care manages, at the beginning of the fiscal year. Then the state seeks reimbursement from the federal government. Kershaw noted funds have already been appropriated for fiscal 2026, which ends June 30.
The federal announcement came after a video surfaced on YouTube alleging fraud in child care in Somali communities in Minnesota. Kershaw said none of those allegations have been proven. She also said there have been similar videos posted in Massachusetts and other states like Ohio, California and Washington.
“Intrepid journalists have made shocking and credible allegations of extensive fraud in Minnesota’s child care programs,” O’Neill said in a YouTube video posted on December 31. “We believe the state of Minnesota has allowed scammers and fake day cares to siphon millions of taxpayer dollars over the past decade.”
O’Neill said he has sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz demanding a “full 360 review” of child care centers including attendance records, licenses, complaints, investigations and inspections. The Administration for Children and Families also launched a dedicated fraud reporting hotline and email address, Alex Adams, assistant secretary of the agency, said in the video.
A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said the federal “Defend the Spend” initiative applies to all states. The initiative, launched last year through the Department of Government Efficiency, has been expanded to include ACF payments, according to a December 30 post on X from user “DOGE_HHS” and reposted by DOGE. Since March 2025, the initiative only applied to HHS discretionary payments.
Over the coming days, the system will expand to “support itemized receipts and photographic evidence, and make all data/receipts, where possible, available to the public,” the agency said in the post.
Funding for Massachusetts Child Care Financial Assistance totals about $1.087 billion for fiscal 2026, according to a December report from the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. In fiscal year 2025, the program covered more than 66,000 children. The state covers most of the costs and in recent years, funds from a statewide income surtax instituted in 2023 have gone toward the program. In fiscal 2026, federal funds accounted for more than $293 million of the program, according to the state.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/daycare1-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 16:57:50.761121

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislative Democrats want state government to do more to help Indiana families deal with rising costs.
House and Senate Democrats announced Monday proposals for repealing the state’s 7% sales tax on residential utility bills and increasing state funding for child care programs.
Democratic leaders said families are facing a “cost-of-living crisis” and that they would push for the Republican-dominated Legislature to provide relief for the growing expenses for utilities, medical care, housing and child care.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, declared during a speech as legislators returned to the Statehouse for their two-month 2026 session that “Hoosiers are getting nickeled and dimed to death.”
“Our public policy this session should not insult Hoosiers by suggesting that their household budget outlook is their fault,” GiaQuinta said. “If our agenda is rejected this session, you’re suggesting that Hoosiers would be able to achieve their American dream if only they had pinched pennies a little better.”
Democrats targeted the Braun administration’s actions to not enroll any more children into the program for taxpayer-funded child care until at least 2027 and slash the payment rates to day care centers.
They argue the state has enough money to end the waitlist of some 30,000 children for the low-income program and that Indiana’s economy is being hurt because parents can’t join the workforce.
Their push for additional child care funding comes after new projections show that the state’s cash reserves could grow to nearly $5 billion by the middle of 2027 — more than double what was anticipated when the new state budget took effect in July.
But legislative Republicans are also considering whether to go along with tax cuts that President Donald Trump pushed through Congress last year in what was dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” 
An analysis from Braun’s administration estimates that total state tax breaks on businesses and individuals could top $900 million over the next two years if the Legislature were to conform state tax law with all the federal changes.
Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, said the state has the resources to help residents facing a financial squeeze.
“We can get this done,” Yoder said during a news conference. “We can come together and really have a conversation of what is the biggest return on our investment, and we will see those specifically in child care investments, pre-K funding.”
Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, said many day care centers around Indiana are facing closure because tightened state funding, which she argued would compound the state’s child care shortage.
“This should be an issue we can work together on,” Hamilton said. “That’s critical infrastructure that helps our employers, that helps our families.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AE5FE72B-3917-41CC-8A6C-850A451EFF5D_1_201_a-1024x620.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 16:57:50.761121

(Provided by the S.C. DOT)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster is asking legislators to spend an additional $1.1 billion on road projects to keep up with inflation costs, he announced Monday in a preview of his total budget recommendations.
That’s nearly as much as legislators have spent on roads and bridges in the past four years combined, according to the announcement.
Construction costs have surged nationally in recent years, and repairs and improvements to roads and bridges weren’t spared. The problem is especially acute in places like South Carolina, where fast-growing populations mean more traffic and wear-and-tear on existing roads, according to a news release from the governor’s office.
McMaster’s full budget suggestions are expected next week, when the Legislature returns to Columbia for the 2026 session.
Revenue estimates updated in November provided the Legislature nearly $2.5 billion in additional money to spend in the fiscal year starting July 1. That breaks down to $1.7 billion in unspent reserves and above-expectation tax collections so far this year — meant for one-time expenses — and $734 million from continued economic growth available for ongoing expenses, according to the state Board of Economic Advisors.
McMaster’s request would consume more than 60% of the one-time money — what’s considered budget surplus. And with proposed reductions to the state income tax potentially decreasing revenue collections in the coming years, McMaster says it’s important that legislators dedicate a huge chunk of that existing surplus toward fixing the roads.
“Our population is skyrocketing, and inflation is driving up construction costs, creating potential delays,” McMaster said in a statement. “We can’t make more time, but we can use this new surplus money to keep road projects moving and on schedule.”
Revenue hasn’t kept up with the cost of inflation, Secretary of Transportation Justin Powell wrote in a December letter to the governor.
Stuck in traffic? SCDOT has a new plan. And a price tag.

To illustrate his point, Powell pointed to the 28-cent gas tax every driver has paid per gallon since 2022, the completion of a six-year phase-in.
In 2017, when the Legislature passed a law that gradually increased the per-gallon tax by 12 cents, one penny per person per gallon could pay to pave 114 miles of two-lane highway. In 2025, it could pave 87 miles, Powell wrote.
Of the approximately $1.1 billion, $600 million would help pay for ongoing interstate projects with increased price tags, $400 million would help fund repairs to the state’s aging system of bridges, and $150 million would allow new projects to move ahead, Powell wrote.
Without the money, projects already underway could take years longer than anticipated, Powell wrote. The longer a project takes, the more expensive it becomes, he added.
“As SCDOT has seen, these delays only lead to additional cost increases, a vicious cycle that is challenging departments across the nation as they work to deliver critical infrastructure,” Powell wrote.
That includes two interstate widening projects: One would complete the widening of I-26 between Columbia and Charleston to three lanes each way. The other would widen the first 10 miles of I-95 from the Georgia border to U.S. Highway 278 in Jasper County. The cost of both projects has spiked since 2022, with the 70-mile I-26 project surging from just over $2 billion to $3 billion and the I-95 project going from $977 million to nearly $2.3 billion, according to Powell’s letter.
Another major interstate project, Columbia’s Carolina Crossroads, saw a significant increase as well, from $2.1 billion in 2022 to $2.8 billion by the end of 2025, Powell wrote. The project is expected to fix the notorious snarl of interstate ramps more commonly called Malfunction Junction.
Along with funding ongoing improvements, the money could help get two new projects off the ground, Powell wrote.
The agency plans to eventually widen Interstate 85 between Anderson and Oconee counties and Interstate 77 in York and Chester counties. With $75 million, the agency could begin pre-construction design work, making it easier to apply for grants that could allow construction to begin sooner than the anticipated earliest start date of 2035, Powell wrote.
Another $75 million could pay for a study on how to improve parts of interstates 26, 85 and 77 near Charlotte, also moving up the start date from 2035 at the earliest, Powell wrote.
On the North Carolina side of the border, transportation officials are working to upgrade 11 miles of highway, including adding express lanes and reconstructing interchanges and bridges, in an effort to reduce congestion, according to the North Carolina Department of Transportation.
The rest of the money would go toward repairing and replacing bridges.
Three years ago, then-DOT Secretary Christy Hall asked legislators for a $1 billion commitment for bridgework over five years. But legislators declined to include any additional money for bridges in their final 2023-24 budget package. Then the emergency closure of Interstate 20 days before Christmas in 2023 highlighted the need.
Last summer, the Legislature approved a second installment of $200 million for bridgework. Weeks after the budget took effect, a large chunk of a weight-restricted bridge in Pickens County collapsed. It is expected to reopen next month.
Of the state’s 8,450 bridges, more than 2,800 are more than 60 years old, which is when many need repairs or replacement, according to Powell’s letter. Around 80 bridges were closed as of Dec. 4, when Powell sent his letter, he wrote.
The $400 million designated for bridgework over the last two years added to the $239 million the agency already spent annually, allowing the addition of 278 bridges to its list for imminent repairs.
In its budget request, submitted last September, the agency sought $300 million — rather than $200 million — for the third bridgework installment.
McMaster’s office uses agencies’ requests to craft the governor’s recommendations.
In an attempt to save some money on future repairs, the department’s request also asks legislators for $25 million to transfer state-owned roads to local cities and counties, reducing the number of miles the state must manage.
South Carolina has the fourth-largest state highway system in the country, despite ranking 23rd in population, according to the Department of Transportation. Moving smaller roads to local ownership would free up staffing and money the department could dedicate to interstates and major highways, according to the agency’s budget request.
Similar “road buyback” proposals have been unsuccessful, with local governments unwilling to take on the financial responsibility.  The DOT is asking the Legislature for the authority to negotiate with local governments on payments for such transfers. Lawmakers would then have to approve the list.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BeamMoving2-1024x573.jpg,,,2026-01-05 16:57:50.761121

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)With the 2026 legislative session set to start in a week, Iowa House Democrats introduced their plan Monday to tackle one of the biggest issues heading into the year — how to lower Iowans’ property taxes.
Republican leaders, including Gov. Kim Reynolds, have said changes to Iowa’s property tax system are at the top of the list for issues lawmakers will consider as they reconvene next week. Reynolds and members of the Republican trifecta at the state Capitol have spent the past few months meeting with local government officials and community leaders as they work through ways to lower property tax burdens for Iowans.
While there is not a clear consensus from Republicans on what property tax legislation they will introduce, House Democratic leaders unveiled their proposal at a news conference Monday.
Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the proposal involves four components: freezing property taxes for people age 65 and older, tripling the Homestead Tax Credit, limiting property tax growth to 4% annually and providing state support for public safety workers’ retirement funds. Jacoby said while transitioning to this new system, the measure would provide two years of “immediate relief” through rebates of $1,000 for homeowners and $500 for renters.
By limiting property tax growth each year, the Democrats’ plan would provide “certainty” to both taxpayers and the local government entities that rely on these taxes, like schools, cities and counties.
“Our plan offers effectiveness — a word that you’ll hear often this year from House Democrats,” Jacoby said. “And, hopefully in a bipartisan way with Republicans, we want a policy that’s effective. Our plan will work, and Iowans will feel the effects immediately.”
In addition to the rebates, Jacoby said the proposal would offer immediate savings for Iowans through an increased Homestead Tax Credit. The credit for qualified homeowners is based on a portion of the homestead’s actual value. The plan would increase the tax credit from an average of $200 to $300 per household to $500 to $600 per household.
Other parts of the plan, he said, like limiting property tax growth, will provide more long-term cost savings for Iowans by ensuring that each year, costs can only rise a certain amount. Under the 4% growth cap, each $1,000 of property tax costs could grow to a maximum of $1,040 the next year, he said.
Freezing property taxes for seniors — “not by means, not by formula, simply by age,” Jacoby said — will also give older Iowans more assurance that they can afford to remain in their homes.
“Many seniors would like to stay in their home,” Jacoby said. “Many people would like to move, but they can’t afford the property tax liability if they move up. This way, it offers certainty that we will also open up the housing stock in Iowa.”
Jacoby said the exact costs of some parts of the plan, such as the rebates and senior tax freeze, were still being discussed with requests out to the Legislative Services Agency, Iowa League of Cities and the state Association of Counties for estimates. However, he said he expected some funding for the rebates to come from the Iowa Taxpayer Relief Fund.
Some components of this proposal were also introduced by House Democrats as legislation in the 2025 session, which did not receive a subcommittee hearing.
The property tax measure discussed most last year was Republican leaders’ plan to eliminate Iowa’s “rollback” system of calculating property taxes and make other changes to limit tax growth. Jacoby said he believes Republicans’ proposal is to “eliminate rollback and somehow make up for it — but that is economically impossible.” He also criticized the idea of limiting property valuations, which he said was a “dangerous path” to start on.
Jacoby said he has spoken with Republicans, including the new House Majority Leader Bobby Kaufmann, about how to approach the subject of property taxes from a bipartisan perspective.
“We’ve seen over the years that the things that have been done from the Statehouse have been totally ineffective, and in fact, they’ve hurt more,” he said. “I will say this, we do have positive relationships with people across the aisle … that are very interested in an effective plan.”

The overhaul is effective immediately, meaning that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend vaccines against 11 diseases. What’s no longer broadly recommended is protection against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis or RSV. Instead, protections against those diseases are only recommended for certain groups deemed high-risk, or if their doctors recommend them in what’s called “shared decision-making.”
Trump administration officials said the overhaul, a move long sought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., won’t result in families who want the vaccines losing access to them, and said insurance will continue to pay. But medical experts said the move increases confusion for parents and could increase preventable diseases.
The change came after President Donald Trump in December asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising its guidance to align with theirs.
HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an “outlier” in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.
Among those left on the recommended-for-everyone list are measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, chickenpox and HPV.
“This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Kennedy said in a statement Monday.
Medical experts disagreed, saying the change without public discussion or a transparent review of the data would put children at risk.
Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said countries carefully consider vaccine recommendations based on levels of disease in their populations and their health systems.
“You can’t just copy and paste public health and that’s what they seem to be doing here,” said O’Leary. “Literally children’s health and children’s lives are at stake.”
The new guidance also reduces the number of recommended vaccine doses against human papillomavirus from two or three shots to one for most children, depending on age.
The decision was made without input from an advisory committee that typically consults on the vaccine schedule, said senior officials at HHS. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the changes publicly.
“Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,” said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25358718659191-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 16:57:50.761121

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Trump administration is sending another 2,000 agents and officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations, according to a CBS News report.
The deployment, which is said to have begun Sunday, would make Minnesota and specifically Minneapolis the focal point of President Donald Trump’s nationwide effort to deport millions of immigrants. The CBS report quotes an unnamed former law enforcement official who notes that “the number of HSI agents being sent to Minneapolis is roughly equivalent to the entire HSI workforce assigned to the state of Arizona ” — underscoring the administration’s intense emphasis.
Protestors squared off with federal officers — and sometimes local police — at raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul in 2025. Law enforcement officers have used crowd dispersal tactics like pepper spray, tear gas, rubber bullets and sound cannons.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota and three Minnesota-based law firms recently sued federal immigration authorities, alleging that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and their leaders are routinely violating the constitutional rights of the people protesting their actions.
The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE as the agency ramped up raids in Minnesota, especially in the state’s large Somali community, as part of a targeted operation ordered by the Trump administration.
Both Minneapolis and St. Paul are sanctuary cities, meaning their local police do not question residents’ immigration status or enforce immigration law, which is a federal responsibility. But both police departments have helped immigration authorities control the large crowds of protesters that have convened outside of raids.

Trump late last year directed immigration authorities to reexamine the green cards — granted to people with legal permanent residency — of people from “countries of concern,” including Somalia.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FirstFile_011-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 16:12:16.268968

Previously the age cutoff was 26. (Getty image) One of Rhode Island General Treasurer James Diossa’s resolutions for 2026 is to create 1,000 active savings accounts for residents with disabilities without jeopardizing their federal benefits.
That goal may become reality now that Rhode Islanders whose disabilities began before age 46 are eligible to open accounts under the state’s Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) program.
Created under the Obama administration in 2014, ABLE accounts allow Social Security beneficiaries to save money for future qualifying needs, such as housing, education, transportation, health, prevention and wellness, employment training and support, assistive technology and personal support services. Earnings grow tax-deferred and withdrawals are tax-free when used for qualified expenses.
Accounts are owned by the beneficiary, but managed by the Pennsylvania-based financial service company Ascensus. Their management is overseen by the Rhode Island Office of General Treasurer.


Looking to learn more on ABLE accounts? 
General Treasurer James Diossa will take part in a virtual seminar hosted by the Paul V. Sherlock Center on Disabilities at Rhode Island College at noon on Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026


Before the start of 2026, ABLE accounts were limited to people who had a qualifying medical condition that began before their 26th birthday. The change to allow people up through the age of 46 was approved through the federal ABLE Age Adjustment Act, which was signed into law in 2022.
“Treasury is committed to helping people with disabilities build lasting financial security,” Diossa said in a statement. “Thanks to the federal expansion of ABLE eligibility, more Rhode Islanders can save for everyday needs and long-term goals without risking essential benefits.”
Kevin Nerney, executive director for the Rhode Island Developmental Disabilities Council, welcomed the age increase now taking effect.
He said he hopes that the expansion will entice more Rhode Islanders with disabilities to start saving. Diossa’s office noted 777 active ABLE accounts in mid-December. 
“We want people to be able to save money and do the things they want to do in their lives,” Nerney said.
The treasurer’s office did not have any projections on how many more accounts may open statewide. Grace Voll, a spokesperson for Diossa’s office, said the treasurer hopes to see 1,000 active accounts by the end of the year.
The National Disability Institute estimated around 6.1 million more Americans would be eligible across the country under the program’s recent expansion.
Beneficiaries can contribute up to $20,000 a year into an ABLE account in 2026. Total assets in an account can reach $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income benefits. 
“But $100,000 with proper investment, might pay more than what your SSI is,” Nerney noted.
Even small contributions can go a long way, he added.
“For some people, a little as $100 a month could have a significant impact on their quality of life — even if it’s just to use an Uber to see their friend every week,” Nerney said.

Miller  Credit: Mississippi University for Women
Nora Miller will retire on June 30 after more than seven years as president of the Mississippi University for Women. 
In an announcement on Monday, Miller noted her ties to the university, also known as The W, which includes her time as a student there in the 1980s. 
“This is a deeply personal decision, made with gratitude and pride,” Miller said in a news release. “The W has shaped my life in profound ways — as a student, as an administrator and for the past seven and a half years as its president.”
The Board of Trustees for the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning will guide the leadership transition process for the Columbus university.
Before becoming the W’s 15th president, Miller served as the university’s chief financial officer, senior vice president for administration as well as vice president for administration. July will mark her 25th year at the W, where she also received her bachelor’s in accounting.
Under Miller’s leadership, the W increased enrollment by over 2,000 students in 2025 and fended off a merger with Mississippi State University. MUW’s nursing program posted the highest pass rate for nursing programs in the state at 99.36% last year.
Miller has spent a majority of her career in public service, working as supervising senior auditor at the state auditor’s office and as the director of budget and financial analysis and the director of internal audit at IHL. 
When the State Board of Education was considering moving the Mississippi School for Math and Science off the campus of the W, Miller spoke out against it. She has also worked to make the university more affordable for Mississippi students. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she moved 75% of classes online and opened up 31 spaces for quarantine on campus in 2020.
“I am proud of the momentum we have built and confident in the university’s future,” Miller said in a statement. “There is important work ahead, and I look forward to continuing that work together in the months to come.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/06042841/3X0A3465-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-05 16:12:16.268968

(Photo via Getty Images)Proposed legislation from a state agency would give the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission the authority to take action against unlicensed gambling sites.
State officials said if passed, the bill would give the commission authority to issue cease and desist orders to the “bad actors” that scam Iowans for information, money or run unregulated, offshore markets. The bill has been filed by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing in advance of the 2026 legislative session, which begins Jan. 12.
Tina Eick, the gaming commission’s administrator, said under current law, the commission does not have the “clear authority” to take action against anyone other than the casinos and sports books that it currently licenses. 
“When Iowans gamble on unlicensed platforms, they’re putting their money and their personal information at serious risk,” Eick said. “So we’re trying to be proactive here.”

According to the latest report from the American Gaming Association, Americans wager more than $673 billion annually in illegal and unregulated gambling markets. The illegal market, according to the report, has grown 22% since 2022. The association attributes the increase to the rise in iGaming, or online gambling, illegal sports betting and unregulated skill games, or unofficial slot-like machines. 
Unlicensed vendors also skirt state taxes. According to the association’s report, the illegal market leads to an estimated loss of $15.3 billion, annually, in state gaming tax revenue.
What does illegal gambling look like? 
Eick said the state encounters three main types of illegal gambling. 
The first kind are companies that spoof or pretend to be a legitimate business to try and steal information. Eick said these bad actors will usually have a website address that looks just slightly off from the casino or legitimate business they are trying to impersonate. 
Online casino gambling is not legal in Iowa, so Eick said if a local casino is reaching out and advertising online games, “that’s a fake.” 
The second kind of bad actor is an online casino operator advertising sweepstakes that offer a cashout in cryptocurrencies. Eick said the commission receives complaints about these companies because when people go to cash out their winnings, they are unable to receive the money. 
Offshore sports betting companies also pose a problem in Iowa, Eick said. These companies are not licensed in Iowa and therefore do not have to follow the same rules that licensed operators have to follow. Eick said this means the offshore companies offer wagers on “things that aren’t legal in Iowa” and raise “integrity concerns.” 
By contrast, Eick said the licensed market is regulated by the commission for the benefit of the state and for the people who participate in the games. 
“We have a strong regulatory system that ensures the games are fair,” Eick said. “We hold those operators accountable – their information and their funds are secure, and then they have responsible gaming, self exclusion programs in place, and then we tax them. They pay their fair share of taxes to Iowa.” 
The bill allows the commission to issue cease and desist orders and obtain injunctive relief on parties offering these unlicensed types of gambling.
Under current law, she said the only thing the commission can really say is “buyer beware” and encourage Iowans to check the websites they are on before entering personal and financial information. 
Eick said the commission regularly hears complaints from Iowans who have been scammed by these types of illegal gambling operations, which is why the commission wants to find a solution. 
“The bottom line is, illegal gaming undermines the public trust and puts Iowans at risk,” Eick said. 
Prediction markets still an unknown factor 
Eick hopes the bill could “clean up” some of the simple exploitations happening in the gambling market, but there are some newer types of online gambling that will be more difficult to control. 
One of those is sports prediction markets, which allow users to trade contracts based on the future result of real-world events. For example, rather betting on whether the Cyclones will beat the Hawkeyes, users can bet on whether or not the Cyclones will win. The same type of predictive markets have existed in the past in topics such as politics, but predictive markets have recently become more popular in sports betting. 
In late December, the sports betting app FanDuel, launched its own prediction market platform. Kalshi and Crypto.com were early adopters of the model, and are regulated by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which allows the trading to occur without state licensing. 
Lawsuits around the model have cropped up in several states, and attorneys general from 38 states, including Iowa’s Brenna Bird, signed a friend of the court brief in a case between Kalshi and Maryland’s Lottery and Gaming Control Commission, arguing the prediction market model “threatens the States’ longstanding ability to protect their citizens.” 
Eick said the questions the commission has on prediction markets have “some overlap” with the questions it has on the “clearly illegal” gaming markets.

“It lacks some of the consumer protections that we see in the regulated gaming industry that we currently have in Iowa,” Eick said.
Eick said the prefiled bill is not meant to regulate predictions markets in Iowa, because that issue is “more complex.” 
Eick said she’s not sure the legislation will get passed, but at the very least, the bill is a “conversation starter” to find solutions that will keep Iowans safe when they gamble. 
“For the integrity of the industry, and so that Iowans don’t lose faith in the regulated and secure market, we need to do something about these other markets,” Eick said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)T.S. Eliot claimed “April is the cruelest month.” Obviously he wasn’t an administrator in South Dakota’s public education system.
For anyone concerned about school funding in South Dakota, December is the cruelest month. That’s when they find out what sort of increase, if any, education will receive in the governor’s budget.
Once they digest that news, the rest of the month can be spent worrying about what sort of bright ideas lawmakers will present in the January legislative session about changing the school funding formula or the exciting new ways that the school system can be used to right the wrongs of society.
Governor aims tax credit at private schools
For public schools this year, November wasn’t all that great a month, either. That’s when Gov. Larry Rhoden announced that the state was signing on to the education tax credit program that was part of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.” For some reason the governor was eager to join the program, even though the fine print on the tax credit won’t be ready until 2027.
While the $1,700 tax credit can be used for public school programs, that clearly wasn’t Rhoden’s target audience when he made the announcement. “I’d just as soon give those dollars to a private school than Uncle Sam,” Rhoden said in a South Dakota Searchlight story. “I think they know how to spend it a little wiser than the federal government.”
Maybe the governor’s enthusiasm for a tax credit that doesn’t exist yet is based on the fact that more families in South Dakota are choosing private schools or home schooling. Alternative education in this state has increased 216% since 2015.
No increase for education in governor’s budget
Dec. 2 was a dark day for education, state workers and health care as the “big three” found out that Rhoden’s budget didn’t include a funding increase for any of them.
The governor blamed flat sales tax revenues for the lack of a funding increase. Those who advocate for education and health care point to the fact that not keeping up with inflation will actually serve as a funding cut as they must choose how to make due with flat funding while expenses continue to go up.
This is a curious political tactic for Rhoden. He was the last to enter the race for the Republican nomination, and now one of his first acts as a candidate is presenting a budget that’s sure to be upsetting for many South Dakotans.
Property taxes in the legislative crosshairs
When the Legislature convenes next week to start considering Rhoden’s budget — January is perhaps public education’s second cruelest month — one of the top assignments will be finding a way to relieve the pressure on property taxpayers. Along with state funding, property taxes are a main source of public school funding.
A summer task force assigned to find ways to cut property taxes concluded its work with 19 recommendations. Some of the ideas that didn’t get the endorsement of the task force will also likely end up in bills for the Legislature to consider.
In just about every legislative session, public schools find their funding the target of some legislator who hasn’t been in a classroom for 30 years but thinks he knows what’s best for education. As a special treat, this year public schools will face an entire legislative session where a major source of their funding is subject to the whims of legislators.
As the governor and lawmakers champion the needs of alternative education and prioritize the complaints of property taxpayers, they run the risk of losing track of the importance of public education. With a long state history of making funding for public education a priority, the current mood runs the risk of giving more significance to other matters. That would be a mistake. Public education should be among the state’s highest priorities, not just a political football to get tossed around every December and January.

Trump vetoes Miccosukee flood protection, citing tribe’s opposition to ‘Alligator Alcatraz’

In a statement to the Phoenix, the tribe wrote that it has “long supported President Trump’s commitment to Everglades restoration for the benefit of America’s public lands.”
“The Tribe has a constitutional duty to protect and defend the Everglades ecosystem, our traditional homelands. We never sought to obstruct the President’s immigration agenda. Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments,” Chairman Talbert Cypress wrote.
He added that the tribe was “disappointed to learn that the White House vetoed a measure intended to mitigate restoration impacts on a Tribal village.”
The bill, HR 504, called upon the Secretary of the Interior and the tribe “to take appropriate actions to safeguard structures within the Osceola Camp from flooding events.”


The Osceola Camp in the Everglades is a residential area for the Miccosukee tribe but not part of its federally reserved area. The tribe says the camp “faces serious flood and environmental risks.”
The bill, introduced nearly a year ago, four days before Trump’s second term began, also would have expanded the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include the Osceola Camp.


Trump vetoed the bill by Miami Republican Rep. Carlos Giménez despite widespread congressional support.
Politico reported Monday that the House will vote Thursday whether to override two vetoes, one being HR 504. That outlet reported “senior House Republicans and Democrats generally expect the chamber will approve the overrides in a rare rebuke of Trump.” However, “Less clear is whether either override vote would have enough support in the Senate.”
The second veto was a bill relating to federal funding for a Colorado water pipeline, also sponsored by a Republican. Democrats there believe the veto was politically motivated, Colorado Newsline reported.
In his veto letter, the president blamed the tribe for having “actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”
The tribe is part of a lawsuit against the state, claiming planners behind an immigration detention center in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” failed to follow federal environmental regulations in constructing the 3,000-bed facility.
“The measure reflected years of bipartisan work and was intended to clarify land status and support basic protections for tribal members who have lived in this area for generations — before the roads and canals were built, and before Everglades National Park was created. It was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests,” Cypress wrote.
Trump, via his veto letter published Dec. 30 by the White House, said the tribe during former President Joe Biden’s administration sought “special treatment from the Federal Government.”
“My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration’s policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country,” Trump wrote.
The Tribe said it will continue to collaborate with Congress and the Florida delegation and the federal government.
The statement from Talbert Cypress pointed out that former longtime Chairman Billy Cypress “enjoyed a friendship with President Trump and was an early supporter of his campaign in 2016.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-15-090534-1024x509.png,,,2026-01-05 16:12:16.268968

A message seeking comment was left with Collins on Monday.

Collins chairs the Education Policy Committee and serves on the Education Ways and Means Committee.
Collins first took office in 2010, defeating Democratic candidate Drama Breland with 56% of the vote in the Republican wave that year. In 2018, she defeated Democrat Billy Jackson with 61.6% of the vote. 
During her time in office, Collins sponsored the Human Life Protection Act. The law, signed by Gov. Kay Ivey in 2019, created a near-total abortion ban in Alabama, including in cases of sexual assault. The law makes it a Class A felony, punishable by up to 99 years in prison, for a person to perform an abortion in the state, except in cases of a threat to a mother’s health; if the woman had a mental illness that could result in the death of her child, or if there was a fetal anomaly that would result in stillbirth or death.
Collins, who had previously sponsored legislation known as “fetal heartbeat” bill that would effectively ban abortion at six weeks’ gestation, said at the time of passage that the law was intended to create a legal challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case that established federal protections for abortion rights. 
“I have prayed my way through this issue and this bill, because it was hard to give up heartbeat,” she said. “I believe we can’t get a heartbeat bill until we get Roe v. Wade turned over.”
The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a case out of Mississippi, making abortion effectively illegal in Alabama. Collins was hopeful that lawmakers would be willing to move to a “heartbeat” bill that would ban abortions after six weeks, but other members of Legislature weren’t interested. 
Only seven abortions were performed in Alabama in 2023, but that did not stop the demand for abortion care. Georgia reported that about 3,300 Alabama women in 2022 and another 3,300 Alabama women in 2023 had abortions in that state.
Collins also helped pass the Alabama Literacy Act in 2019 that funded reading coaches and reading programs around the state while allowing students who failed to pass a reading test at the end of third grade to be held back if they did not complete a course. 
The Alabama Literacy Act requires students to read on grade level by the end of third grade. Since its passage, Alabama has seen improvements in literacy scores who take the Alabama Comprehensive Progress (ACAP) test.
In August, there were 55,930 students who took the Alabama Comprehensive Progress (ACAP) in May. Of that number, 88.4% of them were on or above the benchmark score to be considered “proficient” in reading.
Collins also sponsored a law in 2024 that provided criminal and civil immunity to clinics providing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) services. The bill came about after the Alabama Supreme Court declared that frozen embryos were persons and that their destruction would allow parents to collect damages under an 1872 law. The ruling led many IVF clinics in the state to suspend operations.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Terri-Collins-Feb-29-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 15:58:25.947232

Carlos Giménez.A little over 48 hours after U.S. troops removed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power, top Florida Republicans say they are certain that democracy is coming to the South American nation.
But they admit there is no clear pathway to making that happen and that there could be “detours” along the way.
In Doral, home to one of the largest Venezuelan populations in the U.S., Florida’s two U.S. GOP senators — Rick Scott and Ashley Moody — along with South Florida U.S. Rep. Carlos Giménez spoke at a press conference Monday labelled “Celebrating a New Day of Freedom for Venezuela.”
They all cautioned the enthusiastic audience that while they believed the U.S. government is intent on working to transition in Venezuela from an authoritarian government to a democracy, it will take time.
“The road ahead is not clear,” said Giménez, a Cuban American lawmaker who represents all of Monroe County and the southwest portion of Miami-Dade County.
“But the road ahead may have some detours there that will lead to freedom, democracy, for the people of Venezuela, and I’m sure freedom and democracy to the people of Cuba and to the people of Nicaragua as well, and a new emphasis by the United States on maintaining democracy and peace in our hemisphere.”
Sen. Scott said that while the world certainly looks different than it did three days ago while Maduro was still in office, the transition to a democratic government is “going to take a lot of work. It’s going to take a lot of people in Venezuela to bust their butt to make this happen. But they want to make it happen.”
Maduro has been charged on four criminal counts that include narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices. He pleaded not guilty to those charges in federal court in New York on Monday.
Florida Democratic response
Although many congressional Democrats have called Maduro a “brutal dictator” and “an authoritarian,” they have also called Saturday’s military actions illegal and outside the bounds of the president’s constitutional authority.
In South Florida at least, removal of Maduro was met with support by some Democrats, although with caveats.
“The capture of the brutal, illegitimate ruler of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who oppressed Venezuela’s people, is welcome news for my friends and neighbors who fled his violent, lawless, and disastrous rule,” said South Florida U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a statement.
“It is my hope that this marks the end of a horrific chapter for the Venezuelan people,” added Miami Democratic state Sen. Shevrin Jones in a statement released on Saturday.
“There is no question that Nicolás Maduro was a brutal dictator who oppressed the people of Venezuela for far too long. Miami-Dade County is home to a large Venezuelan population, many of whom fled their country to seek safety in the United States because of what they endured.”
Both Wasserman Schultz and Jones criticized the Trump administration for bypassing Congress in removing Maduro, however.
Other Florida Democrats were more critical of the move.
“I shed no tears for Maduro’s loss of power,” said Central Florida U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost. “But I do shed tears for the destruction of our own democracy. Authoritarians like Donald Trump will always seek justification to break the law in order to start foreign wars for unclear reasons. Congress cannot give him an inch, or there will be much more reckless behavior that endangers lives and allows him to consolidate more power.”
“Allegiance to the U.S. Constitution is not a quaint notion that can be ignored by Trump even when it comes to corrupt Nicolás Maduro,” said Tampa Bay area U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor. “Trump’s justification for regime change and a takeover of Venezuela are unsubstantiated. Trump recently pardoned a convicted drug trafficker Juan Orlando Hernandez and has provided no evidence drug trafficking from Venezuela presents an imminent threat to America’s national security.”
Moody said Monday that that she has been disheartened to hear the criticism from Democrats, saying that “some of  my colleagues immediately start being the mouthpiece of a criminal without understanding the historical facts that led us to this day, and without understanding the law that allows the United State to go after a drug trafficker that cooperates with cartels.”
In her statement, Wasserman Schultz added that the military action now allows Venezuelans to seat “their true democratically elected president, Edmundo González.”
González was the opposition candidate who ran against Maduro in 2024. While electoral authorities in Venezuela claimed Maduro had won a third term in office, then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was clear González won the most votes.
Respect for Maria Corina Machado
Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, has also called on González to be recognized as the rightful leader of the nation. Some analysts have said Machado herself should now rule the country, but Trump seemed to slam the door on that possibility over the weekend, saying that while Machado was a “very nice woman,” “she doesn’t have the support within or respect within the country” to lead Venezuela.
That wasn’t the attitude of the Florida Republicans who spoke Monday.
“She is an incredible woman. She has unbelievable courage,” said Giménez, who added that he and fellow South Florida U.S. Rep. Maria Salazar recently travelled to Oslo to meet with Machado when she received the Nobel Prize. “Do I believe that she has the respect of the Venezuelan people? Absolutely. And she would have been elected the president of Venezuela had Maduro not kicked her off the ballot.”
Scott added that Machado “will be part of the leadership of Venezuela, and I think she’s well respected by Venezuelans.”
Delcy Rodríguez, who has served as Venezuela’s vice president since 2018, was sworn in Monday as the country’s interim president. She is considered a longtime confidant of Maduro and initially criticized the U.S. operation as a violation of the United Nations’ founding charter. However, on Sunday night she offered “to collaborate” with the Trump administration, as reported by the Associated Press.
Giménez said that while it wasn’t ideal that Rodríguez was now in control, it’s probably best for the situation right now.
“Am I happy that Delcy Rodríguez is there? No, I’m not happy … but understand this: The number one thing is to make sure that we don’t have chaos and bloodshed in Venezuela. And so, you have to have a transition to democracy. That’s going to take a while.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-1024x556.png,,,2026-01-05 15:58:25.947232

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)North Carolina faith leaders gathered at the General Assembly in Raleigh Monday to advocate for policies they believe will improve the lives of all North Carolinians in the new year.
The legislature was not in session Monday. They’re scheduled to begin a short session in March and may not address many of the issues advocates highlighted. But Reverend Dr. Floyd Wicker of the People’s Fellowship of North Carolina said the group wanted to speak out in the face of voter suppression, chronic underfunding of public schools, and a health care system which has become unaffordable for far too many.
“To the lawmakers in the General Assembly who wish to suppress our voices and erase all of the gains our dear ancestors fought so hard for us to attain, let it be known we will do all that is in our Holy Ghost power to organize to a better, more equitable North Carolina,” said Wicker.
Geraldine Alshamy, a 72-year-old social justice minister and founder of Mary Magdalene Ministries, braved Monday’s chilly temperatures to advocate for disadvantaged students.
“When lawmakers fail to pass a state budget, it hits not only Black, brown and poor children hardest. It hits all children everywhere,” said Alshamy.
Alshamy grew up in rural Wilson County during the early days of integration. She sees similarities between those days and how schools are being funded now.
“Access to education was promised, but never delivered. We are still at those same times. Support and resources were withheld, and communities were told to make do,” she said.
Alshamy said without appropriate funding, more students in North Carolina struggle with behavioral health problems, and teachers who are not trauma-informed are able to provide little support.
“Every time early intervention is denied, the cost is simply shifted to the courts, law enforcement, prison, and broken families,” said Alshamy.
Republican state legislative leaders have often pointed out that the state’s spending on education has grown every year for the past decade. But the increases have not kept pace with inflation or need, and North Carolina now ranks 48th among all states for per-pupil spending.
Kate Daley with the nonprofit Down Home NC joined the group to advocate for health care funding.
“North Carolina state budget is the last of all 50 states to be passed, still tabled after our legislators left unfinished business,” said Daley. “It remains to be seen how our lawmakers will respond to the billions of dollars missing in federal spending for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.”
Daley said North Carolina will be challenged this year to fill the gap left by federal budget cuts and the state’s shrinking tax revenue.
“Affordable health care, SNAP, and public education are on the line for North Carolina more than ever before, and the time has come to end our state’s corporate tax cuts,” said Daley.
Whether to pause scheduled cuts to state personal and corporate income taxes is one of the sticking points that led to a budget impasse between state House and Senate Republicans in 2025. There’s no indication they’re any closer to an agreement yet.

Tyler Daye, Common Cause N.C.’s policy and civic engagement coordinator, said he was frustrated legislators did not have time to finish a state budget in 2025, but did have time to redraw congressional district maps giving Republicans an advantage in the first congressional district.
“They made the decision to manipulate our voting districts to protect themselves and their friends in power. And legislators went after the only truly competitive congressional districts in the state,” said Daye.
Daye said by ignoring historical voting patterns, legislators have made it more difficult for Black voters in the state to have their voice heard.
“This is cheating,” he said. “It is disgraceful, shameful, and it should be illegal.”
Daye said his organization would again make the case this year for an independent redistricting commission.
“This gerrymandering, or a better word for it, election fraud, election manipulation, must be stopped,” Daye said. “It is disintegrating the integrity of North Carolina’s elections.”
Alshamy knows lawmakers may not choose to address many of the group’s issues this spring. But she remained hopeful – and offered elected officials a stern reminder.
“Leadership is not measured by how much power you hold, but how you protect the citizens of this state,” she said. “I urge you to choose wisely. Choose courage over convenience. Choose children over ideology.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Geraldine-Alshamy-and-faith-leaders-1024x494.jpg,,,2026-01-05 15:58:25.947232

A 23-year-old with a physical and mild mental disability reached out for help from one of Mississippi’s free civil legal organizations after suffering violence and mental abuse from his wife, including a beating that required surgery. 
A judge granted the man a divorce, allowing him to live a life free from abuse, according to client success stories shared by the Mississippi Center for Legal Services Corporation.  
Such free services may be in jeopardy for low-income people in Mississippi and across the country. The U.S. House of Representatives has proposed a 46% cut to the Legal Services Corporation, which funds organizations such as Mississippi’s around the country. Both of the state’s free legal services organizations receive at least two-thirds of their funding from the federal nonprofit. 
In Mississippi, that could mean loss of legal services for over 14,000 individuals, according to estimates by the Legal Services Corporation.
Cuts could lead grantee organizations like the center, which serves people from Jackson to the Gulf Coast, to consider reducing staff, closing offices or scaling back programs, said Sam Buchanan Jr., the center’s executive director. He said the cuts would be devastating for clients.
The center and its companion organization, North Mississippi Rural Legal Services, serve low-income residents. Tight budgets and resources have always meant at least half of all people don’t get the help they need.

“Each year we rely on Congress to fund us at an appropriate level so that we can provide the services that we should be able to provide,” Buchanan said in an interview at the center’s Hattiesburg office, one of four in the center’s service area. 
This year, the center received $3.4 million from the Legal Services Corporation, which is about $500,000 less from the previous year because funding is based on Census counts. Recent counts have shown a decline in Mississippi’s population. 
On average, the two legal service organizations close 4,000 civil cases a year ranging from domestic abuse protection orders, child custody, evictions and employment cases to access to public benefits. 
Both legal service groups work with residents whose income is at or below 125% of the federal poverty guidelines. That’s under $20,000 for a single household and about $33,000 for a household of three. 
“(For) a household, if you operate at a certain income level and you lose 46% of your household income, you’re going to be faced with hard choices,” Buchanan said about potential cuts to the Legal Services Corporation. 
“Do I provide shelter? Do I provide food? Do I provide utilities? So for an organization, it’s the same thing, you have to decide.” 
It’s the same kind of choices some of the center’s clients found themselves in during the 43-day government shutdown as funding for food benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was paused. 
In September, the House and Senate appropriations subcommittees proposed funding for the Legal Services Corporation, going against President Donald Trump’s call to eliminate the organization altogether. 
The House proposed a $300 million appropriation – nearly half of LSC’s funding from 2025 – and the Senate proposed $566 million. 
Legal Service Corporation funding falls under appropriations for commerce, justice and science. 
As of November, Congress has not approved that appropriation. The new fiscal year begins in January, so appropriations would need to be made before then. 
The Mississippi Center for Legal Services Corporation has about 46 full- and part-time staff, including 13 attorneys. Ideally, a legal service center would have two attorneys for every 10,000 eligible people. Buchanan estimates that in reality one attorney serves every 20,000 eligible clients. 
Legal aid providers from around the state met in August to discuss the potential funding threats to free civil aid. 
Some of the potential solutions included recruiting private lawyers to provide pro bono service and encouraging lawyers and recent law school graduates to consider working in underserved areas such as the Delta. 
Despite a potential loss of federal funds, Buchanan said Missisisppi’s free civil legal service organizations want to help, whether that is through providing legal advice, representation or other assistance. 
“I think it’s important that people know that we’re still here, that we are still fighting a good fight and that we’ll continue to do so and that we just need people to understand that from our view point, it’s important that people have equal access to justice, and we are one of the agencies that does that.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/19125836/08.19.25-Sam-Buchanan-Gayla-Carpenter-Sanders-MinnieHoward-069-copy.jpg,,,2026-01-05 15:12:25.043807

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Customers of South Carolina’s two large, private power companies could see their electric bills go up in 2026 — the second time in two years that utilities have hiked base rates.
It has been 16 months since Dominion Energy’s South Carolina customers last saw their rates increase. Now, the Virginia-headquartered company is headed back before state utility regulators seeking to raise base electric rates again.
If approved by the state Public Service Commission, residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt-hours a month — considered the industry standard — would see another $20 tacked on to their current monthly bill, Dominion’s regulatory manager John Raftery told the SC Daily Gazette. That would take average bills from about $157 a month to just shy of $177, starting in July 2026.
This does not include potential increases for cost of fuel, which can be added to bills along the way.
Dominion’s ask comes on the heels of rate hikes approved for Duke Energy customers across the Upstate and Pee Dee.
And electricity costs have been on the rise nationally, not just in South Carolina.
Utility rate increase requests and approvals totaled more than $34 billion in the first nine months of 2025, according to PowerLines, a nonprofit focused on lowering utility bills. That’s almost double the $16 billion in requests and approvals over the same period in 2024.
The national average price of electricity rose faster than inflation in 2025, and government forecasters at the U.S. Energy Information Administration expect that will continue through this year. But the increases have not hit as hard in South Carolina and many other Southeastern states when compared to the West Coast and Northeast.
Dominion is asking for the increase, which would bring in $332 million more annually from all 820,000 customers it serves across the Lowcountry and Midlands. Utility officials say that will help cover $1.4 billion worth of investments made to the utility’s South Carolina system since March 2024.
That includes:

$500 million spent on the lines that carry power directly to people’s homes and businesses
$270 million spent on large transmission lines that move power around the state
$515 million on power plants and hydropower produced at Lake Murray
$120 million on Hurricane Helene recovery

Utilities’ annual spending on the network of poles and wires that deliver power to customers has nearly tripled over the past two decades, according to U.S. Department of Energy data, as large portions of the electric grid near the end of their 50-year life spans. As climate change drives more frequent storms, fires, heat waves, and cold spells, companies also are having to do more to make the grid more resistant to natural disasters.
Some of those improvements to the transmission lines and a coal-fired power plant near Goose Creek are required by federal energy and environmental regulations, said Keller Kissam, president of Dominion’s South Carolina operations.
Others replace smaller, aging plants that are six decades old and hydro equipment that hasn’t been updated in nearly a century, Kissam added.
Dominion’s spending over the last two years is nearly equivalent to the $1.6 billion it spent in the five years prior. Kissam pointed, in part, to the rising cost of copper, steel and aluminum — all of which goes into the parts and components the utility uses in its power lines and equipment. The company also has added 23,000 new customers in that time.
“I would rather fight a Category 4 hurricane than file a rate case,” Kissam said.
But the company also is collecting less than half of the 9.94% rate of return regulators allowed it in 2024. That rate of return is how Dominion attracts investors willing to front the capital the company needs for construction, Kissam said.
Dominion is, in turn, asking regulators to up that return rate to 10.5%.
Duke Energy
As for Duke Energy, the average residential customer in the Pee Dee will see their bill rise by about $11 a month — from $154 to $165 for 1,000 kilowatt-hours of energy — starting in February. State utility regulators signed off on the rate hike on Dec. 12.
The increase for customers in the Upstate, approved Dec. 31, is far less — less than $1 more per month on average starting in March. But those customers still have a bump that has yet to take effect from a previously approved rate hike. That increase of $6.42 per month for the average residential customer comes in Aug. 1, 2026.
In all, Duke has about 857,000 customers in the Palmetto State.
As part of the deal, Duke will set aside funds, raised from investors, for customers who need help paying their bill when facing financial hardship — $750,000 annually for two years in the Pee Dee and $1.5 million annually for two years in the Upstate, according to the South Carolina chapter of the AARP.
Duke also agreed to take part in a petition asking regulators to review how large energy users — those that consume 50 megawatts or more — are charged for producing the power they require. The provision is aimed at the growing number of large data centers and manufacturing operations coming into South Carolina.
In turn, regulators are allowing Duke a 9.99% rate of return.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/electric-meter-1024x752.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 14:58:02.281897

(Stock photo by Oliver Helbig/Getty Images)Carrying an open package of medical marijuana, hemp, or THC products, including beverages, in a car, would be illegal and could lead to suspension or possible revocation of a patient’s access to medical marijuana under a bill that’s been filed in the Senate.
Fort Myers Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin filed SB 1056 Monday, eight days before the 2026 regular legislative begins.
Martin’s bill would give law enforcement the green light to search a vehicle based on the “plain smell” of edibles, hemp, marijuana, or THC beverages by creating a new statute that provides “legislative intent.” In doing so, the bill aims to blunt the effect of an October 2025 Florida Second District Court of Appeal ruling that the smell of marijuana alone is not enough to establish probable cause for a police search because marijuana no longer is illegal.
Because the ruling was in conflict with one of its previous rulings, the appeals court certified the question of whether the legalization of medical marijuana and hemp in Florida means the “plain smell” doctrine, which allows searches based solely on the smell of marijuana, still is valid. 
Sen. Martin didn’t immediately reply to Florida’s Phoenix’s request for comment on the bill.
The ban on the carry of open medical marijuana products applies to both drivers and passengers, although it wouldn’t apply to paying commercial passengers or passengers on buses or passengers in self-contained motor homes that are longer than 21 feet. The definition of “open container” mirrors the definition of open container for alcohol.
The bill has different penalties for drivers and passengers who break the law.

There are 929,655 medical marijuana patients in Florida, Office of Medical Marijuana Use data show.
Both drivers and passengers who violate the law could be charged with a noncriminal moving traffic violation and suspension of their medical marijuana identification cards, which enable them to buy the product. And both drivers and passengers who repeatedly violate the law could have their access to medical marijuana permanently revoked.
A driver who breaks the law a second time could be imprisoned for up to 90 days and forced to pay up to a $500 fine or both. Jail time for a third offense for a driver would be increased to up to six months and the potential fine upped to $1,000.
Police won’t have to wonder whether the driver or passenger owns the open product. Under the bill, an open container of edibles would be considered to be in the possession of the driver unless it is located in a locked glove compartment, locked trunk, or other locked part of the vehicle, or is in the physical control of the passenger.

(Photo from Joe Powers Facebook page)The leader of Rhode Island’s Republican Party is stepping down, less than one year after winning a second term in a contentious and competitive internal election. 
GOP Chairman Joe Powers announced his resignation on Sunday — though it doesn’t take effect until Jan. 15 — citing the demands and rigorous travel schedule of his paid job as a business consultant.
“The role of Chairman demands constant focus and daily engagement, especially moving into an election year, neither of which Chairman Powers can provide at this time,” the party said in a press release.
Powers, 55, was first elected to the top position within the state’s Republican Party in March 2023, after losing his campaign to unseat Democratic Sen. Frank Lombardi in the 2022 election. The 55-year-old Cranston resident won a second, two-year term in March 2025, fending off challenger Jessica Drew-Day in an animus battle over the future of the state’s small Republican presence. The 2025 election was also the first time a challenger attempted to unseat an incumbent GOP chair in 30 years.
In an interview Monday morning, Powers said he had no regrets about running for reelection in 2025, despite his decision now to step away.
“We worked our tails off trying to put together a foundation,” Powers said of his time as party leader. Under his oversight, the GOP updated its bylaws for the first time in 20 years, and filled all the seats on its six party standing committees, which oversee finances, messaging, rules and other tasks.
But he has struggled to balance the full-time party leadership role — one he said demands 60 hours weekly — with his day job. Powers said his business consulting practice began ramping up a year ago as he took on new clients, increasing “exponentially” within the last six months.
He penned his public resignation letter on Saturday from Tampa, Florida, where he was traveling for work. By Monday morning, he’d left the Sunshine State, stopping through Texas and ending in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He spoke to Rhode Island Current, and called in for a scheduled interview on WPRO host Tara Granahan’s Monday morning radio show, from his hotel room.
Unlike media interviews, though, the work of the state party leader requires a physical presence — attending all of the half dozen executive committee meetings throughout the year, and intermittent pop-ups at the many municipal meetings, candidate trainings and fundraisers that occur each month. 
“It’s too important for Rhode Island, especially Republican Rhode Islanders, not to have somebody who can have their hands, or at least their shadow, on all the work and all the goings on inside the party,” Powers said to Granahan.
Powers also highlighted the “highly contested” state and local elections — including general officers and all 113 members of the Rhode Island General Assembly — approaching in November.
“I would take it personally if I squandered it because I couldn’t participate,” Powers said in Granahan’s show. 
Two Republicans, Aaron Guckian and Elaine Pelino, have publicly announced they are running for governor, while Republican James Loughlin is vying for the lieutenant governor position. The state GOP has not endorsed candidates in the November elections yet, but is offering campaign training, promotional and fundraising support to anyone interested.
Just 14% of the state’s 744,618 registered voters identify as Republicans, according to data from the Rhode Island Department of State. 
But the Ocean State’s historically solid blue appearance has turned toward purple, with 40% of state voters backing Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election — the highest support for a Republican presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush was elected in 1988. The red wave has yet to appear on Smith Hill: All of Rhode Island’s general office holders and 98 of 113 state legislators are Democrats.
During the 2025 GOP party elections, Drew-Day criticized Powers for not spending more time and effort recruiting candidates for state and local offices. Drew-Day, 48, of South Kingstown, co-founded an independent political action committee in 2022 to fill the gap, claiming to have supported more than a dozen Republican candidates in 2023 and 2024.
The battle between the two partners turned competitors — Drew-Day was first vice chair to Powers from 2023 to 2025 —  grew hostile in the final days leading up to the March 2025 election. The Warwick event itself featured allegations of voter disenfranchisement and local police being called to escort one member of the West Warwick Republican Town Committee out of the venue, although he was not arrested.
Drew-Day has since declared her intent to challenge Democratic Rep. Carol McEntee for the seat representing parts of South Kingstown and Narragansett in the November 2026 election. She ran and lost to McEntee for the same seat in 2022 and 2024.
Powers’ resignation, prompting a special election within 30 days, might make Drew-Day change campaigns. 
“I’m an organizer,” she said in an interview Monday. “I love people. And as I said before, I thought I could do a better job.”
She hasn’t made up her mind yet on switching to a run for GOP chair.
Powers declined to comment on Drew-Day’s prospective candidacy for the leadership role.
“Everyone has an opportunity to put their name in,” he said. “I’m not endorsing anybody until I see the full spectrum of candidates.”
Powers had already called a few potential candidates on his own to gauge their interest in taking over, but none could commit to the hours and effort required, he said. Powers declined to name the people he contacted when asked by Rhode Island Current.
Allyn Meyers, a former state Senate candidate who lives in Tiverton, might also be considering a run, according to news reports. Meyers could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday.
The full list of contenders won’t be revealed until the internal meeting sometime on or around Feb. 15, when 130 state and local Republican delegates will be asked to vote on their new leader. Niyoka Powell, first vice chair, will call the special election, serving as acting chair in the interim.
Powell did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
Powers will continue as chairman emeritus within the party’s State Central Committee, which offers him voting rights in party elections.

Gov. Phil Scott made two appointments to the Vermont Supreme Court, naming one former top federal prosecutor and another currently serving in that role for Vermont to fill the open spots on the state’s high court.  
Scott, a Republican, announced in a press release Monday the appointments of Christina Nolan, who served as U.S. Attorney for Vermont from 2017 to 2021 during the first President Donald Trump administration, and Michael Drescher, who served as the acting U.S. Attorney for Vermont, in Trump’s second administration.
Nolan and Drescher fill vacancies on the five-member Vermont Supreme Court following Justice William Cohen’s retirement late last year and Justice Karen Carroll’s retirement a few months earlier. The appointments require the confirmation of the state Senate.

“These appointments are important to maintain the trust of Vermonters in a fair and independent legal system,” Scott said in the release. “Christina and Michael both demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to public service, the rule of law, justice and will be great additions to the Court.”
Nolan, of Burlington, has worked in private practice for law firm Sheehey Furlong and Behm following her stint as U.S. Attorney for Vermont. She ran an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2022, losing in the Republican primary. 
Nolan had joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont in 2010, and she was later unanimously confirmed for the top post in the office by the U.S. Senate in 2017. 
“This is an opportunity like no other to continue to make a positive difference in the lives of Vermonters and to uphold the rule of the law and the Constitution,” Nolan said in the release. “I am humbled by the Governor’s confidence in me and by this new opportunity to serve the state I call home.”
Drescher, of Hinesburg, has worked as a federal prosecutor in Vermont for more than two decades, taking over as the top federal prosecutor in the state last year after Trump took office. Drescher held the role first as the acting U.S. Attorney for Vermont. 
Late last year, after he served the maximum amount of time allowed by law in that acting role, his title changed to First Assistant U.S. Attorney, though he insisted he was still in charge of overseeing the office in Vermont.
It’s unclear why Trump did not put forth Drescher’s name for confirmation to the U.S. Senate for the role of U.S. Attorney for Vermont on a permanent basis. The U.S. Department of Justice website currently lists the U.S. Attorney for Vermont post as vacant. 
In his role as the top federal prosecutor in Vermont, Drescher has taken the lead in enforcing many of the policies in Vermont of the U.S. Justice Department under Trump, from immigration enforcement to filing federal charges that carry the death penalty for the first time in cases in the state in years. 
“I have spent the last 30 years working with and appearing before Vermont judges in state and federal courts,” Drescher said in the release Monday announcing his appointment to the Vermont Supreme Court. 
“Drawing on that experience,” Drescher added, “I pledge to help lead a court system in which everyone is treated with dignity and respect, justice is administered fairly and efficiently, and individual rights are protected.”
Scott said in the release that the names of both Nolan and Drescher were forwarded to him on a list of candidates deemed well-qualified by the Judicial Nominating Board.

The Iowa Board of Nursing alleges that on Dec. 3, 2024, licensed practical nurse Rachel Blair of Windsor Heights was working at an unspecified Urbandale care facility when the medication count was reported as being off during her shift, indicating the staff was unable to account for missing drugs.
According to the board, the facility was missing one fentanyl patch. During that same shift, the board alleges, Blair “fell to her hands and knees and struggled to stand.” Paramedics were called to the scene and administered Narcan — a drug commonly used for emergency treatment of an opioid overdose — to Blair.

As a result of that incident, the board recently charged Blair, 35, with misappropriating the medications of a patient or agency, then agreed to settle the case by providing Blair with a warning that any future violations could result in some form of disciplinary action. As part of that settlement, Blair agreed to participate in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program and to comply with any requirements of the program.
Blair’s nursing license remains otherwise unencumbered by any restrictions on her practice.
In 2020, the board charged Blair with attempting to initiate a sexual, emotional or business relationship with a patient. According to the board, Blair was working at a county jail in April 2019 when she participated in personal telephone calls with an inmate. “At times, the calls were sexually explicit in nature,” the board alleged.
According to the board, Blair was then fired from the jail for providing “treatment” for an inmate despite the lack of a physician’s order, and for admitting to having “feelings for an inmate.”
Court records show that a Polk County Jail inmate at the time told jail officials that a nurse, later identified as Blair, had been providing tobacco, drugs and sex to an inmate known as “Casper.” According to a search warrant application filed by the sheriff’s department, Blair admitted to providing “Casper” with unordered, undocumented “massaging treatments,” approximately 15 times over four to six weeks, in a private treatment room.
According to the warrant application, a subsequent review of the jail’s recorded telephone calls uncovered communications between Blair and the inmate that included “sexual content and comments referencing a personal relationship.”
A review of text messages then uncovered 199 written exchanges between Blair and the inmate, according to the warrant application. The messages also included 21 photos of Blair, the sheriff’s department alleged. In addition, the warrant application alleged that money had been deposited into the inmate’s account three separate times by depositor “Clare Loren” — Loren being Blair’s middle name and the name associated with the text messages attributed to Blair.
According to the application, Blair admitted destroying potential evidence in the case during the initial stages of the sheriff’s investigation of the matter.
In that case, the Board of Nursing suspended Blair’s nursing license pending the completion of a mental health evaluation and also required her to complete an educational course on professional boundaries.
At the end of the suspension, Blair’s license was placed on probation for two years.

(Courtesy photo)The Democratic primary race for Montana’s Western Congressional District is getting more crowded.
On Monday, Missoula smokejumper and union leader Sam Forstag announced his entrance into a field that already has two declared candidates.
“It’s become too damn hard for most Montanans to afford basic things like housing, healthcare, childcare, and even groceries,” Forstag said in his campaign announcement. “I’m running for Congress because I’m done pretending the rich and powerful are going to take care of us. We take care of us.”
Forstag graduated from the University of Montana where he was a student senator with the Associated Students of the University of Montana (ASUM) and was elected ASUM president his senior year.
He has worked for the U.S. Forest Service for several years, including as a smokejumper, the elite wildland firefighters that parachute into rugged, remote terrain.
“I know what it’s like to work a thousand hours of overtime and still be holding on by my fingernails,” Forstag said in his announcement video, adding that he’s “trained to deal with a crisis.”
Forstag currently serves as vice president of the NFFE-FSC Local 60 Union, which represents roughly 800 Forest Service workers across the Lolo, Bitterroot and Custer-Gallatin National Forests.
Drawing on his experience as a firefighter and local organizer, Forstag spoke during the “Fighting Oligarghy” rally led by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in Missoula last spring, advocating for public lands and public service workers.
In his campaign announcement, Forstag blamed U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, the Republican incumbent in the race, for “getting millions richer, cutting taxes for corporations and his rich friends while the rest of us fall further behind.”
Zinke won two elections in Montana as the state’s sole at-large representative before he was selected as President Donald Trump’s Interior Secretary during the first Trump term. Zinke resigned amid several federal probes that found he broke ethics rules.
But when the latest census gave Montana an additional seat in Congress, Zinke, who is from Whitefish, ran for the state’s western seat in 2022, winning by 3.5 percentage points. He was reelected in 2024 by nearly eight points.
The Cook Political Report currently rates Montana’s western district as “Likely Republican” with a +5 margin. The state’s eastern district, represented by freshman Rep. Troy Downing, is rated as “Solid Republican” with a +15 margin.
However, midterm elections tend to favor the political party out of power, and state and federal elections throughout 2025 showed a marked swing away from GOP candidates.
A perceived competitiveness of the western district has opened the gates for Democrats to jump into the race. Currently, Russ Cleveland, of St. Regis, and Matt Rains, of Simms, have entered the race, both touting similar backgrounds in agriculture and as veterans.
It is also widely expected that Ryan Busse, who lost a race against Gov. Greg Gianforte last fall, will enter the race, following a poll that circulated assessing a head-to-head matchup between Busse and Zinke.
Forstag has not run for political office outside of UM, and is one of two political newcomers in the primary field as of right now.
“This campaign is about making sure that every Montanan can work a good job and afford a roof over their head, healthcare, childcare, and a good retirement,” Forstag said in a statement.
“For too long, politicians in both parties have left working people behind, trying to turn us all against each other while they rig the system in favor of corporations and rich donors. We can do better than that. We’re up against a lot of money, but if we pull together and work hard, we can fix these systems so that they work for all of us.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/unnamed-12-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-05 13:57:20.250825

(Courtesy HCA)New Mexico’s Health Care Authority will receive $211.5 million in federal funding aimed at shoring up health care delivery for roughly one-third of the state’s residents who live in rural areas.
The award marks the first of five funding rounds authorized in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that President Donald Trump signed last year. The bill required states to submit applications by early November for their part of a $50 billion appropriation for rural healthcare improvements.
New Mexico’s application sought $1 billion over the next five years, including $200 million in the first round, for five rural health care initiatives. The initiatives aim to improve rural access to medical specialists; increase the number of community health programs; train more health care workers; reduce financial strain on hospitals; and establish a rural health data-sharing platform. 
“The funding will strengthen the hospitals and clinics that are lifelines in our communities. New Mexico’s award is above the national average, and we’re ready to put these resources to work for the families who need them most,” Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo said in a statement about the award.
NM’s biggest farmers’ market manager says SNAP cuts will be ‘devastating’

New Mexico received $11.5 million more than it requested, which HCA spokesperson Marina Piña told Source New Mexico resulted from the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service’s “independent” funding methodology that considered the state’s rural healthcare needs and the plans it put forward to address them.
New Mexico received the 13th-most funding in the country, according to CMS data. Texas got the most, receiving a little over $280 million, and New Jersey had the smallest award, approximately  $147 million.
The state’s application noted that 26 of New Mexico’s 33 counties are rural, and their residents tend to have higher rates of heart disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease than their urban counterparts, while often being forced to travel between 50 and 100 miles for basic health care services. 
Eight of out 27 rural New Mexico hospitals are at risk of closure, according to a 2025 analysis the application cited, with four facing “immediate risk [of closure] absent intervention.” Four other federally qualified health centers have closed in recent years, as well. 
Several state Republicans have lauded the funding award as a necessary investment in rural health care. Still, independent estimates show the federal spending bill will cut rural Medicaid spending overall by $137 billion over the next decade. 
In addition to demonstrating the need for the funding, the state also had to address how it intends to comply with the Trump administration’s policy priorities, including aspects of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s agenda. 
For example, states had to confirm whether they intend to have schools implement the “Presidential Fitness Test,” which Kennedy’s uncle John F. Kennedy spearheaded as president in the late 1950s. New Mexico officials said they would pursue legislative and regulatory changes to implement the test in schools by 2029. 
The application also required states to describe their plans for medical licensure compacts, which have emerged as a top issue during New Mexico’s upcoming legislative session as a way to address the state’s doctor shortage. Unlike its neighboring states, New Mexico does not participate in many of the key medical compacts that enable easy license transfer between states for a variety of health care professions.

State officials wrote they intend to push the Legislature to pursue compact approval for doctors, emergency medical service providers, psychologists and physicians’ assistants during the upcoming session. 
Sen. Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) recently told Source that he expects the Legislature to approve compacts for doctors and social workers at the upcoming session, but that other compacts are still being worked out. 
While the state’s application agreed to pursue adoption of a new statewide fitness test and medical compacts, it said it “does not plan to pursue” another of Kennedy’s priorities: prohibiting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients from buying junk food. 
Officials wrote that the state provides “robust educational opportunities” for SNAP recipients about healthy food choices and incentivizes recipients to buy nutritious food through, for example, programs at farmers’ markets.
Piña told Source that CMS did not penalize the state for its responses to those questions.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kari-Armijo-HSD-e1698169804163-999x1024.png,,,2026-01-05 13:57:20.250825

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., announced her reelection campaign Monday in a video posted to social media.
In the video, Fedorchak is described as someone who supports the “America first” agenda and will keep North Dakota as her “top priority.”
“As a fourth-generation North Dakotan, I want the very best state and nation — for my kids and for yours,” Fedorchak said in a social media post. 
This will be Fedorchak’s first reelection campaign for North Dakota’s only U.S. House seat. She defeated Democratic-NPL Party candidate Trygve Hammer during the 2024 general election with 69% of the statewide vote and won the five-candidate Republican primary election with 46% of the vote.
During her first year in Congress, Fedorchak introduced the Ending Intermittent Energy Subsidies Act, which aimed to curtail federal subsidies for wind and solar projects. Portions of the act were included in the 2025 Republican budget reconciliation package, the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act, that was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July.
She also voted in favor of the House Republican health care proposal in December, the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, which includes a transparency provision targeting pharmacy benefit managers, cost-sharing reductions and expands access to association health plans. The health care bill does not extend the Affordable Care Act enhanced premium tax credits. The bill is under consideration by the U.S. Senate.
Trump endorsed Fedorchak’s reelection bid in a social media post in August.
When asked if she plans to seek the North Dakota Republican Party’s endorsement at its state convention in March, Kate Roberts, a spokesperson for the Fedorchak campaign, said North Dakotans “expect the state party” to stand with Trump’s endorsed candidate.
In December, former-Republican-endorsed U.S. House Candidate Alex Balazs announced he will challenge Fedorchak for the state’s lone U.S. House seat. Balazs finished fourth out of five Republican candidates during the 2024 primary election with 4% of the statewide vote.

His death created a vacuum in my heart and soul.
Grief rushed in to fill it.
This is painful to write. It conjures the joyful moment when this precious little boy came into our lives—and how, over time, we watched that joy slip away, replaced by anxiety and alcohol addiction.
Addiction and mental illness are real. So is recovery—through introspection, diagnosis, treatment, and support.
No, people battling these brain diseases cannot simply “stop” and get over it.
Addiction will kill you. And it will rip the heart and soul from those who love you, as parents, family, and friends struggle to provide encouragement for treatment—along with love and support—while trying not to feed the fire of addiction.
I love my son. Even when I was angry and sad about some of his behaviors and choices.
I—his mother—and his friends all tried to support his sobriety. In the end, perhaps we wanted it more for him than he wanted it for himself.
Yes, I second-guessed my parenting—how I let my son down, how I disappointed him—while intellectually and professionally knowing that alcoholism is a disease, and the disease is not me.
Be clear: addiction and mental health issues skip no ZIP code. They do not care about titles, economic status, professional degrees, or the power one thinks they possess. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Few families escape the horrors of trying to secure the help, care, and support needed on the long road to recovery for someone they love.
The national tragedy—the alleged murder of actor and producer Rob Reiner’s parents, Michele and Carl Reiner, by their son who reportedly battled mental illness and addiction since adolescence—brought this pain flooding back.
If you are shaking your head thinking, “Not me,” don’t be so sure. Just wait.
The news is devastating. You soon realize how helpless you are unless—and until—your loved one chooses recovery and sobriety. And even then, that choice is only one moment, one day at a time.
Alcohol—and stigma—kill
Michigan’s rate of alcohol-related deaths is slightly higher than the national average.
In 2023, alcohol-involved traffic crashes resulted in 297 fatalities. The annual per capita death rate from excessive alcohol use in Michigan increased by more than 40 percent between 2015 and 2019. An average of 4,548 deaths each year in Michigan are attributable to excessive alcohol use.
Nationally, more than 178,000 deaths—approximately 120,000 men and 59,000 women—are attributed to excessive alcohol use.
A tremendous loss of love and life.
I still feel a tinge of shame and stigma when admitting this painful family truth. That stigma—yes, it is there—hurts as well.
Stigma remains a major barrier to people getting the behavioral health care and support they need.
I have spent years working in the behavioral health field, serving as Michigan’s state mental health director under former Governor James Blanchard, and as president and CEO of the Detroit Wayne Integrated Health Network.
I know better.
And yet, I admit the fear, embarrassment, shame, and judgment still cling to me like cheap cigar smoke in a darkened bar. We must defeat stigma if we are to give people a real chance at life.
Personally and professionally, I have witnessed the joy that comes when individuals are ready for help and the health care system is there to meet them. I have also felt deep pain watching disease prevent people from accessing help—or worse, when a bureaucratic and underfunded system failed them.
We can—and must—do better.
Today, my grief comes in waves: disbelief and denial, anger and guilt, moments of comfort, and the search for ways to move forward—not on— as I gradually adjust to and accept this profound loss.
The sadness slowly evaporates, though despair still lingers beneath the surface, replaced more often now by memories of love, acceptance, forgiveness, and gratitude for the time Daniel and I had—rather than the time we did not.
As a society, we must do better.
We must educate people that help is available, provide resources to strengthen chronically underfunded public mental health systems, and eradicate the stigma that prevents people from seeking help.
I owe my ongoing recovery from this tragic loss to three invaluable community resources:

DNR personnel may examine the fish’s internal organs or take a piece of fin tissue for DNA analysis and aging.
Lake sturgeon are one of the oldest species in the Great Lakes. While they were previously considered threatened due to habitat loss and overfishing, the DNR partnered with Sturgeon for Tomorrow, Michigan State University, Tower-Kleber Limited partnership, the Bay Mills Indian Community, the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians to rehabilitate lake sturgeon populations in Black Lake. 
Over the past two decades, lake sturgeon populations in Black Lake have increased due to rearing and stocking efforts, research and the protection of spawning adults, and the DNR expects this trend to continue.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-05 18:19:25+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘We need to pray and fast’: Mississippi’s child care providers await guidance on voucher funding freeze,Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/05/child-care-vouchers-providers-concern/,"Cantrell Keyes, director of Agape Christian Academy World, talks about her academy in Jackson on Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Cantrell Keyes thought the Trump administration’s decision to freeze federal funding for child care was “fake news.” 
On New Year’s Day, the Jackson-based child care provider said several of her colleagues in the business called her to ask if it was true: The federal government had decided to freeze funding that helps low-income families pay for child care – and keeps hundreds of Mississippi day cares like Keyes’ afloat. 
The stated reason? Right-wing influencer Nick Shirley’s unverified and viral YouTube video that claimed Somali-run day care centers in Minnesota were taking the federal funds but serving no children – allegations that state has contended with and sought to address for more than a decade. 
“I just could not imagine that our president would not have the mindset to secure services for children and not understand that this would be affecting businesses,” Keyes said. “That’s why I couldn’t believe that that is even real.” 
It’s too early to tell how the decision, announced in an X post on Dec. 30, will impact Mississippi’s already fragile child care industry. Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary for the U.S. Department of Human Services, wrote in the X post that the federal agency would withhold funding from all 50 states until a state could provide “a justification and a receipt or photo evidence” of proper spending. 
“We need to pray and fast,” said Keyes, who predicts she could not stay open for longer than a month if the voucher she receives for nine families were to be delayed.

The Mississippi Department of Human Services – the state agency that distributes federal funds for child care vouchers to providers — doesn’t yet know the impact either, according to a statement from spokesperson Mark Jones. 
It’s possible the agency already collects all the information federal officials will ask for, Jones said, due to its already “strong monitoring of child care facilities” that receive the voucher. But over the weekend, Jones said the agency had received “no official message or guidance” from the federal government regarding the funding freeze. 
“I have a litany of questions that we are anticipating needing answers for clients and providers,” Jones wrote. “Remember, we heard about this from the media on New Year’s Eve. We have as many questions as anyone.” 
On Jan. 5, the federal government announced it was rescinding rules that permitted states to pay providers without verifying attendance logs, which Jones said Mississippi already collects. 
Not only do the vouchers help low-income families afford tuition, the payments keep providers’ doors open in an industry with unworkable economics, said Cathy Grace, the early childhood program specialist with the nonprofit North Mississippi Education Consortium.
Grace, who has worked in child care for nearly 50 years, said this freeze is unprecedented. 
“If you have any sense of economic development or community development, you have to have the worker bees or you won’t have a community,” she said. “The worker bees are the ones that are going to get hit if they don’t have a place for the kids.” 
On X, the Trump administration said that the freeze is an effort to prevent fraud allegedly occurring in Minnesota from happening across the country. 
But in Mississippi, providers, advocates and MDHS agree: The child care industry does not suffer from widespread fraud. In interviews, all noted it would be difficult for providers to successfully commit the scheme described in Minnesota – taking funds without serving children. 
That’s because of fraud controls the Mississippi Department of Human Services – which doles out the federal funds to child care centers in the state – adopted in the wake of the scandal involving the social safety net program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, to monitor its spending, Jones said. He cited the agency establishing its first compliance program that, among other things, routinely checks monthly payments to providers against their attendance logs. 
“We already do everything that is being flagged” in Minnesota, Jones said. 
MDHS normally reimburses child care providers around the 15th of the month, according to the agency. To be reimbursed, Keyes said she has to submit a monthly ledger to the department reflecting her attendance rolls for the children she’s served. 
There is a downside to this method of fraud prevention, Keyes said. But the voucher follows a child, so if a family disenrolls from Keyes’ facility or moves their child to another facility, MDHS stops sending her the tuition payment.

Sept. 5, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Rodney Bennett will resign next week, he announced in a brief email to students, faculty and staff on Monday, leaving UNL nearly six months short of his initial contract.
Bennett, who started at UNL in July 2023, will resign Jan. 12. He led the campus through $27.5 million in budget cuts in the fall, including nearly $7 million in academic program eliminations or mergers approved by the University of Nebraska Board of Regents at a Dec. 5 meeting. The remaining cuts were still in progress as of last month.
“I am writing to share that I will conclude my service as chancellor on Jan. 12,” Bennett said in the opening line of his email.

Bennett’s salary this year was $732,000.
Dr. Jeffrey Gold, president of the NU system, tapped Kathy Ankerson, who retired Dec. 31, 2024, after serving as UNL’s chief academic officer, as UNL’s next interim chancellor. Ankerson previously served as dean, associate dean and professor in UNL’s College of Architecture.
‘Well for the future’
In a separate message, Gold told the NU community he is grateful for Bennett’s service, including his work to stabilize UNL’s financial position, strengthen fundraising and advance student success and retention. Bennett highlighted that work, too, in his departure email. Gold said Bennett’s work has helped position UNL “well for the future.”
“We understand that the news about Chancellor Bennett is one change on top of many other changes,” Gold said. “It will be critical that every member of our UNL community has the opportunity to share their thoughts and help to shape our path forward.”

Gold said he and Ankerson plan to hold several listening sessions, details of which will be shared soon. He said he remains “confident” in UNL’s future, in part with campus budget challenges addressed and UNL nearing joint accreditation with the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
Bennett did not give a reason for leaving UNL but said he believes in the “transformative power of higher education.” 
He indicated he would remain in education, though he didn’t specify whether that would still be in the Cornhusker State. He came to UNL after serving nearly 10 years as president of the University of Southern Mississippi.
“I look forward to exploring opportunities on the horizon that will enable me to elevate mission and purpose in support of student success,” Bennett said.
Contract was set to expire June 30
In November, Bennett became the first UNL chancellor to receive a “no confidence” vote from UNL faculty. The historic vote overwhelmingly passed, 60-14, in part due to concerns over Bennett’s handling of budget challenges.
Bennett declined multiple times to directly address the UNL Faculty Senate action, telling the Examiner after December’s regents meeting UNL had “a lot of work to do” with implementation.
“We’re going to do that with a lot of care and concern for everybody who’s impacted,” he said last month.

Bennett’s contract was originally set to expire June 30. In October, he told the Examiner he desired a contract extension but did not know if or when that might occur.
Gold said at the time he supported an extension but cautioned that it was a decision ultimately left to the regents. In December, Bennett said the situation hadn’t changed.
“You got to talk to the boss about that,” Bennett said Dec. 5 when asked again if his contract would come up for a vote soon. It’s unclear what changed in the month since.
Regent Paul Kenney of Amherst, chair of the NU Board of Regents, said Monday that the board had not discussed Bennett’s contract as a group and that the board had heard “rumors” he might leave before July but “didn’t really know what would happen.” He called Bennett a friend and wished him well.
“I mean, he’s looking to do other things,” Kenney said of Bennett. “Kathy will be a very, very good acting chancellor in his absence, so we’re happy about that, so things ought to go pretty smoothly.”
‘Highest honor and privilege’
In his email, Bennett highlighted a UNL tenure he said stabilized campus enrollment after years of decline, set new records for first-year student retention and six-year graduation rates and enhanced research. He also touted innovation and creative scholarship, advancing statewide extension and natural resource development that includes agriculture and animal welfare, achieving record fundraising milestones and developing “a plan for financial sustainability.”

Bennett extended his “heartfelt gratitude” to faculty, staff, extension-based colleagues, members of the executive leadership team and NU system leaders. He also thanked alumni, donors and friends of UNL.
Addressing UNL’s “outstanding students,” Bennett said each brings to UNL, Lincoln and Nebraska energy, enthusiasm, optimism and determination that he said improves local communities, Nebraska and the world. He described them as“an inspiration to us all.”
“It has been my highest honor and privilege to have served as your chancellor,” Bennett said. “You are the reason we are all here, and I look forward to witnessing how you will embody our belief that every person and every interaction matters, as you change the world for the better.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan is resigning after she was convicted last month of a felony for helping a man avoid immigration enforcement agents in the county courthouse. 
Dugan submitted her letter of resignation to Gov. Tony Evers on Saturday, writing that serving as a judge has been “the honor of my life.” 
“Behind the bench, I have presided over thousands and thousands of cases — with a commitment to treat all persons with dignity and respect, to act justly, deliberatively, and consistently, and to maintain a courtroom with the decorum and safety the public deserves,” Dugan wrote.
Dugan was convicted last month of felony obstruction of justice following a four-day federal trial. The split jury also found she was not guilty of a related misdemeanor. 
The case against her stemmed from an incident at the courthouse April 18 in which she directed an immigrant appearing before her who was in the U.S. without legal authorization through a side door out of her courtroom while federal agents waited in the hallway outside to arrest him. Agents later apprehended the man outside the building. 
Since her April arrest, Dugan’s case has drawn national political attention as an illustration of the Trump administration’s efforts to increase immigration enforcement in ways that many critics say are heavy handed.  
Following the verdict, Wisconsin Republicans demanded that Dugan resign immediately, citing state law that forbids anyone who has been convicted of a felony from serving as a judge. She has been suspended from duty since her arrest. 
Dugan has not yet been sentenced and her legal team has signaled they’ll make a broad and lengthy appeal effort. But Dugan wrote in her letter that the people of Milwaukee County need a permanent judge on the bench. 
“I am the subject of unprecedented federal legal proceedings, which are far from concluded but which present immense and complex challenges that threaten the independence of our judiciary,” Dugan wrote. “I am pursuing this fight for myself and for our independent judiciary. However, the Wisconsin citizens that I cherish deserve to start the year with a judge on the bench in Milwaukee County Branch 31 rather than have the fate of that Court rest in a partisan fight in the state Legislature.”

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)New analysis of federal and state data by the Maine Center for Economic Policy shows the number of Canadians visiting Maine has plummeted since President Donald Trump’s inauguration and as a result economic activity in Maine’s border communities has shrunk significantly.
Since January, Trump has made a number of antagonistic moves towards Canada, from imposing tariffs, accusing the country of allowing fentanyl smugglers to operate unhindered, to threatening to annex the country as the “51st state.” Canadians have responded with their own tariffs and boycotts of American-made products and travel to the United States. 
Because of the president’s immigration policy, many people are afraid to visit the US. Some Canadian students at the University of Maine at Fort Kent and Presque Isle have chosen to complete courses online rather than face increased scrutiny when crossing the border for classes.
The impact of this deterioration in US-Canada relations is materializing on the border in Maine and other states. Since Trump’s inauguration in January through November, almost 750,000 fewer people have crossed the land border into Maine. The largest year-over-year drop-off occurred in April, when there were 35% fewer crossings than in the year before. Since then, visitation has increased somewhat, but crossings were still a quarter lower than expected in November.

Separate data collected by the Canadian government, which records the nationality of travelers crossing the border, reveals this decline is almost entirely driven by Canadians staying away from the US. Between February and July, 367,000 fewer Canadians crossed the Maine-New Brunswick border than the year before, while the number of travelers of other nationalities was just 7,000 fewer. 
The Canadian boycott of Maine has had repercussions on the state’s economy, especially in areas near the border. Fewer Canadian visitors means less money spent in local stores and restaurants. While the Maine Office of Tourism reports Canadians accounted for just 5% of the state’s tourists in 2024, this likely only captures a portion of the Canadians who typically visit Maine — and those visitors have the greatest impact in communities along the border. 
Spending data from Maine Revenue Services show taxable retail sales in the areas of Maine along the Canadian border saw a 3.3% slump in spending between February and August of 2025 compared to the year before. This contrasts with the rest of Maine, where spending rose 1.0% in the same time period. The effect was larger in the restaurant and lodging sector, where sales in border regions were down almost 5%, and up 1.7% in the rest of the state. The area around Biddeford and Old Orchard Beach, which is famously popular with Canadian tourists, also saw a decline in restaurant and lodging sales compared to last year.  
The data show just how damaging President Trump’s rhetoric and policies have been to Maine communities. Many small businesses run on very small margins, and a 3-5% drop in sales can create serious trouble for their finances. The data also demonstrates the way in which Maine and Canada are intertwined economically, especially in border communities. Some of these same areas have struggled economically for years and are the kinds of places President Trump promised to help. Instead, his aggressive foreign policy, chaotic approach to tariffs, and inhumane immigration crackdown have served to make these parts of Maine more isolated and economically worse off.

Mark Kelly for illegal orders video,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pentagon-will-try-penalize-arizona-sen-mark-kelly-illegal-orders-video,,"WASHINGTON — The Defense Department will attempt to downgrade Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly’s retirement rank and pay, seeking to punish him for making a video along with other Democrats in Congress, who told members of the military they didn’t need to follow illegal orders. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth originally threatened to recall Kelly from military retirement and court-martial him for his participation in the video, but announced Monday that the department would instead try to downgrade his rank of captain as well as his retirement pay. “Captain Kelly has been provided notice of the basis for this action and has thirty days to submit a response,” Hegseth wrote in a social media post. “The retirement grade determination process directed by Secretary Hegseth will be completed within forty five days.”Hegseth added that Kelly’s “status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.”Kelly wrote in a social media post that he planned to challenge Hegseth’s attempt to alter his retirement rank and pay, arguing it’s an attempt to punish him for challenging the Trump administration. “My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head– all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,” Kelly wrote. “Generations of servicemembers have made these same patriotic sacrifices for this country, earning the respect, appreciation, and rank they deserve.”Kelly added that Hegseth’s goal with the process is to “send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn’t like, they will come after them the same way. It’s outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.”Constitutional protectionMembers of Congress are generally protected under the speech and debate clause of the U.S. Constitution, which states that unless a lawmaker is involved in treason, felony and breach of the peace, they are “privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.”The Defense Department letter of censure to Kelly alleged that his participation in the video undermined the military chain of command, counseled disobedience, created confusion about duty, brought discredit upon the Armed Forces and included conduct unbecoming of an officer. Hegseth wrote in that letter that if Kelly continues “to engage in conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline, you may subject yourself to criminal prosecution or further administrative action.”Allegations of misconductThe Department of Defense posted in late November that officials were looking into “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly for appearing in the video. It didn’t detail how Kelly might have violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice but stated that “a thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.” Hegseth referred the issue to Navy Secretary John Phelan for any “review, consideration, and disposition” he deemed appropriate. Hegseth then asked for a briefing on the outcome of the review “by no later than December 10.”Kelly said during a press conference in early December the military’s investigation and a separate one by the FBI were designed to intimidate the six lawmakers in the video from speaking out against Trump. The lawmakers in the video, who have backgrounds in the military or intelligence agencies, told members of those communities they “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” they said. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”The other Democrats in the video — Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, Pennsylvania Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and New Hampshire Rep. Maggie Goodlander — are not subject to the military justice system. Trump railed against the video a couple of days after it posted, saying the statements represented “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”",,,,2026-01-05 13:12:16.281733

Results are good so far, but some want quality assurances codified into law.","For years, Connecticut residents who receive benefits through the Department of Social Services have dealt with arduous wait times whenever they need support from the agency’s call centers. 
Bobby Berriault, who receives SNAP food assistance and Medicaid benefits, said he spent nearly two hours on hold one day in October trying to resolve a billing issue. His first call dropped after 41 minutes on hold. When he tried back later that day, he waited another 48 minutes before reaching someone.
Berriault considers himself luckier than most. 
Many people don’t have two hours to spend on the phone, he said. Plus, Berriault lives in New Haven, where he said it’s easy enough to hop on the bus and head to the city’s DSS resource center if he can’t get through on the phone. But, he knows there are people who don’t live on bus lines or close to one of the agency’s physical locations.
“The only way that they’re going to be able to get the services that they need to survive is by connecting with someone on the phone. That’s why this issue is really important,” Berriault said.
The agency recently launched a new, modernized phone system meant to address the long wait times. Deputy commissioner Easha Canada said they’re already seeing results. 
“Providing a dignified experience for the 1.2 million people in Connecticut who are serviced by DSS is really, really important to this administration,” Canada said. “We’re really excited about some of the improvements that we’re seeing already.”
In October, the average wait time to get a simple question answered — such as, “Did DSS receive my SNAP application?” or “When will my Medicaid eligibility be determined?” — was 43 minutes. In the first 10 days after the new phone system launched, average wait times fell to just under seven minutes at the nine locations where it was implemented. Call abandonment rates dropped from 48% to 22%. 
The new system includes several features that the old system did not. Instead of sitting on hold, people can leave a voicemail and specify a convenient time to receive a call back. They can also use simplified menu options to indicate the issue they need addressed, so they don’t end up speaking to a Medicaid specialist if they need help with SNAP. 
All 12 call centers will have the new system by the end of January, Canada said.
What took so long?
Berriault has been receiving DSS benefits since 2009 and he said wait times have been an issue since the state implemented a centralized call center in 2013. Before that, each enrollee worked with a dedicated case worker who was familiar with their situation.
“You didn’t call the main number for DSS. You just called your case worker,” Berriault said. “It was a much better system.”
Sheldon Toubman, an attorney with Disability Rights CT, said DSS has never managed to find a sustainable solution for the wait times. Whenever the issue hits a crisis point, the agency hires more staff. But the call center positions have high attrition rates, and the issue inevitably arises again once people leave those roles. 
Advocates are encouraged by the new phone system but they want to see quality assurances guaranteed by law. Some are calling for lawmakers to establish performance metrics for the call centers during the 2026 legislative session. 
Ahead of November’s special session of the General Assembly, Toubman sent a letter on behalf of 24 organizations to legislative leadership calling for statutory requirements to be set at 90% of calls answered within 60 seconds by a human — a metric that mirrors the department’s standards for its contractors.
DSS spokesperson Jalmar De Dios said the agency “supports transparency and accountability,” but that vendors can rapidly scale operations in a way that a state agency cannot.
“Any expansion of performance metrics should be to meaningfully improve service delivery and the client experience rather than creating expectations that do not reflect the operational realities of a public service agency,” De Dios said in an emailed statement.
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, who heads up the Human Services Committee with Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, said the two haven’t yet discussed such legislation. But she said she’s interested in a long-term fix for the problem, which she said Gov. Ned Lamont and his budget staff at the Office of Policy and Management have failed to provide.
During the COVID-19 emergency, Connecticut used federal funds from the American Rescue Plan Act to staff up the call centers, and wait times improved, Gilchrest said. But when that funding lapsed, the state didn’t replace it, and DSS had to cut call center staff from 125 employees to 40. 
Gilchrest said she’s appreciative of recent improvements but wants to see the issue remain a priority. 
“Many of us were beating that drum and OPM did not put the money in,” Gilchrest said. “We needed this for a while, and I don’t want it to go away.”
De Dios said the ARPA funding was specifically meant to assist with a temporary projected uptake in call center volume as a result of Medicaid “unwinding,” a period beginning in March 2023 where COVID-era eligibility expansions expired and many people were expected to lose coverage. 
Both Toubman and Gilchrest want DSS to establish the number of staff it needs for the call centers to run efficiently and then regularly report how many staff they have, including government employees and vendor partners. 
DSS currently has 59 staff members to handle simpler requests, known as “tier 1,” up from 40 at the beginning of last year, according to De Dios.
Toubman said a permanent fix is particularly important given the new burdens that new federal legislation, H.R. 1 — also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill — places on DSS. New SNAP eligibility requirements began in November. In 2027, Medicaid work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks will also go into effect.
“It’s going to be imperative that there’s a good system where scared people, or people who get terrible notices, can go for help to understand what’s going on,” Toubman said.
Canada said the agency is working to meet these demands. It’s already contracted with a vendor to help with increased call volume following the SNAP changes. Staff are updating systems to be able to perform streamlined income verification for gig workers, as well as pull in education enrollment data to verify future community engagement requirements for Medicaid. 
And in response to Berriault’s recommendation that the call center return to a case worker model, Canada said nothing is off the table.
“As we’re looking at the One Big Beautiful Bill, we’re evaluating new ways of working,” Canada said, including new technologies and processes. But the agency hasn’t yet “landed on what that should look like,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1119_SR_DSSCallCenter_052-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 13:12:16.281733

DeSantis, often hyperactive on social media, was one of the few state leaders who’d stayed quiet in the first days following the operation — even though the Sunshine State boasts the largest Venezuelan community in the nation.
On Monday, he broke his silence.
“We’ve seen the country of Venezuela suffering under the yoke of Marxist ideology, first with Hugo Chávez and then with Nicolás Maduro,” DeSantis said, speaking alongside members of the Florida Cabinet at the entrance to the detention facility his administration has been calling “Deportation Depot” to announce more than 10,000 arrests of undocumented migrants.
“You will be hard pressed to find a reign as destructive as the Chávez-Maduro reign has been; taking a country that has been prosperous with an abundance of resources and basically destroying it and making it so that it’s miserable, repressed, and now one of the poorest countries,” he added.
Late Saturday night, American forces captured Maduro and his wife and brought them to New York. Both were arraigned in federal court on drug trafficking charges.
Doral in South Florida is home to the largest Venezuelan community in the United States. More than 34,000 of its 81,000 residents are of Venezuelan descent.
What was the conference about?
DeSantis called the news conference to celebrate the continuance of Operation Tidal Wave, a detention round-up launched in late April that initially captured more than 1,000 undocumented migrants. Of the updated total as of Monday, DeSantis said, 63% had past criminal charges.
Built at the defunct Baker Correctional Institution in Sanderson — midway between Gainesville and Jacksonville — the state opened “Deportation Depot” mid-September to assist in mass detentions and deportations. It can accommodate 1,310 beds and is expected to hold as many as 2,000 people in a temporary capacity.
It’s been the launch point for 93 deportation flights containing 2,926 people since the center’s opening, DeSantis said.
The North Florida facility came two months after President Donald Trump joined Florida Republicans in opening “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Everglades, the nation’s first state-run detention center.
The state has also been planning for months to open a third center called the “Panhandle Pokey,” but DeSantis said Florida officials are “still waiting” for the Department of Homeland Security to approve it.
He added that Florida may open a fourth detention center in southern Florida. The governor said he’s looking at a number of options but wants to make sure it would “make sense” both in terms of finances and capacity.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security awarded Florida in September a $608 million reimbursement grant for costs associated with the detention and deportation of migrants. This came months after Florida became the first — and only — state to require all 67 counties to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The anti-undocumented immigration sentiment sweeping Florida politics was both inspired by and mirrored in the White House after Trump took office in January 2025. Trump, beginning his second term, emphasized sealing the southern border as a top priority for his administration and removing migrants in the country without official permission.
Florida Republicans heartily agreed. The GOP-dominated Legislature passed a comprehensive law in early 2025 — weeks after Trump’s inauguration — creating state-level penalties for illegally entering Florida, mandating the death penalty for noncitizens who commit capital crimes, and nixing in-state tuition for undocumented college students.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0904-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 13:12:16.281733

Tim Walz ended his campaign for a historic third term on Monday amid mounting pressure from members of his own party and intense attacks from Republicans over widespread fraud in state-run social services programs.

 Gov. Tony Evers statement on Walz decision to suspend campaign
Gov. Tony Evers released the following statement on Gov. Tim Walz ‘s announcement:
“Tim has always been a good friend and a good neighbor to us across the river, and I’m incredibly grateful we’ve had the opportunity to serve as governors of our states together. I’ve always appreciated our friendship, Tim’s wit and candor, and how relentless he is about working to improve the everyday lives of Minnesotans and people across our country.
“Most of all, Tim is a devoted husband and father, and he is a dedicated public servant who’s spent his career putting others before himself—and that’s just as true today as it’s ever been.
“Kathy and I are thinking of Tim and Gwen and the kids today, as we know how important family is when making these kinds of decisions. We’re grateful to call them friends.
“I look forward to working with Tim in the days and months ahead as we continue getting good things done for the people of our states.”


	
[/infobox]Walz defended his record in a statement and said he was certain he could win a third term, but couldn’t give his entire attention to rooting out fraud while running a campaign.
“I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work,” Walz said in a statement.
Some Democratic-Farmer-Labor elected officials have quietly worried for months that Walz’s name at the top of the ticket would hand Republicans the governorship for the first time in 15 years and sink Democrats’ prospects down the ballot.
Walz met on Sunday with U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who expressed her interest in running for governor, The New York Times reported. Other possible Democratic candidates include Attorney General Keith Ellison and Secretary of State Steve Simon
A slew of Republicans have already entered the race including House Speaker Lisa Demuth, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and former congressional candidate Kendall Qualls.
Walz spent 12 years in Congress before winning the governor’s race in 2018. After the DFL won control of both chambers of the Legislature in 2022, Walz signed in the law the most significant progressive agenda in at least a generation, including free school meals for all students; paid family and medical leave; and the legalization of marijuana.
He burst onto the national political stage in 2024 after former President Joe Biden abandoned his campaign for re-election and then-Vice President Kamala Harris selected Walz as her running mate. Walz became a frequent target of President Donald Trump, whose attacks continued even after Trump won the presidential election.
Walz announced in September that he would run for an unprecedented third, four-year term, after deliberating for months. The assassination of Walz’s friend and close ally, House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman in June, forced Walz and his family to weigh the potential costs of another four years in office.
Trump’s attacks on Walz ratcheted up in recent months as national Republicans learned about the wide-scale fraud that has taken place in Minnesota’s social services programs during his tenure, including the highly-publicized Feeding Our Future scandal, in which fraudsters pocketed hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars intended to feed children during the pandemic.
In December, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson announced new fraud charges in state-administered Medicaid programs, estimating that fraudsters have stolen as much as $9 billion in government funds. Walz disputed Thompson’s estimate, painting it as a political attack.






Read Gov. Tim Walz’s full statement:
Good morning, and Happy New Year.
Like many Minnesotans, I was glad to turn the page on 2025. It was an extraordinarily difficult year for our state. And it ended on a particularly sour note.
For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state’s generosity. And even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.
I won’t mince words here. Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St. Paul, and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place. They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family. They’ve already begun by taking our tax dollars that were meant to help families afford child care. And they have no intention of stopping there.
Make no mistake: We should be concerned about fraud in our state government. We cannot effectively deliver programs and services if we can’t earn the public’s trust. That’s why, over the past few years, we’ve made systemic changes to the way we do business.
We’ve gone to the legislature time and again to get more tools to combat fraud. We’ve fired people who weren’t doing their jobs. We’ve seen people go to jail for stealing from our state. We’ve cut off whole streams of funding, in partnership with the federal government, where we saw widespread criminal activity. We’ve put new locks on the doors of our remaining programs, and we’ve hired a new head of program integrity to make sure those locks can’t be broken.
All across the state, Minnesotans are hard at work on this problem. Advocates, administrators, investigators are on the front lines defending the integrity of our state’s programs, and I want to thank them for their efforts.
There’s more to do. A single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud is a dollar too much to tolerate. And while there’s a role to play for everyone – from the legislature to prosecutors to insurance companies to local and county government – the buck stops with me. My administration is taking fast, decisive action to solve this crisis. And we will win the fight against the fraudsters.
But the political gamesmanship we’re seeing from Republicans is only making that fight harder to win.
We’ve got Republicans here in the legislature playing hide-and-seek with whistleblowers.
We’ve got conspiracy theorist right-wing YouTubers breaking into daycare centers and demanding access to our children.
We’ve got the President of the United States demonizing our Somali neighbors and wrongly confiscating childcare funding that Minnesotans rely on.
It is disgusting. And it is dangerous.
Republicans are playing politics with the future of our state. And it’s shameful. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: We welcome ideas from anyone, in any party, who wants to help us continue to stay ahead of the criminals.
And we welcome the involvement of the federal government. I’m grateful to the career professionals at the U.S. Attorney’s office and the FBI who are helping us win this fight.
But I cannot abide the actions of the political leadership in Washington – these opportunists who are willing to hurt our people to score a few cheap points. They and their allies have no intention of helping us solve the problem – and every intention of profiting off of it.
Which brings me to this: 2026 is an election year. And election years have a way of ramping up the politics at a time when we simply can’t afford more politics.
In September, I announced that I would run for a historic third term as Minnesota’s Governor. And I have every confidence that, if I gave it my all, I would succeed in that effort.
But as I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all. Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.
So I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.
I know this news may come as a surprise. But I’m passing on the race with zero sadness and zero regret. After all, I didn’t run for this job so I could have this job. I ran for this job so I could do this job. Minnesota faces an enormous challenge this year. And I refuse to spend even one minute of 2026 doing anything other than rising to meet the moment. Minnesota has to come first – always.
That’s what I believe servant leadership demands of me. And as an optimist, I will hold out some hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will consider what servant leadership demands of them in this moment. We can work together to combat the criminals, rebuild the public’s trust, and make our state stronger. But make no mistake: If Republicans continue down this path of abusing power, smearing entire communities, and running their own fraudulent game at the expense of Minnesotans – we will fight back every step of the way.
I’m confident that a DFLer will hold this seat come November. I’m confident that I will find ways to contribute to the state I love even after I’ve left office next January. But there will be time to worry about all that later.
Today, I’m proud of the work we’ve done to make Minnesota America’s best place to live and raise kids – from our new paid leave policy to our child tax credit to our free lunch program.
And I’m doubly proud of the incredible team we’ve put together to make that vision a reality. Thank you to every member of my staff, and every state employee, who’s part of this fight. We need you on the job to tackle the important work ahead.
Most of all, I want Minnesotans to know that I’m on the job, 24/7, focused on making sure we stay America’s best place to live and raise kids. No one will take that away from us. Not the fraudsters. And not the President. Not on my watch.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Court of Appeals website)TOPEKA — The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of a lawsuit filed on behalf of a Kansas Army National Guard soldier alleging she was fired from a civilian job in violation of federal law offering employment protection to individuals deployed for military service.
The decision by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals sought clarity to the definition of “employer” in terms of whether the Finney County Health Department and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment were responsible for maneuvering in 2010 that ended Staff Sgt. Stacey Gonzales’ employment as a disease intervention specialist.
The appellate court said a federal district court judge improperly dismissed in 2024 the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2022 alleging KDHE engaged in “reckless disregard” of federal law — the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 — implemented to shield employment rights of military servicemembers.
The Court of Appeals’ decision in late December reversed the district court’s summary judgment in favor of Kansas and sent the case back for further proceedings.
The district court judge had concluded KDHE wasn’t Gonzales’ employer, but the appellate court held the definition of employer under USERRA also covered entities that exercised control over employment opportunities of employees.
“The record evidence … allows a reasonable finding that KDHE retained the requisite level of control over Gonzales’s employment opportunities to be a USERRA employer,” the appellate court said. “The district court’s order granting summary judgment is therefore reversed.”
Gonzales, of Garden City, sought through the Justice Department suit lost wages and benefits as a result of KDHE’s decision to end grant funding to the Finney County’s disease prevention program and the ultimate termination of her employment.
From 2001 to 2010, Gonzales served as Finney County’s local disease intervention specialist. She intermittently had military obligations, during which she was absent from the civilian job. Gonzales deployed overseas twice to Iraq and once to Kuwait during her time in the National Guard.
In the disease specialist job, the Court of Appeals said, Gonzales was supervised by local and state personnel. Her salary and benefits were determined and paid by Finney County, the appellate court said, but her day-to-day work, training and performance evaluations involved significant oversight from KDHE.
When KDHE decided not to renew the Aid-to-Local grant in 2010 due to perceived performance deficiencies, Finney County terminated Gonzales’ position.
“The evidence indicates KDHE had some influence on the hiring of Gonzales in 2001 and the elimination of her position in 2010,” the Court of Appeals said. “Whether that rose to the level of KDHE being a USERRA employer by having sufficient control of Gonzales’s employment opportunities was something the district court did not adequately address.”
Attorneys representing the state of Kansas argued the Justice Department’s “expansive” interpretation of USERRA suggested the definition of employer could mean the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention also was Gonzales’ employer because grant funding for the job in Finney County originated with the federal agency and was passed through the state to the county.
However, the Court of Appeals discounted that theory and outlined evidence Gonzales’ evaluations were limited to a “joint venture involving both Finney County and KDHE.”
“The district court’s summary judgment ruling was driven by its erroneous view of the grant relationship between KDHE and Finney County,” the appellate court said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Denver-court-of-appeals-2.png,,,2026-01-05 12:57:05.578583

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa by Nima Gharavi, a YouTuber and self-described “registered wrestling official” with the National Collegiate Athletic Association, Illinois High School Athletic Association, Illinois Elementary School Association and other entities.
The lawsuit names as a defendant Allyson Schwab of the Cedar Falls area, a photographer who allegedly has a substantial social media following for the youth wrestling content she produces.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In his lawsuit, Gharavi alleges that for many years, he has created videos of youth wrestling matches, initially for the exclusive use of wrestling officials. Gharavi says he subsequently created a public YouTube channel to share his passion for the sport and called it Midwest Wrestle. That channel now has more than 175,000 followers on YouTube, Gharavi claims.
At some point, the lawsuit alleges, Gharavi realized that some websites with which he has no connection had copied, without his knowledge or permission, video content from Midwest Wrestle and posted it to third-party websites that contained pornography or other objectionable content.
As a result, Gharavi submitted hundreds of formal “take-down requests” to various websites, asking them to remove his content from their sites, and also served 11 subpoenas to various website hosts and platforms, seeking information on those who had pirated his videos.
In December 2023 and January 2024, the lawsuit alleges, Schwab published multiple posts to her X (formerly Twitter) account, encouraging parents to watch out for “suggestive” online videos of youth wrestling matches that were generating hundreds of thousands of views.
“This makes me sick and why I got this convo going,” Schwab allegedly wrote in one post. “So many parents don’t know their kids are on someone’s YouTube… No reason a 46kg youth girls match should have 2.6 million views … The kids think it’s normal to have 400k views on their video from a local youth or hs tournament…”
The lawsuit states that while Schwab’s posts did not explicitly name Gharavi or Midwest Wrestle, details in her posts corresponded to Midwest Wrestle’s viewership. For example, the lawsuit claims, Midwest Wrestle was the only YouTube channel to have garnered 2.6 million views of a 46kg youth girls wrestling match.
At about the same Schwab posted her comments, Gharavi was “ejected” from the Midlands Championships wrestling tournament by Northwestern University Head Wrestling Coach Matt Storniolo, the lawsuit alleges, asserting that Schwab had essentially accused Gharavi of conduct that “warranted denial of credentials by schools and tournament directors.”
After Gharavi was ejected from the Midlands Championships, Schwab “reached out to Coach Storniolo, unprompted, to praise him for ejecting Mr. Gharavi,” and called him her “hero,” the lawsuit asserts.
The lawsuit goes on to allege that in the ensuing months, several athletic organizations canceled or declined to renew their contracts with Gharavi, a third party published Gharavi’s home address on social media alongside the false allegations, and Gharavi was the target of threats and an attempted home break-in.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for defamation, invasion of privacy by painting Gharavi in a false light, intentional infliction of emotional distress and tortious interference with business relationships.
Schwab has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Schwab for comment.

On Monday, the Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection announced in a news release that it entered into a consent agreement with Bitcoin Depot, which operates Bitcoin kiosks, to recover $1.9 million that third-party scammers defrauded from Mainers through those kiosks.
Additionally, Bitcoin Depot will fully comply with Maine consumer protection laws to operate as a money transmitter in the state as part of the agreement. 
This agreement comes after Gov. Janet Mills signed emergency legislation last June that limits daily transmission amounts and caps fees and exchange rates at virtual currency kiosks. The legislation also provides redress for consumers.
In addition, Mills has signed other legislation to protect Maine consumers from third-party scammers, including the Maine Money Transmission Modernization Act in 2024. 
Linda Conti, superintendent of the credit protection bureau, credited Maine’s new consumer protection laws for allowing the state to reach the agreement with Bitcoin Depot and recoup those losses. She specifically mentioned the “unhosted wallet provision under Maine law, which requires money transmitters to employ new technologies to ensure that Maine consumers own and control their virtual wallets.”

The U.S. House Appropriations committee, responsible for regulating government expenditures, proposed in September to eliminate the National Institute of Nursing Research and all Nursing Workforce Development programs, except the Nurse Corps. The programs represent the only dedicated federal funding for nursing education.
The cuts align with the Trump administration’s request to eliminate Title VIII programs but have yet to be approved by Congress. The official federal budget is currently set to be passed by Jan. 30.
 Potential for impact to patient care

According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, the National Institute of Nursing Research received $197.693 million in federal funding, with $1,607,363 dedicated to research in Missouri during fiscal year 2024. It is the only institute that exists solely to support nursing research, typically done by nurse educators and practitioners.
“We view it as an integral component to the ecosystem of nursing education and research,” said Josh Adams, director of policy and regulatory affairs at the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
That impact extends beyond academia.
Lori Popejoy, dean at the University of Missouri’s Sinclair School of Nursing, said research plays a direct role in improving patient care.
“Everybody in the sphere of healthcare, research and education, is concerned with delivering the best quality care they can, and part of the research enterprise is discovering new, efficient, effective ways of doing that,” Popejoy said.
Adams expressed similar concerns about what’s at risk for health care professionals.
“I think the impact would be losing those insights and a forward momentum that is part of the enterprise of science in general, but in health care, we are always working to try to deliver better, higher quality health care to as many people as possible. I think losing the research that informs how we do that would be incredibly detrimental,” Adams said.
 Nursing Workforce Development programs

The Nursing Workforce Development programs live under Title VIII in the Public Service Act, reauthorized in 2020. The programs provide federal grants to support nursing education, expand the nursing workforce and strengthen access to care in underserved communities.
Its elimination would result in a nearly $50 million decrease nationally from the current funds of $305.472 million for these programs, resulting in funding levels that have not been seen since FY 2020. Missouri received $4,795,783 in Title VIII funding in FY 2023.
One of the programs that has already been canceled is the Nurse Faculty Loan Program, a key component of the Nursing Workforce Development portfolio.
The program provided low-interest loans to graduate nursing students who planned to become faculty members. Those who went on to teach full time for up to four years could have as much as 85% of their loan balance, including interest, forgiven.
“For myself, I used the Nurse Faculty Loan Program, and some of my student loan funding was cut due to change in the Presidential Office,” said Karina Floyd, director of nursing at Stephens College. “I don’t know if I would’ve pursued an MSN and Ph.D. in nursing if I knew the government would move the student loan contracts and delete the programs.”
Both Floyd and Popejoy, leaders of nursing schools in Columbia, expressed concern about the consequences of this cancellation, saying that it not only hurts current nursing faculty students, but could also deter prospective graduate nursing students from continuing their education.
“When I finished my Ph.D., I had a John A. Hartford Foundation pre-doctoral scholarship, and it covered all my education and a stipend,” Popejoy said. “I walked away from my graduate education without any debt because of that scholarship. That’s the best-case scenario for students. And there’s fewer and fewer of those opportunities privately available.”
Floyd said that nursing programs are already reporting that students are pausing or giving up plans for advanced nursing degrees due to the debt cap.
“If this continues, it will directly weaken the education-to-workforce pipeline at every level, not just graduate programs,” she said.
“You’re strangling it at the beginning, and that pipeline just narrows all the way through,” Popejoy added.
Both education advocates and administrators recognize how vital this funding is to help improve access to health care across the state and the country.
“Title VIII funding was created to strengthen the national nursing workforce, particularly in moments of high demand,” Floyd said.
She said reducing support now could worsen existing shortages.
“Hospitals depend on nurses who pursue graduate preparation to become faculty, managers, clinical educators and advanced practice clinicians. When graduate education becomes financially out of reach, the pipeline of future nurse educators shrinks, and that directly limits how many new nurses can be trained,” Floyd said.
“It ultimately affects Missouri patients and the safety and stability of our health care system. As schools of nursing work toward expansion to meet workforce needs, these reductions risk slowing or preventing that growth precisely when the state needs more nurses, not fewer,” she added.
While Congress returned to work this week, they still have time to potentially reinstate funding for the National Institute of Nursing Research and Title VIII programs and deny the president and the House Appropriations Committee’s requests to eliminate this funding.
Both Popejoy and Adams are encouraged by the level of support from the public and nursing advocates like the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
“I think that there’s enough push from the agencies nationally on Congress, and we’re seeing a huge amount of blowback and frustration from the public,” Popejoy said.
“We saw reasonably positive funding support coming out of both the House and the Senate,” Adams added. “There was some separation in what they were comfortable allocating, but there’s support for these programs.”

Photo by Heerea Rikhraj/New Mexico In Depth)Dr. Alana Williams watched her medical malpractice insurance premiums nearly double between 2018 and 2023—from $44,908 to $77,394.
The Albuquerque OB-GYN faced a choice: keep performing gynecological surgery and watch her costs climb, or scale back her practice to survive.
She chose survival. When Williams stopped offering surgery in 2024, her premiums dropped to $16,463.

This story was originally published by New Mexico In Depth.

“I had to drop it to sustain my independent practice,” Williams said.
Her former partner made a different choice. After paying $72,346 in insurance premiums in 2024, she left the practice to join Lovelace hospital, where the hospital covers physician insurance costs.
OB-GYNs care for women during pregnancy and childbirth and treat the full range of pelvic and gynecologic health issues across a woman’s life. The work often involves high-stakes care for two lives at once, making the specialty particularly vulnerable to lawsuits. They’ve long carried some of the highest malpractice insurance costs of any medical specialty nationwide. But what was already expensive in New Mexico has become dramatically worse.
In recent years, premiums have surged. Since January of 2022, rates across specialties have increased by about 40%, according to a presentation to state lawmakers in November by the state’s Superintendent of Insurance. New Mexico OB-GYNs pay nearly double what their counterparts in surrounding states pay for malpractice insurance. Their premiums are $107,961, on average, compared to $59,133 in Arizona, $48,966 in Colorado, and $60,707 in Texas.

Superintendent of Insurance Alice Kane pointed to complicated 2021 reforms to the Medical Malpractice Act as one culprit for the sharp increase.
Among the  reforms, damage caps for individual providers were raised from $600,000 to $750,000. Perhaps most dramatically, lawmakers raised, over five years, the maximum malpractice damages a hospital can owe for pain, suffering and other non-medical losses from $600,000 to $6 million in 2026.
And while independent providers remain covered by the state fund that helps pay large verdicts and medical costs, lawmakers phased hospitals out of the fund starting in 2027. The state fund had begun to run a deficit that studies for the Legislature ascribed to large malpractice awards against hospitals. So now, hospitals, or their insurers, will be on the hook for all of the damages awarded to patients who sue them.
These changes significantly increase the financial risk for hospitals that employ many OB-GYNs.
What remained unchanged was another source of potential costs: past or future medical care needed by the plaintiff because of the negligence of the doctor in the event the physician loses in court.
Also unchanged was the lack of caps on punitive damages, which insurers usually don’t cover in their policies. These are the awards that juries give to punish bad behavior—reckless, willful or even malicious conduct that leads to harm—rather than to compensate the victim.
Providers, both independent and hospitals, are on the hook for punitive damages. They need to pay out unless they find an insurance company willing to cover them.
The Doctors Company, which insures the majority of independent physicians in New Mexico, raised its rates by 20% in 2022, the year following passage of the reforms.
Independent OB-GYN doctors like Dr. Steve Gough are struggling. He said he paid $92,000 in 2024 and expects his rate to increase by at least 15% in 2025. “Despite the insurance rates going up, my salary hasn’t doubled to accommodate,” he said. Gough said he knew of several OB-GYNs who’ve left the state because of increasing insurance rates.
The stakes are high when it comes to maternal care.
Data show that New Mexico was losing OB-GYNs before the insurance spike in recent years. Between 2017 and 2021—before the Medical Malpractice Act reforms passed—the state lost 22% (or 63) of its OB-GYNs, according to the 2023 New Mexico Healthcare Workforce Committee Report.
As of 2024, at least 33% of New Mexico’s counties have no access to OB-GYNs or prenatal care, according to the March of Dimes—making them “maternity care deserts.” Nearly 18% of women in New Mexico lack access to birthing hospitals within 30 minutes of where they live, compared to the national average of 9.7%, according to the March of Dimes report.
Rural hospital administrators and state officials cite multiple factors for the lack of maternal care access, especially in rural areas: dwindling rural populations that mean fewer births, low Medicaid reimbursement rates that don’t cover costs, the expense of maintaining specialized staff around the clock regardless of patient volume, and changes in federal funding that reduced payments to rural hospitals starting in 2020.
“We’ve had several hospitals close their obstetrics wings, as a result of needing to make some changes for their own operating costs,” Lorelei Kellogg, acting Medicaid Director at the New Mexico Human Services Department, told New Mexico In Depth in 2024.
Malpractice insurance costs can compound these challenges, particularly for rural facilities already operating on thin margins. “The premiums are just too expensive to maintain,” said James Kiser, CEO of Holy Cross Medical Center in Taos.
The state has taken some steps since 2021 to more precisely target reforms. In 2023, lawmakers  lowered damage caps for most independent outpatient facilities so they wouldn’t face the same liability as hospitals. And during the 2024 legislative session, lawmakers appropriated $15.4 million in one-time subsidies to help offset medical malpractice insurance costs for individual providers and independent group practices, according to the Office of Superintendent of Insurance.
But finding lasting solutions has proven contentious.
Nick Autio, general counsel at the New Mexico Medical Society, said the complexity of the insurance industry makes solutions elusive. “We don’t have enough data to know. If we had a well-funded task force from the Senate, with actuaries involved and people with actual expertise, we can start getting to a solution.”
“All the actors involved in this space need to sit together and come up with solutions,” he said.
For Williams and Gough, the stakes are clear.
“What’s left is that there are less and less independent providers in the state that will be able to provide these services,” Williams said.
Gough sees the impact daily in his exam rooms, as pregnant women describe the lengths they go to for basic care.
“There are lots of negative things that we’re going to see as fewer and fewer hospitals in our state elect to do obstetrics,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AlanaWilliams-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 11:56:57.228080

But the state’s Democratic representatives in Congress said Trump bypassed legislative branch approval to launch a military strike that has the potential to destabilize Venezuela – even if they agreed that Maduro was a dictator.
The Venezuelan president’s 2024 reelection was determined by many countries, including the U.S., to be illegitimate, while he has been characterized by the administration as the leader of a drug cartel. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who was also captured in Saturday’s raid, were brought to New York to face a U.S. indictment on narco-terrorism and conspiracy charges originally levied in 2020. 
Trump said in a news conference Saturday that the intention was not to necessarily free the Venezuelan people from Maduro’s rule, but rather to secure the nation’s vast oil resources. He added that American petroleum companies would ultimately finance the rebuilding of Venezuela’s oil infrastructure.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also signaled that nations like Cuba could face similar treatment.
Trump says US ‘will run’ Venezuela during transition after capture of President Maduro

In Michigan, key congressional Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate denounced the move.
U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield) said in a statement that the U.S. should not drag itself into another “forever war that puts American servicemembers in harm’s way and has no end in sight.”
“The president said the United States will now run the nation of Venezuela,” Peters wrote. “The American people did not ask for this. There’s no question that Maduro was a bad actor in the region, but that does not grant the administration unilateral authority to wage war without Congressional authorization. I’m also deeply concerned this action could embolden our adversaries like Russia and China to attempt to remove the legitimate leaders of U.S. allies around the world.”
Peters demanded that the Trump administration “immediately provide Congress and the American people with the legal justification for this mission and how they plan to ensure it does not lead to the destabilization of Venezuela and the entire region.”
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly), who has become one of Michigan’s foremost critics of Trump’s domestic and foreign policies, said Trump’s break-neck military action against Venezuela “continues the signature trend of his presidency: relentless focus on foreign entanglements and looking tough abroad, so as to distract from what’s happening to Americans’ pocketbooks. “
“So instead of action on health care costs or housing or energy bills, Americans get military action in Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, the Caribbean, the Pacific, and now a long-term engagement in Venezuela,” Slotkin said. “Despite all the talking points to the media — and by Cabinet members directly to senators last month — this was never about stopping the drug cartels. If it were, President Trump wouldn’t have pardoned drug kingpin Juan Orlando Hernández, and he’d be going after Mexican cartels that move the fentanyl that’s killed hundreds of thousands of Americans — not fishing boats full of cocaine or, ultimately, the Venezuelan oil fields.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Slotkin added that Trump’s only aim was for regime change and an oil grab.
“Maduro is a bad man, and the people of Venezuela deserve better,” Slotkin said. “But we know that regime change isn’t as simple as removing one leader. While there are comparisons to the arrest of Manuel Noriega in Panama in 1989, let’s not forget that the U.S. sent in over 27,000 troops and lost 23 servicemembers in the process. … The bottom line is that President Trump wants to look tough by attacking countries abroad to distract from his failure to attack the core issue of the cost of living at home.”
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Brimingham) decried Trump action without congressional approval.
“I’m grateful our service members made it home, but they never should have been sent on this mission in the first place. Michiganders don’t want more wars,” Stevens said. “I voted to put a stop to Trump’s military buildup in Venezuela, and I will work with my colleagues in Congress in the coming days to demand answers and accountability.”
That said, Stevens said the people and the Venezuelan people are safer with “Maduro’s violent regime out of power.” Still, she said Trump was essentially forcing Michiganders to cover the “billions of dollars it will take to rebuild and run Venezuela. Taking over another country while Americans can’t afford their rent and groceries is unacceptable.”
U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) said the opposition to military action against Venezuela and the kidnapping of Maduro wasn’t just about legal technicalities.
“It’s about the American people having a voice in decisions that could put our service members at risk and commit our tax dollars to conflict,” Scholten said in a statement.
U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Shri Thanedar, both representing Detroit, said the action was unconstitutional and violated international law.
“These are the actions of a rogue state,” Tlaib said in a statement on social media.

Trump’s illegal and unprovoked bombing of Venezuela and kidnapping of its president are grave violations of international law and the U.S. Constitution. These are the actions of a rogue state.
The American people do not want another regime change war abroad.

The state’s Republican members of Congress were far more congratulatory of Trump and what they called decisive executive action to rid the world of a dictator and an alleged drug trafficker – however, the narrative has moved away from allegations of Venezuela moving fentanyl into the U.S. to cocaine.
“(Maduro) was a transnational criminal and illegitimate dictator who directly enabled violent cartels to flood our country with illicit drugs, profit off the deaths of countless Americans, including friends of mine, and eliminate his political opponents,” said U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) in a statement. “I pray for the people of Venezuela, who have long suffered under the brutal rule of the Maduro regime. It is my hope to see them rise up and lead their country in a new direction of self-determination, peace and prosperity.”
Barrett, however, did ask that the president now work with Congress to obtain proper authorization for the continued use of military intervention in Venezuela, “a constitutional power specifically reserved for Congress,” Barrett added.
“I’ve also lost too many friends to open-ended nation building conflicts, and I spend each day in Congress reflecting on the total human cost of armed military intervention,” Barrett wrote. “Venezuela is not Afghanistan, but we still must demand clear and precise end goal objectives with a firm discipline against mission creep.”
U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) thanked the military for carrying out the operation with “skill and courage,” but also called on social media for the U.S. to recognize Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, “the rightful winner of the past election, as President and work with him in this time of transition until the Venezuelan people can hold a free and fair election.”
Trump, however, has indicated the U.S. will work instead with Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, who has since been installed as Venezuela’s interim leader.
U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), also brought up the specter of the forever war in the context of Venezuela, but unlike Barrett, James praised Trump for doing in “four hours” what other presidents took multiple terms to achieve in Afghanistan and Iraq – a bit of a misnomer considering the Iraq and Afghan wars ended in large U.S. death tolls, disastrous pullouts and the situation in Venezuela is far from resolved.
“I voted for this!” James wrote jubilation on social media.

Me and my buddies fought in a 20-year war because Bush and Obama couldn’t get done in four terms what Trump just got done in four hours.

Various military experts and pundits have weighed in on the strike, a decision that was carried out on the order of Trump and not gut-checked by members of Congress, who wield the sole lever to issue war powers to the president.
Trump’s administration has said that his cabinet had precedent to take action against Maduro, citing the 1990 decision from then President George H.W. Bush to detain former Panamanian President Manuel Noriega, which was aimed at securing the Panama Canal for Western interests.
NPR reported that the similarities stop there, given that U.S. troops left swiftly and handed over power to a popular opposition faction that was ready to take control of Panama. 
Trump has insinuated that the U.S. and its oil partners would “run” Venezuela until it was “safe” to engage in a “proper and judicious transition.”

Darby, Pennsylvania
Died Dec. 25, 2025
Colchester, Vermont
Details of services
A memorial service is planned for spring.

Suzanne Chant, 74, of South Burlington, died on Dec. 25, 2025, alongside family and friends, after a long illness.
Suzanne is survived by her children Gerry Canavan and wife Jaimee Hills, Patrick Canavan, and Ariel Chant and partner Will Willoughby. She was “Susu” to grandchildren Hannah, Zoey, Dalton, and Connor, and step-granddaughters Jalyn and Peyton.
Suzanne leaves her sister Kathy and husband Richard Yawarski; sister-in-law Gail St. Pierre; brother-in-law Marty Rawson; nieces Heather, Eileen, Elizabeth, Katie, and Colleen; and her nephews Michael, Chris, Chris, and Robert. She also leaves an in-law family to whom she became as close as siblings: Catherine Chant and Stephen Belitsos, Barbara and Paul Colton, Elizabeth Chant and Jill Burley, Paul and Anne Chant, Daniel and Jodie Chant, and Kirsten Chant; nieces Sarah, Margaret, Emily, Libby, Jacqueline, and Jessica; and nephews Brady, Thomas, Luke, Drew, and Ethan.
She was preceded in death by her husband Stephen Chant, brother Joe St. Pierre, sister Connie Rawson, brother-in-law Timothy Chant, and nephews Andrew and Ronny.
She was born Sept. 29, 1951, the second eldest of four to Joseph and Katherine (McCloskey) St. Pierre. She was born in Darby, Pennsylvania, grew up in Colonia, New Jersey, and studied English and French, graduating from Newark State College (now Kean University).
Suzanne met Steve, the love of her life, in the early 1990s, on the online network Prodigy, where both were early personal computer users. Suzanne and Patrick relocated from New Jersey to Vermont to share life’s adventures with Steve and Ariel. Gerry joined in on vacations and many special times.
Besides being a loving wife, proud mother, caring sister and affectionate grandmother, Suzanne was a poet, an artist, a quilter, an avid reader, and a lover of music. She loved traveling near and far with her partner in creativity, Steve. They loved driving around New England, holding hands, trying their luck at diners, auctions, craft fairs and bookstores.
For many years, they would take an annual summer break from work and family and go to Moosehead Lake in Maine, each with a pile of books for entertainment. In retirement, they discovered the joys of cruising and island-hopping in the Caribbean, even taking back-to-back cruises one year that gave them a full month at sea. In other years, they got their break from Vermont winters in St. Nevis and Bonnaire.
Suzanne and Steve were crazy in love from the day they met. They delighted in their passions for words, art, music, their children and each other. She was loved by many others for her intelligence, her generosity, her strength and her sometimes-gentle and sometimes-fiery spirit. She will be missed by everyone who knew her.

(File photo courtesy of Coastal Carolina)COLUMBIA — An unmanned underwater research vehicle, an event center to train hospitality students and an institute centered around federal defense research are among items on South Carolina colleges’ budget wish list for the coming year.
In all, public universities and technical colleges are seeking $2.3 billion in additional state aid for the fiscal year starting in July, according to a review of budget requests.
Legislators won’t approve colleges’ full requests, but the plans are a preview of higher education priorities across the state.
Coastal Carolina students to build satellite in state’s 1st college space program

For Coastal Carolina University, those priorities include a buildout of South Carolina’s first university-run space program.
Since March 2023, Coastal Carolina professors and about 80 science and engineering students have worked to plan and build a satellite. Now it’s time to launch the shoebox-sized satellite into orbit, where it will circle the planet 15 times a day from roughly 1,200 miles up.
The Conway-based college is asking legislators to set aside $450,000. But the school also wants to take things a step further, with a $900,000 underwater research vehicle.
The unmanned vehicle and satellite will work in tandem collecting images and data from above and below the Atlantic Ocean and South Carolina’s blackwater estuaries.
“Coastal systems are vital to the state’s economy and culture, supporting fisheries, ecotourism, and economic development,” the college’s request reads. “The data collected will enhance our ability to assess ecosystem resilience and provide early warnings for environmental stressors.”
Coastal Carolina scientists and students will track environmental changes driven by storms, flooding, drought, and other natural events. They’ll also monitor impacts to habitats and movements of key marine species, such as shrimp, crabs, oysters, red knots, red drum, sharks, turtles, dolphins, and whales, according to the college’s request.
Tech schools build
While Coastal Carolina’s request appears out of the ordinary, it’s far from the most expensive.
The technical college system is collectively seeking $743 million for projects across its 16 college campuses, accounting for a third of the total newly requested. Most of it would pay for construction projects.
High-dollar projects include $80 million to move the medical campus of Florence-Darlington Technical College out of downtown Florence, giving the college room to grow its training programs in high-demand health care fields.
Midlands Technical College and Spartanburg Community College are asking for $60 million and $65 million respectively to demolish and rebuild a student center and an administrative building, according to documents provided by the state Department of Administration.
And Denmark Technical College, the state’s only historically Black tech school, is renewing a $35 million request for new lab and classroom space. The college, located 35 miles east of the Savannah River National Laboratory, wants to train more of the cybersecurity and energy professionals needed by the federal nuclear research lab in an effort to attract more students and grow the school’s enrollment.
A focus on health care
MUSC Health seeks $350M for new, top-tier cancer center

Budget asks from the Medical University of South Carolina and the University of South Carolina round out the top three largest requests.
Most of MUSC’s $418 million request is for construction of a top-tier cancer center in downtown Charleston, the first of its kind in South Carolina.
And about half of USC’s $307 million ask would go to further the flagship university’s own health care ambitions.
That includes one-time money to move the pharmacy school to the university’s new medical campus that’s under construction in downtown Columbia’s redeveloped BullStreet District.
The school also wants annually recurring dollars to operate the new, taxpayer-funded neurological hospital and a series of clinics across the state that specialize in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.
More sought by SC research universities
USC to establish center for civics education, following national trend

Beyond money for the medical campus, USC is asking for annual operating dollars to run a newly-formed center focused on teaching civil debate and civics lessons. It wants more money to continue a four-way, multi-year research partnership between USC, Clemson University, South Carolina State University and the Savannah River National Laboratory. And it’s asking for funds to continue and expand its efforts around artificial intelligence.
Across the USC system, other major requests include a new nursing education center in Beaufort, complete with simulation labs, and the renovation of an event center in Spartanburg to train hospitality students in the Upstate.
As for Clemson, its request tallies $193 million in additional aid.
That includes $20 million for its National Security Institute, with the goal of growing the $30 million in annual research it does with the U.S. Department of Defense.
In its request, Clemson highlighted its military roots. The school, originally known as Clemson Agricultural College, opened in July 1893 as an all-male, all-white military college. It wasn’t until 1955 that the school began admitting non-military students and women.
Clemson also is renewing requests for projects the Legislature either didn’t fund or partially funded. That includes $60 million for next-generation computing center, $35 million for a new science laboratory and $20 million to expand a genetics research lab.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Campus_Beauty-26-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-05 11:13:18.692856

Undefeated Indiana, which slobber-knocked Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl ranks as the solid favorite at +130 entering the semifinal games. That means that if you wager $100 on Indiana to win it all, you would win $130 if the Hoosiers actually do it.
Rick Cleveland
If you watched Indiana’s dismantling of Alabama, you probably get it. Hard as it was to fathom Indiana (historically the worst team in Division I football) hammering proud Bama, seeing was believing. Indiana treated Alabama like Alabama treats Louisiana-Monroe.
Vegas oddsmakers like Miami next best. The money line on the Ole Miss’s semifinal foe is +315. Wager $100 and win $315 if the Hurricanes prevail. Miami, the only two-loss team remaining, probably ranks as the second betting choice because of the way the Hurricanes handled Ohio State (24-14) in the semifinals.
Next on the oddsmakers’ list is Oregon at +320. And then bringing up the rear and decidedly so at +550 is Ole Miss, despite its impressive 39-34 victory over Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. You can bet $100 on Ole Miss today and earn $550 if they beat Miami and then the Indiana-Oregon winner in the national championship game.
Why are the Rebels so decidedly the underdog? Well, for one thing, they started the season that way. 
Texas, Georgia and Ohio State were the preseason favorites. Penn State, Alabama, LSU, Clemson and Notre Dame all ranked far ahead of the Rebels. 
And then there’s the coaching chaos that happened just before the playoffs began. Pete Golding is two games into his head coaching career and has a staff that is largely spending preparation time at two different schools.
I have no other explanation for why the odds are so stacked against the Rebels. Ole Miss statistically dominated Georgia much more than the final score indicates. Take away Georgia’s second quarter scoop-and-score touchdown – the game’s only turnover – and Ole Miss wins much more comfortably.
Ole Miss isn’t playing like a team with coaching issues. If anything, Lane Kiffin’s abandoning a team beginning a playoff run has seemed to invigorate the Rebels, drawn them even closer together and made them even more determined.

Wide receiver Harrison Wallace III talked about that in a press conference Sunday afternoon. He said the coaching changes have had little impact “because everybody has bought in to go win a national championship.”
“It was crazy for everybody,” Wallace said. “But at the same time, the players and coaches did a great job of keeping everybody together. … I just feel like we did a good job of communicating with each other.”
The biggest noticeable change – other than a coach who  deflects attention to his players rather than attracting it to himself – is that the new coach is now on the field instead of the press box. Golding, when he was the defensive coordinator, coached from above. As a head coach, he is on the sideline. That turns out to be a plus, says standout defensive tackle Will Echoles, such a force in the Sugar Bowl. 
“I think having PG (Golding) on the field now is better,” Echoles said Sunday. “It’s different when they are sending stuff down through the headphones. It’s better when he can get us together on the field like he did in the second quarter against Georgia. He brought the whole defense together and told us what we needed to do better to get some stops.”

Whatever Golding said worked. There also seems to have been no problem at all with Charlie Weiss Jr. in total command of the Ole Miss offense and without Kiffin looking over his shoulder. Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and his teammates have not missed a beat. If anything, they’ve been sharper in the two playoff games.
For his part, Golding says commentators make far too much of the coaching flux and how it affects the Rebels. He loves this team and seems to love its chances.
“I just think these guys show up every day and are excited to go to work and prepare and get better,” Golding said. “… and I think that’s pretty unique. And I think the other thing for them is they don’t flinch. There’s a grit and a toughness about this group … there’s no panic.”
The oddsmakers were wrong about Ole Miss before the season started. They were wrong about them before the Sugar Bowl. They absolutely could be wrong now. As Golding loves to say and says often, “Let’s spot the ball.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — A pair of Democrats from Lawrence with personal grievances about the Trump administration are challenging incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann for his 1st District seat.
Lauren Reinhold, a longtime federal employee at the Social Security Administration, was swept up in Elon Musk’s DOGE purge of federal employees. Colin McRoberts, a professor at the University of Kansas business school, was inspired to run for office after attending Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall’s contentious March 1 town hall in Oakley.
Both Reinhold and McRoberts believe they can overcome the long odds Democrats have faced in the district by taking aim at Mann’s willingness to support an unpopular Republican agenda.
“We were promised: ‘Things are going to be better for you.’ And I’m just one person, but they certainly were not better for me,” Reinhold said.
“I was lied to. I was told my prices would be lower,” she added. “I was told that things would be better for my kids. I was told they would fix health care. And it’s been a year, and none of that’s happened.”
McRoberts said his experience in business negotiations has showed him that representatives like Mann are unable to negotiate on behalf of their district because they are just “going to do what the party wants them to do.”
He said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act marked a tectonic shift by severing the ties between aid for farmers and food assistance for low-income people. Those programs traditionally have been bundled together as a compromise between urban and rural states.
“That’s really going to change the political balance of those subsidy payments going forward, which makes it a lot less stable,” McRoberts said. “And it’s the kind of short-term thinking that’s going to be really dangerous, because we don’t have negotiators in Congress.”
Thanks to state-level GOP gerrymandering in 2022, the liberal town of Lawrence in northeast Kansas is now included in the vast 1st District that covers much of the western two-thirds of the state, all the way to the Colorado border. Only one Democrat — Howard Miller, in 1952 — has won the seat in the 150 years since the district formed. Mann has won three terms, with about 70% of the vote each time.
 
Ready to fight back
Reinhold lived in Topeka until she was 6, then moved to St. Louis. She returned to Kansas in 1993 to attend law school at KU, and stayed to raise a family there.
“I want the world to know that I’m prepared to fight for Kansans, for everyday Americans,” Reinhold said. “I think we’ve been overlooked. We’re not getting what we need. The regular person is increasingly suffering economically. We’re all at risk of our health getting worse.”
She defined a “regular person” as “anyone who’s not fabulously wealthy,” or doesn’t have to worry about their current and future economic security.
Her life was upended after President Donald Trump took office and handed a billionaire tech mogul the power to fire government workers under the pretense of efficiency.
Reinhold said she received the email that was sent to federal employees in late January, urging them to quit their jobs in exchange for pay through September. At first, she resisted.
“And I thought, you know what, if they fire me, I could run for office,” she said. “I could run for Congress and try to fight this mess they’ve made of the federal government. Fight back and restore what the American people need.”
After weeks of turmoil, firings and reassignments, she agreed to take the buyout when a new offer was made in April. She is taking time off to focus solely on running for Congress.
“It’s not about me. It’s not about, oh, poor Lauren lost her job to DOGE,” Reinhold said. “That’s going to be part of the campaign, but I really care that the American people get the government they deserve, that we get the governmental services we need and deserve to make our lives better, and I feel so passionate about that.”

Embracing neighbors
McRoberts said he drove four and a half hours from Lawrence to Oakley because he wanted to hear what Marshall would say about Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and vaccines.
And, McRoberts said, it was pretty clear that Marshall didn’t want people to show up.
McRoberts ended up taking one of the videos that went viral from Marshall’s town hall. People booed Marshall when he dismissed their concerns about Trump administration policies, and the senator left abruptly.
“He didn’t have to care because he thinks he’s running in a safe election,” McRoberts said. “That affected me, the idea that he was so complacent that he’s just going to turn around and walk away, because it’s not fun to talk about the things he’s been doing wrong in Congress.”
McRoberts started thinking a run for Congress during the drive back to Lawrence. He figure he, or even his students at KU, could have handled questions better than Marshall. He wanted to challenge Marshall directly but realized a U.S. Senate campaign would require him to raise millions of dollars.
“I’m just not a wealthy man,” McRoberts said. “I cannot afford to leave my day job. I teach for a living because I have to pay the mortgage, and I love to teach.”
Marshall had complained that people from Lawrence were trying to disrupt his appearance in Oakley, even though both towns are in the same congressional district. The implicit message from Marshall, as McRoberts saw it, was that people from outside of western Kansas are not your friends.
Actually, McRoberts said, people across the district have a shared economic interest rooted in agriculture.
“I think that’s been going on for a long time, an intentional strategy to use the east against the west, and maybe to a lesser extent, the west against the east, to drive these wedges for the benefit of party politics,” McRoberts said. “And I will not and cannot play that game. We’re all neighbors. The 1st District is much more alike than it is different.”
 
A non-zero chance
Reinhold said her work experience gives her a deep understanding of how the federal government works, and that she is better suited than Mann to represent the district.
“I will listen to Kansans,” she said. “First of all, I will get out there and talk to Kansans and listen to them, and listen to what they need, and vote in Congress in accordance with that, and initiate bills, which he’s done very little of, to make our lives better.”
McRoberts said he believes Democrats have an opportunity to break through the Republican stronghold in the 1st District.
“Especially since we’ve seen the impact of tariffs, since we’ve seen the crisis of incompetence and corruption in the federal government, since we’ve seen Tracey Mann really fail to rise to the occasion,” he said.
“The odds are still very long, but it’s a long way from zero, and those odds are getting better every day,” he added.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC261055-1024x629.jpg,,,2026-01-05 11:13:18.692856

Buffalo, N.Y.
Died Oct. 17, 2025
Stamford, N.Y.

Anne Pratt Slatin passed away on Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, at The Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, N.Y., at the age of 80 from pneumonia.
She was born on Oct. 31, 1944, in Buﬀalo, New York, to Mary McNeil and Wilson Holly Pratt. Her early summers were spent at Camp Otsego in Cooperstown, where she began as a camper and later taught sailing — friendships from those years stayed with her for life.
In 1979, Anne married Dr. Harvey L. Slatin in their apartment in New York City, and later that year their daughter, Emily, was born. In 1986, the family moved to Stamford, N.Y., where Emily grew up and where Anne would spend the rest of her life.
Anne gave much of herself to Stamford. She served for many years as a village trustee and later became the first woman to be elected mayor, serving a two-year term. She was also a longtime member of the Stamford Village Library Board, committed to supporting the institutions that made the town stronger.
In her professional life, Anne worked as a self-employed genealogist, helping families trace their histories and reconnect with their roots.
In her later years, Anne volunteered with the Middletown Springs Historical Society in Middletown Springs, Vermont, near the retired dairy farm owned by her daughter, Emily, and Emily’s wife, Amelia. She loved both places and gave her time freely to the communities that mattered most to her.
She loved animals, especially cats, and delighted in the company of Penfold, her daughter’s dog, who always made her smile. That aﬀection also shaped her support for Heart of the Catskills, a cause close to her heart.
She is survived by her daughter, Emily Pratt Slatin, and Emily’s wife, Amelia Phoenix Desertsong; her sister, Mary Ellen Pratt-Phillips; and Loralei Jurztrenka, who first cared for Anne as a nurse and, in time, became a cherished part of the family’s life. She was predeceased by her husband, Harvey; her sister, Holly E. Keller; and her lifelong friends Frank and Carol Bell, and Ellen Wayman, of Stamford, and Richard “Dick” Woodhouse of Cooperstown.
Anne preferred simplicity over ceremony. At her request, there will be no calling hours or funeral.
The family extends their heartfelt gratitude to the doctors, nurses and staﬀ at The Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown for their extraordinary care and compassion during Anne’s final days.
Her final wishes were to be cremated and buried without ceremony at Lakewood Cemetery in Cooperstown, New York. Contributions in her memory may be made to the Stamford Village Library, the Stamford Fire Department, or Heart of the Catskills.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bruce Cole.","Born April 19, 1933
Medford, Massachusetts
Died Dec. 24, 2025
Marlboro, Vermont
Details of services
He has been laid to rest in King Cemetery in Marlboro. A celebration of life for Bruce will be held mid-April 2026. Letters of condolence can be sent to the family at P.O. Box 133, Marlboro, Vermont 05344.

Bruce Cole, 92, of Marlboro, passed away peacefully on Dec. 24, 2025, surrounded by his family. Born on April 19, 1933, in Medford, Massachusetts, Bruce was the son of Barbara Sawyer Cole and the Rev. Alfred Storer Cole of Wilmington, Vermont.
Bruce’s life was defined by hard work, compassion, a sense of humor, and an unwavering commitment to family and community. It was in Boston where he met his lifelong partner and greatest love, Barbara Draper. They were both young dreamers working and aspiring to become veterinarians at Angell Memorial Animal Hospital. Their shared passion for learning and service became the foundation of a love that lasted 70 beautiful years.
Bruce began his education at Tufts University, where his father taught, and later attended the Massachusetts College of Agriculture. He served his country with dedication in the Army Dental Corps in North Carolina during the Korean War. In 1959, he and Barbara graduated from Marlboro College, a place that remained a touchstone throughout his life and career.
In the early 1960s, they bought an old farmhouse in Wilmington, Vermont. With tireless energy and care, transformed the surrounding woods and fields into a working farmstead. A place of animals, shared work and laughter. It became their home for six decades, where they raised their five children and created a lifetime of family memories. For his grandchildren, it was a place of learning, adventure and love, where the roots of family were deeply planted.
Both Bruce and Barbara pursued careers in education with joy and purpose. After earning teaching certifications, Bruce went on to earn two master’s degrees and was later recognized with an Honorary Master’s in Education from Marlboro College. His passion for learning took him beyond the classroom — including a sabbatical in 1975 to study the English Primary System in England, and participation in an archaeological dig in Farfa, Italy, in 1981. These experiences enriched his teaching and inspired the many children whose lives he touched.
Bruce’s tenure at Marlboro Elementary School was truly remarkable. As a teaching principal, he upheld high standards with warmth, creativity and deep respect for every child.  He had a rare ability to see potential in others and lift people up – meeting people where they were, encouraging confidence and helping them believe in themselves. His approach, ahead of its time, nurtured curiosity, resilience, and confidence, creating a safe and supportive environment where children felt valued and capable. Decades of students, families and colleagues continue to hold him in the highest regard, carrying his lessons of encouragement.
Bruce found meaning in shared work and time spent together. He spent countless hours alongside his children and family—mowing lawns, painting houses and caring for the farm. After-school and summer days were filled with cutting and stacking firewood, sugaring, shoveling snow, tending to animals and skiing at Hogback Mountain. In these everyday moments, he taught by example, showing that love often looks like showing up, pitching in and doing things side by side.
For fifteen years, Bruce, Barbara, and their five children welcomed the community to Maple Ridge Farm Camp on the hillside in Wilmington. Here, campers would learn how to care for animals, develop an appreciation for nature and the outdoors, and be enthralled by wild stories Bruce told around the campfire during the weekly campouts. Camp excursions in the yellow school bus to oceans and mountains sparked friendships and fostered a lifelong love of animals and the outdoors. The camp reflected Bruce’s gentle guidance, patience, and belief in learning through experience.
Bruce was a husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, teacher, mentor, neighbor, and friend. He volunteered at the Deerfield Valley Health Center, the Diversion Board, Deerfield Valley Fair, Windham County Conservation District, Marlboro Cares and Marlboro School Association.  Bruce is survived by his beloved wife, Barbara, and his children, Bridget Cole, Dianna Driller (Ron) of Tahoe City, CA, Scott Cole (Jody) of Richmond, VT, Andrew Cole (Jennifer Langdon) of Kilauea, HI and Jennifer Nilsen (Karl) of Wilmington, VT.
He was a proud grandfather to 10 grandchildren: Courtney, Colin, Caitlin, Abigail, Tenaya, Garret, Nicholas, Gunnar, Eve & Mara. And 4 great-grandchildren. Bruce also leaves extended family, friends, and many former students who still call him Mr. Cole.
He will be deeply missed for his quick wit and sarcasm delivered in his Boston accent and the steady, comforting presence he brought into the lives of those around him. He lived with integrity and humility and made time for everyone he encountered, always ready with a story, a helping hand,  or quiet encouragement.
No words can truly capture who Bruce was or the depth of the impact he made; that is something felt in the hearts of all who knew him. Think of him every time you enjoy a cup of coffee, mow a lawn, split wood, paint a house, fire up a green machine, listen to NPR, pour real Vermont maple syrup over your pancakes or catch a glimpse of an old Dodge Dart.

Allen Reavis, R-Atchison, appears for a Dec. 17, 2025, recording of the Kansas Reflector podcast. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — As freshmen legislators last year, Rep. Allen Reavis and Rep. Lon Pishny began having conversations about about the unspoken impact state laws and regulations have on city and county governments.
Bills were being debated, Reavis said, “and it just felt like the effect it would have on local government wasn’t being fully measured.”
“If you’re a legislator who lives in a large city, you may not have the understanding of what happens in a small town with that same legislation,” he added.
Reavis, an Atchison Republican, and Pishny, a Garden City Republican, realized they needed to find a way to help educate and work with their peers. Their idea was to bring together lawmakers with experience serving in or working for local governments, and they formed the bipartisan Local Government Caucus to address their concerns.


They appeared on the Kansas Reflector podcast with Nathan Eberline, executive director of the League of Kansas Municipalities, to talk about the caucus.
“I’m concerned that we’re doing one-size-fits-all legislation in Topeka,” Pishny said. “We mandate it and pass it out to 105 counties when there’s such a variation in operations among those 105.”
Much of the tension flows from a combination of the Legislature mandating local government services, then trying to regulate local property taxes. For a while, the Legislature capped local property tax increases at the rate of inflation. Then, in 2021, the Legislature imposed a confusing “revenue neutral rate.”
That means cities and counties have to lower their property tax rate each year to offset gains in property values — and then send notices and hold public meetings before returning to the same rate as before.

Pishny said the revenue neutral rate was “troubling,” even if the premise was admirable.
“I pay taxes in multiple counties in Kansas, and I would prefer not to pay any more either,” he said. “However, I do want that fire truck to show up at my house, or that ambulance to show up at my house, and some of the services are extremely important.”
Pishny served on the Finney County Commission for 10 years before being elected to his Kanas House seat. Reavis said he spent 13 years in city government and two years with the county before being elected to the House.
They have identified about 40 legislators between the 125-member House and 40-member Senate who have local government experience. They said most are on board with the new caucus, and leadership supports the effort.
But, Pishny said, some remain skeptical.
“Leadership has even cautioned us they don’t want another lobbying group, and that’s not what we’re about,” Pishny said. “We are about education and information and helping people understand the role of local government and what the differences are across the state.”
Reavis said they don’t want to initiate legislation but would like to be responsive to bills and serve as a resource.
They identified several proposals already on their radar, including one that would eliminate a requirement that the Legislature approve local sales tax initiatives and just let local voters decide. They are also interested in discussion about franchise fees, which are charged to a utility to use public rights of way. There could be a challenge to the three-mile zoning jurisdiction that cities have in unincorporated areas. And they could see another wave of efforts to limit local property taxes.

Eberline recalled past efforts by the Legislature to eliminate certain costs, such as mortgage registration fees.
“I remember saying at the time, ‘Well, the more that you do this, the more you shift to the property taxes.’ Those services don’t go away,” Eberline said.
“And so here we are, 10 years later, and everybody’s frustrated by the property tax discussion,” he added.
Eberline said the communities that are thriving in Kansas tend to have something in common.
“It almost always tends to be the place where the city is working with the county is working with the state legislators, and they do have this idea of shared governance, a shared constituency, and the idea that we’re in this together,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC170001-1024x671.jpg,,,2026-01-05 09:57:21.704842

(Photo courtesy of the Office of the Governor)Gov. Tim Walz ended his campaign for a historic third-term on Monday amid mounting pressure from members of his own party and intense attacks from Republicans over widespread fraud in state-run social services programs.
Walz defended his record in a statement and said he was certain he could win a third term, but couldn’t give his entire attention to rooting out fraud while running a campaign.
“I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work,” Walz said in a statement.
Walz will speak to the press at 11 a.m. Monday.
Some Democratic-Farmer-Labor elected officials have quietly worried for months that Walz’s name at the top of the ticket would hand Republicans the governorship for the first time in 15 years and sink Democrats’ prospects down the ballot.
Walz faced a crowded field of Republicans challengers including House Speaker Lisa Demuth, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and former congressional candidate Kendall Qualls.
U.S. Sen. Amy Kloubuchar, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Secretary of State Steve Simon are possible candidates in a Democratic primary which would take place in August.



Read Gov. Tim Walz’s full statement:
Good morning, and Happy New Year.
Like many Minnesotans, I was glad to turn the page on 2025. It was an extraordinarily difficult year for our state. And it ended on a particularly sour note.
For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state’s generosity. And even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.
I won’t mince words here. Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St. Paul, and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place. They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family. They’ve already begun by taking our tax dollars that were meant to help families afford child care. And they have no intention of stopping there.
Make no mistake: We should be concerned about fraud in our state government. We cannot effectively deliver programs and services if we can’t earn the public’s trust. That’s why, over the past few years, we’ve made systemic changes to the way we do business.
We’ve gone to the legislature time and again to get more tools to combat fraud. We’ve fired people who weren’t doing their jobs. We’ve seen people go to jail for stealing from our state. We’ve cut off whole streams of funding, in partnership with the federal government, where we saw widespread criminal activity. We’ve put new locks on the doors of our remaining programs, and we’ve hired a new head of program integrity to make sure those locks can’t be broken.
All across the state, Minnesotans are hard at work on this problem. Advocates, administrators, investigators are on the front lines defending the integrity of our state’s programs, and I want to thank them for their efforts.
There’s more to do. A single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud is a dollar too much to tolerate. And while there’s a role to play for everyone – from the legislature to prosecutors to insurance companies to local and county government – the buck stops with me. My administration is taking fast, decisive action to solve this crisis. And we will win the fight against the fraudsters.
But the political gamesmanship we’re seeing from Republicans is only making that fight harder to win.
We’ve got Republicans here in the legislature playing hide-and-seek with whistleblowers.
We’ve got conspiracy theorist right-wing YouTubers breaking into daycare centers and demanding access to our children.
We’ve got the President of the United States demonizing our Somali neighbors and wrongly confiscating childcare funding that Minnesotans rely on.
It is disgusting. And it is dangerous.
Republicans are playing politics with the future of our state. And it’s shameful. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: We welcome ideas from anyone, in any party, who wants to help us continue to stay ahead of the criminals.
And we welcome the involvement of the federal government. I’m grateful to the career professionals at the U.S. Attorney’s office and the FBI who are helping us win this fight.
But I cannot abide the actions of the political leadership in Washington – these opportunists who are willing to hurt our people to score a few cheap points. They and their allies have no intention of helping us solve the problem – and every intention of profiting off of it.
Which brings me to this: 2026 is an election year. And election years have a way of ramping up the politics at a time when we simply can’t afford more politics.
In September, I announced that I would run for a historic third term as Minnesota’s Governor. And I have every confidence that, if I gave it my all, I would succeed in that effort.
But as I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all. Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.
So I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.
I know this news may come as a surprise. But I’m passing on the race with zero sadness and zero regret. After all, I didn’t run for this job so I could have this job. I ran for this job so I could do this job. Minnesota faces an enormous challenge this year. And I refuse to spend even one minute of 2026 doing anything other than rising to meet the moment. Minnesota has to come first – always.
That’s what I believe servant leadership demands of me. And as an optimist, I will hold out some hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will consider what servant leadership demands of them in this moment. We can work together to combat the criminals, rebuild the public’s trust, and make our state stronger. But make no mistake: If Republicans continue down this path of abusing power, smearing entire communities, and running their own fraudulent game at the expense of Minnesotans – we will fight back every step of the way.
I’m confident that a DFLer will hold this seat come November. I’m confident that I will find ways to contribute to the state I love even after I’ve left office next January. But there will be time to worry about all that later.
Today, I’m proud of the work we’ve done to make Minnesota America’s best place to live and raise kids – from our new paid leave policy to our child tax credit to our free lunch program.
And I’m doubly proud of the incredible team we’ve put together to make that vision a reality. Thank you to every member of my staff, and every state employee, who’s part of this fight. We need you on the job to tackle the important work ahead.
Most of all, I want Minnesotans to know that I’m on the job, 24/7, focused on making sure we stay America’s best place to live and raise kids. No one will take that away from us. Not the fraudsters. And not the President. Not on my watch.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54916277197_74d814f6e6_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 09:57:21.704842

HOST: Laura Colarusso 
GUESTS: Jennifer Smith, Chris Lisinski, Jordan Wolman, Hallie Claflin







COMMONWEALTH BEACON is officially wrapping up 2025 and looking ahead to the stories that need to be told across Massachusetts in 2026. From major environmental scoops to local news in Gateway Cities to Beacon Hill happenings, our reporters covered a swath of issues last year, and many of those storylines will continue to unfold in the new year.  
On this week’s episode of The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon editor Laura Colarusso sits down with reporters Jennifer Smith, Chris Lisinski, Jordan Wolman, and Hallie Claflin to discuss the team’s major stories in 2025 and what they will be covering on each of their beats in 2026.  
Just weeks after joining the newsroom in September, Wolman uncovered that Rep. Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, used Gov. Maura Healey’s pending energy affordability bill as a legislative vehicle to put forth a measure to weaken the state’s 2030 climate commitments. The House didn’t move forward with the legislation following intense backlash, but it’s still on the table for next year.  
“Deep-blue state of Massachusetts walking back from its 2030 climate commitments is not a headline that, at least in November, House leadership was comfortable with,” Wolman said. “I think that we can look for a clearer compromise between what the governor had proposed and what was put forth in this trial balloon.”  
Lisinski, who also joined the team in September but has been covering the Statehouse for years, explained how President Trump’s second term dominated Beacon Hill in 2025. Looking ahead to 2026, he will continue covering the state’s budget pressures as Massachusetts faces sizeable tax revenue losses over a two-year span.  
“The budget writers in the Legislature and in the Healey administration have been growing more and more worried about how much the state is collecting in tax revenue. They have been lifting up every metaphorical couch cushion, trimming spending here and there,” Lisinski said. “That’s just going to continue to get worse with the existence of … the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”  
Claflin joined the team in July to cover the state’s 26 Gateway Cities. In September, she followed up with leaders, health care workers, and first responders in Leominster to examine how the city and region is dealing with the loss of its maternity unit two years later. In 2026, she will continue to monitor hospital and health care service closures in Gateway Cities. 
“Gateway Cities are particularly vulnerable when it comes to those kinds of closures. The payer mix is often challenging for hospitals that are already struggling financially – lots and lots of folks [are] on Medicaid and Medicare in those cities,” Claflin said. “I think there’s going to be more stories to tell there.”  
One of Smith’s deep dives in 2025 shed light on geographic disparities across the state when it comes to health care access.

BURLINGTON — Molly Gray, the former Vermont lieutenant governor who also ran, unsuccessfully, for a seat in Congress, wants her old job back.
Gray announced her campaign for the state’s second-highest office Monday morning at a coffee shop in the South End of Burlington. Gray is running as a Democrat; if she wins the party’s primary in August, she’ll likely face current Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, a Republican first elected to the post in 2024, in the general election in November.
In Vermont, the lieutenant governor has few day-to-day responsibilities besides presiding over the state Senate when it’s in session. But those in the position can, and often do, use it to advocate for certain issues. Gray said she would be a stronger opponent of President Donald Trump’s administration, and the policies and proposals coming from the White House, than Rodgers has been in his first year in the post.
“There are no ceremonial offices right now,” Gray, who’s from Newbury though now lives in Burlington, said in an interview last week. “No one can afford to sit it out or stand on the sidelines at a time where the fundamental rights of Vermonters are under attack — regularly.”
(To be sure, Rodgers has said he does not support Trump and spoke against some of the administration’s actions at a major anti-Trump protest in Montpelier in April.)
Gray was elected lieutenant governor in 2020 after beating out a crowded field of Democratic primary opponents. She was in the job for less than a year before launching her campaign for what was then an open U.S. House seat. After a bruising campaign, she lost the primary to Becca Balint, who easily won the general election that fall.
After leaving office in 2023, Gray was tapped to serve as the first executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance. The Burlington-based nonprofit supports Afghans who are resettling in the state, offering a variety of programs such as a driver education initiative tailored to women who were not allowed to drive in their home country.
Gray said that role has given her firsthand experience with what she called the “extreme cruelty” of the Trump administration’s policies. She pointed, for example, to how the administration has paused visa and other programs for Afghan nationals, while those already in the country have also been stripped of temporary permission to stay.
“It’s ongoing chaos, right?” Gray said. “It’s been one blow after another.”
In addition to using the office’s bully pulpit to respond to news from Washington, D.C., Gray said she’s motivated to run for lieutenant governor again because of her own experiences — giving birth to her son, Jack, since she has left office, as well as caring for her mother, who lives in Newbury and has multiple sclerosis.
“I’ve experienced firsthand a health care system in crisis. Trying to access rural care in rural Vermont is extremely challenging right now,” she said. “We’re deeply concerned, as I think many, many families and many Vermonters are.”
Gray said that if she wins this year’s election, she is not interested in leaving the role for higher office, as she tried to do in 2022. That includes both running for governor and a seat in Congress, she said.
“If I’m lucky enough to earn the support of Vermonters — and have the chance to work for them again — I’ll stay in the job as long as there’s ability to problem solve and to get things done,” Gray said.
No other Democrats had formally announced a 2026 campaign for lieutenant governor as of Monday morning.

California legislators return to Sacramento today to kick off the second year of the Legislature’s two-year session. In addition to dealing with a state budget deficit projected to reach nearly $18 billion this year and a 2026 primary election, lawmakers will introduce and weigh in on new bills. Expect many: In 2025, more than 900 bills were sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk.
One proposal in the pipeline is a bill that would enable Californians to file lawsuits against federal agents. Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco drafted the bill in response to ongoing immigration raids under President Donald Trump. Assemblymember Mark González, a Los Angeles Democrat, also introduced a measure that aims to restore the 988 suicide and crisis hotline for LGBTQ+ callers in L.A. County, following Trump’s elimination of the specialized service.
California Republicans in the Senate also laid out their priorities going into the year, which would require considerable bipartisan support given the Democrat’s super-majority in the Legislature. The GOP’s top issues include funding the implementation of the anti-crime measure Proposition 36, investigating Medi-Cal fraud and addressing the state’s high cost of living. 
Many new California laws went into effect on Thursday as well, including ones that allow residents to get grant money for new roofs, require tortilla products to contain folic acid and mandate consumers to pay an extra fee on products with a non-removable battery. Read our rundown on the new laws that could affect your life, and check out the most talked-about measures from CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.
Meanwhile, two state laws facing legal challenges from critics have been blocked by federal judges. One measure, which passed last year, grants the state more authority to regulate working conditions for private-sector employees. And on Friday a federal appeals court ruled that the state’s 2023 law restricting concealed firearms is unconstitutional.

Another go for mandatory kindergarten?

Speaking of new bills, California lawmakers plan to reintroduce a proposal requiring parents or legal guardians to enroll their 5-year-olds in school. Though the Legislature has attempted to mandate kindergarten nearly a half dozen times in past years, some legislators are optimistic that a bill could advance this year, reports CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
Data shows that children who attend kindergarten have higher math and reading test scores, are more likely to graduate high school and are less likely to drop out of school. But while California requires all school districts to offer kindergarten, it doesn’t require families to enroll their children. 
State Sen. Susan Rubio, a West Covina Democrat, unsuccessfully proposed two bills to make kindergarten mandatory. One died in the appropriations committee in 2024; the other was spiked by Newsom in 2022, who cited budget restrictions. 
But this year could be different, Rubio says, because the Legislature experienced a significant turnover since it last voted on a kindergarten bill in 2024. Several legislators also said they’d consider sponsoring a kindergarten bill, and California’s public school chief Tony Thurmond pledged to support any bill that addresses it.

Newsom’s final year as CA governor

This year marks Newsom’s last year as California’s governor. In this final year, how the governor responds to the state’s budget, housing and affordability issues could have a major effect on his expected bid for the presidency, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
In the past seven years, Newsom expanded transitional kindergarten, created an office to control rising health care costs and enacted policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. His policy and politics battles against the Trump administration, particularly in 2025, has also thrown Newsom into the national spotlight. 
But the governor has fallen short of some of his promises too, which he could continue to tackle in 2026: California housing costs are some of the highest in the nation and homelessness has increased under his tenure. Amid federal and state budget cuts, some advocates also worry that Newsom will walk away from his goal to expand health care coverage, such as when he proposed to freeze new Medi-Cal enrollments for undocumented immigrants.

That extends to Beacon Hill, where legislators have been more or less on a holiday break since mid-November and now need to chart a course for the busiest stretch of the two-year lawmaking term.
Representatives and senators tend to bristle at the suggestion that they have not been productive, and sure, 2025 featured a not-insignificant amount of work to survey the landscape, gather input, and ponder appropriate next steps.
But a quick glance at the term’s new laws so far shows that legislative leaders are far from accomplishing the goals they set for themselves. Once the holiday decorations are taken down and stuffed back into storage, they’ll have plenty of work to do.
Here’s a look at what to expect from Beacon Hill in 2026.
Budget, budget, budget
After a bevy of spending last year — in fact, most of the substantial legislation approved in 2025 featured some degree of appropriations — policymakers will return to the topic quickly.
Healey must file an annual state budget proposal for fiscal year 2027 by January 28, which will kick off months of debate about how Massachusetts absorbs the impacts of federal policy changes.
Her deputies project the megalaw President Donald Trump signed in July will decrease tax collections by nearly $950 million across this year and next combined. Lawmakers might be tempted to soften the blow by divorcing parts of the state’s tax code from the federal code, though that strategy could draw pushback from businesses, for whom compliance would become a heavier lift.
The state’s financial outlook is middling, with most revenues set for modest growth, so budget-writers have their hands full even before accounting for the federal changes.
There’s another big variable hanging over the next cycle, too: influential business groups are pushing a ballot question that would slash the state’s income tax rate from 5 percent to 4 percent. If approved, experts say that measure could cut available revenues by hundreds of millions of dollars in fiscal 2027 and by up to $4.8 billion annually once fully implemented.
Top Democrats are already antsy about the measure, and the frustration could prompt discussions about a compromise policy change to keep the question off the ballot.
Still in crisis: Health care and housing
Three of last term’s biggest laws took aim at the lack of available, affordable places for Bay Staters to live, boosted oversight of hospitals, and sought to control prescription drug costs.
And that won’t be anywhere close to the final word on housing and health care.
Insiders expect more debate this year about what else Massachusetts can do to boost housing production and rein in prices. It’s not clear what lawmakers and Healey have in mind, but they regularly cite the issue as one of the most pressing in the state, especially given its importance to the overused “affordability” and “competitiveness” slogans.
On health care, there’s growing interest — at least in the Senate and corner office — in reinvigorating the primary care sector, where an aging workforce and a lack of new physicians entering the field make it difficult for patients to secure timely appointments.
A task force lawmakers created to come up with solutions last month recommended essentially doubling the share of health care dollars that flow toward primary care, without increasing total spending.
That’s a potentially impactful move that could trigger a major political battle: Growing one slice while keeping the pie the same size means other industry segments, like specialists and pharmaceuticals, would earn less. Those who stand to lose are unlikely to acquiesce quietly.

Finding the right balance on energy affordability
Many of Healey’s top legislative priorities are still stuck somewhere in the pipeline as the new year unfolds, but one already had a short-lived stretch in the spotlight.
The House last fall appeared poised to use Healey’s energy affordability bill as a vehicle to defang the state’s 2030 statutory decarbonization requirements. Once that idea generated major blowback from environmental advocates, though, House leaders retreated.
House Ways and Means Committee chair Aaron Michlewitz said in November that stakeholders still need to “have a conversation at some point related to whether we can meet our goals for 2030,” but suggested that probably will not happen as part of any action on the governor’s legislation.
Left unclear in that assessment was what the final House rewrite will look like, not to mention what senators will do once they get a chance to stamp their own mark on the bill.
Healey’s underlying package wove together a suite of reforms, such as allowing the Department of Public Utilities to cap monthly utility bill increases, more tightly regulate third-party competitive electric suppliers, clear the way for new nuclear power, and more. The governor projected it could save ratepayers $10 billion over a decade.
While that proposal idles, Bay Staters are buckling down for another winter with significant rate hikes.
Election season is closer than you think
No matter how much the Legislature does, 2026 could still be a record-breaking year for policymaking… at the ballot box.
As many as 12 ballot questions are poised to go before voters, barring any proposals failing to clear the remaining eligibility hurdles or campaigns pulling the plug. That would blow past the record of nine measures that appeared on the ballots in 1994, 1976, and 1972.
Expect an awful lot of bellyaching on Beacon Hill about the measures, most of which reflect attempts to circumvent the Legislature on policies that do not have enough support among legislative leaders to move.
The Legislature will get a chance in the first part of the year to approve any of the initiative petitions or propose substitutions, though it seems unlikely they’ll feel inclined to stamp support on this field. Elected officials on occasion have brokered deals in which some campaigns agree to halt their efforts, and that could be on the table again.
Another safe bet: A lot of people will spend, and make, a lot of money on electioneering.
Ballot question campaigns are almost always expensive endeavors, with the most politically potent topics leading to slugfests. Stretch that dynamic across a historically large field, and it seems likely that campaign finance regulators will track tens of millions of dollars changing hands.
This year is also a major statewide election for individual officeholders. All of the state’s constitutional officers are up for election again, and most — including Healey, Attorney General Andrea Campbell, and Treasurer Deborah Goldberg — have already announced plans to seek another term. Three Republicans are also aggressively jockeying for the chance to challenge Healey in the fall.
In the Legislature, there will be much less competition. History shows most Massachusetts lawmakers can expect an easy ride to reelection. But the Legislature as a whole still tends to operate with a fair degree of election-year logic, and the work accomplished by late summer will quickly become fodder for the few incumbents who need to break a sweat on the campaign trail.
Healey, too, will be eager for her Democratic compatriots to hand her some key legislative accomplishments to tout.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1800-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 08:57:15.547655

Under Newsom’s tenure, health care has been expanded, but his housing goals and homelessness pledges remain unfinished. Can he deliver before eyeing the White House?


It’s Gavin Newsom’s final year in office as California governor — and his last chance to use his role as governor to audition for the national stage. 
The governor, who will address the Legislature and present his budget proposal this week, has spent the past seven years pushing an ambitious agenda. Now in his final year, numerous interest groups will clamor for him to pass their preferred policies, nix the regulations they fear and protect the programs they favor. How he responds will follow him into his expected presidential primary run. 
Will he, with his recent focus on affordability, make a dent in Californians’ housing and health care costs? Will he make progress on reducing homelessness? Will he continue pushing green energy as voters demand cheaper gas? Will he weather another dismal budget deficit without punishing cuts that would alienate the progressives whose programs he has championed? 
“This really is a pivotal year for him,” Democratic political consultant Kelly Calkin said. “What do voters in the rest of the country want to see? They’re feeling the pinch of affordability. … He’s probably going to look through that lens on what helps shape his agenda for the next year.”
It’s also his final opportunity to make headway on some of the lofty goals Newsom made when he ran for governor in 2018 that he hasn’t always met.
He vowed to tackle homelessness, which has only gotten worse over his seven-year tenure, despite the more than $24 billion his administration has poured into it. He started off his term with an initial, headline-grabbing proposal to grant new parents six months of paid leave, but quickly pared it back to a two-week increase, for a total of eight weeks, and gradual boosts in how much the program pays.
In 2021 he said the state would add 200,000 new subsidized child care slots by this year, but the plan been delayed for two years and remains tens of thousand of slots short; he has since promised to resume the expansion this year.
He campaigned on establishing a single-payer public health care system, even calling out “politicians saying they support single-payer but that it’s too soon, too expensive or someone else’s problem.” Then he pivoted to “universal coverage,” with the state slowly expanding coverage for low-income Californians, including undocumented immigrants, but abruptly halted that amid a budget deficit last year. 
He spoke, like so many before him, of evening out the state’s boom-and-bust tax system that over-relies on stock market returns, but has largely quashed other proposals to raise revenue as the state stares down a deficit.
‘It never seems like enough’
Newsom’s penchant for big promises and first-in-the-nation ideas has been both a blessing and a curse for the ambitious politician. Advocates of those policies say the lofty goals have made a difference, even if the state ultimately falls short of achieving all of them. 
Newsom has left his mark on state government: He started new programs like the expansion of public school to all 4-year-olds, created an office to control rising health care costs, flexed the state’s regulatory powers to achieve its greenhouse gas-reduction goals — only to run into resistance with the Trump administration — and pushed state leaders into overseeing thorny issues like homelessness and the mental health care system that had long been left to local and county governments. 
“I don’t think there was a lot of stuff lacking,” said Anthony Rendon, the former Assembly speaker who led the chamber during Newsom’s first five years in office, of policy issues the governor has yet to address. After years of working with Newsom’s predecessor Jerry Brown, who was focused mostly on fiscal restraint and building up the state’s reserves, Rendon and former Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins recalled Newsom starting off his first term in 2019 pleasing the mostly Democratic Legislature with a long list of progressive ideas and a willingness to spend on them. 
“In retrospect, it never seems like enough,” Rendon said.

Diablo Unified School District in Concord on Aug. 11, 2025. Photos by Camille Cohen and Laure Andrillon for CalMatters
Case in point: housing. It’s perhaps the most visible measure by which Newsom will be judged after he leaves office and it comprises a bulk of the recent national Democratic platform focused on lowering the cost of living. About 40% of California households are “burdened” by their rent or mortgage, Census data shows, a policymaker benchmark meaning housing eats up more than a third of their income. 
Newsom ran on lowering those costs by boosting production and said it was “achievable” for the state to build an ambitious 3.5 million new homes by 2025. In 2024, the state added just under 120,000 new units, about a fifth of the annual rate needed to meet that goal. In media appearances the governor now downplays his original figure as a “stretch goal.”
Yet those who favor building more say he’s still accomplished more than any other governor on housing. They blame local resistance to housing density, high interest rates and the persistently high cost of building as reasons for the slow progress. 
“You can’t solve a systemic problem overnight or even in seven years, but what you can do is change the trajectory of the issue,” said Ray Pearl, executive director of the California Housing Consortium, a nonprofit that advocates for building affordable housing.
A pivot to modular housing this year?
Pearl pointed to actions Newsom has taken, like an early budget move to quintuple the state’s tax credit for low-income housing construction, backing laws that relax rules on where housing can be built and picking legal fights with cities that refuse to plan adequate housing units for their populations. 
“Leadership sets the tone,” he said. “It’s changed the focus and the conversation to where the state of California has finally gotten serious in planning for and producing affordable housing.”
Pearl said in Newsom’s final year in office he hopes the governor will support a proposed $10 billion bond lawmakers want to put on this year’s ballot to boost a state affordable housing fund.
Newsom acknowledges California has yet to see his promised building boom, and last month expressed interest in alternative forms of construction, such as modular housing, as another solution. On The Ezra Klein Show, he hinted at an upcoming legislative debate over how the state can promote modular housing, a cheaper way to build in which houses are assembled in factories then shipped to sites to be installed. An Assembly committee chaired by one of Newsom’s allies on housing, Democratic Oakland Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, is set to discuss the method this year. Its use in the Bay Area has already exposed familiar debates about the use of union labor in housing. 
“This holds a lot of promise. It holds a lot of political peril, in the context of the politics within labor. And that has to be accommodated and dealt with,” Newsom said. “By the way, if there’s a big preview for California in my last year, it’s in this space legislatively to take it to the next level.”
It’s the closest Newsom has come in recent weeks to stating a new policy goal or proposal. Izzy Gardon, Newsom’s spokesperson, would not provide any details on his housing or any other agenda, telling CalMatters only to “stay tuned.” 
Gardon refused interview requests to discuss the governor’s policy goals for his final year. Newsom is expected to deliver his State of the State address on Thursday.
Tough times for health care and social services
Already, advocates for the comprehensive safety-net services that Newsom has championed — another hallmark of his tenure — are urging him to maintain those programs as he stares down another tough budget deficit estimated at $18 billion. The agency overseeing those services accounts for nearly 40% of the state’s general fund spending and many of its programs are projected to lose significant federal funds through President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill.

During Newsom’s two terms, he added subsidized child care slots, boosted cash assistance for the poor, installed a state surgeon general who has focused on childhood trauma and the racial health gap and most significantly, incrementally expanded health care coverage to different groups of undocumented immigrants. 
The latter, a controversial and costly policy, has allowed the governor to pivot from his original promise of a universal, state-paid health care system that was the pie-in-the-sky dream of progressives and still say he was achieving “universal access.” After passage of the Affordable Care Act, more than 90% of Californians were insured by the time Newsom took office. His expansions, first for immigrant young adults and then for older ones, pushed it to nearly everyone in 2023. 
Policy allies generally don’t fault Newsom for shifting away from a single-payer system, which would have required billions more in state funds and complex agreements with an increasingly un-aligned federal administration. They are particularly satisfied that his administration has laid some of the groundwork for such a proposal by attempting to rein in the growth of health care costs through price limits imposed by the Office of Health Care Affordability. But now, they’re worried he’ll walk away from his expansive coverage goals altogether. 
Last year, facing higher than expected costs in the Medi-Cal program and needing to close a $12 billion deficit, Newsom undid coverage for the last group of undocumented residents to become eligible: working-age adults. A freeze on new enrollment of adults took effect Jan. 1. Later this year, undocumented immigrant adults will lose Medi-Cal dental coverage and next year most will face monthly premiums that are expected to force some off coverage, to the disappointment of health advocates who are urging Newsom to reverse the cuts. 
Amanda McAllister-Wallner, executive director of the advocacy group Health Access California, said she’s worried the administration will consider further cuts this year, after Newsom has come out heavily against other proposals to raise revenue for the health system, like a nurses’ union proposal for a wealth tax. She doesn’t like that the governor appeared willing to back down on coverage at the same time the state’s provision of social services for immigrants became an increasing political controversy nationally. 
“The hope was that the Health for All expansion would be considered the baseline, that that would be something we budget for long term because it’s just something that’s part of who we are as a state,” said McAllister-Wallner. “Health care has been an area where the governor has really made a name for himself in a way that I think he can and should be very proud of, and to see … a backing-off of those commitments would be the biggest disappointment for me.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/010623-Newsom-Inauguration-RL-CM-06.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 08:57:15.547655

California is one of 32 states that doesn’t require 5-year-olds to attend school.



The past few years, California has been all about the ABCs, 1-2-3s and the wheels on the bus, investing more than $5 billion in early childhood education. 
But kindergarten, a staple of elementary schools for more than a century, remains optional. Despite nearly a half dozen legislative attempts to require it, California is one of 32 states that doesn’t mandate that all 5-year-olds attend school.
That might change next year. Legislators plan to introduce a new bill to require kindergarten and they’re confident that it will meet a better fate than its predecessors, which either died in committee or were vetoed, largely due to the cost.
“Kids need to be around other kids, they need to be learning. It matters,” said Patricia Lozano, executive director of Early Edge California, which advocates for early childhood education. “I don’t see why California can’t make this happen.”
The data, advocates say, is clear. Children who attend kindergarten have higher test scores in math and reading in third grade and beyond and higher high school graduation rates. They’re also less likely to be suspended or drop out later in their school careers.
Why some parents opt out
While California requires all school districts to offer kindergarten, it doesn’t require families to enroll their children. Most do, but about 5% a year opt out. The reasons vary: some families believe their children aren’t ready for the rigors of school, and others are happy with their children’s current arrangement, whether it’s a preschool, day care or staying home with family.
Latino families are the least likely to send their children to kindergarten, data shows. Lozano said there’s a variety of reasons for this: they either don’t know about it due to a language barrier; they’re afraid to register their children in school due to immigration concerns; parents are working so hard they’ve missed notices from the school district; or some combination of all three. Regardless, schools need to improve their outreach to that community, she said.
Cecelia Kiss, a bilingual kindergarten teacher in the Sacramento City Unified School District, said she recently had a student whose mother was deported, and the child was unable to attend school because there was no one available to drive her. Even though the child loved school and the family placed a high value on education, it was logistically impossible to get the child to school. It took several weeks for the school and family to make transportation arrangements.
“For Latinos, education is so important. We want to give our kids the best we can,” said Kiss, who is also the parent of a kindergartner. “But sometimes we can’t do everything. We rely on kind teachers to care for our children, to help them learn, to help them be prepared for first grade.”
State Sen. Susan Rubio said that the fact that kindergarten isn’t mandatory discourages already disadvantaged families from enrolling their children. In her experience, Latino families have tremendous respect for the public school system and if the system tells them kindergarten is optional, and therefore not a priority, “they listen to that.”
That’s why she’s proposed two previous bills to make kindergarten mandatory. The state should be unequivocal in its message to families that early childhood education is essential for students’ success in school and life, she said. The state’s already rolled out transitional kindergarten to all 4-year-olds, expanded state-funded preschool and added more slots to its subsidized child care program. Bolstering kindergarten should be next, she said.
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond agrees. He said this month that making kindergarten mandatory is a legislative priority for 2026, and he pledged to support any bill that addresses it. Several legislators said they’d consider sponsoring one.
‘Not an urgent need’
Both of Rubio’s previous kindergarten bills died – one in the Senate Appropriations Committee and another when Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed it. In his veto note, he said he supports early education generally but the state hadn’t budgeted the cost, estimated to be $268 million annually. 
“While the author’s intent is laudable … it is important to remain disciplined when it comes to spending, particularly spending that is ongoing,” Newsom wrote.
Plenty of groups supported the bills, including the California Teachers Association — the state’s largest teachers union — and a slew of school districts. But it had a few opponents, namely the Homeschool Association of California. The group’s opposition was not based on the merits of kindergarten itself, but on the state’s ability to strip rights from parents.
“Most kids are already going to kindergarten. But some parents have good reasons for keeping their kids at home,” said Jamie Heston, a member of the group’s board. “Parents want the choice to decide what’s best for their individual child.”
The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association hasn’t taken a position on the issue, but generally opposes new initiatives that cost money — including mandatory kindergarten. That stance isn’t likely to change if a kindergarten bill resurfaces, the group’s vice president Susan Shelley said this week.
“From a budgetary point of view, there’s a lot of pressure this year to keep spending under control,” Shelley said. “This would not be a one-time cost. It would be ongoing. And there’s not an urgent need to expand kindergarten, compared to other more pressing needs facing the state right now.”
Bruce Fuller, an education professor at UC Berkeley who studies early childhood education, said the Legislature should focus on more pressing needs facing the under-6 crowd. Those include how the rollout of transitional kindergarten has led to the closure of many preschools, leaving many 3-year-olds without a place to go. Also, Head Start is struggling with funding and other obstacles imposed by the Trump administration, including attempts to bar families who are not citizens. And even though California has expanded access to state-funded preschool, not enough families know they’re eligible.
“Not that many families opt out of kindergarten, so it’s not a huge need,” Fuller said. “There are more immediate concerns.” 
Learning gaps among students
Still, Rubio is confident that a kindergarten bill has a good chance of passing this year, largely because the Legislature has seen a significant turnover since it last voted on a  kindergarten bill in 2024. Twenty-seven new senators and Assembly members were elected last fall.
For Rubio, whose parents immigrated from Mexico, the issue is personal. Although she did well in school, her twin brother did not. At an early age, he was wrongly placed in special education, fell behind and struggled throughout his time in school, eventually dropping out. Rubio believes he would have fared better if he had a high-quality early childhood education.
She’s also an elementary school teacher who’s seen the gap between students who’ve been to preschool, TK and kindergarten, versus those who had never enrolled in school at all until first grade. Children who’ve been to kindergarten know how to hold a pencil, write their names, count to 20, take turns and maybe even read or do basic math, she said. Those who haven’t lag far behind their peers and some never catch up, she said.
“I have very vivid memories of my students just breaking down crying at the end of the year because they couldn’t do a test. They didn’t know the answers, and that’s so heartbreaking to see,” said Rubio, who’s on leave from her job teaching at Monrovia Unified in Los Angeles County. “It’s hard on them, and it’s hard on the teachers because those children need a lot of extra help.”
Lozano said she thinks the bill will pass eventually. The initiative would cost money, but the state would save money in the long run if more students succeeded in school and graduated.
“It took us 20 years to get TK. It takes time to change minds, change policies,” Lozano said. “There are so many benefits to kindergarten, especially for the kids who need it the most. We believe the benefits outweigh the costs.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/032723-Buttonwillow-LV_CM_15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 08:57:15.547655

The California Courier uses the name of an established paper and doesn’t disclose apparent Republican ties. Critics call it “pink slime”




Earlier this year, as the political battle over Congressional redistricting brought California into the national spotlight, Facebook users were shown a curious series of ads.
The ads, from a straightforward-looking news site called the California Courier, often felt a lot like campaign commercials, linking to articles hammering Democrats in the state, including Gov. Gavin Newsom. Few punched in the other direction, toward Republicans. One said “California Democrats just rewrote their gerrymandering plan so voters will see their partisan map on the ballot this November.” Another called Proposition 50, which passed in November, “a scheme critics say is meant to undermine voter-approved protections and entrench one party rule in California.”
A reader who clicked through to the Courier’s website would find stories that largely align with a conservative view of the news, like a video of a child “riding a scooter through San Fran’s drug-ravaged streets,” or an anonymous piece that cites “confidential sources” cautioning against a “left-wing educator” running for a position with an Orange County school district. 
What a reader would not find is any disclosure of the Courier’s ownership or funding, including what appear to be ties to a network of conservative organizations in California that, according to one researcher, scaled up a series of right-leaning news sites in three other states just ahead of the 2024 election.
The Courier has money to spend. According to a review of the ad library maintained by Facebook’s owner, Meta, the outlet has spent more than $80,000 since 2021 promoting its stories on social issues and politics, potentially reaching tens of thousands of users on the platform each week. 
Critics say the California outlet is part of a growing, nationwide ecosystem of innocuous-looking, cheaply-produced news publications that publish and advertise biased articles in an attempt to surreptitiously influence elections. They worry the practice could mislead voters and corrode trust in nonpartisan news providers.  
“I think we are in an era where people are consuming so much content online without knowing the source of it,” said Max Read, who has studied the network apparently behind the Courier at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonprofit that works to counter political polarization. “And for well-funded organizations to contribute to that by disguising what they’re doing online just helps exacerbate that problem of people not trusting what they come across.”

At a glance, the Courier does not necessarily look right-leaning. A handful of stories seem like straight news echoing press releases, such as one announcing new affordable housing units. But even those that seem relatively neutral may have a right-leaning spin, like one describing speeding fines tied to income as a potential “woke penalty loophole.”
The outlet also shares a name with a 67-year-old California-based publication serving the Armenian diaspora. One of that Courier’s founders won acclaim from his peers for his tenure as dean of the University of Maryland’s journalism school.
When The Markup and CalMatters contacted the publisher of the Armenian Courier, he said he was unaware of the other site. He told a reporter he was opening it for the first time.
“I’m definitely not conservative,” said Harut Sassounian, who owns the Courier, where his regular editorials appear online and formerly in print. “The two publications have nothing in common. Neither politically nor ethnically nor anything like that.”
The Lincoln Media network
Although it lacks the pedigree of its Armenian twin, the right-leaning Courier has shown it is well-immersed in today’s social media. A video it made suggesting Newsom flip-flopped in his view of President Joe Biden’s mental acuity generated thousands of reactions. 
The publication also shares some of the murky citation practices of contemporary social media. Almost all of the stories on the site are unattributed, or simply attributed to “the California Courier.” 
A few, however, include author names. One of the named writers describes himself on social media as a “content creator” for the Lincoln Media Foundation, a conservative group, and links to Courier articles. Another shares a name with a Republican strategist based in Orange County, and a third lists a resume with conservative organizations in a short bio. 
The Lincoln Media Foundation is tied to the Lincoln Club, a group based in Orange County that bills itself as “the oldest and largest conservative major donor organization in the state of California.” The club funnels anonymously-donated money to conservative candidates and causes.
The Lincoln Media Foundation’s Facebook page recently said it was “proud to present” a new documentary purporting to reveal “the untold truth about the Pacific Palisades fire,” the natural disaster that tore through the state this year and increased political pressure on Newsom. 
One hour later, the Courier’s Facebook page promoted it as well, not mentioning the Lincoln Media Foundation but describing the documentary as “much anticipated.”

Neither the Lincoln Club, Lincoln Media, the California Courier, or the Courier writers responded to multiple requests for comment about the origins of the site, either through email, phone, or social media messages.
That silence, and the lack of information about ownership on the Courier’s website, comes despite the outlet’s chief goal, as outlined on its Facebook page.
“California Courier offers statewide and local news,” the page’s description reads. “Our mission is transparency.”
The Lincoln Club has previously been linked to “local” websites around the country, spreading stories with a distinctly conservative tint. 
Last year, Read’s Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which tracks disinformation and extremism online, found a handful of such sites that noted deep in their privacy policies that they were projects from Lincoln Media. Those outlets had names like The Angeleno and the Keystone Courier, and stretched from California to Pennsylvania, although a resulting report didn’t name the Courier. 
Many of the sites used Facebook and other social media tools to press a conservative agenda, the report found. Meta has rules against “coordinated inauthentic behavior” but it’s not clear whether Lincoln Media’s websites would cross that line. 
‘Pink slime’ news
Researchers have taken to calling sites like those operated by Lincoln Media “pink slime” news, a name coined after a meat-industry additive. These sites don’t produce outright false news, like others, but they do not meet basic journalistic standards. That often means low-quality content and failing to disclose associations with outside organizations. 
The sites generally aren’t designed to generate revenue, but to sway public opinion. The majority, according to researchers, lean toward a conservative agenda, and if the site’s stories gain traction on social media, they can travel widely. “If they place an ad well or if they just get the right pickup from the right influencer, these things don’t really have a limit on how far they can go,” Read said.
While it’s not clear how many sites the Lincoln Club might fund, it isn’t the only group that has used the strategy.
In 2020, the New York Times reported on Metric Media, a group that created nearly 1,300 sites around the country with names like Maine Business Daily and the Ann Arbor Times. At a glance, these could pass for simple local news operations. But the Times report found they took money from public relations firms and Republican operatives to produce stories beneficial to those groups, a massive journalistic red flag. 
Ethical or not, the strategy can be effective for lending credibility to a particular viewpoint. Kevin DeLuca, an assistant professor of political science at Yale University who has researched pink slime websites, conducted an experiment that showed subjects both real unbiased news sites and others produced by Metric Media. 
Some subjects in the study were given a tip sheet that asked them to examine the sites closely, looking at whether they included information like credible mission pages and other details. But even with the tip sheet, the study subjects said in interviews that they didn’t strongly prefer the truly local over the manufactured sites. 
DeLuca says these sites are now in place around the United States, and news consumers have little idea when they’re running into them. The problem may only get worse with the spread of generative AI, since that technology further reduces the cost of creating such sites.
Researchers who study these sites say it’s never been easier to produce them. Local news, for one, has faced a years-long financial crisis that’s wiped many once-robust operations off the map.

While it can’t be said whether any one publication uses AI-generated content, the wide availability of tools like ChatGPT, capable of producing at least a semblance of a passable news story, have also made it easier to build up such sites. 
“It’s going to make these pink slime sites even harder for people to know that what they’re reading is not from a human source and not really local investigative journalism.” DeLuca said.
Sassounian, for his part, doesn’t think there’s any risk the two California Couriers would ever be confused with each other. He took over the paper in the 1980s, and his columns, which he describes as “hard-hitting editorials that defend the rights of the Armenian people worldwide,” have been translated into languages around the world. 
“It’s not pleasant to have our name used by someone else,” Sassounian said. “I prefer that they don’t, but I don’t know what I can do about it.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/121125-CA-COURIER-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 08:57:15.547655

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As states across the nation broke into a redistricting arms race ahead of the 2026 elections, Utah got a new congressional map through a court-ordered redistricting process stemming from a yearslong lawsuit alleging gerrymandering and a violation of Utahns’ rights to reform their government through ballot initiative. 
By the end of 2025, a Utah judge had ordered a new congressional map that included one Democratic-leaning district. 
The ruling has left Republican lawmakers dismayed and defiant. They’ve accused the judge of violating the Utah Constitution and separation of powers principles, as they maintain the Legislature has the sole authority to draw political boundaries. They’ve pledged to continue to fight the ruling in court and have pushed back candidate filing deadlines to allow more time for a different map to be put in place. 
As Supreme Court pulls back on gerrymandering, state courts may decide fate of maps

Anti-gerrymandering groups and plaintiffs in the case, meanwhile, are standing firm, arguing that the courts have not only the power — but the responsibility — to step in when lawmakers have failed to pass a lawful map. 
Voters in 2018 narrowly approved a ballot measure known as Proposition 4, which created an independent redistricting commission that had to adhere to neutral map-drawing criteria. But lawmakers later repealed and replaced that law with a new one to turn the independent commission into an advisory body that lawmakers ultimately didn’t need to listen to. 
Though 2025 brought significant developments in Utah’s longstanding redistricting legal fight, it’s still far from being resolved. 
Here are the key issues to watch in 2026 — which will have crucial implications for Utah’s redistricting process, the fate of Utahns’ ballot initiative power, and the future of Utah’s political landscape.

Will Utah’s court-ordered congressional map hold? 
The lawsuit over Utah’s redistricting process is far from over. 
The Utah Legislature’s top Republican leaders have repeatedly said they plan to appeal 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s rulings to the Utah Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. 
Late last month, Gibson issued a ruling declining to finalize the larger, ongoing redistricting lawsuit but allowing final certification of her Aug. 25 ruling that tossed out the Legislature’s 2021 map. That means the Legislature can appeal that specific decision to the Utah Supreme Court, which it’s expected to do in early January.

In that ruling, Gibson acknowledged that “until there is a final decision on these legal issues from our Supreme Court, there will be a cloud (over) Utah’s congressional elections and an open question regarding the power of the Legislature and the power of the people.” 
“The Utah Supreme Court can decide now if the Legislature is the sole and exclusive authority over redistricting in Utah or if it shares that responsibility with the people,” Gibson wrote. “It can decide if the people of Utah, through the exercise of their right to alter or reform government through a citizen initiative, can also pass binding laws regarding how the Legislature performs its redistricting duty.”
Additionally, the judge said the Utah Supreme Court “should decide now” if her Aug. 25 ruling that blocked the Legislature’s 2021 congressional map should stand or not. 
“These legal questions should be put to rest as soon as possible,” she wrote. “There is no just reason to delay the Utah Supreme Court’s review of those legal rulings in the (Aug. 25 ruling).” 
In redistricting fight, Utah Republican lawmakers will appeal to Utah Supreme Court

Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. 
Lawmakers in a special session pushed back the 2026 congressional candidate filing period by about two months — until March 9-13 — in hopes of getting a different congressional map in place in time for the 2026 elections. But it remains unclear whether the Utah Supreme Court will weigh in on time, what its decision will be — or if lawmakers will attempt any other legislative maneuvers between now and then. 
For now, though, Utah’s court-ordered map that includes a Democratic-leaning district concentrated in northern Salt Lake County, remains.
Democrats’ crowded race for Congress 
With high hopes that Utah Democrats will have their best chance in years to send a candidate to the U.S. House, the Democratic primary for the state’s newly drawn 1st Congressional District is already shaping up to be a crowded one. 
State Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, was the first to announce, followed closely by former congressman Ben McAdams, the last Utah Democrat to hold a seat in Congress. Former state Sen. Derek Kitchen also jumped into the race, along with current Sen. Nate Blouin, Salt Lake City Council member Eva Lopez Chavez, and a newcomer from West Valley City, Luis Villarreal. Even more announcements could be in the works. 
Meanwhile, the new District 1 could force a shakeup in Utah’s current all-Republican delegation. 
Utah lawmakers condemn courts while anti-gerrymandering supporters urge ‘hear our voice’

Because congressional candidates don’t need to live in the district they represent, it’s not yet clear which district each incumbent will run for. But if Utah’s current court-ordered map holds, whichever Republican runs for the 1st Congressional District will likely face an uphill battle to keep his or her seat. 
Will Republicans’ effort to repeal Prop 4 succeed? 
While Utah’s redistricting court battle continues, the Utah Republican Party and a political issues committee called Utahns for Representative Government are pursuing a ballot initiative of their own to repeal the voter-approved independent redistricting law known as Proposition 4. 
To successfully place the repeal question on the 2026 ballot, the groups have until Feb. 14 to gather at least 140,748 valid signatures from registered voters and hit high enough thresholds in at least 26 out of the state’s 29 Senate districts. 
As of Dec. 31, 24,372 signatures had been submitted, according to the Lieutenant Governor’s Office.
Another redistricting twist: Utah GOP changes tactics to repeal independent map-drawing law

A dark money group that helped finance President Donald Trump presidential campaign in 2024 is bankrolling the Proposition 4 repeal effort. The nonprofit Securing American Greatness has contributed more than $4.3 million to Utahns for Representative Government, according to the group’s received contributions report. 
The anti-gerrymandering group Better Boundaries — which successfully sought Proposition 4 in 2018 — has been encouraging Utahns not to sign the repeal petition, while also accusing some paid signature gatherers of using “misleading and deceptive tactics to trick people into signing.” The group has also issued reminders that signers can go through a process to remove their signatures. 
If the groups successfully place the repeal question on the 2026 ballot, Utah voters will have the final say on whether Proposition 4 stays — or gets overturned. 
Lawmakers may try again to enshrine their power over ballot initiatives 
When Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders announced they would be holding a special session to push back congressional candidate filing deadlines, they also said they plan to consider asking voters to consider a constitutional amendment to “clarify” or restrict the power of voter-approved ballot initiatives. 
It wouldn’t be the first time Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature tried to do this — but the last attempt failed, voided by the courts. 
After a groundbreaking Utah Supreme Court ruling in 2024 made clear that the Legislature’s power over “government reform” ballot initiatives has limits, Utah lawmakers put a question known as Amendment D on the 2024 November ballot to sidestep that ruling and rewrite the Utah Constitution. 
Judge voids controversial constitutional amendment on Utah’s Nov. 5 ballot

Had it been approved by voters, Amendment D would have enshrined in the Utah Constitution the Legislature’s unfettered power to repeal or alter any type of ballot initiative, including Proposition 4. 
However, the Nov. 5 ballot language posing the question to voters — written by Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders — did not explain that in plain language, prompting critics to sue. They claimed Amendment D’s language was “false and misleading.”
Gibson agreed, while also determining state officials failed to meet constitutional publication requirements — so she voided the question. State attorneys appealed the decision to the Utah Supreme Court, which affirmed the district court’s decision.
But Utah lawmakers don’t seem likely to drop the issue. They may pursue a new version of Amendment D — but it’s not yet clear what its language will be. Lawmakers are likely to consider a resolution to put the question on the ballot during their 2026 general session scheduled to begin Jan. 20. 
Lawmakers eye changes to the courts 
As part of a brewing issue that’s related to redistricting but bigger — stemming from lawmakers’ overall recent frustrations with the court system — Utah legislators are likely to again turn their attention to Utah’s judiciary and consider making changes. 
Utah’s top GOP lawmakers have said that the Legislature is expected to weigh whether to expand Utah’s Supreme Court from five justices to seven. 
They told the Deseret News it’s meant to address growing caseloads and to speed up decisions, but Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told The Salt Lake Tribune in October that more justice could actually lead to more deliberation and delay timelines further. 
Saying it’s not court packing, governor supports expanding Utah’s appeals courts  

Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters during his Nov. 25 news conference broadcast by PBS Utah that he’s in favor of adding more justices to the Utah Supreme Court and more judges to the state’s Court of Appeals. 
The governor said he doesn’t see it as court packing, and that he doesn’t share the same consternation lawmakers have with the courts. Rather, he said he sees it as a way to “start moving justice quicker through the system.”
A majority of states have at least seven justices. That includes neighboring Colorado and Nevada. Idaho and Wyoming have five. 
If the Utah Legislature’s 2026 session is anything like last year’s, however, it’s possible tensions between lawmakers and the judiciary could boil over again. Last year, lawmakers considered a slate of bills that legal professionals and even Durrant, who as a member of the high court doesn’t generally comment on political issues, described as a “broad attack on the independence of the judiciary.” 
Many of those bills, however, fizzled or resulted in a compromise. It’s possible some could return for further debate. 
Additionally, some Republican lawmakers have voiced support for considering articles of impeachment against Gibson over her rulings in the redistricting case — but it remains to be seen whether that effort will gain any traction. 
Rep. Matt MacPherson, R-West Valley City, said he planned to file articles of impeachment against the judge. But when asked about that effort in November, MacPherson told Utah News Dispatch he wanted to wait and see how the Legislature’s appeal to the Utah Supreme Court goes before deciding whether to proceed.

Jeana Ross, R-Guntersville, speaks to the Alabama House of Representatives on May 8, 2024 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker has pre-filed a bill for the 2026 legislative session that would limit screen time for children.
HB 78, sponsored by Jeana Ross, R-Guntersville, would require licensed child-care facilities, public kindergarten classrooms and certain Pre-K classrooms to implement guidelines and training on screen time created by the Department of Early Childhood Education (ADECE) Research and Evaluation team.
Ross, who previously served as Alabama Secretary of Early Childhood Education, said after seeing what research said about the effects of screen time on children wanted to find a way to prevent it.

“I can remember early on, like in the early 2000s writing grants, because I wanted every child to have an iPad. I just thought, because it was the new technology, and they could put all their books on the iPad, and they wouldn’t have to carry those heavy books in a backpack,” she said in a recent interview. “I didn’t know better, but now we see what the outcomes are and why it wasn’t such a bad idea for the older students, but it absolutely was not a good idea for the younger students.”
An August report from Cedars-Sinai Medical Medical Center, a hospital in Los Angeles, said that children under three years old should have “little to no screen exposure” because it can delay social skill development.
“We’ve long recognized that the earliest years of life matter the most, and from birth to age five, their children’s brains are developing so fast, I mean, faster than any other time, and the experiences they have during those years shapes their learning for a lifetime,” Ross said.
Ross said one key piece of this bill is bringing awareness to parents about screen usage.
“This is not about shaming or making people feel like, oh my goodness, what have I done? This is just about informing, and that’s going to be a big piece of this legislation, that parents are going to be able to have information that they might not have known about, as far as how to best use screens and when not to use them,” she said.
Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey said after the Dec. 11 Alabama State Board of Education meeting that while screens have their place in society, students need to be spending instructional time with teachers.
“There’s a lot of research about the overuse of screens in some places. We already have limitations on our four-year-old Pre-K program in this state, so I’m excited about us having discussions about how we can extend some of those limits to five-year-olds,” he said.
Under the Alabama Administrative Code, children under the age of two are prohibited from screen usage and children over the age of two are limited to less than 30 minutes per day for children in half-day programs and less than an hour a day in full-day programs in licensed childcare facilities.
Not all child care facilities in Alabama are licensed. Out of 2,458 facilities roughly 78% (1,922) are licensed by the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). Licensed facilities are required to reapply for licensure every two years.
Ross’ bill expands these limitations to include weekly limitations of 90 minutes per day for children ages two through four and individual screen usage is prohibited. Local boards of education must adopt policies on appropriate screen time usage in kindergarten classrooms.
Guidelines implemented in the bill would be created by the Department of Early Childhood Education (ADECE) Research and Evaluation team in collaboration with DHR and the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE). All three agencies will implement the guidelines once created.
“If you provide the opportunity to people, for people to have input, not only are you creating something that’s got a lot of good across the board perspective, you’re including people in the process, and I think that’s very important,” Ross said.
The guidelines must include the importance of reading, play, physical activity and caregiver-child interaction; the risks of excessive screen time on children and strategies for creating “screen-free routines” at home.
The bill would require certain teachers and staff to undergo annual training developed by ADECE, DHR AND ALSDE that includes guidance on the appropriate use of screen time in early childhood settings, what constitutes high-quality programming and alternatives to screen time.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Tribes across the West have worked with states to protect the Colorado River and conserve enough water to raise elevations in the river’s two largest reservoirs, Lakes Powell and Mead, a move that has helped states during critical droughts.
Now tribes want to make it clear that any future agreements on how to manage the river’s water must include their input and an acknowledgment that they intend to develop their water rights.
“It’s high time that tribes begin to really begin to flex their sovereignty,” said Mike Natchees, a member of the Ute Indian Tribe Business Committee.
The Ute Indian Tribe holds significant senior water rights, including 500,000 acre-feet in the Green River basin in Utah, but faces challenges with unused water flowing downstream due to lack of infrastructure and funding. 
“It just continues to flow downstream. We are uncompensated for it. It is undeveloped. And again, that is unacceptable for the Ute Indian Tribe,” Natchees said.
That sentiment was shared among representatives for dozens of tribes who spoke at the Colorado River Water Users Association conference at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in December.
Western states that rely on the Colorado River have less than two months to agree on how to manage the troubled river. The seven Colorado River Basin states — Arizona, California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming — have until Feb. 14 to reach a new water sharing agreement before current operating rules expire at the end of 2026 —or the federal government will step in with their own plan.
But the Ute Indian Tribe, whose reservation is located in Northeastern Utah, emphasized that any new agreement will have a significant impact on tribes across the Colorado River basin.
One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use during dry years. Historically, Lower Basin states have used nearly all their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation under current Colorado River guidelines, compared to the 4.5 million acres-feet used by the Upper Basin states.
Natchees said the impact of water cuts to tribes in the Upper Basin have not been discussed enough during negotiations, adding that he hopes tribes will one day have a seat on the Upper Colorado River Commission, an interstate water administrative agency that represents Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico.
“The bottom line is that the Lower Basin is just simply over allocated. They’re overusing and they’re doing it with no regard to anyone in the Upper Basin, which feeds their system, and that needs to change,” Natchees said.
Tribes have continued to be a part of the solution when it comes to conservation on the river, said President of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, Jonathan E. Koteen.
In 2025, the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe signed an agreement to conserve 13,000 acre-feet of water to bolster elevations in Lake Mead, and contributed additional water savings through its ongoing seasonal fallowing agreement with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
Those water savings helped California reach its goal of conserving 1.6 million acre-feet in Lake Mead a year ahead of schedule.
“Tribal inclusion must be formal, meaningful and permanent. Tribes are not new participants. We are original stewards of the river, and our voices must be part of shaping the future family,” Koteen said.
Conservation efforts by tribes have also been innovative, said Koteen. The Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe secured funding to line the Reservation Main Canal, reducing seepage and improving efficiency for water deliveries to large portions of the Yuma Project Reservation Division.
Another example of an innovative solution was when the Jicarilla Apache Nation entered a landmark 10-year water-sharing agreement with New Mexico and The Nature Conservancy in 2023 to lease up to 20,000 acre-feet of its Colorado River water annually, supporting endangered fish habitat and water security for the state by strategically releasing water into the San Juan River.
“It’s increasing water security for the state of New Mexico, allowing the state to meet its obligations under whatever framework that we end up coming up with in post 2026, so it’s a great project,” said Jenny Dumas, the water attorney for the Jicarilla Apache Nation.
But Dumas emphasized that not every tribe can replicate such an agreement, and every tribe has their own unique needs that must be considered when settling on a new water sharing agreement.
Councilmember for Ute Mountain Ute Tribe Conrad Jacket said the tribe’s Bow and Arrow Farm is a major economic driver. While tribes in California, like the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, are able to reduce crops for payment, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe can not.
“This year, we did have to cut back,” Jacket said. “And that’s not good on our part. That is not good on all this whole region’s part.”
Instead, the tribe would benefit more from flexible tools that allow the tribe’s water to be set aside in good water years, while contributing to additional release in dry years.
Tribes said they were committed to helping states reach a seven-state consensus on how to share the river’s water, in order to stabilize the river and secure their rights.
During the conference, the Colorado River Indian Tribes, the Gila River Indian Community and the Central Arizona Water Conservation District, which manages the Central Arizona Project, signed a major proclamation to work together to protect the Colorado River.
The Colorado River Indian Tribes is Arizona’s largest and most senior Colorado River water rights holder.
“All of us who live in Arizona, native and non-native alike, are connected by water, for without water, there is no life.  And it is that common thread that binds us, which has us here today, pledging to work together for the greater good of all who live in Arizona,” said Colorado River Indian Tribes Chairwoman Amelia Flores.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC08889-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 08:11:41.157980

The lieutenant governor presides over the Alabama Senate but has little power over the chamber. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)The Alabama lieutenant governor, constitutionally speaking, is like a bag of old phone charging cords.
You may need it one day. But it’s more likely to sit and do nothing.
Which is not to say the person occupying the office is powerless. The lieutenant governor has some appointments. He or she presides over the Senate and casts votes in the event of a deadlock. And should the governor leave office — legally or mortally — the lieutenant governor takes the job.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But for most occupants, it’s four or eight years of doing little but calling senators to order and reporting the outcome of votes.
The lieutenant governor, in effect, is a timekeeper with benefits. You could become governor. But you most likely won’t. It’s the vestigial tail of Alabama government.
Yet promising to sit better than your opponents doesn’t fly in a political campaign. So candidates for the office have to pretend its limitations don’t exist, or campaign on their personalities.
I’ll give Wes Allen this much: His campaign website for lieutenant governor seemingly acknowledges that fact. It has no issues section or platform. It’s just Allen and his far-right ideas, particularly when it comes to voting.
It’s the same thing with Agriculture and Industries Commissioner Rick Pate, another candidate for the office. The only suggestion policy on his site is a link to a story in which Pate says Trump’s tariffs on agriculture, which are terrible for farmers, are actually good for them.
There are other candidates with plans for the job. Patrick Bishop wants to “vigorously advocate for the equality of all Americans” (could be a tough sell in the Alabama GOP these days). Dean Odle has a lengthy article on his website about an alliance between Islam and communism (which probably would have used “Catholicism” in the place of “Islam” not too long ago). Nicole Wadsworth has a detailed issues page, but hardly anything on it is in the purview of the office she seeks.
Phillip Ensler, so far the sole Democratic candidate, says he would try to facilitate healthy debate in the chamber, in hopes of advancing legislation on issues like education and health care. He can do everything on the former, but it’s hard to see what effect he could have on the latter in a GOP-dominated Senate.
This will be a pattern over the next few months. Among Republicans, you’re going to see a lot of arguments over who loves President Donald Trump more and can act as the oracle of his will. They’re going to want you to think that they can remake education and the economy while asking the clerk to call the roll in the Senate.
And we’re going to see a lot of money spent on this timekeeping job. In 2018, the candidates for the office spent over $5 million on the race. Combined, Allen and Pate raised $1.3 million for the lieutenant governor contest by the end of November.
The lieutenant governor’s race, in that respect, is an estuary where the fresh water of political ambition meets the brackish waves of constitutional reality.
But it also reflects a broader disconnect between campaigning and governing in this state. Which we’re going to see a lot of in these midterm elections.
Tommy Tuberville’s gubernatorial campaign website leads with his promise to fight “woke ideology.” In Alabama, this has meant making teachers afraid to discuss Black history with students and having publicly subsidized come-aparts over rainbow flags.  He also wants to bring back manufacturing jobs, secure the border that’s some 675 miles away from Alabama, and improve education, somehow.
The thing, though, is that Tuberville won’t have the power to do any of that should he be elected governor. He’ll have a bully pulpit — emphasis on bully — for his obsessions. But Tuberville will learn, as other governors have, that power in the state resides in the Legislature.
But he’s not the only candidate who doesn’t seem up to speed on the state of things in Alabama. Jay Mitchell and Katherine Robertson’s attorney general campaigns leave one with the impression that A) Alabama’s immigration rates are high (they are lower than the national average), B) that immigration is inherently a problem and C) that Immigration and Customs Enforcement somehow needs their help to terrorize children and families.
Over in the secretary of state’s race — a campaign for an office that does little more than file papers — Caroleene Dobson and Andrew Sorrell want you to think election fraud, effectively nonexistent in Alabama, is a much bigger issue than election accessibility.
It’s this strange game we play. Candidates pick issues that have little valence in the state. Voters more affected by rising health care costs than “woke” largely let them get away with it, so long as they keep the right-wing catchphrases coming. And for four years after electing them, we lament that the state government doesn’t do anything.
Most of those offices have more power than the lieutenant governor does. But like that old bag of charging cords, they seem to be a poor fit for our present needs.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Leg-7173-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 08:11:41.157980
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-05 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Is Congress facing another shutdown threat? Here’s what to know.,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/05/congress-federal-shutdown-january-2026/,"Funding for much of the federal government runs out Jan. 30. If Congress doesn't approve a deal by then, it could lead to a partial shutdown.","After a record-long government shutdown that ended in November, Congress faces another funding deadline just two months later.
Federal lawmakers are trying to avoid another closure that would lead to furloughs of thousands of federal workers and a pause in some government operations. But the consequences wouldn’t likely be as significant as the one in the fall because a few agencies already have full-year funding through the end of September.
Funding standoffs are becoming increasingly common, and the government has been operating for a while on short-term bills to keep things running at current levels. And that has left Congress more susceptible to shutdown threats.
With lawmakers returning from the holiday recess this week, they have a short window to strike a funding deal on an appropriations package for the rest of fiscal year 2026 or opt to pass another short-term bill to give them more time for negotiations.
If they are unable to approve any funding fix by the end of the month, the government could fall into a partial shutdown.
Here’s where things currently stand.
Why is government funding running out in January?
Congress set the next funding deadline for Jan. 30 as part of a bipartisan deal that reopened the government in mid-November.
Members passed three of the 12 full-year spending bills that fund specific government agencies for fiscal year 2026: military construction projects and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, and the Legislative Branch which keeps Congress operating. Those funds will last until Sept. 30, which is the end of the federal fiscal year.
Meanwhile, the rest of the government agencies are operating on flat funding that will expire at the end of January.
Congress will either need to pass the remaining nine spending bills that’ll keep the rest of the government funded through September or pass another short-term measure known as a continuing resolution.
Will they meet the deadline to avert a shutdown?
Congress will be tasked with finishing up a broader funding deal with less than a month until the deadline.
Negotiations were underway before the holiday break and will ramp back up again for the next three weeks that Congress is in session in January.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, will play a major role in those negotiations. She’s the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, which crafts and negotiates spending legislation.
Leaders are hopeful they can broker a deal with new topline numbers. But if an agreement on a funding package doesn’t come together, Congress will likely resort to a continuing resolution that’ll keep funding going for a shorter period of time. But passage of that type of legislation isn’t guaranteed either.
Even if funding were to lapse again, it wouldn’t be like last year’s 43-day shutdown.
Some programs that were suspended in the fall, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, wouldn’t be in jeopardy again. That’s because Congress already approved full-year funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees federal nutrition assistance.
Will health care play a role again? 
During the funding standoff in the fall, congressional Democrats made health care one of the central demands to earn their votes. Because of narrow majorities in Congress, Republicans needed Democratic votes at least in the Senate to pass any funding bills.
The debate revolved around the extension of enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans. With the expiration of those pandemic-era tax credits after Dec. 31, premiums are set to spike for many this year who get their coverage through the state’s marketplace, Access Health CT.
Democrats, including Connecticut’s congressional delegation, have said they’ll keep fighting for the renewal of those expired subsidies that had been in place since 2021.
But it is unclear if the party will once again tie the tax credits to funding the government at the end of January, though they could make new demands.
Separately from government funding, various groups of lawmakers are seeking a legislative solution to bring back the subsidies, though likely with some limits.
And the House is expected to take up Democrats’ three-year extension after the party and four Republicans forced the issue through a procedural tool called a discharge petition. Because lawmakers collected 218 signatures, it triggers a vote on the House floor.
Even if it passes the House this month, Senate GOP leadership is unlikely to take it up. A vote on the three-year subsidy extension failed to advance in the Senate last month.
Will CT secure the rest of its congressional earmarks?
Connecticut’s congressional delegation scored some of its funding requests for local projects for the first time in years.
That’s because earmarks — now known as congressionally directed spending in the Senate and community project funding in the House — usually only get approved in full-year spending bills.
Lawmakers are able to make requests with some limitations that typically get steered toward pet projects in their states. Connecticut’s delegation has sought funding for infrastructure and environmental investments, social services for families and children, affordable housing and upgrades for police departments and emergency units.
Connecticut’s share of approved earmarks were part of the three full-year spending bills that passed in November to end the shutdown. But dozens of other earmarks requests are in limbo.
If Congress can pass some or all of the remaining nine funding bills this month, Connecticut will secure funding for its other initiatives that amount to tens of millions of dollars. Lawmakers in the state sought at least $177 million in earmarks for FY 2026.
But if the government stays open through a short-term fix, funding for those local projects are unlikely to materialize. Lawmakers will be able to make new earmarks requests later in the year for fiscal year 2027.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25274456520062-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 07:57:42.254403

Industry groups and climate advocates anxiously await the $126 million initiative. But the state lawmakers who championed it say it’s taken far too long to come online. […],"Freightliner eCascadia electric trucks used in a Coca-Cola Bottling fleet are pictured in 2023. (Photo courtesy of Daimler Truck AG)Washington is close to opening a new incentive program for commercial fleet operators to transition trucks and other vehicles to models that run on electric or hydrogen power.
Industry groups and climate advocates anxiously await the $126 million initiative. But the state lawmakers who championed it say it’s taken far too long to come online.
The transportation sector is the biggest driver of Washington’s carbon emissions. Exhaust from big trucks and buses makes up a disproportionate share of those emissions, and diesel air pollution can be especially unhealthy.
To help combat this, the Washington Zero-Emission Incentive Program, or WAZIP, is expected to launch in the spring.
“We are very eager for WAZIP to launch as soon as possible,” said Leah Missik, the Washington legislative director for environmental advocacy group Climate Solutions. “We know from the experience in other states and even from the experience of people who’ve been able to get clean trucks here in Washington that this program will help drivers and businesses save money, and it will benefit communities.”
Washington has already made some progress.
In 2024, nearly one in five new medium- and heavy-duty vehicles sold in Washington ran on zero-emission technology, according to the state Department of Ecology. Though the adoption rate varies depending on the type. Heavier trucks are harder to come by than, for example, electric delivery vans. Think of Amazon’s ubiquitous Rivian vans.
Heavy trucks, on the other hand, remain prohibitively expensive for many companies, while lacking public charging infrastructure, industry groups say. And they can’t go nearly as far on a charge as their diesel-fueled counterparts, not to mention they’re much heavier.
The city of Seattle has tried its own incentive program offering up to $180,000 for Class 8 heavy-duty trucks to serve the Port of Seattle. But even with that sweetener, operators found the transition still unfeasible financially.
Instead, the city in October partnered with a company called Zeem Solutions to distribute $1.5 million to drayage operators. It follows more than $5 million that the Northwest Seaport Alliance gave the company over the summer for a commercial fleet charging depot in the city of SeaTac.
But while Washington state moves ahead, the federal government has looked to slow the transition. 
Washington has been following the lead of California in its push toward zero-emission vehicles. California has a unique ability to set emission rules that go further than federal guidelines, and other states can pick between the two. Washington has been following California’s stricter standards. 
But Congress this year repealed California’s opportunity to set those standards. States, including Washington, have sued the federal government over the move.
One of those rules pushes manufacturers to up their sales of zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks over time. The move by Congress and approved by President Donald Trump offers a “slight ease of pressure” on the trucking industry, said Sheri Call, president and CEO of the Washington Trucking Associations.
“But it also doesn’t mean that we don’t want to continue the conversation about what industry can do today,” Call continued, “because we do have members who are motivated to reduce their carbon footprint. They just need workable solutions to do so.”
The local trucking industry is also grappling with the Trump administration’s cancellation of federal money meant to fuel a hub of hydrogen development in the region, which aimed to help develop cleaner semitrucks, among other things. Call said this is “very promising technology for the industry, especially in the heavy truck space.”
How will it work?
The WAZIP program is funded by proceeds from the state’s carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act. 
It’ll offer $82 million in vouchers for on-road vehicles, $20 million for off-road equipment, like forklifts and farm equipment. It’ll also have $10 million reserved for small businesses.
For example, buyers of a zero-emission Class 4 medium-duty truck weighing between 14,001 pounds and 16,000 pounds could get $60,000 off at the point of sale, though the final voucher amounts aren’t yet finalized. The vouchers, which increase based on weight, cover electric and hydrogen fuel cell technology.
For reference, a Class 4 diesel truck costs around $60,000 while the electric version is roughly $160,000, according to John Barnes, of TEC Equipment. Diesel Class 8 trucks cost $160,000 compared to $600,000 for electrics.
Voucher applicants can also ask for more money to install charging infrastructure, a major barrier to transitioning to zero-emission vehicles for both businesses and individuals. 
The hope is that trucking companies can get assistance with upfront costs to transition toward electric, then reap the benefits of reduced fuel costs over time.
“I cannot understate the importance of it in terms of hitting our climate targets, but also helping people save money over the long run,” Missik said.
Some businesses will be eligible for even more savings. They include those with under $10 million in annual revenue and those certified as an emerging or rising business by the state’s Office of Women and Minority Owned Business Enterprises. Drayage operators, veteran-owned businesses, nonprofits and public agencies also qualify. 
In the Class 4 example, these purchasers could get an extra $10,000 off.
Businesses can also buy converted or used vehicles with vouchers of reduced value.
The initiative is modeled on similar efforts in California, where a truck incentive program has given out roughly 15,000 vouchers totaling over $1.6 billion in savings in the past 15 years.
Call and Missik both expect WAZIP to be very popular.
What’s taking so long?
But those leading the charge for WAZIP’s creation think it should already be up and running. 
State House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, said it should’ve started up at least six months ago. His counterpart in the Senate agrees.
“The governor’s office and the Department of Transportation know that I’m not satisfied by how long it’s taken to get this done,” Fey said. “It’s beyond the point now that my patience is about done with this.”
In response, the state Department of Transportation noted “this is a complex program that WSDOT needs to ensure is developed and administered properly, because significant state resources are involved.”
“This work includes custom software to meet Washington’s unique needs,” spokesperson Barbara LaBoe said in an email. “WSDOT is working diligently to deliver the program as quickly as possible, while maintaining the high standards for compliance and usability that are required.”

(Photo by Donna Gordon Blankinship)When Cadence was deciding which 8th grade classes to take at Maywood Middle School, a couple of things influenced the 14-year-old’s choices. 
“I don’t like ELA,” she said, referring to English Language Arts, the term schools use these days for reading and writing. 
So Cadence chose to spend part of her day in Issaquah School District’s experimental microschool, which combines science and English with a focus on the environment, and an emphasis on hands-on learning.
On a recent Friday afternoon, Cadence and her classmates were conducting an experiment to better understand radiation, using skittles and math — and both reading and writing. Earlier in the period, she participated in a class review session employing both writing and conversation. And her class also spoke briefly about the book they had been reading about the groundbreaking chemist and physicist Marie Curie.
In other words, her teacher, Valerie Buck, weaves reading and writing into every day and every project, with or without Cadence and her classmates realizing. It’s a creative approach to meeting students where they are academically.
Customizing education to the needs of individual students is not new. Research has shown for decades that every child requires a slightly different path to academic success. But most schools find it easier to talk about than to actually do in large classes during short class periods.
Issaquah’s microschool program is just one notable example where a Washington school is working hard to overcome those obstacles. Creativity in educational programs appears — in my limited view — to be growing again in these post-pandemic years. Microschools are one option.
Some consider microschools, which are more popular on the East Coast, a leftover from the pandemic. Some families who felt online learning wasn’t working formed their own learning “pods,” where students could both quarantine and learn.
The Maywood program doesn’t exactly fit the microschool model, because it’s not an all-day, standalone program. But it has many of the elements: It is small (50 total students in two classes) and different and has a focus on personalized learning.
Students opted into the program, which the school views, in part, as a way to get them ready for the project-based learning approach at a district high school. Building community is another major goal in Buck’s classroom and another emphasis at many microschools.
The Issaquah project is not offered as an all-day standalone program, although that is a goal, because school officials could not cobble together enough money to launch a larger pilot.
They are lucky to have enough space — tucked away from regular classes — to give them the feeling of being special and unique. And this corner of Maywood has a couple more empty classrooms just begging to be filled with an expanded program, which Buck said would allow them more time for hands-on learning.
Buck chose to focus on the Salish Sea and sustainability and has integrated community service projects to add real-life experience. For example, students did a water use study about shorter showers and visited the Gates Foundation to learn about water and toilets.
“I think it’s important because kids really need purpose with what they’re learning,” Buck said.

Penelope, 13, agreed. “It seemed more interesting than normal classes,” she said between counting “radioactive” skittles in Buck’s class. “You get to do nice hands-on things, which is fun.”
Julia Bamba, the microschool principal who oversees special projects and innovation for the district, said Issaquah started experimenting with alternative school models because they wanted to give students more control over their learning.
The district takes a slow and steady approach to innovation, starting with prototypes that are thoroughly tested before scaling. It’s not good enough for the innovations to meet student desire for variety (or more science and less language arts); they also must meet the district’s high academic standards, Bamba said.
She pointed to a few other public school programs that both inspired Issaquah and keep them thinking about how they can innovate.
Big Picture Learning is a network of schools across the nation and in Washington that emphasizes student-directed learning. And Tacoma Public Schools has become a center for creativity through a maritime education partnership with the Port of Tacoma, and by providing numerous ways students can earn college credit while still in high school. 
‘Customer’ focus and creativity in Spokane
One of my favorite examples of school innovation is Spokane Public Schools. A recent conversation with Kristin Whiteaker, who is director of charter schools, satellite schools and program support for the district, revealed there’s more going on in Spokane than I was aware of.
You may remember that when Washington state started experimenting with charter schools, Spokane was the only district that decided to embed that choice inside their public school walls. But they’ve done a lot more. They not only provided intentional remote learning years before the pandemic, they have strengthened and grown their online school since then. Spokane Virtual Learning welcomes students from across the state and has higher graduation rates (88% in four years) than a lot of regular public schools.
Spokane offers many other choices from the school innovation checklist: Dual-language immersion in Spanish and English, project-based learning, a parent-teacher cooperative model, special resources for homeschool families, a biomedical institute, a standalone highly capable program, and a Montessori school. Spokane also has district-wide school choice so students and families can choose which program is best for them.
Why so many choices? That’s what the community wanted, Whiteaker said.
While many districts across Washington lost enrollment during and after the pandemic, Spokane didn’t. Whiteaker credits their “customer” focus and ongoing academic success.
“We’re constantly surveying families to ask questions about what their interests are and what their perspectives are before we make decisions,” she said.
Whiteaker emphasized that Spokane isn’t just interested in creativity, but academic success.
“We lead with data and research and have a focus on best practices,” she said, adding, “And the heart. Care that comes from the heart is part of our culture.”
They don’t have a microschool, but I’m guessing that’s because Spokane parents haven’t heard of them yet.
An evolving trend
Microschools most closely resemble one-room schoolhouses, although they usually have more than one room. But the idea is the same: small school, multi-aged classes, hands-on, differentiated learning. The concept blossomed during and after the pandemic, but existed well before. 
Their size makes the economics more difficult than the academics, and state regulations can also be a stumbling block. A few states have passed laws giving microschools the right to exist, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. Other states, including Oregon, Illinois and Massachusetts, require hybrid authorization similar to private schools.
Many microschools in other states (and potentially in Washington) operate under homeschool laws or as private schools. A 2025 report from the National Microschooling Center estimates that between 750,000 and 2.1 million students attend microschools in the U.S. They are in every state as well as Washington, D.C., and nearly half were founded by parents.
Sixty-one percent of microschools nationally get their funding from tuition, while 38% get at least some of their money from state school choice dollars, such as vouchers. Ten percent get regular public school or charter school funding.
A Washington proposal to establish a pilot project to authorize certified teachers to operate microschools failed to pass during the 2022 legislative session. But districts and private schools are allowed to experiment with the model under existing laws.
Tailored approach
Another Washington microschool, the Kineo School in Kirkland, is private, tuition-funded and designed to serve a neurodivergent student population. It has a multi-age classroom and operates as a one-room schoolhouse for children in kindergarten through third grade. 
Flexibility and personalization are two main values at Kineo, explained school Director Elizabeth Kent. Everyone learns at their own pace and in small groups based on ability, not age.
Kineo and other microschools are not for everyone, Kent said. Children who thrive in larger social groups do better at larger schools. But the benefits outweigh the disadvantages for some children, such as individualized learning, which is much harder to do in a regular classroom of 30 kids with one teacher.
“I don’t know how teachers can work with large groups of students and tailor things,” Kent said.
But Kineo’s low student-teacher ratio — 10 students with two teachers, plus specialists like occupational and speech therapists — comes with a hefty price tag of about $26,000 a year. Kent said that’s about middle of the road for private schools in the area. 
The school was bigger before a large group of students graduated. Kent said they hope to grow again, but won’t go above 40 or 50 students in a few class groups.
Kent said size is an important element of a microschool, but other things, like community and personalized learning, are what make the schools special.
“Meeting individual student needs is huge. I do think you can do that with a traditional program,” she said. “What doesn’t work is if a family expectation doesn’t align with what the school is offering. It’s just not enough to desire a small school.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microschools2-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-05 07:11:40.842920

Photo by Tony Webster.Minnesota already gets more than half of its electricity from wind, solar, nuclear and other resources that don’t emit planet-warming carbon dioxide or air pollutants that harm human health. Power plants here emit 50% less greenhouse gas than 20 years ago, according to Clean Energy Economy Minnesota.
Under state law, Minnesota’s power sector needs to go 100% clean by 2040, and there’s a sense among state policymakers, utility leaders and energy system experts that the easy part may soon be over.
Energy system modelers say efforts to reduce power emissions become costlier and more logistically challenging as the grid reorients around weather-dependent renewables. Adding more of what’s known as “clean firm” resources like nuclear, geothermal, hydropower, gas plants with carbon capture, and long-duration batteries — plus more high-voltage power lines — can address what Deloitte researchers call “the last 20%” problem.
The challenge for Minnesota is that these resources all have their own tradeoffs. Policymakers, utilities, labor and host communities appear far from consensus around the best path forward — particularly when it comes to nuclear power plants, which Minnesota law prohibits building more of.
Not fast enough?

The “carbon intensity” of the Minnesota power grid ticked down another 4% in 2024 as utilities and energy developers added more renewable power, Clean Energy Economy Minnesota said in April.
The poster child for those efforts is Xcel Energy’s multiyear plan for the Sherco power plant, which by early next decade is set to host enough carbon-free power to replace most of its retiring coal units’ output. State regulators have approved a host of other clean energy projects over the past two years, including 910 megawatts’ worth — nearly the output of a full-size nuclear power plant — in a two-month span this summer.
For now, utility leaders, regulators and policymakers say Minnesota remains on track to meet its statutory obligation for 100% carbon-free power by 2040, but with a major caveat: electric vehicles, data centers and new industrial loads are pushing electricity demand upward. If built, Minnesota’s dozen or so large data center proposals would consume more power than every home in the state, according to the Star Tribune.
“Solar and wind aren’t going to do everything on their own. Yes, we are building out renewables, but not at the rate our demand for electricity is increasing,” said Rep. Spencer Igo, a third-term Republican who represents part of the Iron Range, at an October forum hosted by the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance.
The long-range plans filed by Minnesota’s two biggest for-profit utilities show firm resources like gas plants accounting for a significant share of new additions to the grid over the next decade-plus. Minnesota Power, now majority-owned by the private equity firm BlackRock, wants to add 750 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity to replace a coal power plant set to retire by 2035. Xcel Energy would deploy nearly 3,000 megawatts of batteries and “firm dispatchable” power to its system in the 2030s after adding 420 megawatts of gas at a new southwestern Minnesota power plant later this decade.
Xcel and Minnesota Power say their new gas plants would run only as needed to make up for temporary energy shortfalls caused by high power demand or periods of low wind. And Xcel is designing its Lyon County gas plant to run on a mix of at least 30% hydrogen, which does not emit greenhouse gases when burned and can be produced with carbon-free electricity (or possibly mined from natural reserves).
But in its most recent long-range plan, Xcel admits that squeezing all the greenhouse gas emissions out of its Upper Midwest grid — which covers parts of the Dakotas, Wisconsin and upper Michigan — will require “ingenuity, new technologies, and transmission.”
Leading contenders
None of those new technologies is perfect.
Geothermal power, which taps naturally occurring heat deep underground, has managed to unite environmentalists on the left with MAGA types on the right. That includes former fracking executive and now Energy Secretary Chris Wright. But even the “enhanced” geothermal systems being commercialized across the western United States today are no match for Minnesota’s stable geology, which makes getting the power out of the ground that much more difficult
Another technology that involves drilling thousands of feet into bedrock is carbon capture and sequestration. In theory, any carbon-emitting power plant could retrofit its exhaust system to absorb, liquefy and inject most of its greenhouse gas emissions deep underground.

Like geothermal power, however, long-term carbon storage requires specific subsurface conditions absent in Minnesota and much of the Midwest. Most power plants in the region would thus need to tie into yet-to-be-built pipelines like the long-planned Summit network, which would pipe carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Minnesota and four neighboring states to a storage site in western North Dakota.
Summit’s future is uncertain due to a recent regulatory setback in South Dakota and opposition from property owners regionwide. Even if it moves ahead, it will cost billions and take years to bring online. Perhaps more appealing is the potential for captured carbon to be used as an input for locally made “e-fuels” that could one day replace petroleum-based fuels for airplanes, ships and other heavy vehicles — if the economics ever make sense.
Theo Keith, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, said Minnesota’s biggest investor-owned electric utility is taking a wait-and-see approach. Xcel doesn’t currently have plans for carbon capture and doesn’t think it’s needed to reach the 2040 goal, but it “could play a role in the future of clean energy as the technology improves and the cost comes down,” he said.
Then there’s long-duration energy storage, a grab-bag of surprisingly low-tech solutions that deliver power for at least 10 hours.
Some, like the iron-air batteries Great River Energy plans to power up next year, can discharge at full capacity for several days on end. While the lithium-ion batteries dominating the grid are now cheap enough to enable 24/7 solar power in sunnier parts of the world, they may never be economical for riding out the multi-day stretches of low sun and wind Minnesota sees every winter.
Long-duration energy storage could help. But it faces its own technical and economic challenges, particularly around energy losses during charging and discharging, said Kevin Pranis, marketing manager for Laborers International in Minnesota and North Dakota. Pranis’ union hosted the October nuclear forum.
“If you only get half your energy back, it costs twice as much to run,” he said. “I could see iron-air batteries totally transforming the world and eclipsing everything else — or not.” (Coal, gas and nuclear power plants also lose a lot of energy when converting heat to electricity.)
Efficiency is one thing nearly everyone involved in Minnesota energy policy agrees on, even if they emphasize different aspects.
The controversial bill that extended key tax breaks for data centers this year also requires large-scale computing facilities to pay up to $5 million annually into a home weatherization fund for lower-income Minnesotans. Sen. Nick Frentz, a Mankato Democrat who supported the bill, said that provision would reduce customers’ electric bills and relieve stress on the grid itself.
“I’m surprised how little attention that feature is getting,” he said. “The less energy these houses use, the less pressure on our grid…it’s a big win.”

Meanwhile, DFL Reps. Larry Kraft and Kari Rehrauer want Xcel Energy and other Minnesota utilities to develop “virtual power plants” to offset 10% of their electric demand within three years.
Virtual power plants use home batteries, thermostats and other small-scale energy resources to alleviate grid constraints on the relatively rare occasions — typically on the hottest summer days — when power demand pushes the otherwise overbuilt grid to its limit. They’re far cheaper than conventional power plants, can be deployed in months rather than years, and help get more out of the existing grid without expensive new infrastructure, said George Damian, director of government affairs for Clean Energy Economy Minnesota.
“We have a system that we’ve already paid for…(so) how can we operate it better,” Damian said.
The nuclear option
Some say Minnesota’s grid would operate better if it had more nuclear power — the one resource it’s not allowed to add courtesy of a 30-year-old legislative moratorium.
At the October forum, speakers hailed the economic and environmental benefits of nuclear power. Nuclear plants employ twice as many people as similarly-sized coal plants. They pay better than most other energy employers. They’re cleaner, even considering the issue of waste storage. They’re usually the biggest taxpayers in their communities: Xcel’s Prairie Island nuclear plant accounts for 54% of Red Wing’s city tax base and 40% of its school district’s tax base, according to an analysis by Center for Energy and the Environment. And despite high construction costs, they may actually reduce the long-run cost of reaching 100% clean power.
“Eighty to 85% of the electricity we are going to need will come from tools we already have,” like wind, solar, batteries and high-voltage transmission, said Michael Noble, former executive director of St. Paul-based Fresh Energy. But “if we rely on (them) to do 100% of the job, we’re going to pay way too much for electricity…we need firm power that you can turn on when you need it,” he added.
Noble said he was motivated to speak publicly for the first time about his support for nuclear power because after decades of dithering, the industry “has its act together enough to build new nuclear.”
Dozens of startups have designs for “small modular” nuclear plants they say are safer and cheaper to build than the full-size reactors operating today. So do a handful of better-known companies, like GE and Rolls-Royce. And after 30 years during which the United States added virtually no nuclear capacity, two full-size reactors powered up earlier this decade in Georgia.
The Trump administration is all-in on nuclear. Wright, the secretary of the Department of Energy, sat on the board of well-connected nuclear startup Oklo before taking his current job. In the year since, he has reduced his department’s support for renewables while putting billions toward nuclear, geothermal and fossil fuels.
President Trump himself could reap billions from the proposed merger of his social media company and another startup aiming to commercialize nuclear fusion, a nascent technology that futurists hope ushers in an era of cheap, near-limitless energy without the long-lived radioactive waste.
Minnesota nuclear proponents want the state to lift its moratorium — the country’s strongest — and join the party. Other Midwestern states — including Democratic leaning states — have done the same: Wisconsin in 2016, Illinois just this year. If Minnesota doesn’t act soon, the long-awaited nuclear construction boom could pass it by, said Aaron Rosenthal, research director for North Star Policy Action.
“As other states have taken action on this…Minnesota is increasingly the outlier,” Rosenthal said at the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance forum. Rosenthal was the sole credited author on a pro-nuclear policy paper distributed at the event.
A Republican-led effort to repeal the nuclear construction ban came up short in the 2025 legislative session, but lawmakers are likely to try again in 2026 as development-hungry Greater Minnesota communities turn up the pressure. A coalition of 18 rural counties joined the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance in October, followed by future Xcel gas plant host Lyon County in November.
Arguments against new nuclear plants emphasize high construction costs and long build times. The two new Georgia reactors came in seven years late and $17 billion over budget, double the initial estimate. North America’s first small modular reactor, in Ontario, looks more expensive than expected, too. Proponents say costs will come down as more plants get built, citing the “learning curves” that have made wind, solar and now batteries competitive with fossil fuels; skeptics aren’t so sure.
But that debate is almost a sideshow in Minnesota. Here, any successful effort to lift the moratorium runs through the Prairie Island Indian Community, which remains opposed. In the 1970s, an Xcel predecessor company kept the tribe in the dark as it built the Prairie Island nuclear plant on its doorstep. Since the 1990s, amid a federal stalemate on long-term nuclear waste storage, radioactive spent fuel has accumulated at the site over what Rosenthal’s paper called “explicit tribal objections.” At the forum, Igo called the tribe’s treatment “horribly wrong.”
It’s an existential issue for a community whose federal recognition is tied to that particular piece of land, said Blake Johnson, the tribe’s government relations specialist.
“If something were to happen that made us evacuate and not able to return, we don’t exist as a tribe…there is still no solution to the waste that sits 700 yards from our people,” he said at the forum. The tribe’s consultations with legislators last session failed to yield a breakthrough, he added.
Igo said he would keep trying.
“We are going to move forward together or we’re not going to move forward,” he said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/24077210421_cc6f35e9aa_o-1024x646.jpg,,,2026-01-05 07:11:40.842920

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)With 2026 already underway, there are a few faces we are watching in state government. Will Indiana’s Senate Republican leader face pushback from his own caucus?  Will Democrats break through in a statewide race?
Here are five Hoosier politicos who could have an interesting year:
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray: The leader of the Senate has taken national heat for his role in the defeat of the redistricting bill. When the president of the United States is taking your name in vain, it’s not a great day. So, the question is what happens next? He isn’t up for re-election until 2028, so the primary threats are mitigated in his case. But does he still control his fractured caucus? Theoretically anyone could challenge him for his leadership post but if the redistricting vote is an indicator, Bray has the necessary support to remain. A bigger concern is his relationship with Gov. Mike Braun and House Speaker Todd Huston — both big supporters of the map redraw.

Braun has been especially upset that the Senate, at least initially, ignored his special session call. Bray reversed course and the public vote was a bit embarrassing for Braun given that Republicans have a supermajority in both legislative chambers. If Braun wants his legislative agenda to move, he will have to temper that anger. Meanwhile, Bray and Huston work closely on virtually every topic going through the General Assembly and must maintain that relationship to get past intraparty squabbles.
Speaking of Braun, he is our next person to watch. And he needs some solid wins.
In 2025, he did secure some property tax relief for Hoosiers — up to $300 for many  — but the final product was far afield from his original proposal. And we all know how redistricting went.

So, what can we expect from Braun in 2026? It’s a little unclear. His office hasn’t unveiled a specific legislative agenda even as the session resumes. And it’s ending in late February, meaning there isn’t much time to get substantive proposals done.
Braun told the Indiana Capital Chronicle he wants to focus on health care costs but didn’t give any examples of how that would occur. Lawmakers have been working on health care for several years and have a bit of fatigue on the topic.
The governor will likely face an interstate tolling debate in 2026 as the state looks for more revenue to maintain and upgrade highways. One area he is poised for big wins is on the utility front. But only if the new regulators he has named to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission come through — blocking rate hikes and generally tapping the brakes on utility profits.
For the first time in a decade, Hoosiers will see the Bayh name back on a statewide ballot. But it’s not Evan Bayh — Indiana’s former governor and U.S. senator. Instead, it’s his son Beau Bayh, a lawyer and Marine Corps captain running for secretary of state.

The 30-year-old Democrat has been on the campaign trail for months, meeting with potential voters in diners and gyms around the state. And he’s been raising money — lots of it. Since he formally launched his campaign in October, he has already raised over $1 million in large donations.
He must get past Blythe Potter at the Democratic state convention in June — a small businesswoman with her own military service record — if he wants to take on Republican Diego Morales in November. If Beau Bayh doesn’t beat Morales, who has had numerous missteps in office, Indiana Democrats will be demoralized.
Beau Bayh does have one Achilles heel — while born in Indiana he has lived most of his life on the East Coast. That was due to his father serving in the U.S. Senate and then he attended college and law school at Harvard. Republicans will use that to label him an outsider.
The race I’m most interested in this year is that of Fort Wayne Republican Sen. Liz Brown. It’s a fascinating look at how GOP politics have split in Indiana — with longtime Republicans now considered not conservative enough if they buck the party line even a little.
Brown has been one of the most strident anti-abortion voices in the state and a reliable Republican since she came to the Indiana Senate in 2015. But she got crossways with a few GOP stalwarts — including U.S. Sen. Jim Banks and Attorney General Todd Rokita. That’s because she refused to hear an immigration crackdown bill last year that she thought needed too much work.
Before that she voted against a bill to eliminate firearm licensing requirement and another banning transgender Hoosiers from high school sports.
Banks and Rokita recruited a primary challenger — well-known Allen County politico Darren Vogt.
Brown was among the most vocal in support of the recent move to redistrict Indiana’s congressional districts, and resigned a Senate leadership post in frustration. Bray later took away her Judiciary Committee chairmanship.
The last B to watch for is Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith. That’s because he is always making news, but not necessarily for the best of reasons.
Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith speaks at a pro-redistricting rally at the Indiana Statehouse on Friday, Dec. 5, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
In 2025, he had his share of controversy. From buying a luxury SUV to firing an employee who later alleged some members of the staff watched an AI-generated-porn video in the office. His employees regularly closed the Statehouse office in the summer, too. And his close friend and pastor is facing a sex scandal at his church.
Plus, Beckwith said the 3/5 compromise was a good thing and received a reprimand from Senate leadership. He often butts heads with Braun — most recently saying the Trump administration threatened federal funding for Indiana before deleting the his tweet.
It’s unclear what to expect from Beckwith in 2026 because he doesn’t follow any government or political norms. Which is just the way he likes it.

A mix of corporate donors, small-dollar contributors and others with big pockets – that latter of which appear to be pulling for Democratic U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham and Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake.
As the new year begins, the 2026 primary season is in full swing, and the top three U.S. Senate candidates on the Democratic side of the aisle each have millions of dollars to play with as they march toward August 4, the date on which voters will choose party nominees for the November general election.
The same can be said of Republican Mike Rogers, who is also sitting on a mound of cash given to him by wealthy donors throughout 2025, giving him a steep advantage as a candidate who is already maneuvering like he’s in the general election race.
Year-end 2025 campaign finance reports aren’t due until the end of January, which will detail spending between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 while also wrapping up the contribution and spending totals for the previous year. 
Reports that are available show that each of the three major players on the Democratic side of the race are in a tight race money wise, with Stevens having the advantage, but mostly due to campaign committee transfers she infused into her Senate bid from her congressional committee.
What’s more interesting, however, is where that money is coming from and who’s giving it.
Stevens flush with larger donor cash, some from large corporations
Stevens raised $4.72 million between April and October 2025, with $3.11 million coming from direct individual, organization and PAC contributions. The transfer from her congressional committee totaled $1.53 million.
Federal Election Commission reports show that Stevens also received $6,000 from the Blue Michigan PAC, which is supporting her campaign. Bridge Michigan reported that the group has also spent significant money on text message support for Stevens.
She spent $2.6 million up until Oct. 1, and ended the quarter with $2.6 million cash on hand, putting her in a strong spot as the candidates move into the heart of primary season.

Part of that had to do with her larger dollar donations from wealthy individuals. FEC data shows that the largest share of Stevens’ fundraising haul came from donations of $2,000 or more ($1.79 million) and donations of $1,000 to $1,999 ($751,316).
Public FEC reports also show that Stevens has amassed tens of thousands of dollars from multiple large corporations, including:

Amazon and Blue Origin PAC, owned by Amazon chief Jeff Bezos (a combined $39,000);
Google’s NetPAC ($11,500);
FedEx PAC ($23,000);
Delta Airlines PAC ($35,000);
the Boeing Company PAC ($13,500);
Norfolk Southern Corporation’s Good Government Fund ($1,000);
Walmart’s PAC For Good Government ($24,000);
DoorDash’s DashPAC ($5,900);
The McDonald’s Corporation PAC ($3,000);
Charter/Spectrum’s PAC ($18,000); and
Nucor Corporation PAC ($15,000)

Each of the companies have a history of reportedly questionable labor practices and union-busting activity.
Stevens has positioned herself as a strong supporter of unions throughout her career in Congress, introducing labor-focused legislation in the House, and has racked up various endorsements from unions like the  Teamsters Local 243, UNITE Here Local 24, Pipefitters, Steamfitters, Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Service Local Union 636, and IronWorkers Local 25.
Rogers raised less than his rivals in the bulk of 2025, but with billionaire support
Not to be outdone, Rogers raised $3.41 million, but only $1.87 million of that came from direct contributions. Bridge Michigan also reported that some of his fundraising haul came from the “Team Rogers” joint fundraising committee.

Rogers’ total fundraising haul was also aided by a nearly $1.5 million transfer from other committees, including Team Rogers.
Rogers spent $966,938 in the first two quarters of 2025, and owes nearly $6,000 in debt owed to his campaign.
That leaves Rogers with $2.7 million cash on hand.
Rogers is also sitting on $5 million donated to the Great Lakes Conservative Fund super-PAC supporting his bid from Tim Dunn, a Texas oil billionaire with deep ties to the Christian Nationalist movement and a rising presence in the national GOP scene.

The Gander also reported that Team Rogers accepted a $12,000 contribution from John W. Childs, a billionaire megadonor who was charged in 2019 with soliciting prostitution in a Florida massage parlor sting.
Rogers’ only rival for the GOP nomination is former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Bernadette Smith, who entered the race in late November, too late for mandatory fundraising reports.   
McMorrow and El-Sayed trailing, but not far behind
McMorrow, who announced her candidacy in March 2025, raised $3.85 million through October, amassing a greater share of dollars than Stevens did in total direct contributions at $3.82 million. McMorrow also had zero transfers from previous campaign committees.
She did, however, spend $2.4 million. That leaves McMorrow with $1.45 million cash on hand, but with zero debt owed to her campaign.
Unlike Stevens, McMorrow’s largest share of contributions came from people giving $200 or less ($2.08 million), but McMorrow’s second largest share of donations came from the $2,000 or more category ($899,772).

El-Sayed has been trailing his Democratic primary rivals in fundraising, but not by much.
He raised $3.57 million up until October with $3.56 million coming from direct contributions, still more than Stevens but not as much as McMorrow. El-Sayed spent $1.72 million up until October, the least of the three candidates.
Like Stevens, El-Sayed’s largest donation category came from those giving $2,000 or more ($1.6 million), but his second largest portion of his overall contributions came from the $200 and under club ($961,749).

Becky Currie will try again in the coming legislative session to push through Mississippi prison health care reforms. 
A similar effort by the Republican chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee fizzled and died in in last year’s session.   
In an interview outlining her plans, Currie said she will introduce legislation based on findings gleaned from numerous tours of Mississippi’s prisons as well as instances of alleged denial of medical care documented by Mississippi Today. 
The findings have come to light as the state continues to direct hundreds of millions a year to a private medical contractor, VitalCore Health Strategies. 
“We’ve got to give patients – I call them patients because when you’re sick, you’re a patient no matter where you are – we’ve got to give them the care that the taxpayers have already paid for,” Currie said. 

Mississippi Today’s “Behind Bars, Beyond Care” series has documented alleged routine denial of health care in Mississippi prisons: potentially thousands of people living with hepatitis C going without treatment, an untreated broken arm that resulted in amputation and delayed cancer screenings one woman said led to a terminal diagnosis. One ex-corrections official said people are experiencing widespread medical neglect in Mississippi’s prisons, and revealed internal communications between department officials lamenting the quality of care provided by VitalCore.
During the 2025 legislative session, Currie took to the floor of the Mississippi House and presented a wide-ranging list of examples that she said showed inadequate medical care in state prisons. In some cases the lack of care resulted in unnecessary suffering and death, she said.
Many of the issues have been allowed to persist because the state Department of Corrections is policing its own provision of health care at prisons, Currie said. 
Currie last year drafted a bill that introduced numerous reforms, including giving authority to the Mississippi Department of Health to review prison health care and make policy changes. 
Other central tenets of the bill included ensuring that inmates have access to 24/7 medical care, dispensing medication in a way that ensures inmates who need it actually receive it, requiring prisons to provide communal electronic kiosks for prisoners to request medical appointments and waiving fees for a wide range of medical services. 
Long considered one of the most conservative members of the Mississippi House, Currie secured support from the entire House, winning over everyone from tough-on-crime Republicans to criminal justice reform-minded Democrats. The bill passed 118-0 in the House. It was amended and whittled down before passing the Senate, but ultimately died in late negotiations between the chambers.
Currie believes the bill contained too many provisions, drawing opposition from the office of Gov. Tate Reeves and some of his Senate allies. Currie said Reeves’s office wanted to hire a private firm to conduct a review of prison health care instead of the Department of Health, a debate that loomed over the bill as House and Senate negotiators failed to agree on a final version in the closing days of the 2025 session.
To avoid a similar impasse this year, Currie will introduce many of the same measures, but in separate bills.
“I had it kind of like the Big, Beautiful Bill,” Currie said. “I had the big health care bill for MDOC, which was a failure on my part, because they were able just to say, ‘Oh no, we don’t want all of that this year.’ I’ll come at it a little differently (this year) and do it piece by piece.” 
One key policy fix Currie plans to reintroduce this year is revamping the process by which inmates request medical attention at many prisons. Prisoners often still need to rely on guards to bring them to an infirmary. This arrangement gives guards, who are not medical professionals, the power to determine whether a prisoner receives immediate care.
“We’re still at the part where an inmate has to tell a guard that I need to see a doctor, and he tells them to sit down and shut up, and they never get to see a doctor,” Currie said.
In October, Mississippi Today reported on the case of Christopher Boose, a 38-year-old Mississippi man who fell off his bunk at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility and broke his arm. He was allegedly denied treatment by guards for a week and developed sepsis. Boose, who was serving a one-year sentence for a Drug Court infraction, had his arm amputated. He has filed a federal lawsuit seeking $5 million in damages. 
To prevent similar episodes from happening in the future, Currie plans to push for new requirements to document prisoner requests for medical attention.
“The problem is we keep zero records, and there’s no accountability,” Currie said. “Like the article you did. It’s like oh, well, he lost his arm, I’m so sorry he didn’t get seen. We had to cut his arm off.’ I mean, it’s just, that kind of thing happens so often.”
Another prison health care issue Currie plans to tackle again is the spread of hepatitis C. Documents and private conversations reported by Mississippi Today show the problem appears to be widespread in state prisons.

A major scientific advance in the early 2010s – direct-acting antiviral drugs – transformed treatment regimens for hepatitis C, offering high cure rates, shorter treatment durations and fewer side effects. But the medication can cost the Mississippi system almost $30,000 for a six-week course. Many state prison systems have negotiated lower prices for the medication and are able to treat more patients.
Currie plans to keep pushing for the Department of Corrections and VitalCore to purchase hepatitis C medication through health care organizations enrolled in the federal 340B program, which requires pharmaceutical companies to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices. The program can offer discounts on drugs in the range of 20% to 50%. 
The Department of Health provided MDOC information about how to access 340B pricing, but as of October, the agency had not yet taken steps to obtain the reduced prices, a Health Department spokesperson told Mississippi Today. 
In an interview, Senate Corrections Chairman Juan Barnett, a Democrat from Heidelberg, said that he “vaguely remembered” Currie’s bill and supported some of its key provisions, but wanted to center efforts in his committee around reducing Mississippi’s prison population to free up more money for health care services. 
Barnett said he wasn’t completely satisfied with the performance of VitalCore, the private medical contractor that has raked in hundreds of millions of dollars to provide health care in prisons. 
“My thinking of trying to handle most of that cost is to reduce the prison population by passing legislation that will allow people with certain crimes to be able to be released,” Barnett said. “When you get the population down, then you have more money at your disposal to handle medical issues.”
Mississippi has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world — 661 people per 100,000. About 19,500 people are currently incarcerated in state prisons. 
Currie was initially surprised when House Speaker Jason White made her chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee. But amid a growing chorus of complaints about the provision of health care in Mississippi’s prisons, White told Currie, a former nurse, that she would have free rein to clean up the system. 
“Becky, go get em,” Currie recalls White telling her. 
So she crisscrossed the state, traveling to prisons and speaking with inmates about the issues they faced when trying to receive medical care. She encountered people with jaundice from untreated hepatitis C and women with cancerous lumps growing out of their breasts. 
Despite evidence that prisoners in a state with such a high incarceration rate aren’t receiving proper medical attention, Currie said, she has waged a lonely push for reform.
“It’s just me,” Currie said. “And it’s not that the proof’s not there.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/17162611/MT-Prison-Health-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2026-01-05 07:11:40.842920

Missouri GOP senator slams party leaders for forcing vote on bills without allowing debate

But before that, Democrats intend to make state Senate Republicans pay for invoking the rule to shut off debate — known as the previous question — for the first time since 2020.
With fewer than one-third of the seats in each chamber, the filibuster in the state Senate is practically the only means for the minority party to stall or kill legislation. That is why Democrats are determined to extract a price for using the previous question, but they aren’t saying how that will play out in the annual legislative session that starts Wednesday.
“As far as what that session looks like, everyone will have to wait and see,” Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat, told The Independent last month.  
The only affirmative duty of the General Assembly each year is to pass a state budget. But with a dwindling surplus, revenues in decline, and Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe pushing for elimination of the state income tax, the prospects for easy agreement look murky.
The list of other items awaiting action include issues that generate bipartisan support, such as addressing the growing wait list of people being held in jails who need court-ordered mental health treatments; legislation intended to improve maternal health; and personal agendas of departing lawmakers, including term-limited Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin’s bill to shut down solar power development and desire to regulate pharmacy benefit managers.
There are 10 seats in the state Senate certain to change hands, and all have attracted candidates currently in the Missouri House. Legislators looking to move up — including Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Republican running for the state Senate — will want to take election year achievements home to voters.
“You never know about the Senate, but the House is going to do business as usual, and we’ll just see how things play out in the Senate,” Patterson said in an interview with The Independent.

 Senate dysfunction

When Senate Republican leaders used the previous question rule at the end of last year’s session, it was the first time the motion to shut off debate was invoked during a regular session since 2017.
After the votes passing bills to undo voter-approved paid leave for workers and putting repeal of the 2024 abortion rights amendment on this year’s ballot, Democrats vowed there would be a price to pay in 2026.
“What we’re doing today is a failure of the Senate,” state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Democrat from Columbia said on the final day of the 2025 session. “And when there’s a failure in the Senate, there needs to be a response, and that response can’t last forever, but that response has to happen, and it has to be painful, and has to make us all understand that when the Senate doesn’t function as a body, we all lose.”
The offense, in Democratic eyes, was repeated during the September special session on redistricting, and aggravated by a rules change that sidestepped every opportunity Democrats could use to stall proceedings.
Democrats have to maintain their stall long enough to show that their views must be respected and that the state Senate is designed to be a less partisan body than the House, said state Sen. Tracy McCreery, a Democrat from Olivette.
“One of the challenges with working with some of the newer senators is that they brought the House mentality with them, and they don’t have respect for the institution of the Senate,” McCreery said. “In the Senate we have thoughtful, deliberative conversations, and we don’t just ram things through and not allow for debate.”
O’Laughlin, asked by text about the opening-day atmosphere she expects as she begins her last session as Senate leader, replied only with a head-exploding emoji.

 Budget and taxes

The gap between estimated state general revenue and appropriations in this year’s budget is $2.6 billion. Part of the difference, for state cash flow needs, is artificial because it is new spending on multi-year construction projects or money set aside for unfilled jobs in state government.
The rest must come from the state’s accumulated surplus, which has been diminishing and could be depleted within two fiscal years.
Kehoe has warned his budget proposal on Jan. 13 will be written to bring spending into balance with current revenue. That task will be complicated by the need to replace up to $1.2 billion in spending from non-general revenue funds with general tax revenue. 
“There are only painful budget bills that have money to cut from,” said state Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Democrat from Springfield. “And typically in our state, when we have to face budget cuts, we see that in K-12 education, higher education and (appropriation bills) that include things like social services and the social safety net.”
Kehoe’s also expected on Jan. 13 to outline his plan for weaning state government off the income tax. With the tax representing 65% of last year’s $13.4 billion in revenue, the question will be where to find replacement money.
Republican members will be anxious to hear the details.
“We’ll have to see what that proposal will be and what revenue replacements or what revenue sources will be created from those changes,” said state Rep. Jeff Vernetti, a Republican from Camdenton.
Local taxes will also be a major question. State Rep. Tim Taylor, a Bunceton Republican, led a House committee that spent the summer studying property taxes. There are a number of Republicans who want to replace the property tax system with sales taxes.
That could work in some areas but wouldn’t generate enough revenue for rural areas, Taylor said in a recent interview. And for areas that could generate the revenue, the tax rate could be prohibitive.
The state imposes a 4.225% sales tax but local option taxes mean the rate paid at retail in most locations is much higher. And the sales tax is one place to go for replacement revenue for the income tax.
That is unlikely to be popular with voters, Taylor said.
“The thought of increasing sales tax again is really going to put that to pushing 10 cents on $1 or something, and that’s pretty substantial,” Taylor said.
Local governments will be watching both debates closely, said Steve Hobbs, executive director of the Missouri Association of Counties.
“First and foremost this needs to be fair to the citizens of Missouri,” he said.
Property tax is an immensely complex issue to tackle, Hobbs said. One reason, he noted, is that state school aid is tied to local tax effort.
The Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force, appointed by Kehoe, is halfway through its study of school funding. Changes to how local taxes are imposed would change the formula calculations.
And support for education depends on reliable revenue from state taxes, which are about to be overhauled, Hobbs noted.
“You have two legs of your education funding stool you are talking about putting under construction,” Hobbs said. “That is a big lift.”

 O’Laughlin’s agenda

In early December, O’Laughlin wrote on social media about a frustrating experience she had attempting to obtain a prescription while in Jefferson City. Most of the time, she wrote, she gets her medications from a local pharmacy in Clarence, but was frustrated by mixups and miscommunications she blamed on pharmacy benefit managers.
“What is the result of this wondrous cost saving set up? Absolutely nothing good for the customers,” O’Laughlin wrote.
Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, are the mechanisms used by insurance companies to control prescription costs for their plans. Techniques include preferential contracts for particular pharmacy companies, with higher reimbursements or dispensing fees for high-volume chain stores and online providers.
“The rural areas are hardest hit because their pharmacist is also their healthcare advocate, often knowing the patients and literally their entire medical history,” O’Laughlin wrote in response to a question from The Independent.
O’Laughlin endorsed legislation filed by state Sen. Travis Fitzwater, a Republican from Holts Summit, to end preferential clauses in PBM contracts.
Similar legislation last year drew a coalition of opponents that, along with insurance companies, included the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Missouri AFL-CIO. 
The opposition will be daunting, said Abe Funk, owner of John’s Pharmacy in southeast Missouri. Funk’s business operates in six locations, including two in communities with fewer than 1,000 people.
Funk is a member of the Missouri Pharmacy Business Council, which lobbies for independent pharmacies. He’s been calling legislators in his area and will personally visit the Capitol to push for the bill.
To overcome opposition, this year’s bill will focus on revealing the details of how PBMs pay claims. That’s helped change some minds, he said.
“They like the idea of transparency,” Funk said. “They like the idea of actually being able to see what their claims are, their payments. And so we anticipate a different climate this session than we have in the past.”
O’Laughlin’s long-standing opposition to renewable energy development is being ramped up by a 5,000-acre solar power project in Henry County in western Missouri. The project was developed over several years but only revealed publicly at the start of 2024. 
In December 2024, after two incumbent commissioners were defeated for reelection, the Henry County Commission approved an incentive package for the solar project that included $650 million in public-sponsored financing.
A lawsuit invoking a rarely used law requiring the courts to investigate public contracts is heading to trial in October. O’Laughlin has filed a bill for a moratorium on new solar project construction, including stopping work on projects underway but not finished, through Dec. 31, 2027.
The solar projects use valuable farmland, seek tax abatements and other preferential treatment and add little to local economies, O’Laughlin wrote in an email to The Independent.
“I honestly see this as tearing a giant hole in the fabric of our communities socially, fiscally, environmentally,” O’Laughlin wrote to The Independent. “What is there to like about them?”
 Election year prospects

No Democrat has won a statewide election since 2018, and results from 2024 show how daunting it will be for Kirkwood Democrat Quentin Wilson, a state department director from 1998 to 2001, to deny incumbent Republican State Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick a second term.
The auditor’s office is the only statewide race on the ballot. Last year, despite spending $20 million, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Lucas Kunce received just 41.8% of the vote, only two percentage points more than gubernatorial candidate Crystal Quade, who spent about $2 million.
But the difficult statewide race for Democrats doesn’t mean this year’s voting won’t give the party an opportunity to impose significant losses on Republicans. The same voters that gave GOP candidates landslide wins for statewide office handed them defeats on abortion rights, following up on prior liberal ballot measure wins on Medicaid expansion and marijuana legalization.
Republicans have put a measure reinstating the state’s near total abortion ban on the ballot, along with a proposal to change the way majorities are calculated for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative. And the redistricting plan intended to give the GOP an additional seat in the U.S. House faces a possible referendum vote. 
Controversial ballot measures can bring hundreds of thousands of Missourians out for an otherwise unexciting election. That occurred In 2018 and 2020, when a right to work referendum and Medicaid expansion, respectively, were on August primary ballots. In those years, nearly 300,000 more people voted in the Democratic primary than the average of other elections since 2000. 
Millions have already been spent on ballot measures for this year and the total for all will likely exceed $100 million by the time voters go to the polls.
But even a big surge of Democratic voters would only dent, not break, the GOP majority, said Terry Smith, political science professor at Columbia College.
Only 21 of 163 Missouri House seats were decided by 10 percentage points or less in 2024, and early financial reports indicate that only two of the 17 state Senate seats on the ballot appear to be truly competitive in November.
The best result for Democrats, Smith said, would be to break the two-thirds supermajority Republicans enjoy in each chamber. 
After the 2024 election, Republicans held 111 seats in the House and 24 of 34 seats in the Senate.
“Do Republicans  have anything to worry about? I don’t think so,” Smith said in an interview last week with The Independent.
In deeply Republican districts, even if the ballot measures draw a larger Democratic vote, it won’t be enough to change the outcome, Smith said.
“If you go from a district that is 75-25 to 60-40,” he said, “you pick up 15 points and you still lose by a landslide.”

(Nataba/iStock Images)We face a new year with the likelihood that the same divisive and hate-filled words and actions will intrude and dominate much of the public square. Some political leaders observing and adopting behavior from the lesser-civilized among us will prove useful.
Little else seems to be working.
We have all heard the saying, “They fight like cats and dogs.” But, all cats and dogs do not fight each other. Many, if not most, get along just fine.
Actually, our cat takes naps on our dog’s face. However, that has not always been the case. One of our previous dogs found great pleasure in chasing and terrorizing one of our cats. So clearly, it all depends.
It depends on what?
One could speculate that maybe our current dog and cat get along because they grew up together and shared their kitty and puppy days. That is partly the case. But, the dog has also been accepting older adopted cats that were complete strangers with different temperaments. There is no fighting, no chasing. They all get along.
Lesson one: Cats and dogs couldn’t naturally look or behave more differently, and yet whether they grew up together or met as strangers, they still respect each other, live peaceably under the same roof, and often do things together.
There are lessons that members of the Missouri General Assembly can take from that as they convene their 2026 legislative session this week. Members of Congress can do the same.
Respect and getting along are not just common among cats and dogs, but also among other lowly creatures in the animal kingdom.
We have a neighbor who loves animals, especially horses. On any given day when we pass by her farmhouse, it is not uncommon to see horses (large and miniature), donkeys, mules, sheep, goats, even peacocks, turkeys, and chickens of various breeds — all grazing and scratching alongside each other. 
We have yet to witness a fight or scuffle among any of them during nearly two decades we have been neighbors. While we know they might occur, it is not a common occurrence.
One could easily dismiss this example by saying, oh your neighbor operates a petting zoo, or she carefully picks docile animals. She does not. 
There is another likely explanation. She loves animals. She shows it in her actions, her tone, her body language and how she cares for and communicates with them. The animals see and feel her love, and they behave toward her and each other accordingly. 
Lesson two: These animals are different in every way imaginable — unlike us humans who are 99.99% the same — yet they co-exist, they get along. There are many reasons why they do. We can imagine.
Lesson three: First and foremost, our neighbor — the leader in this case — creates the space, sets the tone with the way she treats and communicates with that very diverse animal population.
Do you suppose there are any hints, lessons our political leaders can glean and put into practice?
Examples abound.
Several miles down the road while riding in the countryside, I looked over at a pasture with cows, Shetland ponies, elks, alpacas, and zebras. I thought to myself, what is it that we humans do not get? Those animals don’t speak the same language, certainly do not look alike, and yet they all seem to get along for their common good.
This harmony, respect, and acceptance just described among farm animals likely exists among many animals in the forests and jungles, even in the sea. 
Of course, there are those that do not get along, that prey on each other, and that live in fear of each other. But there are lessons we can learn from them, too. 
It is all about discernment and choice. 
Many choices are available to us. Exposure. Learning. Understanding. Compromise. Acceptance. How we choose to appreciate, work together, and live with each other.
So why do we, supposedly the most civilized animals on the planet, find ourselves promoting, practicing, even wallowing in perpetual discord and divisiveness the aim of which is to do more harm than good. Or, if any good at all, only for the few.
If many of our political leaders do not have, do not like, or haven’t been around animals or taken the time to observe any, maybe this new year is a great time to start or become reacquainted.
Our state and nation cannot perform the greatest good for the greatest number of its citizens by continuing the disrespect and disregard for the rules and laws that promote decency and civility, and most importantly, how we regard each other as fellow human beings traveling this earth entitled to the same rights and privileges.
How have we, who have so much in common, lost our way when many in the animal kingdom have not?
Yes, we do not hold all the same beliefs about everything or have the same life experiences. We all do not have the same visions and goals, or how to accomplish them.
We can disagree, have robust discussions on any issue or problem. But, we need not take advantage and try to destroy each other during the process.
Many aspects of our state and national political environment are on a slippery slope, and goodwilled visionary leaders who are willing to work for our common good are hard to find. It’s time for many of them to look to members of the animal kingdom for guidance.
Even animals accept and appreciate coexistence and the mutual benefits a vibrant living environment can bring.
Why can’t many of our political leaders?",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AnimalandPoliticalLeaders2-Nataba-1024x675.jpg,,,2026-01-05 06:57:30.123852

State and federal officials are gearing up to stop the advance of a parasitic fly that is less than 70 miles from the United States border with Mexico.


Since Nov. 25, at least 10 new cases of incidents involving the New World screwworm fly have been confirmed within 400 miles of the border. The flies have been inching their way to the U.S. since they broke the biological barrier created by Panama’s narrow geography in 2022.

“There is a threat of it maybe getting into the southern United States, and then it would most likely end up in Missouri, too, at least maybe some isolated cases,” State Veterinarian Steve Strubberg said. “It’s conceivable that it could happen in the coming year or two.”


Deb Hudman, Missouri Department of Conservation health section chief, added that “transportation of infected animals is most likely how it would enter.”


Experts are hoping for a long winter and cold spring to help keep the flies from crossing the border.


“The cold weather is good,” Hudman said. “Anything as low as 48 degrees Fahrenheit stops the larvae and pupae development, and anything below 59 degrees significantly drops the activity of adult flies.”


Local and federal agencies are working to take advantage of the weather and keep New World screwworm flies out of the U.S. Last month the U.S. Department of Agriculture launched a website hoping to centralize information about the flesh-eating fly.


“The USDA remains focused on implementing our sweeping five-pronged plan to combat New World screwworm. As part of these critical efforts, USDA is working on both sides of the border to ensure a comprehensive response,” said Lyndsay Cole, a USDA spokesperson, in an email.



That five-pronged plan includes a total of $29.5 million in investments to renovate an existing fruit fly production facility in Metapa, Mexico, and to build a sterile insect dispersal facility at Moore Air Base in south Texas. The Mexico facility is expected to open as early as next summer. Planning is also underway to build a new production facility at Moore Air Base, according to the USDA website.


“Unfortunately there won’t be enough of those sterile flies available to us for a few years. It takes a long time to ramp up those production facilities, so we are hoping it stays in Mexico,” Strubberg said.
According to the plan, sterile screwworm flies are among the primary tools the government can use to fight the New World screwworm, but only one plant exists in Panama; it produces 100 million flies a week. A separate plant in Mexico that produced 500 million flies a week was shut down in 2012 for economic reasons.
The goal of producing sterile flies is to have them mate with female flies, which usually mate only once in their lifespan. Using this method, over time the population is reduced back down to zero. The sterile insect technique is what allowed the U.S. to eradicate the flies in the 1960s.


The U.S. government has worked closely with Panama since the now-broken biological barrier was formed.
 A costly wipeout



Screwworm was eradicated in the U.S. in 1966 at the cost of around $750 million. This time around, the USDA’s Economic Research Service says it could cost the Texas economy alone $1.8 billion over the next year if the fly gets into the United States.


Losses of $730 million are predicted to fall onto cattle producers. Nine of the last 10 confirmed cases of screwworm within 400 miles of the U.S. have come from bovines, according to data collected by the USDA.


“If it would come in, we would have such a great expense of eliminating it,” Strubberg said. “There are just so many different areas of added expense for individual producers.”


The impacts it would have on consumers are harder to predict, Strubberg said. But potential spikes from a dip in supply and increased expenses from dealing with screwworm could add to shelf costs.


To help the government contact producers in a potential infested zone, Strubberg urges people to register their premises through the Missouri Department of Agriculture if they have animals. The premises registration form can be found here.
 Cows and wildlife: easy targets




The flies can infest all living warm-blooded animals. This includes humans, pets, livestock and wild animals. Some signs to look out for in infected animals include an open wound or navel that looks infected, decreased activity and animals isolating themselves.


“The larvae are basically maggots,” Strubberg said. “They are much more aggressive than the normal maggots of the common flies we have around Missouri right now, and so they will cause a lot more damage.”


If an animal gets infected, there are a few treatment options. If treated, animals can make full recoveries, but untreated it is “very devastating,” Strubberg said.


“If you catch it early enough and treat it, you would do some surgical procedures to remove the larvae and hopefully treat them so they don’t mature,” Strubberg said. “There are systemic treatments of infested animals also; some of the larvae are so deep that you can’t remove them all surgically.”


The FDA conditionally approved a new topical solution for the prevention and treatment of New World screwworm in cattle over 2 months old, Exzolt Cattle-CA1. The drug is in the same family as Bravecto, an oral drug used for flea and tick prevention in dogs and cats.


“Exzolt Cattle-CA1 is eligible for conditional approval because it is intended to prevent and treat serious or life-threatening diseases in cattle, it addresses unmet animal health needs, and demonstrating effectiveness of the drug requires complex or particularly difficult studies,” the Food and Drug Administration said in a news release.


“Pets are also an easy way for screwworm to be transported,” Strubberg said. “We are working with every entity we can to try and get pet owners and all animal owners aware.”


He says to monitor pets to make sure they don’t have any open wounds and are feeling well. Strubberg added it’s important to be especially vigilant if you recently traveled to a place with an active screwworm population like Central and South America.


“If anyone is purchasing pets from outside the state, you definitely want the veterinarian to take a good look at it,” Hudman said.


Missouri’s wild animal populations would be at risk as well.


“Deer would be something to keep an eye on because they have lots of wounds from running, vehicle strikes and fences,” Hudman said. “It could certainly be present in raccoons, opossums, coyotes and rabbits. Really any warm-blooded species with an open wound.”


Wild populations would be next to impossible to contain and treat because they aren’t behind a fence or in a barn, Hudman said.


“You would have to trap all of them, and then you would have to treat them, then the first treatment might not take,” she said. “I just don’t see how that would be very viable.”


The only wild populations that might be possible to protect are ones with small, localized populations. Hudman pointed to Missouri’s elk population as an example.


The Missouri Department of Conservation is working closely with the Missouri Department of Agriculture and the USDA to develop a plan to combat the potential arrival of screwworm. A plan is currently not finalized.


“We’re setting up and making sure there are microscopes all around the state with people who can identify the larvae so we can have a local or regional way to approach it,” Hudman said.
 Screwworm fly impostor



Another challenge Missouri faces in identifying potential screwworm infestations is a different species of blowfly that looks like the screwworm fly. That species of blowfly feeds off dead tissue instead of living tissue.


“It’s going to be very tricky for the general public to tell the difference between the two, and the one that feeds off of dead tissue is very prevalent,” Hudman said.


While the New World screwworm fly hasn’t been detected in the U.S., Hudman advises caution toward the potential presence of the fly in the coming years.

A bipartisan bill in the state Legislature aims to address those problems. | Photo by Caspar Benson/Getty ImagesOn Dec. 3, a committee of Wisconsin lawmakers heard from Gabriel Lugo about his time in prison before his conviction was overturned. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Lugo testified through a statement read by attorney Rex Anderegg in a hearing of the Assembly Committee on State Affairs. He said he experienced constant lockdowns that severely restricted his movement and some correctional officers treating him as less than human. 
Lugo, 36, was convicted of first-degree reckless homicide in 2009 and spent the majority of his incarceration in Waupun Correctional Institution, the state’s oldest prison, which has received scrutiny for prison deaths and living conditions. After Lugo’s conviction was overturned, he was released from jail in June 2023.
According to Christopher Lau of the Wisconsin Innocence Project, the project has helped exonerate more than 30 people. Clients leave prison with medical ailments and emotional trauma, without familial support, employment, savings, and often, with nowhere to call home, his testimony stated. Many struggle to re-enter society. 
Exonerees often have to wait months to get on the agenda for the claims board’s meetings, Lau stated. If they qualify, the law doesn’t provide enough to ensure stable housing, he said, “to say nothing of the costs of social services like counseling, vocational assistance and access to health insurance.” 
The Wisconsin Claims Board can award up to $25,000 in compensation, at a rate not greater than $5,000 per year for the imprisonment, and has also awarded attorney fees. It can recommend that the state Legislature issue additional compensation. 
In February 2016, the Assembly unanimously approved a bill that aimed to increase state support for wrongly convicted people, including enabling the claims board to issue higher payouts. It did not become law. 
AB 583, a bill currently in the Legislature, also aims to provide more aid more quickly to wrongly convicted people. Under the bill, a wrongly convicted person would receive compensation at a yearly rate of $50,000, prorated daily, for the imprisonment; the total would not exceed $1 million. The claims board would adjust the rate yearly to account for the cost of living, and it would be able to award compensation in an annuity payable over time. 
The bill addresses when people who received compensation for wrongful imprisonment in the past can petition for more under the new law, potentially allowing some to receive more compensation. 
The bill lays out when wrongly convicted people could have health care coverage under plans offered by the Group Insurance Board to state employees. 
Under the bill, if a person is released from imprisonment on the basis of a claim of innocence, they could petition for a court order directing the Department of Corrections to create a transition-to-release plan. They could also petition for a financial assistance award of up to 133% of the federal poverty level for up to 14 months, or while compensation proceedings are pending, whichever is shorter. 
State legislators who introduced the bill included Republican and Democratic lawmakers. Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine), chair of the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety, submitted testimony in support of the bill. 
The bill bars some people from filing a petition with the claims board for compensation for wrongful imprisonment, such as a person who is convicted of a violent crime after being released. 
Records-sealing language
Also under the bill, a person released from imprisonment on the basis of a claim of innocence could petition the court for the sealing of all records related to the case. For Lugo, it took about two years to get a response from job applications because his case was still visible online, his statement said. 
A similar provision in the bill that the Assembly passed in 2016 drew pushback from the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, which argued that it would “dramatically compromise the ability of media and the public to examine what went wrong in cases in which things are known to have gone terribly wrong.”
On Dec. 22, the Wisconsin Examiner reached out to the office of Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek), one of the lawmakers who introduced the bill, about the provision and the council’s concern in 2016. 
“Thank you for bringing this information to our attention as we were not aware of this when we introduced the bill this session,” Rodriguez said in an emailed comment. “The organization has not reached out to us with any concerns at this time.”
Lawsuits
Wrongly convicted people may also attempt to obtain a monetary award through lawsuits. The bill addresses the possibility of a person receiving a settlement, judgement or award for damages in a federal or state action related to their wrongful imprisonment. 
Under one of these parts of the bill, if the person obtains a settlement before the claims board awards them compensation, the claims board would subtract the amount from the board’s compensation. 
Changing the process
Under current law, the claims board is responsible for finding whether the evidence of the person’s innocence is “clear and convincing.” 
The claims board members come from the Department of Justice, the Department of Administration, the Office of the Governor, the Wisconsin Senate and the Wisconsin Assembly. The Senate and Assembly members are Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) and Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Markesan).
Under the bill, when the claims board receives a petition for compensation for an innocent convict, it would be referred to the Division of Hearings and Appeals in the Department of Administration. The division would find whether the evidence is clear and convincing that the petitioner was innocent of the crime they were imprisoned for. 
If the evidence is clear and convincing for innocence, the division would transmit its findings to the claims board, which would decide what amount of compensation would be equitable. 
Individual bills
In a decision dated Jan. 30 of this year, the claims board awarded $25,000 to Gabriel Lugo, plus approximately $77,000 in attorney fees, and recommended that the Legislature award him an additional $750,000.
According to Rodriguez, the Legislature has only passed individual appropriation bills awarding additional compensation three times. 
Rodriguez’s testimony stated that it’s estimated that around 72 people have been exonerated in Wisconsin since 1990, and that seven received recommendations for compensation above the cap. She stated in a press release that “the Legislature should not have to play judge and jury again” when there is already a process at the claims board. 
“Without these reforms, exonerees would continue to need individual appropriation bills to receive an adequate amount of compensation,”  Rodriguez stated in a press release. “These bills have rarely been acted upon, and even more rarely are signed into law.”
The board has also recommended that the Legislature issue additional compensation for Robert and David Bintz, who were released from prison in the fall of last year.

(Photo by Hal Brown/New Jersey Monitor)In the nearly four years since Matt Platkin became New Jersey’s 62nd attorney general, his critics have multiplied.
Republicans tried to impeach him. Democrats accused him of weaponizing his office to attack their allies. State police unions sued him. Someone even sent voters mailers attacking him, a move usually reserved for political candidates in bare-knuckle election contests. (Platkin ran for public office just once — when he became the first sixth grader at his middle school elected to student government.)
Platkin regards it all as a measure of his success.
“I haven’t shied away from tough decisions and tough cases,” he said. “If you do this job for four years and you haven’t pissed anybody off, then you really haven’t done the job the right way.”
With just weeks left before Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill takes office and installs a new attorney general, Platkin shared his proudest moments, biggest frustrations, future plans, and more in a wide-ranging interview with the New Jersey Monitor.
 On corruption and criticism
Gov. Phil Murphy named Platkin, a Democrat and his former chief counsel, attorney general in February 2022.
As head of the state Department of Law and Public Safety, Platkin leads an office of about 8,000 people and oversees police, criminal and civil investigations and prosecutions statewide, and more.
His corruption crackdowns typically grab the most attention, both because he’s targeted some of the state’s most powerful people, such as South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, and because those cases don’t always hold up in court. State judges tossed Platkin’s criminal indictments of Norcross and more than a dozen correctional officers involved in a brutality scandal at the women’s prison, among others.
Those fumbles have fueled calls for an outside review of Platkin’s public corruption unit and prompted state legislators from both parties to try to take the state police from his control and subject his staff to wiretaps.
Platkin called the criticism “baseless personal attacks” rooted in his mission to hold people accountable, regardless of political party or position, from drug traffickers up to President Donald Trump.
“These are people with positions of power who have bully pulpits. I don’t hear them saying it’s political prosecutions when we take down 30-plus-defendant mafia rings or drug cartels or gangs engaged in gun violence. But when you prosecute a politician, people who don’t like it want to accuse you of having a political agenda,” Platkin said. “That’s not new, by the way, but I do think the severity of the attacks has increased, and they’re completely unfounded.”
A Norcross spokesman declined to comment for this story. When a state Superior Court judge dismissed the charges against Norcross last year, Norcross attorney Michael Critchley said Platkin “trashed” the reputation of the Attorney General’s Office with the “sham” indictment. Platkin’s office is appealing.

 A national ‘embarrassment’
One of Platkin’s more public clashes with his critics came earlier this month, when a Senate panel unanimously passed a bill that would have weakened the state comptroller’s office, which also investigates public corruption.
That hearing was helmed by Sen. James Beach (D-Camden), a close Norcross ally and architect of the plan to remove state police from the Attorney General’s Office. Beach clashed with Platkin, U.S. Sen. Andy Kim, and acting Comptroller Kevin Walsh when they testified against the bill, telling Platkin, “You, sir, have drug down the department!”
Platkin called the hearing an “embarrassment” and followed it up with an unusual written rebuke to Beach, accusing him of violating the free speech rights of the bill’s critics by limiting the time they could testify about the measure while allowing some of the bill’s supporters to speak at length about it.
Platkin told the New Jersey Monitor that the government cannot discriminate against people because it doesn’t like their speech.
“Once you open the door up to give people a platform to speak, you have to give everyone a fair shot to speak,” he said. “He stacked the deck. He was dismissive, he was arrogant, he was aggressive, he was insulting — to a United States senator, just as he was to ordinary residents of our state. And what message does that send to people of New Jersey and across the country, who have the lowest level of faith in their government institutions that they’ve had since the Civil War?”
Beach declined to comment through a spokesman. Sen. Nicholas Scutari, who sponsored the bill, later withdrew it and said he won’t meddle again with the comptroller’s powers.
 Taking on his boss
Platkin also tangled with Murphy after first lady Tammy Murphy launched a bid for the U.S. Senate seat when its former occupant, Bob Menendez, was indicted and later convicted in a global bribery scheme and resigned in disgrace.
Kim was the first to announce he wanted the seat. As the state’s party leaders lined up to endorse Tammy Murphy, Kim sued to challenge the county line, which gave party leaders’ preferred candidates better placement on the ballot. During the court fight, Platkin offered his unsolicited opinion that the county line must go. Tammy Murphy later dropped out of the race.
Did this cause problems with Gov. Murphy?
“I think he’s been a tremendous governor, and I’ve been proud to serve him directly and him and his administration for almost the entirety of his time in office. He’s always been professional with me, and I’ve genuinely enjoyed the partnership,” Platkin said. “Obviously, that was a personally difficult decision, but one that you could look at now …  was the right legal outcome.”
Murphy told the New Jersey Monitor he has no hard feelings.
“It’s history. Matt’s done a hell of a job, in particular, I have to say, fighting the Trump administration, where he’s led with great force and stature,” Murphy said.
Platkin has joined or led at least 43 federal lawsuits against the Trump administration.

 Proudest accomplishments?
Platkin cited a number of actions as his proudest moments as attorney general, including his fights against Trump’s policies, his work against gun violence, and lawsuits against tech giants like Meta, TikTok, and Discord, whose platforms he alleges have fueled social media addiction among youth.
A gun violence reduction advocate since high school, he said his role as attorney general gave him the power to make change on the issue — and his two young children gave him the drive.
“I grew up in the Columbine generation. I thought we would have solved this problem,” Platkin said. “My daughter had her first school shooting drill before she could walk. Weeks ago, I got an email that they played Elmo in the closet to keep 2-year-olds from being too loud during a school shooting drill. That’s not normal. And that’s not Second Amendment rights.”
Platkin has defended New Jersey’s strict gun laws against challenges by the gun lobby, expanded tracking of gun carry applications, taken steps to better investigate gun crimes, targeted gun retailers, supported community-based violence intervention work, and more. He said all this has helped cut gun violence in New Jersey to record lows since statewide tracking began in 2009.
“We know that it’s not 9.5 million people engaging in gun violence. It’s like 1,000 people. So when you think about it that way, it’s actually quite a solvable problem, or at least a problem that you can reduce. And we’ve tried to focus on those people that we know are habitually involved in violence,” he said.
 What’s next
Platkin wouldn’t say much about where he’ll go after Jen Davenport, Sherrill’s choice for attorney general, succeeds him. But it won’t be politics, he said.
“I can tell you for sure I’m not running for office,” he said. “I find it kind of funny that people can’t imagine that somebody might do something because they think it’s right, not because it furthers a political narrative.”
He vowed to remain active in many of the battles he waged as attorney general.
“I didn’t start caring about these things when I took office in 2022, and I’m not going to stop caring about them in 2026,” he said. “In some way, shape, or form, I’m going to stay involved in these fights.”
Assemblyman Antwan McClellan (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Assemblyman Antwan McClellan (R-Cape May), who last year pushed for Platkin’s impeachment, called his legacy “a failure.”
McClellan pointed to prosecutorial missteps that resulted in the collapse of high-profile cases; Platkin’s numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration; his office’s lengthy, unresolved investigations that leave state troopers and other targets in limbo; and his decision to supersede the Paterson Police Department over the objections of its chief and the city’s mayor. The latter sparked a court fight that went up to the state Supreme Court, which deemed the state takeover lawful.
“It’s all chasing headlines, as opposed to grinding down and really doing the work that needed to be done and what’s expected from the attorney general of the state,” McClellan said.

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Fifty-nine children died of caregiver abuse or neglect in 2024, according to an annual report from the Indiana Department of Child Services released Monday, just before the end of 2025.
Of those, 18 were due to abuse and 41 were due to neglect.
The total has stayed in a similar range in recent years — from a low of 50 in 2020 and a high of 61 in 2022. Last year’s number was 56.
DCS reviewed 276 child fatalities in 2024. The share of deaths attributed to caregiver maltreatment has hovered around 20% for at least the last several years.
The agency reviews all child deaths that involve allegations of abuse or neglect, and — for children under age three — all fatalities that are sudden or unexplained. Forty-two, or 71%, of the victims were under age 3.
Fifteen kids in the report were previously victims in a prior case of abuse or neglect substantiated by DCS.

Death by weapon, which includes body parts like closed fists, was the leading cause of death, listed in 20% of cases. Asphyxia, poisonings, drownings and unsafe sleep conditions were other top factors. DCS pulls causes of death from state death certificates.
Two cases involved toddlers shooting themselves with unsecured, loaded firearms — one in his mother’s purse and one by his father’s mattress. That is down from 10 similar cases recorded in 2023.
Parental alcohol and other drug use was prevalent, however.
Several young children died directly of acute cocaine, fentanyl or methamphetamine toxicity. But parents were repeatedly described as incapacitated by drug use in numerous cases with other primary causes of death, like a house fire, starvation or unsafe sleep conditions.
Some kids died after catching the common cold. Often, their parents didn’t seek medical attention despite noticing their children stopped eating, went pale, struggled to breathe and so on.
Other victims had chronic health conditions.
A 1-year-old boy, who’d previously been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and heart failure, died after going months without an overnight ventilation machine or medications prescribed to prevent fluid build-up in his lungs.
One 12-year-old girl with Type 1 diabetes died of diabetic ketoacidosis. Her blood sugar topped 600 on the day of her death. Investigators found a broken continuous glucose monitor and unused insulin pumps in the home, according to the report. The child’s medical records revealed the parents had a history of failing to manage her autoimmune disease even though they’d been through training more than 10 separate times.
Of the 78 alleged perpetrators deemed responsible for the fatalities, 63 — or 81% — were the children’s biological parents. Multiple perpetrators can be involved in one death.
The report cited a variety of caregiver stressors, like insufficient income, unemployment, substance abuse and a history of abuse — either as a victim themselves or as a perpetrator.
In 43 cases, or 73% of them, the children died at their own homes.

(Photo by Zoranm/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — A Tulsa lawmaker is pushing for a new law that would require public schools to begin conducting routine hearing tests for children in kindergarten through third grade in an effort to boost literacy rates.
But the plan has faced pushback from some state and national groups, who argue that while the hearing screenings would be beneficial, it’s critical that the state’s required guidelines adhere to best practice and be funded adequately so as not to harm local schools and businesses.
State Rep. Meloyde Blancett, D-Tulsa, said she filed House Bill 2188 last session after talking with pediatric audiologists in her district. She believes that undiagnosed hearing loss is likely preventing some students from succeeding academically.
“If you can’t learn to read by the third grade, then you can’t read to learn,” Blancett said. “It becomes a significant barrier to success in school.”
She’s pressing for Oklahoma to join the 70% of states that already require some type of hearing screenings for school-aged children.
While over 98% of infants are screened for hearing issues at birth, the testing cannot flag certain types of pediatric hearing loss, including late-onset or progressive, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, which represents over 200,000 audiologists, speech-language pathologists and scientists. 
Nationally, about 15% of children suffer from hearing loss when they enter school, according to the group. But failure to detect it impacts speech and language development and harms children’s academic, emotional and social outcomes, according to the organization.
Kim Richardson, a licensed hearing instrument specialist with more than 20 years of experience at Lucid Hearing in Edmond, said cost is a barrier that keeps many families from receiving early screenings and intervention.
Screenings cost from $250 to $350 if someone has to pay out of pocket, she said.
“Most insurance doesn’t cover hearing screenings, which is why people put them off,” Richardson said.
David Huff, Doctor of Hearing Care by Hugh, an Edmond-based business, said that hearing screenings are only effective if schools are properly trained in how to administer them.
“Screenings should happen, but schools must be equipped,” he said. “Without consistency across districts, the results become unreliable.”
How to properly conduct the screenings was a concern for five high-profile groups, including Hearts for Hearing, the Academy of Audiology, and the Oklahoma Speech-Language-Hearing Association. The groups opposed Blancett’s legislation during the 2025 legislative session.
While the three did not respond to requests for comment, Blancett provided a letter the groups sent lawmakers in February. They wrote that while they “unequivocally support the expansion of hearing screenings” using evidence-based screening models, they worried about the “significant, unintended negative consequences” of House Bill 2188.
Among those were a requirement to use a tablet-based program that the audiologists said is not consistent with “evidence-based methods recognized for childhood hearing screenings by nationally recognized clinic practice guidelines.” 
The groups also expressed concern about the financial burden to Oklahoma’s education system and immediate workforce supply challenges that would be required to accommodate increased testing and referrals. 
They also urged lawmakers to first study legislation passed in other states that already require such testing.
Blancett said it is unlikely that she’ll continue to pursue House Bill 2188 during the 2026 legislative session, which starts in February. But she said she’ll continue to press for student hearing screenings and will continue to work with stakeholders to develop best-practice legislation.
“There’s a critical need that’s not being met,” Blancett said. “My hope is that at some point, this gets across the line so we can give kids and teachers the resources they need.”

(Photo by Westend61/Getty Images)LINCOLN — With state government facing a $471 million budget shortfall, one state agency again seeks to use state lottery funds, through the Nebraska Environmental Trust, to help finance its operations.
The proposal was described by trust supporters as a new and probably unconstitutional “raid” of trust funds — state lottery proceeds that are granted out to environmental projects.
A state official, meanwhile, described the transfer as necessary to continue soil and water conservation projects and said it complies with a recently amended state law that expanded the allowable uses of the money.
The Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment (NDWEE), in a mid-budget funding request, seeks an $8 million transfer from the Trust, of which $6 million would be used for a soil and water conservation program and $2 million for salaries and administrative costs.
Board members of the Nebraska Environmental Trust made their annual grant awards in 2024. The grants were awarded early, in January instead of June, to allow organizations to begin work sooner in the year, officials said. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
Amanda Woita, a department spokeswoman, said the transfer to the Water Resources Cash Fund complies with the goal of the Trust funds — to conserve, enhance and restore the state’s environment, and that the Trust currently holds more than $70 million, so it can “easily” afford an $8 million withdrawal. The Trust typically distributes about $20 million in lottery-funded grants each year.
“Using these funds to protect the vital groundwater and surface water resources is a clear constitutional and common-sense use of the funds allocated to the Environmental Trust,” Woita said in an email response to questions.
But Kristal Stoner, the head of Audubon Great Plains, and Sandy Scofield, a former state senator who heads the Friends of the Environmental Trust, questioned the legality of the proposed transfer.
Stoner said using one-time Trust funds to help solve a state budget problem would “erode” the Trust and its purpose, which is to provide competitive grants to local and regional organizations seeking to enhance the state’s environment.
“I am deeply concerned,” she said in an email. “Continued diversions of funds will mean the end of the Trust.”
“Nebraska should continue to fund our legal responsibilities and basics of our government with general funds,” Stoner said, and not lottery proceeds.
Tight budget times
The proposal comes when the state is wrestling with closing a gap in the state budget and as supporters of the Trust worry about raids on the grant funds.


Explaining the Nebraska Environmental Trust
The Nebraska Environmental Trust was established when Nebraskans approved a state lottery in 1992. It receives 44.5% of the lottery proceeds — about $20 million a year in recent years.
Its stated mission is “to conserve, enhance and restore the natural environments of Nebraska.”
Grants are provided on a competitive basis, after a review and scoring by a committee of Trust Board members and then voted on by the entire 14-member board. The governor appoints nine board members. Five others are state agency heads, four of which are appointed to those posts by the governor.
Recent grant recipients include the Statewide Arboretum, various cities and towns from Omaha to Mullen, the Crane Trust, Ducks Unlimited, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, as well as the Audubon Society.


A year ago, the Legislature allocated $15 million in Trust funds, over two years, to soil and water conservation programs overseen by the Department of Natural Resources, an agency that recently was merged into the NDWEE.
State lawmakers, though, rejected a proposal by Gov. Jim Pillen to expand the use of Trust funds to include “outdoor recreation” and “healthy infrastructure.”
The separate Water Resources Cash Fund primarily finances projects by local Natural Resources Districts to enhance stream flows and groundwater recharge in areas of concern about water resources.
When it was created, the water program was financed using state tax dollars. But since 2011, Trust funds have been transferred in some years to supplement the state water cash fund’s annual grants, which totaled $3.7 million in the most recent year, according to an October report to the Legislature.
The NDWEE, in its budget request, said the $8 million in Trust funds would allow continuation of water resources programs in areas where water has been fully or overappropriated.
In recent years, the Trust, in a departure from past practices, has built up an excess of funds by not awarding all the proceeds it gets from the Nebraska Lottery. In 2023, for instance, it granted out only $11 million of the $20 million available. In 2024, $15 million was granted out of $26 million available.
This year, grant awards of about $18 million out of the $25 million available have been recommended by a Trust subcommittee, according to Holly Adams, the Trust’s executive director. The full Nebraska Environmental Trust Board meets Jan. 8 to consider approving those awards.
According to the Legislative Fiscal Office, the Trust holds about $73 million in assets, about $27 million of which will remain unobligated, once the proposed new grants are considered. Some of the Trust’s grants are multi-year, so funds for them are already assigned to grant out in future years.
Scofield, who was chief of staff under then-Gov. Ben Nelson when the Environmental Trust was created, said lottery funds were never intended to finance the administrative expenses of state agencies. She said the current budget “mess” has been caused by the state failing to provide enough tax revenue to finance state operations.
Some have blamed cuts in state income taxes passed by the Legislature in 2023 as too deep. The cuts are projected to reduce state tax revenue by $470 million in the current fiscal year and $702 million in 2026-27. Pillen, meanwhile, has said he anticipated needing to cut state spending and says state government should be reduced. He has called for $500 million in agency cuts this year.
Legal questions continue
Supporters of the Trust, who maintain that the latest proposed transfer is illegal, point to a state statute that says that grants from the Trust “shall not provide direct assistance to regulatory programs.”

But Woita, of the NDWEE, said that is a misreading of state law, and that recent amendments for the use of the Water Resources Cash Fund clearly allow its use to cover the costs of salaries and water conservation projects.
In May, a former state official, Jon Oberg, threatened to file a lawsuit to block the proposed transfer of Trust funds to the water resources fund proposed in the 2025 legislative session.
Oberg and another former state official, W. Don Nelson, who served as chief of staff under then-Gov. Bob Kerrey, have previously successfully blocked a Trust funding decision that they maintained was unconstitutional. Their 2020 lawsuit resulted in the removal of a $1.8 million grant to install ethanol blender pumps at gas stations.
But Oberg told the Examiner on Thursday that he had no comment about the most recent proposal. The proposed $8 million transfer will be considered by the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee during the 2026 legislative session, which begins Wednesday.

A fifth candidate, Enrique Casiano of Janesville, happens to check all four of those boxes. A 47-year-old registered nurse, Casiano said his decision to join the Democratic field of hopefuls for the 1st District seat arose during a four-month strike at the Mercyhealth East Clinic in Janesville, where he is a leader in United Auto Workers Local 95.
The walkout of UAW-represented nurses, physical therapists, medical assistants and maintenance employees at the clinic started July 2, centered on health care costs, wages and security for employees.
“When September came around we were still on strike,” Casiano recalled. “I was thinking to myself, What in the world is going on? Why would a company do this to their employees? Why would this even be allowed?”
He and fellow union members blamed federal labor laws. Casiano said they have “no teeth” and don’t hold employers accountable.
“That has to be changed at a national level,” Casiano said. “That’s what motivated me to get out there and run for Congress.”
The strike ended Nov. 3, when the clinic management and the union ratified a new contract. The agreement led to raises that were higher than nonunion employees received elsewhere in the Mercyhealth system, Casiano said, although still less than what the union had originally sought. Health care costs for employees will be “basically three times” what they were previously, he added.
“This was a big concession,” Casiano said. “Something I told the membership, this should be a wake-up call for everybody to vote for someone who’s going to do something about the health care crisis in our nation.”
Casiano argues that health care is a human right and government should do more to prevent health care costs from leaving people in debt or sending them into bankruptcy.
“If you have the money, you’ll get care,” he said. “If you don’t have the money, I’ve seen how many people end up being homeless or go into great debt because of their health.”
He supports Medicare for All, but also favors giving states greater freedom to regulate the health care systems. He opposes consolidation among health care groups and favors breaking up large hospital and health care systems, as well as keeping for-profit businesses, including private equity and venture capital firms, out of health care.
“The current system rewards profiting from people’s health care crisis,” Casiano said. “It is not a system of prevention and rewarding the best health care outcomes and practices.”
Casiano said that updating the 1930s-era National Labor Relations Act with laws that would strengthen the rights of workers to union representation is a top priority of his. If elected he would also seek to enact stronger federal laws against wage theft and against misclassifying workers as independent contractors with fewer protections. He said that he also wants “real tax relief to the working class” instead of the wealthy.
Casiano is one of five Democrats vying for the chance to challenge U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, the Republican incumbent in the 1st District now in his fourth term.
“I’m part of the working class. I’m not a lawyer. I’m not a politician,” Casiano said — although he readily acknowledged that every other Democrat competing for the nomination could make the same claim.
“Pretty much everybody running this time around, we’re all just working class people who want to see a change in the 1st District,” he said.
The rest of the Democratic field includes ironworker Randy Bryce, emergency room nurse Mitchell Berman, Racine community activist Gage Stills and university administrator Miguel Aranda.
As he shapes his campaign, Casiano is leaning into his background as a health care professional, a union activist and also a member of the Hispanic community.
He said the Trump administration’s round-ups of immigrants — which has caught up U.S. citizens in addition to people without legal immigration status — has a personal dimension.
“It’s sad that I, when I go to Milwaukee, can be stopped [by police] just because of the way I look and the way I talk,” he said. “At the national level, we’re attacking specific [ethnic groups of] people, which we’ve never done before.”
The 1st Congressional District has been solidly Republican since the mid-1990s. Steil succeeded Paul Ryan in the office when Ryan stepped aside  in 2018 after a 20-year tenure. A corporate lawyer and former Ryan aide, Steil won with margins of 9 to 10 points in 2022 and 2024.
The Cook Political Report has rated the district as likely Republican in 2026, and gives the GOP a 2-point advantage based on past presidential elections.
Casiano contends political apathy accounts for Steil’s success. “In the last election, many of my coworkers, they just did not go out to vote,” he said. “It’s not winnable, somebody told me [because] it’s all about the money.”
He contends that 2026 can be different.
“What’s changed now is the Trump administration and how messed up everything is going,” Casiano said. “Only people that have blinders on will say everything is OK, because it’s not.”
Casiano said he knows he’s a long-shot candidate, but he believes Steil is vulnerable and that people can be motivated to vote if candidates reach out to them.
“I know he has let down a lot of his constituents,” Casiano said. “We know he’s not out there for the farmers, or some of the small businesses” in the district, he added. “That’s the big message we’ve got to bring forward.”
He believes enough people have stayed away from the polls in the past to make a difference in the outcome for 2026.
“We have to go and start talking to Black and brown people in our community and get them out to vote,” Casiano said. “This is what I’m going to be fighting for.”

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden reminded lawmakers during his December budget address that state law “dictates” a minimum increase in education funding each year.
But in the next breath, he recommended flat funding for South Dakota schools.
During a press conference two days later, South Dakota Searchlight asked Rhoden to explain the contradiction.
“The same people that made the laws can suspend them, if you will,” he said. “And there’s times that it’s been necessary to do so.”
Lawmakers created the mandatory increase law in 1995, with an effective date in 1997. It required annual increases of 3% or inflation, whichever is less — an amount described as the “index factor.”
Legislators and governors followed or exceeded that requirement for 13 years. Since 2010, however, they’ve provided less than the index factor four times. Rhoden’s proposed budget would be the fifth.
How lawmakers get around the index factor
To get around mandatory funding increases, lawmakers amend the state education funding law. Instead of applying the mandatory increase to the prior year’s baseline funding, they reset the baseline. 
The mandatory increase remains in the law, but only as a requirement for the next year. When the next year arrives, if legislators want to go below or above the minimum increase, they reset the baseline again as needed.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said the index factor now serves more as a “guideline or a goal.”
“One Legislature can’t bind a future Legislature by statute,” Venhuizen said.


Dave Knudson was chief of staff to Gov. Bill Janklow when Janklow signed the mandatory minimum increase into law three decades ago. Knudson, who later served as a lawmaker, said the Legislature’s recent treatment of the law signifies a declining commitment to schools.
“It seems like education isn’t as high of a priority in these last few years as it was the prior 25 or so,” Knudson said.
1990s law changes made schools ‘very dependent on the state’
Janklow convinced lawmakers in 1995 to take more responsibility for school funding in an effort to reduce local property taxes. 
Knudson said the index factor was established because Janklow’s administration “knew state funding would have to be adjusted on an annual basis.” Three percent was close to the annual rate of inflation around that time, he said.
‘Not increasing is a cut’: Governor’s flat funding plan for education, health care worries advocates

Former lawmaker Lee Schoenbeck served in the Legislature then. He said there was an expectation that the index factor would provide what school districts “needed to have to operate.”
The changes implemented in the 1990s made schools “very dependent on the state,” Schoenbeck said, and put the onus on lawmakers to follow through with required funding increases.
“It ought to be a big deal to decide you won’t do that,” Schoenbeck said. 
During the roughly 30-year history of the index factor law, lawmakers have increased education funding by exactly the index factor 10 times and gone above it 15 times. They provided increases smaller than the index factor four times, including one year of widespread budget cuts when education funding was reduced.
Rhoden said during his budget address that education funding has stayed above the index factor over the long term. Since his predecessor Kristi Noem became governor in 2019, state education funding has grown by 27.9%, Rhoden said, while the index factor over that time has been 21.7%
Impact of sales tax reduction
Sandra Waltman, the South Dakota Education Association’s director of government relations and communications, said school districts set their budgets with the index factor as a guideline. Some enter into multi-year contracts with teachers based on the expectation.

Yet school leaders recognize it can be difficult to meet the index factor “in extreme times,” Waltman said.
“To ignore it consistently and have schools fall behind inflation is where we’d become concerned,” she said.
Schoenbeck said the state could live up to the index factor this year by immediately returning the state’s sales tax to 4.5%. The Legislature and then-Gov. Noem temporarily reduced the rate to 4.2% in 2023, costing the state more than $100 million in annual revenue. The tax is scheduled to go back up to 4.5%, but not until 2027.
“Put that back to where we had it and you’d have your problem solved,” Schoenbeck said. “Now these people in the Legislature will have to decide if they have the courage to pay their bills.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)I have an easy New Year’s resolution for Oklahoma lawmakers: Vow to reject any legislation in 2026 that creates do-nothing advisory boards. 
Pretty much every annual legislative session, senators and representatives pat themselves on the back for creating another government panel that seems to have no enforcement or regulatory power, much less do anything to make our state a better place.
Take the higher education Free Speech Committee, for example.
It’s been in the headlines recently because Oklahomans want to know what this body is doing about the fact that our state’s three largest universities have each been hammered with allegations of First Amendment violations, ranging from political and religious speech discrimination to press censorship.
Lawmakers created the board in 2022 to ensure that First Amendment rights are protected on Oklahoma college campuses, but gave it the power to only review policies and complaints and then make recommendations to universities on improvements to policies and free speech training. Chad Caldwell, who authored the legislation, has said the committee is needed because free speech matters continue to grow in importance, affect everyone universally and need to be protected.
But rather than being bastions of free speech, this nine-member board gives the sense that they have no sense of urgency to protect the First Amendment rights of university students and employees.
Instead of serving as a watchdog, this group has largely relegated themselves to the sidelines, opting instead to be cheerleaders, allowing universities to police themselves.
Meanwhile, our universities have faced serious free speech accusations.
A dispute at Oklahoma State University gained national attention after a staff member reportedly criticized a student for wearing a hat emblazoned with “No. 47” – symbolizing President Donald Trump’s second administration – while ironically giving a speech about free speech on campus at a nonpartisan event.
Leadership at the University of Central Oklahoma is facing accusations that they’re attempting to censor the press by stopping the print edition of their student newspaper, The Vista. The paper continues to publish digitally. 
And the University of Oklahoma is facing a dispute over whether a student, who received a failing grade after she cited the Bible in an essay about gender conformity in a psychology class, can claim religious discrimination. It has led the university to put two educators, including a teaching assistant who gave a student a zero for her work, on leave. The university, by the way, is now also facing accusations from a national group that they infringed on the rights of the teaching assistant. Just before Christmas, the university said that person who graded the essay was stripped of instructional duties.
As the Freedom From Religion Foundation put it, OU is a public university, which cannot privilege a certain religious viewpoint.
This state committee, meanwhile, has been largely silent throughout it all.
That raises concerning questions about whether board members actually know what they’re doing, and if they even could recognize a First Amendment violation.
During its most recent meeting, the Free Speech Committee only mentioned the OU dispute, which continues to play out, just before adjoining. The board chair asked the board if anyone wanted to address it as part of the board’s new business. Caldwell, who serves on the committee he helped create, commended the university for using the free speech processes in place.
Committee member Andy Lester also praised OU after the meeting, but lamented at one point that “it’s hard to balance these things.”
Indeed. But that, dear sir, is the onerous task this committee should be undertaking.
He also recommended that people pursue free speech complaints at the campus-level rather than with his committee because their “process takes some time.”
That’s not encouraging for people who deserve to have their First Amendment rights protected and enforced by what should be a neutral body or for our universities that deserve vindication if they did not commit a violation.
If this board is not equipped to quickly sort through complaints, why do it at all?
Caldwell said he supports it continuing to be an advisory committee. He argues they don’t need enforcement powers to force changes, and said that the committee was designed to be collaborative rather than adversarial with the universities it works with.
Board members have been busy combing through institutions’ free speech policies and making seemingly minor revision recommendations.
I question if this committee has the expertise — and willpower — needed to recommend changes that will strengthen free speech protections.
As an advisory board, they definitely don’t have the power to require needed change.
Which makes it a prime example of the ridiculousness of advisory boards and commissions.
So I hope as lawmakers begin drafting their 2026 legislation, they ask themselves if another advisory board will legitimately make lives better for their constituents.
If the answer is no, then let’s resolve in 2026 to take a hard pass on creating new ones and to seriously consider the continued need for those that already exist.

Local stakeholders say the project simply requires too many unacceptable impacts for the unique, and lucrative, outdoor recreation hotspot.
The post Backer of controversial Seminoe hydroelectric project proposes new tack appeared first on WyoFile .","The developer of a proposed pumped-water-storage hydroelectric project at Seminoe Reservoir has submitted a revised plan and asked federal officials to consider it as they evaluate the proposal and draft regulations. 
Utah-based rPlus Hydro says the alternative plan addresses a host of local concerns, including threats to critical bighorn sheep habitat and a destination trout fishery. Project opponents, and at least one state agency, say they haven’t had adequate time to evaluate the new proposal and remain unconvinced that it accomplishes that aim. 
The developer also filed a request in December with the state to certify water quality assertions made in its applications for federal licenses. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality will review and prescribe conditions related to “dredge-and-fill” activities associated with the project, according to the agency.
If built, the pumped-water storage system would generate electricity by pumping Seminoe Reservoir water uphill during daytime “off-peak demand” hours when wind and solar power are plentiful and wholesale electricity is cheapest, and then releasing that water back downhill through hydroelectric turbines during higher-demand hours in the evening.
Wildlife impacts, waivers and an alternate plan
The project is ultimately subject to federal approval and regulation, though which agencies should handle which aspects is still a matter of debate. Several state agencies and local government entities, meanwhile, also have roles to play as evaluators, commenters and advocates.

On the federal side, rPlus Hydro wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider its newly proposed “Alternative D” in the draft environmental impact statement for the project. The company, responding to an outpouring of concern and analysis from locals, says its newly crafted option would result in less heavy-truck traffic and a smaller construction footprint, reducing likely impacts to wildlife in the area, including a prized bighorn sheep herd.
“From a recreation standpoint,” rPlus wrote in a Dec. 15 letter to FERC, the company’s revised proposal “relocates the primary construction activities for the main access tunnel — including the batch plant and spoil pile — farther from the state park. As a result, recreational resources and visitor experiences are expected to be less affected than under [FERC’s currently preferred plan].”
Wildlife and outdoor recreation advocates have railed against the company’s request for a long list of waivers to timing stipulations designed to protect wildlife and habitat in the area. Likewise, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has objected to some habitat impacts that FERC appears willing to accept, including variance requests to override “timing stipulations for the crucial winter and [birthing] ranges,” Game and Fish wrote in a December letter to FERC. 
“Bighorn sheep have very specific habitat requirements which the minimization and mitigation measures proposed in the [draft plan] will not be able to adequately compensate,” the letter states. “Bighorn sheep habitat is irreplaceable.” 
rPlus Hydro’s new option is a welcomed effort, as well as an acknowledgement of threats to wildlife and recreation, Trout Unlimited’s Patrick Harrington said. But it doesn’t go far enough. The project would still disturb big game and other wildlife and chip away at vital habitat. The new alternative also doesn’t address potential impacts to the Seminoe and North Platte River fisheries.

“It’s a [public relations] strategy, not meaningful mitigation,” said Harrington, who serves as Wyoming governmental relations director for Trout Unlimited’s Rockies Region.
A major flaw in the proposed new alternative, Harrington added, is that it appears to shift much of the federal government’s mitigation planning for the project from FERC to the Bureau of Reclamation, which doesn’t have comprehensive authorities to address the myriad environmental and recreation impacts.
“This just creates an administrative loophole that makes permitting simpler,” Harrington said.
Existing wildlife timing restrictions, which are enshrined in the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Rawlins Resource Management Plan, increase the cost of construction, rPlus Hydro told WyoFile. The company is asking for waivers that are “narrowly tailored to allow construction to proceed efficiently.”
“Under the BLM Resource Management Plan,” rPlus continued in a written response to WyoFile inquiries, “seasonal activity restrictions would limit construction to roughly four months per year. This constraint would significantly extend an already complex, multi-year construction effort and require repeated mobilization and demobilization of crews and equipment, adding costs and inefficiencies that would make the project uneconomical to build.”

The public comment period for FERC’s draft environmental analysis ended Friday, before the agency formally responded to the company’s new proposed alternative. Trout Unlimited and several other entities, according to Harrington, are asking FERC for additional time to review and comment on the revamped proposal. rPlus Hydro “does not oppose” additional time for public review and comments, the company said. 
Without the benefit of formally reviewing rPlus Hydro’s proposed alternative, Wyoming Game and Fish reiterated to FERC its frustration with the federal agency’s draft plan. 
“We have articulated our concerns to the project proponent and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission through numerous exchanges,” Game and Fish Director Angi Bruce wrote. “And yet our most significant concerns, direct and in-direct impacts to the Ferris-Seminoe bighorn sheep herd and the fisheries of Seminoe Reservoir, Kortes Reservoir and the Miracle Mile segment of the North Platte River continue to be inadequately addressed or disregarded in the [draft environmental impact statement].”
Seminoe project
rPlus Hydro, and its subsidiary Black Canyon Hydro, propose building a 13,400-acre-foot reservoir in the Bennett Mountains overlooking Seminoe Reservoir near the dam — one of several reservoirs on the North Platte River.
Water from Seminoe would be pumped approximately 1,000 feet uphill to the new storage facility during the day when the market price for electricity is typically cheapest, then the water would be released through hydroelectric generators in the evening when daily power demand peaks, according to the companies. The facility could generate more than 900 megawatts of electricity when operating — slightly more than the generation capacity of the Dave Johnston coal-fired power plant, and enough to power roughly 675,000 homes.

The project also requires a new bridge and about 30 miles of new power transmission line connecting to PacifiCorp’s Aeolus Substation near Medicine Bow. The estimated cost ranges from $3 billion to $5 billion, and it could take up to five years to construct, according to federal documents.
“The project will bring substantial economic benefits to the local community and will serve as an important element of Wyoming’s modernized and reliable energy infrastructure,” according to the company’s website.
State’s review, and water quality
As stakeholders await word from FERC about its next steps, Wyoming DEQ has posted technical and modeling reports regarding rPlus Hydro’s request to the state. DEQ will host a public meeting from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Jan. 21, at Casper College.
Among other water quality considerations, the agency noted “discharges of water used for power generation may influence water quality in Seminoe Reservoir, the downstream Kortes Reservoir, and the segment of the North Platte River below Kortes Dam known as the ‘Miracle Mile,’ primarily with respect to temperature.
“This segment of the North Platte River,” DEQ continued, “is designated as an Outstanding Resource Water where the existing quality is maintained and protected.”

Trout Unlimited, as well as Friends of the North Platte and other groups, worry that a potential increase in turbidity and temperature may damage the fisheries, noting that trout, in particular, are sensitive to warmer temperatures. That’s a concern for local governments that rely on fishing tourism revenue.
“Any negative impacts upon the North Platte fishery, specifically the Miracle Mile, could have a devastating impact on our tourism industry,” Casper Mayor Ray Pacheco wrote in a draft letter to FERC.
The Casper City Council, joining Natrona and Carbon county officials, objects to FERC’s currently proposed path forward for the project. 
“This project will have a substantial impact on the health, safety, welfare, custom, culture and socioeconomic viability not just of Carbon County, but Natrona County and the City of Casper,” Pacheco wrote. “It is imperative that any potential impact this project has on hunting and fishing must be considered and properly mitigated.”
rPlus Hydro reiterated to WyoFile that it “takes seriously” and “recognizes the tremendous importance of fish and other wildlife to Wyoming and to the communities surrounding the proposed Seminoe Pumped Storage Project.”
The company noted that its own study concluded “that normal project operations, under typical conditions, would not harm Miracle Mile water quality or its fishery. rPlus has agreed to operational restrictions to ensure temperature thresholds are not exceeded and that the Miracle Mile remains fully protected.”
Conservation groups, including Trout Unlimited, are not convinced. All things considered, Trout Unlimited’s Harrington told WyoFile, the project appears to require so many environmental exceptions and acknowledged fish and wildlife impacts that it is simply a bad fit for the location.

Food insecurity is soaring in the state due to inflation and other factors, food relief experts say.
The post Wyoming spent $2.4M on hunger relief during shutdown emergency appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming spent $2.4 million to supplement hunger relief efforts in the state when the government shutdown left an estimated 26,000 state residents without federal SNAP assistance this fall. 
The money, which Gov. Mark Gordon released after declaring a public welfare emergency, was distributed to 81 mobile pantries, food pantries and the Food Bank of Wyoming. Distribution amounts ranged from $1,814 to the LaBarge Food Bank to $216,280 to Needs Inc. in Cheyenne.  
With the increased purchasing power, Wyoming’s network of food relief partners were able to distribute approximately 140,000 more meals statewide compared to the same period last year, according to a Department of Family Services report.
That number underscores what food relief personnel describe as a level of food insecurity they’ve never experienced before. 
It’s hard to say something like “all-time high” because there are holes in historic data, Food Bank of Wyoming Executive Director Danica Sveda said. But that’s what it feels like. “We are experiencing food insecurity on a much higher scale than I think anyone anticipated,” she said. 
The need for nutritious food had already increased to notable levels by summertime. The trend ramped up during the holidays, Sveda said. 
Gov. Gordon touted the SNAP-related hunger relief efforts in a recent press release.
“This effort reflects Wyoming at its best,” Gordon said. “State agencies, nonprofits, churches, and volunteers worked together to take care of our neighbors.”
He added a caveat, however.

“I’m proud of that work but I want to reiterate that this need has not ended with the restart of SNAP,” Gordon said. 
Hunger insecurity and SNAP
An estimated 90,000 people in Wyoming lack reliable access to nutritious, affordable food, according to the 2025 Map the Meal Gap from Feeding America. Additionally, 26,260 children live in food-insecure homes, the report shows, a 39% increase since 2019. 
As to what’s fueling growing needs, Sveda said, “it’s largely due to inflation. Grocery store prices are incredible right now, even for people who don’t face food insecurity.”
For families whose wages haven’t risen, she said, “the cost of food is really making families make hard choices.” Most other costs of living like utilities, rent and gas are inflexible, she said, so it’s the food budget that often takes the hit.

The federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their grocery budget. 
Around 29,000 people in 13,000 households receive SNAP benefits in Wyoming, according to the USDA. The average monthly benefit is around $386 per household. Children and seniors received the majority of the roughly $62 million in 2024 benefits. 
The Wyoming Department of Family Services distributes SNAP benefits on a monthly basis via reloadable EBT cards, which function like a debit card, for buying eligible food items.
As October’s government shutdown stretched toward November, the USDA announced plans to stop SNAP payments due to lack of funding. On the eve of the Nov. 1 SNAP lapse, Gordon declared a public welfare emergency, releasing state funds to prop up food assistance. 
Wyoming was unable to transfer state funds to SNAP recipients’ EBT debit cards. Instead, the executive order enabled the governor’s office to send discretionary emergency funds to charitable organizations and churches to provide food through food banks and pantries. 
A recent Department of Family Services report outlined how funds were disbursed and used during the period between Nov. 1 and Nov. 19, when Gordon’s order was rescinded.
“The funding allowed pantries to purchase a greater quantity and variety of items, especially high-demand proteins and fresh produce,” the report said.
Hunger relief programs served 74,000 individuals in November, a big jump from 53,000 in October, the report shows — “highlighting the increase in usage in November, which occurred during the federal government shutdown.” 
Rising needs
In the report, the Food Bank of Wyoming compared the November food spending of its partners to the same period last year. 
“Due to this increased purchasing power, partners were able to distribute approximately 140,000 more meals statewide compared to the same period last year,” the report said. “This dramatic increase underscores how essential this funding has been in stabilizing food access during a period of heightened need.”

The report also includes other data that indicate mounting food insecurity in the state. From September through November, calls to Wyoming’s 211 helpline related to food needs nearly doubled, the report states. 
Sveda, who spoke to WyoFile days after the Christmas holiday season ended, said that even with the buffer of emergency funds, pantries ran out of food, didn’t have enough volunteers to operate more than a few hours per week and experienced increasing numbers of people showing up for food assistance. 
SNAP benefits have resumed. Still, Food Bank of Wyoming and others are bracing for high demand to continue in 2026, she said. 
“We want to make sure that no one has to go to bed hungry, and that no one is malnourished because they couldn’t afford produce,” Sveda said. “And so looking ahead, we’re going to continue to work really hard to cultivate relationships with producers, farmers, ranchers and donors to make sure that we can keep doing this valuable work and make sure that we’re getting enough food out into the community.”

When everyone has health insurance, providers aren’t burdened with bad debt, charity care and overcrowded emergency departments, writes Barbara Sowada.
The post ‘Medicare for All’ can fix a broken system appeared first on WyoFile .","The current U.S. healthcare system is broken. 
The problem is bigger than affordability. Our system is a for-profit mishmash of disparate insurers and payment plans cobbled together in reaction to economic and political issues. The result is an increasingly unaffordable, ineffective, confusing mess, which frustrates patients, doctors and hospitals alike.

Opinion

The solution is “Medicare for All.” 
It would bring high quality, affordable care to everyone. You wouldn’t lose your health insurance if you lose your job, move, get divorced, age out, or make too much money. A catastrophic illness or injury wouldn’t plunge you into medical debt. It lets you choose your doctors and hospitals, improves your access to healthcare services regardless of where you live, reduces health disparities, and improves the health of individuals and our communities. 
Studies show that having health insurance is strongly correlated with more disease prevention, better chronic disease management, less infant and maternal mortality, and greater longevity.
Medicare for All builds on and expands traditional Medicare, which is well liked, to provide comprehensive benefits — medical, prescription drugs, mental health, dental, vision, hearing and long-term care to every person in the U.S. With everyone covered in the same plan, care is affordable. There are no insurance premiums, out-of-pocket costs, copays, deductibles, coinsurance, surprise bills, nor network restrictions.
The benefits to doctors and hospitals are significant. With Medicare for All, a single-payer system, billing is standardized and streamlined, saving an estimated $40 billion annually. Providers are paid the same for the same service, instead of payment varying by geography and insurer. When everyone has health insurance, providers aren’t burdened with bad debt, charity care and overcrowded emergency departments.
Opponents claim Medicare for All is too expensive and would raise taxes. The fact is we cannot afford not to implement Medicare for All. America has the most expensive healthcare system in the world, an estimated $5.3 trillion was spent in 2024. 
Broken down, the average cost to insure a family of four was about $29,000 — $3,564 out of pocket, $6,296 in premiums and $19,276 in employer contributions, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker, which monitors the U.S. health system’s performance. 
In other words, those premiums are a kind of tax. Right now, we are all paying for each other’s health insurance. For instance, employer contributions are indirectly subsidized by us, paid for through higher prices when we buy the company’s goods or services, and are directly subsidized by the worker, through reduced compensation to offset what employers spend on employees’ health insurance.
The U.S. spends almost twice as much as comparable countries who have healthcare for all — $13,432 per person versus an average $7,393, using 2023 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data. Yet, our health outcomes are poorer by all major metrics. Here’s the kicker — 60% of U.S. healthcare costs come from tax dollars. Sixty percent of $13,432 equals $8,059 — still more than our counterparts pay for better healthcare. We pay much more because the U.S. is not a unified system but a conglomeration of competing, for-profit parts. Costs cannot be controlled in a for-profit system, only shifted. 
Motivated by quarterly growth, the U.S. healthcare system functions much like the children’s game of musical chairs. Insurers, big Pharma, hospitals and doctors compete with each other, expecting their profits to grow quarterly. Comparable countries keep their costs low because they are not motivated by quarterly growth, investor dividends and stock buybacks. 
Their healthcare systems are funded through some form of income-based progressive taxes, or a combination of progressive taxes and limited household contributions. Everyone is automatically covered and costs are controlled through a systemwide budget, known as a global budget, which unites all parts of the system and spreads the money equitably so hospitals don’t go broke, nor eliminate services. All communities, including rural communities, have access to necessary care.
You don’t have to be a fan of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders to see that his proposed Medicare for All legislation is a good step in the right direction — a move toward a single-payer system that provides comprehensive coverage to all Americans, regardless of income or health status. To control costs, Medicare for All must be explicitly a non-profit system, integrated by a global budget. It also must be adequately funded. Medicare for All, however, will not be welcomed by those who are profiting from the current system. They have the money to lobby Congress, and disinform the public, to maintain the status quo. If we want affordable healthcare, then Medicare for All is worth fighting for.
Piecemeal reform, whether at the state or national level, can only bring us more of the same: rising costs and diminishing returns.

(Getty Images)Idaho will receive nearly $930 million over the next five years to improve rural health care access and affordability. 
The massive federal tax and spending package approved in July included $50 billion for “Rural Healthcare Transformation” grants nationwide. 
Idaho on Dec. 30 was awarded nearly $186 million in annual grants to be distributed over five years to implement the plan outlined in its grant application, which focuses on five initiatives: “improve rural access to care through technology; ensure accessible quality care through innovative models; sustain rural workforce with training, recruitment, and retention; implement population-specific, evidence-based projects to make rural America healthy again; and invest in rural health infrastructure and partnerships.”  
“For many Idaho families – especially in rural areas – affordable, accessible health care is a real concern,” Gov. Brad Little said in a press release. “This investment, made possible by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, recognizes those challenges and puts resources where they’re needed most. It helps strengthen local health care and ensures Idahoans can get the affordable care they need, no matter where they live.” 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare submitted the state’s application with consultation from a task force convened by Little. 
The state will use the funds to provide subgrants to support the goals and projects outlined in its application. 
“A budget request will now go before the Legislature for federal funds approval,” the press release said, “and additional details about implementation will be shared as they become available.” 
 Idaho plans to use technology to improve rural access to care

The state’s application includes plans to conduct assessments on rural health care facilities to identify gaps, develop shared infrastructure among clients and to invest in equipment, software and training to expand telehealth options. 
The state plans to help procure mobile apps and online portals to help Idahoan patients for “self-monitoring, appointment scheduling, medication adherence, and coaching.” Investments in cybersecurity improvements, AI clinical tools, emergency system upgrades, and health management and analytics systems are also included in the plan.  
The goals to achieve by 2030 include increasing the number of facilities utilizing telehealth by 50%, increasing the percentage of physicians located in each of Idaho’s rural counties that are connected to the new Health Alert Network (HAN) to at least 80%, and increasing the number of appointments completed using telehealth or remote delivery modality by 50%.
 Idaho’s plan to use ‘innovative models’ includes diagnostic kiosks, workforce programs 

Idaho’s grant application outlines plans to deploy kiosks and pods in rural communities in places such as libraries, grocery stores and pharmacies where people may attend a telehealth appointment or receive mail-order prescriptions in lockers.
To address workforce shortages in rural areas, the plan proposes to further utilize health care professionals who aren’t doctors, such as emergency medical services, or EMS, responders. The plan said it may use funds to create designated locations where these professionals could hold in-person contact hours or offer apprenticeships. Funds would also be used to develop a Community Health Emergency Medical Services plan and allow trained EMS professionals to perform check-ups and wellness assessments in homes.
Funds may be targeted at recruitment, retention and training of EMS professionals. 
Goals include increasing the percentage of Idaho’s rural counties that have at least one county-level full-time equivalent paid EMS position from 28% in October 2025 to at least 97% by December 2030 and to decrease the percentage of emergency responses to repeat users (those who received services more than more than once in a year) from 32% in 2013-2016 to less than 10% by December 2030. 
 Funds may target incentives on medical education, training and retention in rural areas

Most of Idaho is rural, and the entire state is experiencing a significant shortage in doctors, especially in certain areas such as obstetrics and gynecology. The state does not have a public medical school in its borders, but it has some state-sponsored seats at the University of Washington and University of Utah medical schools. 
Both graduate and undergraduate medical students can do required training rotations in Idaho, and increasing opportunities for these clinic rotations in Idaho has been a focus of a recent task force looking to boost medical education in the state. 
The application includes financial incentives for doctors who commit to working in rural areas for at least five years, including signing bonuses and retention bonuses. There would also be money put toward health care education scholarships to students who would commit to serving in rural areas upon graduation, and support for physicians who train undergraduate or graduate medical students. 
Using the federal grant to support medical training in rural areas was an idea floated by the Idaho Medical Education Working Group, the Idaho Capital Sun reported in September. 
 Projects to deploy address chronic disease, mental health, maternal health 

Within Idaho’s initiative to “make rural America healthy again,” are projects to implement national standards and screening to try and prevent chronic health conditions, improve mental health and substance abuse treatment and address shortages in maternal and child health services. 
Projects include the National Diabetes Prevention program to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes, and diabetes self-management education and support programs, as well as enhanced screening and education about Alzheimer’s and related dementias, and cancer, heart disease and other chronic conditions. 
Funds could be used for initial start-up costs for a pediatric psychiatry access line, so that pediatricians may be able to consult with child psychiatrists, according to the application. Other efforts could include providing space for mental health treatment in schools, expanding mobile crisis response teams and mobile medication assisted treatment for substance abuse, and to complete a needs assessment of maternal and neonatal care. 
Goals include decreasing the number of deaths from suicide, drug overdose, and alcoholism by 25% from 1,216 in 2023 to 912 or fewer by December 2030 and increasing the number of rural hospitals completing one or more new perinatal collaborative initiatives from zero to eight by December 2030. 
 Infrastructure investments may include equipment, vehicle and mobile screening units 

The planned investments in rural health care infrastructure include supporting renovations of facilities that would facilitate prevention programs, behavioral health treatment, dental and maternal health services. 
The funds could also be used to modernize facilities with the purchase of equipment such as MRIs, CT scanners, equipment for compounding pharmaceuticals and other items that would allow rural residents access to higher-level care without having to travel to a larger community. 
The application includes a plan to purchase mobile mammography units to offer breast cancer screenings in areas where they are not offered, and to help clinics and facilities retrofit vehicles to use for patient transportation. 
The application included a commitment to strengthen its partnership with the five federally recognized Native American tribes in Idaho, as well as to set aside 3.5% of its total grant to support tribal health care facilities and projects intended to improve services for Native American residents.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Candidates in a crowded Republican field vying for their party’s nomination to fill a vacant Arkansas state Senate seat already agree on many issues, from lowering taxes to supporting abortion restrictions — but they are especially united in their opposition to the 3,000-bed Franklin County prison project.
The GOP candidates facing off in a five-way primary Tuesday include a former member of the state House of Representatives, a gas utility community affairs coordinator and three businesspeople.
They’re hoping to serve the remaining term of a Republican lawmaker who was a vocal opponent of a project that has roiled this rural community 45 minutes from Fort Smith so much that one critic has placed placards and fake skeletons across from the prison site in protest of it.
Whoever wins the GOP nomination will go on to face Adam Watson, an independent, in the special general election held on March 3. If none of the candidates win an outright majority, the top two advance to a runoff Feb. 3.
The seat became vacant in September, after the death of Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch, who was among the lawmakers who voted against the prison’s construction when it was repeatedly rejected during last year’s legislative session.
Stubblefield’s seat has been the focus of a lawsuit over Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ decision to schedule the election for his successor in June. The move prompted complaints that the timing would have left voters without representation in this year’s legislative session, when the prison project is likely to come up. Sanders eventually moved up the election after being ordered to do so by a judge.
The candidates are:

Former state Rep. Mark Berry
Wade Dunn, a businessman
Brad Simon, a businessman
Stacie Smith, community affairs coordinator for Arkansas Oklahoma Gas
Ted Tritt, a businessman

 Prison 
The five candidates said in interviews and during a candidate forum in Booneville last month that they believed spending on the prison was irresponsible, citing issues obtaining water at the 815-acre site, lack of an available workforce and lack of input.
Berry, who represented House District 26 when the prison was announced in October 2024, said the prison issue has been “poorly handled” by state officials, expressing frustration with how he was informed about it. Generally, Berry was in support of building a new prison — just not in Franklin County, and possibly not as large either — and for increasing state spending on public safety.
“One thousand to 1,500 beds would be adequate, with the ability to expand that prison as we actually need it,” Berry said. He added that expanding Calico Rock was another potential option.
Dunn, who has been endorsed by Stubblefield’s family, criticized the surprise announcement of the prison site as “sneaky” and “underhanded,” before adding that he would never be in favor of it.
He also proposed an alternate location, saying Mountainburg, just off Interstate 49’s Exit 29, could draw on Fort Smith and the northwest Arkansas region for employees.
Simon said the state would be better off using that money to address the number of inmates who return to prison after being released, a root cause for the state’s prison bed shortage.
“We invest about $5 million a year on our reentry program,” Simon said. “We could spend $100 million on reentry programs, and it wouldn’t even be a drop in the bucket to what that prison’s going to cost.”
Tritt disputed there was an overcrowding problem. He said there needed to be a greater focus on providing additional support for people locked up for nonviolent crimes and those with mental health issues.
Smith said in an emailed statement that she could not support spending “$1 billion on a 3,000-bed prison when our state has so many other needs.”
Taxes and priorities
The Republican hopefuls sounded similar on other issues. The four who spoke at the forum cited lowering income or property taxes as a priority if elected, while also saying such cuts had to be fiscally responsible.
Dunn said, if elected, he would push to eliminate property taxes for veterans and those over the age of 65.
“They’ve contributed a tax base to the tax base for 40 years, paid for their homes, paid for their property, but they still have to rent it from the government,” Dunn said.
Simon said cutting regulations and taxes were his top priorities, along with reducing spending, arguing those moves would expand the economy.
Berry supported eliminating income taxes, especially the corporate income tax.
Tritt also agreed with continuing to cut Arkansans’ taxes. But he also said listening to constituents would be most important, because “people don’t feel like their voices have been heard” in Little Rock.
Tritt said he was also concerned with a recent Arkansas Supreme Court ruling that legislators can alter or repeal constitutional amendments passed by voters with a two-thirds majority in each chamber.
“We’re gonna have to have some fighters there [in the Legislature] that’s going to stand up for the Constitution,” Tritt said.
Smith said her top priority other than the prison was strengthening workforce development via “vocational training, apprenticeships, and partnerships with local businesses.”

We’ll be watching everything from health care reforms and support for the state’s foster children to economic development plans and policies that could shape the state’s energy economy for years to come.
The legislative session is a chaotic period for both news and the public. It’s when laws are made and priorities for the state’s government throughout the next year are set.
We at West Virginia Watch wanted to take some time here before session begins on Jan. 14 to prepare our readers for what they will see from us throughout the 60 days, explain how processes work and ensure they know what tools and resources exist to help them navigate the often confusing proceedings that are about to take place.
Please read on to help keep yourself informed about what we’re tracking over the legislative process and feel free to reach out to any of our reporters if you have questions about the legislative process, our work or anything else.

A quick rundown on how session works
Lawmakers are expected to gavel in for the first day of the 60-day session on Wednesday, Jan. 14. That evening, Gov. Patrick Morrisey will deliver his second State of the State address, where he will lay out the legislative priorities he wants to see lawmakers address throughout the rest of session.
Once session starts, any lawmaker in either the state House of Delegates or Senate can introduce bills they would like to see their colleagues consider. After being introduced in the lawmaker’s chamber, the bill will be referred to the committee process.
In the Senate, the process is simple: each bill is referred to at least one committee, where lawmakers will discuss it, invite testimony on it and introduce potential amendments to change it. If a bill is passed out of committee, it will return to the entire Senate for consideration.
In the House, new rules introduced last year restructured the committee process. There, bills are referred to more specific subcommittees that operate under the larger committee. For example, under the House Education Committee are subcommittees for educational choice, higher education and public education. Members from the larger House Education committee serve in smaller groups on the subcommittees.
Each subcommittee in the House will consider a bill for at least two days. The first day it is introduced in the subcommittee will serve as a “public hearing,” where members of the public and stakeholders either request to speak on bills or are invited by lawmakers to do so. Individuals should reach out to committee chairs for each subcommittee to request to speak. 
The second day is when lawmakers will markup and discuss the legislation at hand, offering amendments as they see fit. At the end of that process, they will recommend whether or not the bill should be passed by the larger standing committee. The overarching committee will hold its own public comment period and discussion and markup of the bill before voting whether or not to advance it to the full House for passage.
After going through the committee process, legislation introduced in both chambers will be reintroduced — usually on second reading — in front of the entire body they originated in. Lawmakers at this point can offer amendments to bills that must be approved by a majority of the whole chamber. After a third reading and if a bill is approved by a majority of lawmakers, it will advance; the House will send their passed bills to the Senate and vice versa for passage.
Generally, this process continues until both chambers agree on and pass the same version of the bill to send on to the governor for approval. Once received, he can either sign the bill, veto it or allow it to become law without signature.
There are, of course, exceptions to all of these processes — either the House or the Senate can vote to suspend rules and change proceedings with enough votes, for example.
Overall, it’s most worth watching a bill once it is assigned to a committee. That shows that the bill is gaining traction and at least has enough support from a committee chair to be discussed and featured on an agenda.
Keep in mind, there are thousands of bills introduced each year. Only some of those advance through the committee process and even fewer become law. For example, out of 2,460 bills introduced last session only 249 — just over 10% — are actually considered completed legislation, meaning they became law or were vetoed by the governor.
WHAT WE’LL BE FOLLOWING
School funding formula woes, paying for the voucher program 
Many lawmakers represent counties losing public schools due largely to West Virginia’s shrinking population. Seventeen school closures have been approved so far this year, according to an analysis from the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. Sixteen public schools closed in 2024.
Schools get less money from the state when there are fewer students in classrooms, spurring financial concerns as they try to serve those who remain. 
State lawmakers have floated the idea of changing the state school aid funding formula, which hasn’t been updated in years, to better serve counties that are dealing with declining student enrollment. Adjusting the complicated school funding formula could be challenging in the 60-day session window.

School superintendents last month told lawmakers that they’d like to see a funding increase in the formula for professional and service personnel salaries so they can retain necessary teachers and staff despite declining population. 
The funding formula also doesn’t account for special education services, which are costly to the school system. Special education students now make up around 25% of the state’s student population, according to the state school board. 
Lawmakers will also have to figure out how to pay for the Hope Scholarship, the state’s broad school voucher program, that is expected to cost around $230 million. Some Republicans have already raised concerns that the program cost is ballooning out of control, and House Democrats are expected to introduce bills that would put guard rails on how the money can be spent, like banning use of Hope funds in out-of-state schools. 
Morrisey, lawmakers want changes for troubled foster care system
Republicans in the House and Senate have already said they’ll introduce at least 16 pieces of legislation focused on fixing the state’s troubled foster care system. Several of the measures focus on beefing up accountability for Child Protective Services, including a measure that would require CPS workers to wear body cameras.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has touted improvements to child welfare under his watch, but lawmakers are still concerned about how the state is handling foster care cases for around 6,000 kids. 
Many of the measures would require funding.
Morrisey plans to work with the Legislature on one of the proposed bills that would create a fund to bring hundreds of out-of-state foster children back to West Virginia. The money would be used to open in-state beds in state-owned facilities. There are more than 300 foster children from West Virginia in facilities across the country.

Senate President Randy Smith wants to see data center bill challenges addressed, others may not
One of the largest pieces of legislation passed in the 2025 regular session was House Bill 2014, dubbed the Power Generation and Consumption Act. The law aims to recruit the establishment of data centers in West Virginia. It also allows for the creation of microgrids — relatively small power sources that are not connected to existing electric utilities. 
The law created a specialized tax structure for certain data centers and microgrids, meaning all but 30% of property tax revenues generated by the facilities is diverted outside of the community they operate in. It also stops localities from enforcing any zoning requirements or other policies against the developments, meaning local governments have no control in how they operate.
Several companies are currently attempting to construct microgrids and data centers throughout West Virginia. Residents in some of these communities have been outspoken against the developments, citing concerns over environmental and health impacts and lamenting the lack of local control their governments have over the facilities and the costs that could be associated with them.
It’s possible this session could see revisions to the data center and microgrid bill, in part due to these residents’ concerns.
Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston, told his constituents in Tucker County in November that he had a “hard time” voting for HB 2014. As Senate president, he continued, he could have killed the bill but doing so would have been “hard” on his “political career” since it was a priority from Morrisey.
He said that “local control is a big issue” within the bill, and something that members of the state Senate “want to address.” 
At a news conference last month, House Speaker Roger Hanshaw was less direct about addressing concerns that have stemmed from the bill and the developments proposed following its passage. He said that, since it had been less than a year since the law went into effect, it was difficult to know the real impacts HB 2014 could have. 
“I’m sure that it’s among the things we’ll talk about when we convene next month,” he told reporters.
Meanwhile, Morrisey told reporters last month that he doesn’t believe concerns shared by locals who would be most affected by proposed data centers — and who have stood up consistently at rallies, public hearings, in lawsuits and more decrying them — are fair. He called them a “couple people” who were “engaging in scare tactics” and urged the public to instead celebrate how potential future proceeds from data center developments could help cut taxes.

School vaccination policy still unclear legislatively
Every year, lawmakers introduce bills to loosen the state’s strict school vaccination requirements. While states generally require school students to be vaccinated against several infectious diseases like whooping cough, polio and measles, West Virginia is one of only five states that do not allow families to opt out of that requirement for religious or philosophical objections. 
State law currently allows exemptions for only medical reasons. An executive order from Gov. Patrick Morrisey is at odds with the state’s school vaccine law, but he says the order is permissible under another law, the Equal Protection for Religion Act. A case at the heart of the debate is set to be reviewed by the West Virginia Supreme Court.
Last year, the Senate approved a bill that would have codified Morrisey’s executive order, but the House of Delegates ultimately rejected it. 
While some lawmakers have said they’d support or introduce bills that would put religious exemptions into state code or even get rid of the vaccine requirements altogether, the chair of the House of Delegates health committee told West Virginia Watch changing the school vaccine law is “not a priority” as the debate makes its way through the courts. Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, chair of the Senate Health Committee, said this session’s legislation should come from the House after delegates rejected last year’s bill. 
PEIA remains unstable
West Virginia state employees continue to face rising health care costs. The Public Employees Insurance Agency recently approved a 3% rate increase effective July 1 for state employees, local government workers and retirees who are on their health care plans. For state employees, a monthly spousal surcharge will increase by an average of $200 per month.
Last year, PEIA raised rates by 14% for state employees and by 16% for local government employees. Retirees also saw a 12% increase in premiums. 
The 2025 legislative session saw few PEIA-related bills. Morrisey last summer said he planned to call a special session to address the issues, but the session never materialized.

State employee pay raises as part of economic development
Morrisey has said his budget proposal will include raises for all state workers, but he’s not said how much. Morrisey told reporters he wants to work with state lawmakers on the proposal. 
“In my budget for fiscal year 2027, we will have a pay raise for state employees. Period,” Morrisey told reporters at a news conference Dec. 11. “That’s going to include teachers, that’s going to include school service personnel, that’s going to include our hard working state police and so many of the people — the correction officers — who are working hard every day to make West Virginia a better place to live, to work and to play.”
Republican leaders in the House of Delegates have proposed legislation that would increase pay for state teachers and school service personnel. 
State treasurer Larry Pack said he’s backing legislation that would have all teachers in the state making at least $50,000. Teachers who already make that amount should get a $2,000 raise, he said. 
House Republicans want to see more economic development overall 
At a news conference last month, Republicans in the state House of Delegates said they want to see economic development and job creation dominate their legislative agenda.
Specifics for the plan so far are relatively vague and they will likely remain that way until legislation is introduced showing details. The approach, House Speaker Roger Hanshaw said in December, will focus on three pillars: job training, workforce development and retention; investment in “job-creating businesses” and, lastly, practicing “responsible economic growth.”
Hanshaw said the state will see more resources put toward the aviation industry, both in manufacturing and operations. 
The House will also see the “Recharge West Virginia Act” introduced, which Hanshaw said will “support” local businesses in the state that increase their staffing.
Other legislation will be the TEAM-WV Act, an acronym meaning Technology, Energy, Aviation and Manufacturing. The act, Hanshaw said, is modeled under the same guiding principles of the nearby JobsOhio. In West Virginia, the potential bill would propose creating a “competitive, statewide” nonprofit to help form a more “cohesive” approach for developing sites for industry and growing partnerships between sectors.
Another attempt at Certificate of Need repeal 
For years, advocates and special interest groups have been lobbying the Legislature to repeal the state’s Certificate of Need process. Even after years of having a Republican supermajority control both chambers of the Legislature under Republican governors, they’ve been met with little luck.
Last year, that trend continued as legislation proposing to repeal the process again failed, this time laying bare a political power struggle largely between Morrisey and members of the House.
CON has been on West Virginia’s books since 1977. It’s a regulatory process, overseen by the West Virginia Health Care Authority, that requires entities looking to create or expand health care services to receive a legal document proving those new services fit an unmet need in the area.
Through the Health Care Authority, those interested in obtaining a CON receive technical assistance before applying to see what needs they are meeting. Services are approved through a needs methodology and different services — such as hospice care, ambulatory centers, clinics, private practices and specialty services — have different methodologies.
Morrisey announced during his first State of the State address last year that he wanted to see the entirety of this process repealed. He called it “big government activism at its worst” and said that repealing it would allow the state’s health care industry to “move toward the free market.”
But those who work in health care have been critical of removing CON laws as more than 75% of patients in West Virginia are government payers, meaning their health insurance comes from the Public Employees Insurance Agency, Medicare or Medicaid.

If CON is repealed, these critics say, there would be no guarantee facilities that come into the state would cater to these patients, as those programs reimburse less for services than private insurers.
Legislation to remove CON laws have been introduced annually for at least a decade. Most never gained traction. 
Last year, the legislation — HB 2007 — served as one of the first tests for Morrisey’s influence in the Legislature, and specifically among members of the House. Several lawmakers who held concerns about repealing the certificate of need process told members of the media, in interviews and elsewhere, that they did not appreciate the strategies employed by the governor and his staff while they attempted to whip votes in support of the legislation.
House Health voted down HB 2007 early last session, meaning it never went to the full House for consideration. While Del. Chris Anders, R-Berkeley, attempted to discharge the bill from the Health Committee and to the House floor for another vote later in session, he yet again failed as all but 16 members voted overwhelmingly to kill the legislation one last time.
It’s likely CON repeal in some form will again be up for consideration in the Legislature as it has been for the last decade. Specifics on the proposed policy, however, will only be clear once a bill is introduced.



There are several resources that can help the public stay on top of what happens at the Legislature every day and most can be found online at https://www.wvlegislature.gov/ Here are some quick tools you can use this legislative session:

Bill tracking: Using either the bill number, sponsor or keywords, you are able to search for bills that have been introduced during session and see where they are in the legislative process. This is a good way to see what bills have been introduced on certain topics or what issues certain lawmakers are tackling.
The Legislative Calendar outlines important days and deadlines to keep note of throughout the legislative session, including the last day to introduce new bills, when rulemaking should happen and more.
Bulletin Board: Checking this in the morning allows the public to access expected calendars for both the House and the Senate. Links to scheduled committee meetings are available for each chamber as well as the chamber calendars, which detail what bills are expected to come up throughout that day and where they are in the process.
WV Legislature Blog: Staff for the Legislature work each day to write brief blog reports showing what happened under the dome, from subcommittees to the chambers. This is a great way to stay up-to-date on some of the more policy-focused decisions made during session that may not always be covered by news outlets.
Activity Calendar: Over the 60 days, different organizations and groups will set up throughout the Capitol’s upper and lower rotunda hosting advocacy days. They are there to educate the public, meet with lawmakers and lobby for and against legislation to support their causes. The activity calendar lists what advocacy days are scheduled for 2026.
Contacting your legislator: Both the House and the Senate have complete lists of currently serving lawmakers on the Legislature’s website. These profiles include contact information for the lawmakers, their districts, what committees they serve on and bills they’ve sponsored so far in the session.

(Photo by Lora Wobbema/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s farmers are looking for higher profits but things may get worse before they get better, ag industry experts say. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture in December announced its Farmer Bridge Assistance, a payment program to help farmers survive what was a disastrous 2025 for many producers. 
North Dakota has set up its own loan programs to help farmers through economic hardship and to recover from storms that wiped out storage bins, making producers more dependent on short-term markets. 
Bank of North Dakota President Don Morgan said there is “prolonged stress” on the ag industry, and 2026 will likely not provide much relief when it comes to profits. 
He said the loans backed by the state-owned bank are not just meant to get farmers into 2026 but also into 2027. 
Morgan said the bank will help farmers with “as much as a working capital break as we can.” The bank is taking applications until June 30, 2026. 
The Bank of North Dakota allocated $37 million in loans to help rebuild grain storage and provide temporary storage. Another $300 million loan program aims to help farmers who lost money in 2024 and 2025. The bank also made available another $100 million in loans to help farmers pay for storing grain that has not been sold from the 2025 harvest. 
Bank of North Dakota commits $400 million ‘lifeline’ to ag producers

As of mid-December, the bank had funded more than 100 loans under those programs, with about 30 applications pending.
Looking at the big picture, Bryon Parman, agriculture finance specialist with North Dakota State University Extension, said the frequency of bailout programs for farmers raises concerns about deeper problems. 
“These ad hoc programs have started to become the rule more so than the exception,” Parman said. His comments came after the Trump administration announced the bridge payment program. 
“The fact that you need them over and over and over again, there’s some issues,” Parman said. 
Much of the blame for poor crop prices, especially in soybeans, has been blamed on the Trump administration’s trade war with China, a key market for North Dakota soybeans. 
But Parman said he saw signs of weakness in the ag economy even when farm revenue was high in 2022.  He said in that year, the rate of return on major assets and equity was relatively low to some previous boom years.
Parman said farmers are paying $10,000 and sometimes $20,000 an acre for land. 
But the land “doesn’t make all that much money, which, as an economist, doesn’t make any sense,” he said. 
Morgan said land values are being supported by large ag operations that are able to borrow more money, from out-of-state interests and the perception of scarcity. 
“They aren’t making any more of it,” Morgan said of farmland. 
Owning land that’s of high value does help a farmer’s balance sheet, Parman said, but high land values also make it hard for younger farmers to expand and be profitable doing it. 
Unlike drought years or other natural disasters, Parman said crop yields have been pretty good. 
“Prices have been an issue, but mainly they’ve been an issue because our costs are so high,” Parman. 
Federal ag payments address ‘crisis situation’ but trade still key, North Dakota groups say

Fertilizer prices are staying high in part because of competition for fertilizer from other parts of the world that are trying to improve their ag production, such as South America and India, Parman said. 
In addition, China, a major supplier of fertilizer, has been exporting less, he said.  
Mark Watne, who last year ended a 12-year run as president of the North Dakota Farmers Union, said he recently visited farms in Brazil and was impressed by their ability to increase production. 
Brazil’s advances in agriculture and soybean production have allowed it to fulfill much of China’s demand. That means China has become less reliant on soybeans from the United States. 
“Without even chopping down more rainforest, they can expand,” Watne said of Brazil  “So I think it’s worrisome. I think we may become more of a residual supplier (to China) than we really want to be.” 
One area of relief is declines in the prices of fuel and lubricants as well as lower interest rates, but are not enough to offset the increases in other categories. 
“Most major crops will see a cost increase of between 1.5% and 2% from 2025-2026,” Parman wrote in a November article published by NDSU  “While this would not be considered a large increase, given current crop prices, any increase at all will be difficult to absorb financially for many producers.”

(Photo: Benjamin Pounds for Tennessee Lookout)Seventeen years have passed since a massive rupture at a Tennessee Valley Authority plant spilled more than 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash into Harriman, Tenn., but the event is still raw in Jessica Waller’s mind.
Waller’s father, Ernest Hickman, a union contractor for Jacobs Engineering Group, worked on cleanup of the spill.
Hickman died of emphysema, which Waller attributes to his contact with the ash over a six-year cleanup period — specifically beryllium, a naturally occurring metal used in the nuclear, automotive and aerospace industries, and arsenic, which is used in metal, technology and some medical uses. 
Both are present in coal fly ash and are highly toxic.
She believes her mother, Patsy Hickman, also got ill from exposure after washing her husband’s clothes and other activities putting her in contact with the ash, causing her death of respiratory failure.

“It’s sad to know there’s a lot of people even here in Tennessee in the area who have no idea about the coal ash spill,” Waller said. “Or they do but they didn’t know the extent of the devastation that it caused, especially health-wise of making so many people sick.” 
Lunches on the coal ash
A dike at the Kingston Fossil Plant broke on the morning of Dec. 22, 2008, releasing 5.4 million cubic yards, or 1.1 billion gallons, of wet ash stored in the pond behind it. 
The ash, a byproduct of burning coal, spilled as sludge into the Swan Pond Embayment and Emory River and covered 300 acres, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Ernest Hickman was one of the first workers cleaning up the site, just one or two days after the spill. Hickman, Waller said, first worked in the spilled ash sludge keeping pumps running to suck it up. Later he shoveled it around to different locations including rail cars. His last month there was in April 2014 when the spill material “finally got from the mush to dust,” Waller said.
Coal ash contains 26 toxins including ones that cause cancer, are heavy metals or are radioactive. The workers’ training materials mentioned risks from arsenic and silica but not other risks from other materials like lead, cobalt, uranium, radium, lithium or molybdenum.
Waller said Jacobs didn’t allow respirators or masks and gave false information.
“(Workers) were told that you could eat a pound of it a day and it not even hurt you,” she said. 
TVA footed the bill for workers to have luncheons at tables underneath tents “right on the coal ash.” Wind, Waller said, blew the dust around, getting it in their food and drink.
“That’s because they trusted them,” she said of why the workers ate at these lunches. “And that trust was broken.”
“He would come home with his nose full of white stuff,” Waller said of her father during the ash cleanup. “He’d be coughing up black stuff.”
Jacobs Engineering settles Kingston coal ash case

Both of her parents, Waller said, started developing respiratory illnesses in the years after the cleanup, followed by her mother’s cardiovascular issues. She said her mother fell ill in 2014 and her father in 2016 and that their symptoms such as mini strokes “mimicked each other.”
“They got to where they couldn’t walk,” she said. “They couldn’t talk.” 
She got her father a sippy cup so that he could still enjoy Pepsi.
Ernest Hickman began “falling all the time.” Waller quit her job and delayed going back to school to be a licensed practical nurse to focus on caring for her parents instead. 
Ernest Hickman died on Dec. 4, 2016, and Patsy Hickman on Sept. 19, 2018. They were in their 50s; other Jacobs workers who died were younger.
“Question everything.”
“This was all covered in the ash,” she said in December, pointing to soccer fields near a historic marker in Swan Pond Sports Complex at the former spill site. 
Close to the 17th  anniversary, Waller placed her parents’ portraits next to another nearby monument, a cross meant to represent those including her parents, killed by toxins.
She is still worried about contaminants still in nearby bodies of water, and her grief flares near the holidays.
“I do have a hard time with Thanksgiving and Christmas,” Waller said. She still decorates a tree on Nov. 1 like her mother, whose favorite holiday was Christmas, did.
She remembers her father making drawings using his computer’s “basic paint program,” including one that included an image of the Earth describing Jacobs and another company, Bechtel, as doing “environmental cleanup around the globe.”

Waller didn’t conclude the ash was a cause for her parents’ illness until after her mother’s death. Then she went on a “binge” of research on ash toxins. She connected with Janie Clark, whose husband had worked on the spill cleanup and died. 
Waller met more spill workers and their families through a Facebook group. She compared her parents’ experience to that of others and then checked with doctors who’d treated other workers.
She said she got compensation from a lawsuit filed against Jacobs, settled in 2018 — Jacobs appealed the decision until 2023 — although she said the plaintiffs were “let down” by how long it took. Since then she’s told her story as a way to handle her grief he’s told her story for two years which she said helped her handle her grief for her parents and anger at TVA and Jacobs.
Waller said she hoped people could learn to be more skeptical of people in power and big corporations.
“Question everything,” she said, adding she likes to get second opinions in her nursing work.
Coal ash, she said, despite current talk of reviving the coal industry,  is “definitely not safe” and that moving it around will “contaminate everywhere.” 
She and Clark talk at least once per week.
“Nobody understands the type of grief that we are dealing with,” she said of herself and Clark. “We were the ones that witnessed the suffering.”

(Photo by Chad Riley/Getty Images)Idaho’s endowment forests are often the subject of passionate public conversation, and that is a good thing. These lands support Idaho’s public schools and other institutions and are managed – by Idahoans – with care and scientific rigor. 
Who benefits from the state’s school endowment fund? Idaho students or the forest products industry?

A recent op-ed about Priest Lake includes several misconceptions about how the Idaho Department of Lands (IDL) and the State Board of Land Commissioners (Land Board) manage these trust lands. As stewards of Idaho’s endowment lands, we want to set the record straight. 
The endowment assets are managed as a unified trust with the Endowment Fund Investment Board managing the financial assets and Idaho Department of Lands managing and protecting the land assets. Both entities are under the supervision of the Land Board. 
 MYTH: Idaho Department of Lands is clear-cutting “senescent forests” and converting them into tree farms.

FACT: The term senescent forest refers to stands in a state of biological decline. IDL does not manage endowment forests to reach senescence. As a trust land manager, IDL maintains forests in productive, healthy, actively growing conditions to ensure long-term revenue and ecological resilience. Regeneration harvests, including clearcuts in appropriate locations, are recognized, science-based silvicultural tools that help restore young, vigorous stands while protecting soils, water quality, and wildlife habitat for the long-term.
IDL is not converting forests into “tree farms.” Our forests are managed for long-term sustainability, ecological function, and consistent revenue for beneficiaries. 
 MYTH: Idaho Department of Lands has adopted a blanket 40–45 year timber rotation, similar to timber management on the West Coast.

FACT: This is an oversimplification. While IDL does use the Forest Projection System (FPS, developed by the Forest Biometric Research Institute) as one of several tools for forest growth modeling, rotation ages are set based on site productivity and inventory data from field measurements and LiDAR analysis, not an arbitrary timeframe.
In Idaho’s diverse landscape, high-productivity sites may reach commercial maturity in around 35 years. Others may require 85 years or more.
Most endowment forest stands fall somewhere between.
Rotation age is determined by site-specific biological growth, sustainability modeling, and long-term revenue considerations — not by a single statewide target.  
 MYTH: Timber harvests on endowment land are not sustainable or cannot support long-term revenue.

FACT: Sustainability is built into the trust mandate. Idaho’s endowment forests are managed under a sustained yield framework, ensuring that harvest levels remain stable over time, forest health is maintained, and timber revenues continue for future generations of beneficiaries.
Many Priest Lake stands are harvested after reaching maturity following timber harvests or stand replacing wildfires from decades ago.
 MYTH: Revenue from endowment lands is only intended for public schools, and contributions are “token.”

FACT: Public schools are the largest beneficiary, but not the only one. By law and by trust structure, endowment lands support:

Public schools
Agricultural College
Charitable Institutions
Normal School
Penitentiary
School of Science
State Hospital South
University of Idaho
Capitol Permanent Fund

Endowment lands and funds form a unified trust corpus, established by the United States at statehood. The state of Idaho — through the Land Board as trustee — has a fiduciary responsibility to manage these assets for all named beneficiaries.
Revenue from timber currently represents over 90% of annual income from land management, but Idaho’s endowment also includes 1.5 million acres of other revenue-producing lands and a highly diversified investment portfolio managed by the Endowment Fund Investment Board (EFIB).
The fund’s performance is among the strongest and most transparent public land trusts in the country.
 MYTH: Idaho Department of Lands is “putting all its eggs in one basket” by relying on timber and acquiring additional timberlands.

FACT: This characterization misrepresents Idaho’s trust structure and investment strategy.
The land portfolio is increasingly diversified through commercial leasing, land exchanges, strategic acquisitions and limited dispositions.
EFIB manages a diverse, high-performing financial fund that mirrors private-sector best practices
Timberland acquisitions are guided by long-term expected returns, not short-term conditions.
Idaho’s combined land and financial assets form one of the nation’s most disciplined, well-managed trust systems.
Land dispositions over the last decade have produced approximately $330 million dollars. Of this, about $100 million has been reinvested in 54,000 acres of productive timberland, $144 million reinvested in financial assets, and $85 million available in the Land Bank which can be used to purchase more profitable lands or transferred to the financial asset. 
 MYTH: Engineered wood products will replace traditional timber markets, making Idaho’s forests less valuable.

FACT: Engineered wood products still require high-quality fiber, something Idaho’s managed forests are well-suited to produce. Traditional lumber and engineered wood rely on different grades and types of timber, and IDL forests contribute to both markets. These evolving markets strengthen, not diminish, the economic value of managed forests.
 MYTH: Idaho Department of Lands logging is the primary driver of soil erosion and phosphorus levels in Priest Lake tributaries.

FACT: This conclusion is not supported by comprehensive landscape evidence.
The area around Priest Lake has seen substantial residential development, which also influences nutrient loads and water quality.
Historic U.S. Forest Service management up through the 1970s–’80s involved intensive harvests visible in Google Earth time-lapse imagery — activity that predates current conditions.
IDL applies stringent best management practices, stream buffers, and slope protections based on Idaho’s unique soils and terrain, meeting or exceeding Forest Practices Act requirements.
Any evaluation of phosphorus or sediment trends requires watershed-scale analysis that accounts for all land uses, not just selective interpretation of a single tributary.
In conclusion, Idaho’s endowment lands exist to provide permanent, long-term support for Idaho’s public institutions. IDL’s management is built on science, sustainability, transparency, and constitutional fiduciary duty. The challenges facing these forests — wildfire risk, changing markets, population growth, and ecological stress — require thoughtful, strategic stewardship. 
That is exactly what IDL is committed to delivering.

(Photo courtesy of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library)Federal policies on health care and trade are likely to continue to color North Dakota’s biggest government stories in 2026. Congress and the Trump administration are spending money in an attempt to help the rural health care system and farm economy to offset cuts to Medicaid and declining ag commodity prices.
It’s also an election year, featuring ballot measures and a U.S. House race in North Dakota. And the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library plans its grand opening in conjunction with the nation’s milestone 250th anniversary.  
Special session
Gov. Kelly Armstrong has set Jan. 21 as the date for a special legislative session to allocate federal rural health funding that was part of what Republicans called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in 2025.
North Dakota was awarded $199 million after applying for its share of the federal funding. One North Dakota policy change prompted by the competition for federal funding was prohibiting the use of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to buy candy and junk food. The new restrictions are expected to be implemented by September 2026. 
North Dakota receives $199 million in federal grant for rural health care

North Dakota’s application for funds from the Rural Health Transformation Program focused on four areas: workforce; preventive care and healthy eating; bringing high-quality health care closer to home; and improving health care technology.
Once lawmakers gather at the Capitol, they could propose bills addressing other issues. But legislative leaders have said they plan to limit the scope of the session, and rules require that a two-thirds majority in each chamber must agree that the topic should be considered.
Election
North Dakota’s only U.S. House seat and a potential statewide vote on making school meals free for students are likely to be the top races in 2026, but there are many more. More than half of the Legislature’s seats are up for election, and there are local races for seats on school boards, judgeships and other positions. 
U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, a Republican in her first term, plans to run for reelection and has already received President Donald Trump’s endorsement. Republican Alex Balazs, who came in fourth out of five candidates in the 2024 primary but received the state party endorsement, has announced plans to challenge Fedorchak.

Other statewide offices  — all held by Republicans — on the 2026 ballot are secretary of state, attorney general, agriculture commissioner, tax commissioner and two seats on the Public Service Commission. 
The statewide nonpartisan offices up for election are the Superintendent of Public Instruction and two seats on the state Supreme Court.
In the Legislature, odd-numbered districts are on the ballot and two even-numbered districts, 26 and 42, have elections for House seats. The primary is June 9.
North Dakotans may be voting on state funding for school breakfasts and lunches, something the 2025 Legislature voted down. Organizers still need to turn in signatures to get the issue on the general election ballot. 
Voters will consider during the primary election a ballot measure to require all proposed amendments to the state constitution to comprise a single subject. 
The Legislature also approved putting two measures on the 2026 general election ballot. Measure 1 proposes to make changes to term limits voters approved in 2022. The measure would allow lawmakers to serve up to 16 years in one chamber and clarifies that a partial term does not count toward the limit. Measure 2 would require that 60% of voters approve a measure instead of a simple majority. 
Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library
The grand opening of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library is set for July 4 in Medora, coinciding with the 250th birthday of the United States.
All living presidents are invited to the grand opening, said Matt Briney, spokesperson for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation. However, they may not attend on the opening weekend and instead arrange a time to see the library before the year ends. 
President Trump has not confirmed whether he will attend the library opening, Briney said. July 1 is highlighted on a national calendar of 250th events to celebrate the library’s grand opening.
Members of Theodore Roosevelt’s family are planning to camp in the area during the opening weekend, and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who is also a library foundation board member, plans on attending the library opening, according to Briney. Among public officials expected to attend is Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who championed the library project as North Dakota governor.
The state has high hopes for attracting more tourists to the town of fewer than 200 people with the museum dedicated to Roosevelt, who ranched in the Badlands before becoming revered as one of America’s greatest presidents.  
Energy 
As the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, North Dakota relies on oil and gas taxes for more than half of its revenue. Production has held relatively steady, though the price of oil is struggling to stay above the level forecast by the state. 
North Dakota oil production resilient even as prices have declined

Industry observers will be watching to see if a couple of carbon dioxide gas sequestration projects — Minnkota Power’s Project Tundra and the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline — will move forward. 
Sequestration is permanent underground storage of the greenhouse gas. Minnkota would sequester CO2 from a coal-fired power plant while Summit would gather CO2 from ethanol plants in five states, including one in North Dakota. While in the works for years, construction has not started on either project. Summit, which has faced regulatory challenges, has indicated the possibility of changing the pipeline route, but also has said a North Dakota storage area “remains an important long-term asset for the project.” 
Meanwhile, hearings on a controversial high-voltage transmission line are coming up in January. There is high interest in a pipeline to bring natural gas from western North Dakota to the east, though construction won’t start until 2028. There could also be headwinds for wind and solar energy as the Trump administration cuts incentives for green energy projects. 
Potential efforts to extract critical minerals from coal, lawmakers’ study of nuclear energy’s feasibility in the state and the ongoing discussion surrounding data centers are also likely to be major energy topics in 2026.
Agriculture 
The farm economy took a beating in 2025, and 2026 isn’t looking so good, either. A major factor will be export markets. China has been a key importer of North Dakota soybeans in years past but did little buying in 2025. 
Depressed prices for soybeans and other crops coaxed the Trump administration into aid payments for farmers, which should arrive in February. Former North Dakota Farmers Union leader Mark Watne questioned whether those payments would be enough to keep farmers afloat.
Construction will continue in 2026 on two giant milking operations for Minnesota-based Riverview in the Red River Valley. There is a lawsuit pending against the state for its permitting of the Herberg Dairy near Hillsboro and other legal challenges to the Abercrombie Dairy north of Wahpeton. 
Beef production was the bright spot for North Dakota agriculture in 2025, and despite some ups and downs, could be again in 2026 as consumer demand remains strong despite higher prices.

I’ve lost track of the number of lawsuits filed to force the federal government to do what it is legally required to do. Political violence is at an all-time high. And the animosity across the aisle continues to grow, even though lawmakers of different backgrounds, communities and ideologies have more in common than they think. Division and otherization have become the norm.
Unfortunately, the word unprecedented has been used so often that it feels less like something new or never done before and more like Tuesday.
I think it’s finally time to retire “unprecedented.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Now, don’t get me wrong—I’m not harkening back to the “good ol’ days.” As someone who has spent their entire career in and around Lansing politics, I know that the secrecy, political jabs, lack of transparent information and lack of communication are nothing new. I know that the policy process is slow, and long legislative session days occurred even under single-party control. And not everything that happened this year was bad. We saw historic investments in school funding targeted to Michigan students who need it the most and support for 100,000 babies born over the next three years, helping them start off strong. We saw compromise, as members across the aisle and across the chambers worked together to improve policy and mitigate harm. 
But the good was vastly overshadowed by the onslaught of “unprecedented acts”.
So as we turn to 2026, we have a few resolutions that we think policymakers in Lansing should adopt.
First and foremost, mitigate the harm. Hundreds of thousands of Michiganders stand to lose health care coverage and food assistance due to the cuts included in the harmful federal megabill passed earlier this year. Even more will fall through the cracks due to complex federal rules and regulations and confusing paperwork. To be clear, these cuts do not mean savings for the states—they mean job losses, provider closures and higher food and health care costs for all 10 million Michiganders of every age, of all incomes and in every part of the state. The state must do what it can administratively and through budget decisions to reduce the negative impacts to the extent possible.
Get a balanced and equitable budget done on time. Families all over the state are struggling with the high cost of housing, groceries, utilities and child care. Michiganders deserve to see a doctor, put food on their tables, safely send their children to schools and reach toward economic security. School districts and local governments need to plan what services they’ll be able to continue providing. Our state budget is a moral document, and it needs to prioritize meaningful investments in Michigan’s people at a time when they need it most.
Pass evidence-based, data-backed, people-centered policies. As an organization rooted in data, we follow the numbers to determine whether our policy decisions are moving the needle on outcomes for Michiganders. We are also an organization that is informed by the community, and we know that ensuring the voices of those who will be most affected by policy change and budget decisions is a vital part of the policy-making process that is often missing. Consistent policies combined with sustained investments in what we know works are necessary in order to improve outcomes for Michigan’s kids, families and workers.
The Michigan League for Public Policy has been around since 1912. In that time, we’ve weathered economic ups and downs and shifted with political swings, but we’ve remained steadfast in our dedication to the issues Michiganders value most. Instead of policy decisions that divide us, we should be centering our family, friends, colleagues and neighbors in these conversations. And that would be truly “unprecedented.”

(Photo: NC Newsline)For nearly a quarter century, when debates over voting laws, gerrymandering, or money in politics enveloped North Carolina, Bob Phillips has been in the thick of them. That era ends this month, when Phillips retires from day-to-day advocacy work. 
As the leader of Common Cause North Carolina since 2001, Phillips has helped to shape anti-corruption laws and organize support for voting rights. He has worked with other groups like the League of Women Voters, Democracy NC, and the North Carolina NAACP to remove obstacles to voting, increase government transparency, and try to overturn election districts they argued were unfair.  
Phillips has been a constant presence in the Legislative Building, in courtrooms, and at rallies. And during his tenure, Common Cause NC has gone from a small, nearly invisible operation to an organization with statewide reach. 
Last January,  an online town hall Common Cause sponsored about Judge Jefferson Griffin’s efforts to throw out more than 60,000 votes in his race for a seat on the state Supreme Court drew more than 600 participants from around the state. Thousands of people gathered in the cold to attend its rallies to protest trashing votes in that close race. 
Phillips, with his typical modesty, doesn’t take credit for the group’s rising profile. He credits the organizers Common Cause has across the state and in the office with deepening the grassroots and making concrete what can be heady topics. 
“We still have a presence at the legislature in lobbying the decision-makers, but we’ve also invested a lot in organizers,” he said. “That’s probably the secret sauce in connecting people.”
Common Cause President and CEO Virginia Kase Solomón said Phillips has built a talented team in North Carolina and an atmosphere where they can do their best work. 
“Whether you’re a volunteer or a staff person, he figures out what your superpower is, then he lets you go and run with it. He’ll put you forward,” Solomón said. 
Mitchell Brown worked with Common Cause NC when he was a student at A&T State University in Greensboro in an effort to increase student turnout for the 2010 elections. He credits that work with his interest in voting rights. Brown went on to attend law school at NYU and is now senior voting rights counsel at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. 
“Bob is a very important reason why I’m a voting rights attorney today,” he said. 
When Phillips came to Common Cause after years as a reporter and then as spokesman for former Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker, he already had deeper knowledge than most about how the legislature works. He says partisan politics were not as toxic as today. 
Politics in North Carolina has undergone a tremendous shift in the last 25 years. Republicans have taken firm control of the legislature and have enacted laws such as voter ID, which the organization opposed. 
“It has changed dramatically,” Phillips said.  “I jokingly say sometimes the worst day I had in the first 10 years on the job would maybe be the best day today.”

And it’s hard to win a gerrymandering lawsuit these days. State and federal courts say it’s not their job to referee partisan redistricting. 
In fact, Common Cause North Carolina is etched in legal redistricting history. It was a case that went to the U.S .Supreme Court, Rucho v. Common Cause, that resulted in the court saying it would not consider complaints over partisan redistricting. The “Rucho” in the case is former state Sen. Bob Rucho, who now sits on the North Carolina Board of Elections. 
Still, Phillips looks back on some significant wins. 
He counts same-day registration, which allows people to register and vote on the same day during the early voting period, as a victory the organization helped secure. North Carolina passed same-day registration in 2007, the first southern state to do so. 
Though Common Cause NC is nonpartisan, Republicans deride it as built to aid Democrats. It’s true that Common Cause has sued Republican leaders many times in recent years over redistricting plans. Leading Republicans, including House Speaker Destin Hall, ridicule the strategy as ‘sue until blue.”
However, Phillips said its positions are centered on principles, not partisan politics. 
For example, Common Cause NC helped push campaign finance and lobbying laws through the legislature in the mid-2000s despite initial opposition from Democratic House leadership, Phillips recalled. Democratic House Speaker Jim Black was under investigation for accepting illegal campaign contributions, and the measures were inspired by reports of his activities. Black was later indicted and sentenced to prison. 
Though its push to have an independent group draw election district lines is now seen as a Democratic issue, it’s something Republicans wanted when Democrats were in control, Phillips recalls. 
Back in 2007, Republicans, then in the minority, sponsored bills to create an independent redistricting commission. Among the sponsors were current Senate Leader Phil Berger, a Rockingham County Republican, and former state Reps. Tim Moore and Thom Tillis, who went on to serve as House Speakers. 
Democrats in the legislature buried those bills. 
Independent redistricting is all but dead in North Carolina today, and after a series of friendly rulings by conservative courts, Republicans are exercising their considerable freedom to draw districts for partisan advantage. 
It wasn’t that long ago that the declaration from a former House Republican redistricting leader that a congressional plan had 10 Republican seats and 3 Democratic seats only because they couldn’t figure out how to draw an 11-2 map drew gasps and made headlines. 
Now, partisan advantage is a clearly declared goal. 
“They were just blatantly open about it,” Phillips said. 
Phillips says Republicans are disguising racial gerrymandering, which is still illegal, as partisan gerrymandering, which the Rucho decision allows.
Common Cause NC lost a federal lawsuit over legislative and congressional districts this year. It and other plaintiffs claimed new lines are racial gerrymanders, while Republicans asserted they used no racial data to create the new districts. 
“Unfortunately, we’re at a time where many of the courts buy that,” Phillips said. 
After Phillips returns from a long vacation, Solomón has asked him to come back to an advisory role for the national organization.  
“”He’s someone whose advice and wisdom and strategic thought-leadership and knowledge base I was dreading the idea of losing,” she said. 
Phillips said he has tried, and he hopes Common Cause will continue, to help promote civility in elections. 
“Everybody wants to see our elections being more civil affairs than they are,” he said. “Can we suddenly, with a coalition, make that happen? Probably not. But we can get more people thinking about what’s needed in holding the folks that are running for office accountable.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BobPhillips_redis-featured.jpg,,,2026-01-05 06:12:12.123764

According to the report – which is entitled “Who Owns America,” nearly 9% of residential parcels in 500 U.S. counties are owned by a corporation and the concentrations exceed 20% in some cities. What’s more, the trend is expanding rapidly, and it’s further complicating the already deeply challenging housing market for first-time buyers. And in December to learn more about the report and the housing market challenges it helps to highlight, we caught up with the national housing reporter for the news outlet, Stateline, Robbie Sequeira.

Because the Capitol is closed and vacated for a $300 million multi-year renovation, the House and Senate will meet in a temporary building that was constructed next to the Capitol Annex. 
Other state offices, including the governor’s and Supreme Court’s, have been moved elsewhere in Frankfort. 
Public will be on the outside as Kentucky legislature convenes in temporary quarters

The temporary legislative chambers have no in-person accommodations for the public. Some open government advocates have raised concerns about the lack of public galleries, saying it could distance Kentuckians from the proceedings. However, Republican legislative leaders said building galleries would have been too costly an addition for a temporary structure. 
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear voiced criticism of the lack of galleries in mid-December when asked about plans for an alternative rotunda space. In the Capitol, citizens and officials often gathered in the rotunda for rallies and other events. 
The governor said the Capitol Education Center, a visitors center, had been “altered to try to create the largest meeting space possible” as an alternative to the rotunda. The center sits atop the parking structure next to the Capitol Annex. 
“So, this meeting space will be close by, we believe will be safe, and is the best alternative that we have, Beshear said. 
As for the lack of galleries in the House and Senate chambers, Beshear said, “You could have put in bleachers. You could have put in just extra seating areas, simply by moving a wall back in some area, but that wasn’t included in their design.”
Also different this year, Beshear will deliver his State of the Commonwealth Address Wednesday at the Thomas D. Clark Center for Kentucky History in Frankfort. The speech before a joint session of the House and Senate has traditionally been delivered in the House chamber of the Capitol.
Who can enter temporary chambers?
Answering questions via email, Legislative Research Commission (LRC) spokesperson Mike Wynn said that legislators, legislative staff and credentialed reporters will have access to the temporary chambers. Lobbyists will not.
Wynn added that a few Annex committee rooms — rooms 149, 154, 169 and 171 — will be open to the public as viewing rooms while lawmakers are in session in the next building. The rooms will have live video feeds of the proceedings in the House and Senate. 
“Anyone wishing to access the temporary chambers must enter through the Annex and use the walkway that connects the Annex to the temporary chambers,” Wynn said. “The main entrance of the temporary chambers is located next to the Rose Garden.”

People with an LRC-issued badge can enter the Annex via the front doors or the tunnel that connects the annex to the parking garage, Wynn said. People with disabilities may use an ADA entrance at the rear, southeast corner of the Annex. On busy days, LRC may activate the front doors near the Floral Clock on the west end of the building. 
The temporary structure is connected to the Annex by a walkway. Security officers will be at each end of the walkway, inside the doors, Wynn said. Lawmakers have offices in the Annex.
Wynn told the Lantern that those wanting to reserve an Annex committee room for an event, like an advocacy group, should follow buildings on the LRC’s website. The Finance and Administration Cabinet will still oversee requests for events on the Capitol’s campus, he added.
Also missing from the 2026 session will be some student pages. The General Assembly will not host its day page program, Wynn said. Students from across the state participate in the program, visiting the Capitol and their lawmakers for a day while learning about the legislative process. 
“The General Assembly will continue to offer a constitutional page program, and the House will offer opportunities for students to participate in the legislative process through House Standing Committees,” Wynn said. 
Full-time pages are high school students, typically juniors and seniors, who serve throughout the entire legislative session. 
New addresses for constitutional officers
As for Kentucky’s other branches of government, the judicial and executive branches have also moved out of the Capitol during the renovation and to temporary offices in Frankfort. 
The Kentucky Supreme Court is at 669 Chamberlin Avenue. Additionally, the Supreme Court Clerk’s Office and the State Law Library are on Chamberlin Avenue. 
Beshear and his staff are in the Old Governor’s Mansion and State Office Building on High Street in downtown Frankfort. Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman’s office is at Berry Hill Mansion.
Republicans Attorney General Russell Coleman and Secretary of State Michael Adams are neighbors. The AG’s office is at 1024 Capital Center Drive, while the secretary’s office is at 1025 Capital Center Drive.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Boosting Rhode Island’s share of funding to K-12 public schools could relieve some pressure on municipal property taxes, according to a commission calling for an overhaul of the state allocation to local school districts.
The group convened by the Rhode Island Foundation found the state only covers about 38% of K-12 education spending, an amount Foundation CEO and President David Cicilline called “really low” when compared to other states.      
“If we don’t get this right and ensure that every student in Rhode Island has access to a high-quality public education to prepare them for a pathway into either higher education or a career, the future of our state is really in jeopardy,” said Cicilline, a former U.S. representative and Providence mayor at a December press briefing ahead of the report’s release.  
The foundation’s Blue Ribbon Commission released recommendations in a report Monday, proposing that the state redo what constitutes “full funding” for municipal school districts, by incorporating costs such as transportation and teacher pensions into the state’s funding model. In addition, towns and cities would also have a clearer idea of their own fiscal obligations to their schools. 
“I think most states are moving towards a system where the state assumes greater responsibility,” Cicilline said, partially because poorer communities often have a harder time generating the revenue needed to effectively fund their schools.     
The commission suggested that a 58% state share would result in an increase of about $600 million a year in education spending.
Under the proposed changes, the total “foundation cost” of K-12 education, as the commission labels it, would be about $2.9 billion. State spending would rise from roughly $1.57 billion to $2.16 billion and the municipal share would fall from about $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion.

The 63-page report is the product of the Blue Ribbon Commission, which was established in December 2024 and co-chaired by Cicilline and Nora E. Gordon, a Georgetown University professor of public policy. The commission’s members included superintendents, union leaders, advocates, charter and public school officials, plus a youth working group of Rhode Island students. Brown University’s Annenberg Institute served as research partner and facilitator and prepared the final report. 
The commission’s four big recommendations are meant to work in tandem and would need to be pursued as a complete set of reforms, rather than a piecemeal approach.

Edit the funding formula so that the state covers a much wider range of K-12 costs, rather than focusing too much on instructional costs.
Tweak the formula’s weights to determine how different students’ needs are served, such as students with disabilities, multilingual learners, and students with economic disadvantages.  
Require municipalities to have a minimum local contribution to their schools, based on the town or city’s property wealth, rather than the current suggested share.
More requirements for transparency in local school finances. The report notes: “Dollars come to districts regardless of how the district has spent past dollars, what student outcomes it is achieving with those dollars, or how transparent they are about the use of funds.” 

“What is occurring right now is that we have some students in the state of Rhode Island with a full bucket who are fully funded, and we have some students who are not,” said Brenda Santos, Annenberg Institute director of Rhode Island research partnerships and networks.
The commission also sketched an alternative wherein the state would maintain its approximate 38% share of local education funding, while still retooling the formula itself. In this scheme, municipalities would pay about $300 million more if all districts were to be fully funded.
Cicilline said lawmakers could write the new formula into law without immediately increasing the state’s overall K-12 spending. The state could phase in a higher share over several years, he suggested, as the budget allows. 
An aging formula for state aid 
The state’s current funding formula was first crafted by lawmakers in 2010 and instituted the following school year. As a recent legislative summary phrases it, “The core principle behind the formula is that state funding should follow the student; therefore, the distribution of state funds changes annually based on shifts in enrollment.”
In the commission’s view, however, not enough money follows students. The present formula’s “core instructional amount” provides municipal funding largely for teacher salaries and direct classroom costs. So that “core” amount, Santos and Cicilline told reporters at the December briefing, often ends up inadequate. 
Santos offered the example of in-district transportation costs as something that shocked the youth working group, who were flabbergasted that the state does not subsidize busing for public school students. 
“You cannot educate a child that’s not in the building, “ Santos said.
The commission also took mathematical umbrage with how the current formula combines child poverty rates and property assessment values in its calculations. It noted Rhode Island is the only state to crunch the numbers in this specific way, can lead to uneven funding in places where high property values coexist alongside high child poverty. 
The commission suggests relying solely on the property tax base to reflect a more accurate minimum contribution. The report’s third recommendation — to mandate a local minimum share of education funding — is meant to curb towns and cities whose local contributions have stagnated even as state aid and property values have increased. 










You cannot educate a child that’s not in the building.


– d Brenda Santos, Annenberg Institute director of Rhode Island research partnerships and networks


Santos said the revised calculation is a way to ensure “every single city in town is paying the same rate under this proposed system.” 
“So no one is a winner, no one is a loser,” Santos said. “There are no advantages for any district or any city or town like there are under the current system.”
She gave the example of Portsmouth, which currently gets about $3 million in state formula aid that would disappear under the new model. But the new model would also provide about $5 million for costs Portsmouth is paying locally, so the town would be about $2 million better off overall.
Pensions past and future
Pursuing either the 58% or 38% funding scenario would funnel state money in the following ways:

In-district transportation, school safety, career and technical education (CTE) costs, building maintenance, and early childhood screening are not included in the current funding formula and are kept afloat by municipal expenditures. The Commission recommends the state contribute to these costs.
The state already splits with municipalities the payments for out-of-district transportation, certain special education expenses, and the pensions of teachers who are already retired. The commission recommends that the state absorb these costs in full.

Right now, both current and retired teacher pensions sit outside the formula and are split 40/60 between state and local funds. The commission thinks that the future pensions of current teachers should be absorbed into the core funding amount like any salary cost, while the state should shoulder alone the pension liability for already retired teachers, “a cost completely unassociated with current students who are in school,” Santos said.   
The pension ask would eventually subside on the retiree side. In recent and upcoming fiscal years, the state has paid over $400 million for retired teachers’ pensions, but Santos said that state actuaries calculate that by 2036, the liability will fall sharply because of how the current benefit plan is structured.

State officials and legislative leaders were briefed on the commission’s report ahead of its release, and its recommendations are likely to become a topic of discussion at the State House when the legislative session begins anew in January.     
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said over a recent email that state representatives “look forward to carefully reviewing the report during our upcoming legislative session.” 
“A strong educational system is essential in making sure our students are well prepared for the rapidly-changing 21st century economy and is a critical component of our state’s future prosperity,” Shekarchi said.    
Senate President Valarie Lawson, also who serves as the president of the teachers’ union the National Education Association Rhode Island, is still reviewing the final document, according to spokesperson Greg Paré.
Paré said the commission “raises important issues” the Senate will soon explore this legislative session, and he added that the entire Senate is scheduled to receive a presentation on the report from the Foundation on Jan. 15. 
Gov. Dan McKee said in a an email that his administration “will carefully review their recommendations as we work with education leaders, the General Assembly, and communities to ensure our funding system is fair, transparent, and aligned with student success.”

(University of Kentucky photo)If you smoke and want to quit, call the national quit line at 1-800-784-8669 to speak with a confidential coach. 
In what could be a “game changer” someday for Kentuckians with small cell lung cancer, the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center has treated the first patient in the country with a novel drug currently in the early stages of human trials. 
Markey is the first site to open a U.S. trial for ZG006 (Alveltamig), which has three “arms” (trispecific) to grab cancer cells and connect them to T cells, a type of white blood cells that are key in fighting pathogens and disease. 
It has the potential to give years of life back to small cell cancer patients, for whom other therapies have been ineffective in many ways — only about 40% of patients responded to tarlatamab, an immunotherapy with two “arms” (bispecific), for example. 
Dr. ​​Zhonglin Hao, a professor of medicine and the co-leader of Markey Cancer Center’s thoracic oncology program, said small cell lung cancer usually occurs in patients with a history of smoking, with the exception of a “very small proportion.” 
This population typically undergoes treatments that are on the market right now, but their cancer often comes back.  
“When they recur, that’s when we need more options,” Hao said. He described the three-arm therapeutic approach like this: “When they are dragged together, the lymphocytes can kill the cancer cell.” This can extend and save lives, he said. 
His trial will enroll three dozen patients over the next few years. To qualify, patients need to have extensive stage or limited stage small cell lung cancer and need to have experienced a recurrence of their cancer after receiving first line chemotherapy, Hao said. Patients in the trial receive the therapy via infusion in a hospital setting every two weeks.  
Hao’s team treated the first patient in the trial in late October. That patient “has tolerated it well without any appreciable side effects,” he said. 
If this trial proves “promising,” Hao said, he will launch a second tier trial and be able to “take a larger number of patients, in terms of hundreds of patients.”  
Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in Kentucky, despite its robust screening system. Kentucky has the second-highest rate of smoking in the nation — behind only West Virginia. 
In 2022, 17% of adult Kentuckians smoked, significantly higher than the national rate of 11%. The rate of new lung cancer cases, too, is higher than the national average — 84.1 per 100,000 people in Kentucky compared with nearly 52.8 per 100,000 nationally, according to the American Lung Association’s State of Lung Cancer. 
“Everybody will be tickled if we can make the bispecific, trispecific work for more people,” Hao said. “Our goal … is to cure them … despite having … that kind of disease.” 
​​Meanwhile, Hao said, patients should seek treatment as early as possible. 
“A lot of times geography is a hurdle, a barrier for referral,” he acknowledged. “But I want all our community and college to think and to suggest (to) patients: Come to UK early and in order to have that potentially curable therapy.” 
This new treatment may also be effective in treating brain metastases, which is when cancer cells migrate to the brain. This is common in small cell lung cancer, according to UK. The first U.S. patient treated with ZG006 at Markey had brain metastases, Hao said. 
“This disease has a very high chance of coming to the brain,” Hao said. “Once they come to the brain … it’s oftentimes too late to handle it, so we’ve got to think about just starting immunotherapy as soon as we (can).” 



Who should get screened for lung cancer? 
According to the American Lung Association, people should get screening for lung cancer if they are 50-80 years old, currently smoke or did smoke in the last 15 years and smoked a pack a day for 20 years or two packs a day for 10 years. People who fit that criteria are “high risk” for developing lung cancer, according to the association. 
People can also email the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services’ lung cancer screening program at LungCancer@ky.gov with questions about screening. 
Kentuckians who believe they qualify for the UK trial can contact the Markey Cancer Center.

After this year’s governor’s race, the former Pennsylvania attorney general, Montgomery County commissioner and state representative is widely expected to set his sights on the party’s nomination for president in 2028.
Voters next year will judge Shapiro on his record of running the commonwealth. While Republicans say there’s plenty to criticize, such as three late budgets and lingering questions about a sexual harassment scandal involving a top aide, Democratic and Republican political experts say his appeal to a broad swath of voters is undeniable.
“Josh Shapiro is easily the most popular governor we have had in a long time. This is a guy that Democrats love, Independents love,” said Lehigh Valley-based GOP consultant Sam Chen, noting a group of prominent Republicans including former U.S. Reps. Charlie Dent and Jim Greenwood endorsed Shapiro in 2022. “Republicans, behind closed doors, acknowledge that.”
After nearly three years in the governor’s office, Shapiro’s approval record hit an all-time high in October, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll. His consideration as a running mate for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 elevated his profile nationally. 
And the governor’s race is expected to strongly influence down-ballot races, meaning the Democrats’ one-seat majority in the state House, the Republican three-seat majority in the Pennsylvania Senate and perhaps as least four U.S. House seats are believed to be in play this year. 
“Politically, Josh’s victory is very key to what’s going to happen from a policy standpoint in the commonwealth and in the nation,” Philadelphia-based public affairs executive Larry Ceisler said.
Shapiro’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Shapiro’s likely opponent in November is Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a retired U.S. Army officer and business executive serving her second term as the commonwealth’s financial manager. 
An ally of President Donald Trump, Garrity has positioned herself as a champion of the people during her five years in office. She touts the Treasury’s success in returning hundreds of millions of dollars worth of unclaimed property held by the state to its rightful owners and expanding access to educational savings programs.
Garrity’s campaign plans to make the case that while Shapiro has broad approval, it’s based on a carefully crafted public image. Voters will change their minds when they see beneath the surface, Republican strategists said.
“It’s a mile wide and an inch deep,” Garrity campaign spokesman Matt Benyon told the Capital-Star. “There’s very little intensity to it. It provides us an opportunity to tell the other side of the story.”
On Dec. 23, the campaign released a video styled as a movie trailer for a dark techno-crime thriller with references to a 2011 Philadelphia stabbing case that Shapiro took over when he was state attorney general. The tagline: “It’s amazing what you can learn … when you hide in the shadows.”
Before the case was transferred to the attorney general’s office in 2018, Philadelphia officials had initially determined that Ellen Greenberg’s death was a homicide before changing it to suicide, despite the presence of more than 20 stab wounds on the 27-year-old teacher’s body.
When the medical examiner said in October he no longer believed Greenberg died by suicide, Shapiro said he stood behind the conclusion the AG’s office reached that the evidence points to suicide. He also expressed regret that his office could not provide better closure for her family.

Garrity’s campaign will also make an argument that Shapiro’s narrative of success is belied by Pennsylvania’s national rankings of its economy, education system and transportation infrastructure.
“Pennsylvania is lagging behind,” Benyon said. “What Josh Shapiro does with seemingly every breath he takes is blame President Trump.”
Republican Party of Pennsylvania spokesman James Markley said the GOP will attack Shapiro over what it says is a lack of transparency surrounding the resignation of Secretary of Legislative Affairs Mike Vereb amid a sexual harassment scandal that resulted in a $295,000 settlement with Vereb’s accuser. 
The administration said during litigation over a Right to Know Law request for emails around the time the accusation was lodged that the accuser’s email account was deleted in accordance with records retention policies.
The GOP, Markley said, also plans to highlight what the party claims is a lack of transparency around security upgrades to Shapiro’s own Montgomery County home after the April firebombing of the official Governor’s Residence in April. Shapiro and his family were asleep there after celebrating Passover the night before when a Harrisburg man, at odds with the governor’s position on the war in Gaza, threw two Molotov cocktails into the state reception hall. 
Cody Balmer pleaded guilty in October to attempted murder with a sentencing enhancement for terrorism and will serve 25 to 50 years in state prison. The administration has said the improvements stem from reviews by Pennsylvania State Police and independent security experts “to pinpoint security failures, review protocols, identify gaps and make concrete recommendations for improvement to the Governor’s security.”
“If he doesn’t have anything to hide, then why is he fighting so hard to block all of this information from being released to the public?” Markley said.
Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy and administration at Penn State Harrisburg said those issues offer an opportunity to question Shapiro’s judgment and character, but they may not register with voters in the way Republicans want. Mallinson noted they didn’t affect Shapiro’s popularity in real time.
“Most people aren’t as polarized. They just want the government to work and things to go their way,” he said.
Chen said those issues might also present pitfalls for Garrity, noting that Shapiro gets sympathy as the victim of an anti-semetic attack and voters may feel it’s reasonable to update security after such a breach. Likewise, Vereb was a Republican when he served in the state House before becoming one of Shapiro’s close aides in the attorney general’s office.

“You’re walking on very thin ice if you’re going to use that as an attack,” Chen said. 
Shapiro’s image is that of a governor who has proven his ability to competently run a government, who has pushed for investments in education, agriculture and transportation. And while he hasn’t achieved all of those policy goals, Mallinson said Shapiro has put himself at the center of compromises and willingness to entertain proposals from those further to the left and right of him.
Mallinson said the three late budgets on Shapiro’s watch might be an angle where he is vulnerable to criticism. Although a monthslong delay of his first budget was due in part to the collapse of a school voucher deal with Senate Republicans, in each case the divided legislature has shared responsibility, Mallinson said.
Democratic strategist Neil Oxman said Shapiro has figured out how to work with the Republican Senate 
“He understands better than anyone, probably since [Ed] Rendell was governor, that when the Democrats and Republicans each control houses there has to be some give and take,” Oxman said.
Shapiro has also leveraged losses into political capital by demonstrating that he is fighting for constituent groups. 
“Whether or not he can get mass transit [funding] for Philadelphia and Allegheny County, just the fact that he’s fighting for it shows voters he’s fighting for them,” Oxman said.
And although Shapiro has many policy issues to figure out, such as surging energy demand and prices in the face of the AI race, Ceisler said Shapiro’s demonstrated ability to work across the aisle provides a foundation to continue negotiating.
“For all the acrimony and delay, he’s done a good job,” Ceisler said.
And while the budget delays in 2023 and 2025 that extended into the fall each year caused real disruption and expense for school districts, county governments and nonprofit organizations, the vast majority of Pennsylvanians weren’t directly affected. 
Last year, the weight of the late state budget was compounded by the record 43-day federal government shutdown, which resulted in hardship for many federal workers. That may have had a detrimental effect on faith in government generally, Mallinson said
“My bigger concern is that it affects their view of government and the ability to get things done,” he said. “If you’re a voter who is not just turned off from voting by that … at the end of the day, you still have two options and you have to pick one.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shapiro-snap-updates--1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 05:56:54.544346

In Ashland, a street lamp lights the way between two bridges over the Ohio River. (Getty Images)In its most recent rate case, Kentucky Power clarified that population and industrial losses, coupled with the need to increase revenue for investors, relative to its fixed costs, are significant reasons for its proposed 15% industrial rate hike, 14.9% residential rate hike and 13% commercial rate hike. 
Annual statistical reports kept by the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) reflect a sad tale. Over 12,000 residential customers have been lost in the past 14 years in Kentucky Power’s 22-county service area in Eastern Kentucky. In 2010, Kentucky Power sold 3.3 billion kilowatt-hours of industrial power.  By 2024, that number dropped to 2 billion kilowatt-hours  a 38% loss. No doubt, our region is in trouble. 
Most people living in Eastern Kentucky do not need numbers on a chart to tell us that industries once depended on to feed our families have declined or, worse yet, completely evaporated. Coal, steel and power, the bedrocks of our communities and local economies, have gone by the wayside. 
Kentucky Power itself was a major player in declining power and coal jobs when it chose to decommission its Big Sandy 2 generating plant in Louisa and invest millions of Eastern Kentucky ratepayer dollars in the coal-burning Mitchell plant located just outside of Moundsville, W. Va., a plant that does not  employ Kentucky citizens, pay Kentucky taxes or burn coal mined in Eastern Kentucky.  
So here we are, looking for new industries to attract to our area and hoping the industries and businesses we do still have stay. None of this is for the faint of heart. To their credit, economic development teams across the region are aiming to create sustainable growth, foster innovation and improve the quality of life in their communities. Adding another 15% to the industrial electrical rate, which is already one of the highest in the state, is not helpful. 
More is needed, much more than just decently priced industrial electrical rates to attract and maintain industries and businesses providing good-paying jobs. Infrastructure is key as well. 
As they say in the real estate market, our area of Northeast Kentucky has good bones. We have two major waterways, the Big Sandy and the Ohio River; rail services and three major highways that pass through our area: Interstate 64, US 60 and US 23. We are minutes away from the AA Highway, a throughway to Northern Kentucky and the industrial Midwest.  We have regional airports nearby. Yet, we have failed to keep up. 
Our electrical grid needs work. Extreme weather events due to climate change — hurricanes (the effects of which are felt here in Kentucky), ice storms, floods and tornadoes — are only growing in frequency and intensity. According to Climate Central, 83% of power failures can be attributed to weather changes. We must upgrade or suffer the dire consequences of inaction.

The aging grid in Eastern Kentucky requires a proactive approach to meet the needs of a region seeking a renaissance. Merely trimming trees and clearing brush do not guarantee a resilient power supply. Ratepayers deserve a reliable power supply that only comes from utilizing current technology.
Unfortunately, there has been a major issue at the Mitchell plant requiring significant capital and attention to address. One of Mitchell’s two concrete cooling towers is failing structurally at the over-50-year-old coal-burning plant and needs to be reinforced or replaced. 
According to Kentucky PSC records, the options to address the failing tower would be $376 million for a new mechanical draft or $356 million  to shorten the tower. Either way means money out of the ratepayers’ pocket for an expense that is not a long-term solution as the Mitchell plant, which Kentucky Power owns half of, is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2040. The money needed to shore up the tower will be in addition to the current proposed rate hike. Kentucky Power has said it is seeking a federal grant to help with this expense; time will tell.
The complicated history Kentucky Power has with its ratepayers continues to lean toward customer rate unsustainability. A correction must take place. 
We need companies providing good-paying jobs to locate in the service area to combat population loss, and those companies need fair electrical rates and adequate infrastructure. Ratepayers need Kentucky Power, a monopoly, to manage its operations more effectively. The truth is, families in Eastern Kentucky, who already pay the state’s highest average energy bills, can no longer bear the burden of questionable decisions by Kentucky Power, compounded by a hard-hit regional economy. 
PSC meetings on this matter were recently well attended in both Pikeville and Hazard as citizens and elected leaders alike spoke out in unity about the harm further rate hikes will cause.   
One more community meeting is on the schedule. The Kentucky PSC will be in Ashland at 5 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 8, at the Ashland Transportation Center to hear from ratepayers.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As 850,000 Virginians (and millions nationwide) went without food stamps this fall during the federal government shutdown, the giant reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer set off a timer for states to reduce their error rates in computing the disbursement of funds to recipients. States that don’t comply risk losing their funding.
That means Virginia must drop its error rate from where it hovers now around 11% down to 6% by 2027. Otherwise, the state could be on the hook for $270 million annually. 
Enter “SNAP Forward,” an initiative spearheaded by Gov. Glenn Youngkin through an executive directive this past August with the express purpose of reducing the state’s SNAP error rates. It’s work that incoming Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s administration will inherit. 
Youngkin has publicly referenced the initiative and his administration’s efforts to slash SNAP error rates repeatedly in recent months, most recently in his final budget presentation to lawmakers last month, but has shared few details. The Mercury gleaned a clearer picture of the progress so far through a series of Freedom of Information Act requests and by reviewing  Youngkin’s  proposed state budget. 
 Compliance with federal law changes

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, helps low-income earners afford to buy groceries. States have always handled disbursing the federal funds to qualifying residents. Sometimes, errors in either overpaying or underpaying households arise, stemming from paperwork mistakes by government staff or outdated information from beneficiaries. 
When Congress passed its reconciliation bill in July, the measure stipulated that states with higher error rates may have to, for the first time, pay a portion of SNAP benefits to recipients. 
Beyond spurring error rate reductions, the law adjusted age and work eligibility requirements.
Since Oct. 1, Virginia beneficiaries can no longer attest to their expenses and income themselves. Now, state employees reviewing SNAP cases must  take further steps to verify applicants’ expenses. Household composition will be required to be verified as well by March 2026.
 Strategic meetings

A series of meeting presentation slides revealed by the November and December records request shows conversation materials used during a monthly series of “SNAP Forward” virtual meetings with local Department of Social Services workers around the state. The meetings began in September. 
The conversations entailed training refreshers for workers on managing SNAP, new policies to verify household information and notes on other states, like Wisconsin, which has maintained a low error rate. Virginia’s Department of Social Services has plans to conduct interviews with states that have track records of dropping their error rates to gather insights.

 Contracted help

The Mercury reviewed a $1.7 million contract for services by a company called KPMG included in the state’s FOIA response. The organization offers tax, audit and advisory services to companies and governments that hire it. 
With a six-month contract for services, KPMG has been tasked with deploying to “agreed-upon” local DSS offices to “support (Virginia) with targeted strategies to help improve SNAP payment accuracy.” The company was also hired to provide recommendations and prepare training documents.
The Mercury reached out to KPMG to inquire further but did not receive a response by the time of this publication. 
 A quality assurance team 

As local social service departments around the state handle SNAP case loads, the administrative ease or strain looks different in different localities. One of the records the state released to the Mercury was a document outlining feedback from the Virginia League of Social Services Executives. The group expressed concerns about whether smaller local social services offices in the state could handle the additional administrative burden that the new process would require. 
Lawmakers and advocates have also warned that these workers are expected to have heavier loads for Medicaid eligibility changes triggered by the reconciliation bill. 
Youngkin’s outgoing state budget proposal earmarks about $2.4 million to fund a quality assurance team for the Office of Health and Human Services — a potential solution for the expected administrative challenges. The 14 new positions Virginia could  hire would be responsible for helping to find and correct SNAP payment errors. 
Whether the team comes to be or not depends on upcoming budget negotiations in the 2026 legislative session, where Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger will have her own ideas about how the state should allocate its resources. After Virginia’s legislature agrees on the next state budget, Spanberger will be responsible for signing it or making adjustments.

Last year, one notable document was missing.
The annual report from the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission would normally have been published at the end of November. The JIRC’s 2024 report was a rich text: for the first time, it contained the names and misdeeds of Virginia judges who were disciplined by the seven-member commission for violating the commonwealth’s judicial cannons. The change was the result of a 2023 law sponsored by Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick, which passed with bipartisan support and backing from outgoing Attorney General Jason Miyares.
Virginia House approves bill to boost transparency when judges get punished

That brief window of transparency shut last year, when lawmakers unanimously passed a bill specifying they would be the first ones to see JIRC’s annual report — and decide if it’s ever made public. 
The change means the public won’t know the names and misconduct of errant judges in their community in 2025 unless lawmakers decide to release it. In 2024, that list included a Richmond judge who’d made unwanted advances on female attorneys and a Roanoke judge who’d had a relationship and provided legal aid to the mother of a man on trial for murder in the same courthouse. 
In a committee meeting last year, the 2025 bill’s sponsor, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, said judges deserved more privacy.
“The whole idea was — especially in unfounded cases — a lot of information that’s available under the FOIA law right now is information that might not be accurate and may be defamatory toward a judicial officer,” Deeds said in a February committee meeting, referring to the Freedom of Information Act.
But Deeds’ statement doesn’t align with what’s in the reports. Under the rules of the 2023 law, the outcomes of “unfounded cases” are not published in the JIRC’s annual report — only a much smaller number of cases where judges were disciplined for violating the cannons.

In an interview last week, Deeds said he was unaware the report only contained the names of disciplined judges.
“When there’s a founded complaint, when there’s disciplinary action — that ought to be public information,” Deeds said.
Deeds said the bill was “not my idea” and that he “really had not had any interest in this before.” At the committee meeting, he said former Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth Melvin, who retired last month, had convinced him to carry the bill. The judge served as vice chair of JIRC and previously represented Portsmouth as a Democrat in the House of Delegates for 24 years. Melvin could not be reached for comment for this story.
Deeds said he was unsure how the General Assembly would publish the report, if it decided to do so, and said he was open to reconsidering the bill after a social media thread by Richmond reporter Sarah Vogelsong last month brought the issue to public attention. (Vogelsong previously served as  editor-in-chief of the Mercury).
“I didn’t realize people were hotly anticipating the release of these things,” Deeds said.
All 50 states have systems for screening and investigating ethical complaints against judges. Those complaints are always private, and the overwhelming majority in Virginia involve litigants unhappy with verdicts, JIRC’s counsel, Raymond Morrogh, told lawmakers in a 2021 Senate committee presentation. Those complaints aren’t eligible for JIRC’s review. If a panel determines a complaint does have merit, they can elect to gather more information, like a response from a judge, or simply express their disapproval without taking formal action.
If an investigation substantiates a complaint, judges may face a range of outcomes, including agreeing to disciplinary actions, like supervision or substance abuse treatment. In more serious cases, the JIRC may elect to hold a formal hearing. 
The hearings can resemble trials, where a state official presents evidence of misconduct, including witnesses and depositions, and a judge, often represented by a lawyer, presents their defense and cross-examines witnesses. The commission has the power to suspend a judge and recommend that the Virginia Supreme Court censure, remove, or force a judge into retirement.
In the majority of states — but not Virginia — fact-finding hearings involving judges are public, according to the National Center for State Courts. 
Indiana University law processor Charles Geyh, a national expert in judicial ethics, said in an interview that judges were often “reluctant to air their dirty laundry in public,” wary of undermining public trust in the courts. But Geyh argued Virginia’s level of secrecy into judicial misconduct risked undermining that goal.
“We’re past the point where the public is going to sit tight and have the judiciary say, ‘Trust me, we’re doing it — we’re just not telling anybody about it,’” Geyh said. “We’re past the point where that’s enough.”
Fairfax attorney Andi Geloo, a vocal critic of what she calls “wayward judges,” said the secrecy around judicial discipline created a separate standard from others accused of misconduct, from police officers to criminal defendants.
“The public has a right to know how judges are performing and whether they’re upholding the law,” Geloo said. “And this change sends a message that judges are above the law.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)When state Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, talks about Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act, she often does so from experience — both as a former journalist and as a lawmaker who says she has repeatedly seen the law used to discourage public access rather than promote it. 
Since her first year in office in 2018, Roem has made FOIA reform a legislative priority, reintroducing the same core proposal multiple times. Earlier this year, that effort nearly paid off, with her bill advancing further than ever before before ultimately dying late in the House.
Now, Roem is trying again.
She has reintroduced Senate Bill 56 for the 2026 General Assembly session, which is set to begin next week, reviving an effort to tighten limits on how much state and local governments can charge for public records and to clarify how agencies seek court relief when responding to large or complex requests. 
The proposal, which earned bipartisan support during the 2025 session, at the time passed the Senate, cleared a House committee and reached the House floor before being sent back to committee on a procedural vote after committees had stopped meeting, effectively killing the bill.
“It’s the same bill, different year,” Roem said in an interview with the Virginia Mercury. 
“I have worked since 2018 on this legislation, and I have introduced it five or so times over the years. The entire point of it is to reduce FOIA fees, so that the fees that are being charged are actually being used simply to cover the actual costs associated with pursuing FOIA requests in the first place, instead of being used as a deterrent for the public to not pursue FOIA requests.”
 Limiting FOIA fees

Under SB 56, public bodies would be prohibited from charging more than the median hourly rate of pay of their employees — or the actual hourly rate of the employee performing the work, whichever is lower — when calculating labor costs for producing public records. 
Supporters say the change would prevent agencies from assigning high-paid staff to routine FOIA requests in ways that inflate costs and discourage access.
Currently, Virginia law gives agencies broad discretion to determine who processes a request, a practice critics argue has allowed FOIA fees to climb into the hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
The bill creates a narrow exception to the fee cap. If a public body can demonstrate that no employee is available to process the request at or below the median hourly rate, it may petition a court for permission to exceed the limit. 
Roem said that provision is intended to accommodate situations involving specialized or technical records while still placing the burden on the agency to justify higher charges.
“Even I, as a state legislator, got hit with a FOIA fee earlier this year, a three-digit FOIA fee,” Roem said. “This happens to my constituents routinely.”
She pointed to a case in her district involving a mother who was charged more than $8,000 to view a 92-second video of her autistic daughter being dragged off a school bus. While the fee was later reduced, the woman still paid hundreds of dollars and needed $1,500 in financial assistance to cover the remaining cost.
“This happens again, and again, and again, and again, where FOIA fees are used as a deterrent to the public getting public information that they have already paid for,” Roem said. “Public documents are public, your tax dollars have already paid for these documents in the first place. Therefore, you should have the lowest barrier possible to accessing them.”
 Changes beyond cost

In addition to fee limits, SB 56 would update the required “notice of rights and responsibilities” 
that public bodies must post on their websites. The notice would be revised to explain how fees are calculated under the new limits and to describe the option for agencies to seek court approval to exceed the cap.
The bill also clarifies how agencies may seek additional time to respond to FOIA requests. Current law allows public bodies to petition a court for more time in limited circumstances, but the process has been criticized as unclear and inconsistent across jurisdictions.
Under Roem’s proposal, agencies could file such petitions in either general district court or circuit court, and courts would be directed to give those petitions priority on their dockets. Importantly for requesters, the bill would toll — or pause — the statutory response deadline while a petition is pending.
The legislation also makes technical changes to reorganize the FOIA statute, moving provisions related to charges for producing records into a separate section for clarity.
Taken together, the bill aims to standardize FOIA fees statewide, reduce the use of cost as a barrier to public access and provide clearer procedures for courts, agencies and requesters when disputes arise.
 FOIA as a public tool

Roem has repeatedly emphasized that FOIA reform is not about making life easier for journalists.

“The public needs to care about this, because it is the most important tool that they have to hold their government accountable in between elections,” she said. “It is the single most important tool that they have. That’s a misconception that it’s just reporters and some state actors who use it.”
She noted that support for the bill has come from across the political spectrum, including social conservative groups that often oppose her on other issues.
“FOIA is not just for the people we agree with,” Roem said. “It’s for people who disagree with us, and it is for people who are perfectly neutral and just collecting data. FOIA is for everyone.”
Despite broad rhetorical support for transparency, Roem said FOIA reform rarely becomes a voting issue for the public, making it easier for lawmakers to treat compliance as a burden rather than a core responsibility.
“The Virginia Freedom of Information Act is consistently treated as a burden by government officials rather than a necessary obligation of government to its citizens,” she said. “It needs to be seen as a vital, important government service, as opposed to an administrative burden.”
Alan Gernhardt, executive director of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act Advisory Council, said the council’s staff has studied earlier versions of Roem’s proposal.
“As staff, we do not take any position on pending legislation,” Gernhardt said. He explained that a council subcommittee studied Roem’s SB 324 in 2024 and produced an executive summary and report, but did not reach consensus on a recommendation. A subsequent council meeting lacked a quorum, preventing a formal vote.
Gernhardt said Roem’s 2025 bill was based on that earlier work but was not referred back to the council after it failed to pass.
 How Virginia compares

Virginia’s FOIA system has long drawn criticism for its complexity and inconsistency. With the commonwealth’s 133 localities, Roem said, there are effectively 133 different approaches to public records access. Her bill draws in part from practices used in York County, which she described as a more reasonable, nonpartisan model.
Virginia’s approach also stands in contrast to FOIA systems in several other states that place tighter limits on fees or waive them entirely in many circumstances. 
According to a 2023 national review by the transparency nonprofit MuckRock, some states restrict charges to the actual cost of duplication, while others prohibit agencies from charging for staff time altogether unless a request is deemed unusually burdensome.
States such as Colorado and Indiana, for example, cap or standardize labor fees, reducing agencies’ discretion to assign higher-paid employees to routine requests. 
Other states have moved even further toward low- or no-cost public records access. In Nevada, agencies generally may charge only for the cost of copies, unless a request is classified as “extraordinary,” and even then the law requires fee policies to be clearly posted. 
At the federal level, the U.S. Freedom of Information Act allows for fee waivers when disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations — a standard transparency advocates say states should more broadly adopt. 
An overview of federal FOIA fee waivers is available online, while comparisons of state public-records laws are compiled by the National Freedom of Information Coalition.
“Some states don’t have FOIA fees at all,” Roem said. “Some states have much more reasonable systems than we do. It can be free, and others have reduced rates. Virginia’s system sucks.”
 Prospects in 2026

Roem is hopeful that SB 56 will pass during the 2026 session, citing the bill’s near-miss earlier this year and a House with dozens of new members. She said she is reintroducing the legislation “literally verbatim” from the version that earned bipartisan support, but plans to make the case again to lawmakers unfamiliar with its history.
Still, uncertainty remains over whether the measure would become law even if it clears the General Assembly.
It is unclear whether incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer, would sign the bill. A spokesman for Spanberger did not respond to a request for comment.
For Roem, the stakes extend beyond this year’s vote.
“I have repeatedly compared the Freedom of Information Act in Virginia to a giant slice of Swiss cheese,” she said, “which every single year gets more and more holes poked in it, and less and less cheese around it.”
She added: “Here we are voting to add more exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act without having fewer exemptions to offset it. This is about strengthening the most important accountability tool the public has.”

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)When the State Corporation Commission approved Dominion Energy Virginia’s proposal to build a new, 944 MW gas peaker plant on November, 25 it looked like the end of a long, drawn-out battle over the future of fossil fuels in Virginia.
SCC approves Chesterfield gas plant and Dominion rate hike, creates new rate class for data centers

The approval seemed to signal that for now, at least, the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) would not stand in the way of new gas-burning turbines in spite of their high greenhouse gas emissions. According to the SCC’s order, the surge in power demand from data centers had triggered a reliability exception to the VCEA’s ban on new fossil fuel construction.  
Then suddenly, on December 16, the SCC granted the Southern Environmental Law Center’s (SELC) motion to reconsider the decision the commission had rendered just weeks before,  suspending approval of Dominion’s plan. What the heck?
The SCC did not limit what it intends to reconsider, suggesting it will look anew at each of the four issues SELC raised. Since those issues cover pretty much everything about the gas plant’s approval, it’s impossible to guess what is going on. 
Certainly, there are many reasons to criticize the initial approval of the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center (CERC), beyond its climate impacts. The majority-Black community where the plant would be located suffered for decades from exposure to toxic air pollution spewing from the huge coal plant on the site. Closure of the coal plant had brought a welcome respite. Residents fear they will once again serve as a sacrifice zone for decades to come, in spite of environmental justice protections written into the VCEA.
In addition, Dominion had gamed the planning process so thoroughly that this alone might have caused the SCC to reject the proposal. Dominion had gone ahead and put in an order for the gas turbine even before soliciting proposals from third parties to address reliability concerns, as the law requires. On top of that, the company told the SCC that an independent third party had reviewed the options, which was false. 
 Dominion, it turned out, never had any intention of awarding the project to anyone but itself or of considering alternatives that didn’t involve fossil gas. How could the SCC reward such malfeasance?
The VCEA prioritizes the security and reliability of the power supply even over its carbon-cutting and cost-saving goals, but there are conditions attached to approving new power plants, intended to make new fossil fuel generation something of a last resort. SELC and other environmental groups had made a strong case both that Dominion failed to meet those conditions, and that there were non-fossil fuel alternatives that could provide reliability at less cost.
But if Dominion’s gaming of the process should have sparked outrage at the SCC, it also succeeded in putting the regulators in a difficult position. The mere suggestion of a future with rolling blackouts if a power company doesn’t get its way would cow any public utility commission, let alone one in a state facing an unprecedented surge in demand.  
That explains the SCC’s order approving a certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) for the gas plant Dominion swears is its only viable option. What, then, explains the about face on December 16, less than 24 hours after receiving the motion to reconsider?  
 Four possible errors

In its motion, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), representing Appalachian Voices, the NAACP and Mothers Out Front, argued that the SCC erred on four points around environmental justice, the cost of the gas plant compared to alternatives, the burden of proof on reliability and the legal mechanism for cost recovery. 
If the SCC were to agree with any of the first three arguments, the result would require new analysis, and might even send Dominion back to the drawing board. Agreement on the fourth point, however, would only change how Dominion charges ratepayers for the cost of the project. It would require the company to put the cost into base rates instead of a new rider, making CERC potentially less profitable for the company.  
This last point looks like something of a legal slam-dunk. A provision in the VCEA allows rate recovery through a rider only when a utility has met its energy efficiency targets – something all parties agree Dominion has not done. 
SELC also alleged that the commission failed to ensure the development of CERC “does not have a disproportionate adverse impact on historically economically disadvantaged communities,” another statutory requirement. The SCC’s original order addressed the point but appears to have misread this section of the law. That fact alone would justify a reconsideration of the November 25 order, though it would not alter the core of the decision to approve a CPCN for the gas plant.   
SELC’s other three points put CERC in greater jeopardy, if the SCC agrees. 
The commission’s environmental justice analysis consisted mainly of a judgment that a gas plant would be less harmful to the surrounding Black and Hispanic community than the coal plant that was formerly on the site. This may or may not be true, but that’s not the standard. On the contrary, a minority community that has suffered decades of pollution shouldn’t be first in line for the next polluting project to come along. That “disproportionate” impact is precisely what the VCEA and the Environmental Justice Act prohibit.
If the SCC were to side with the local community on this point, it wouldn’t stop Dominion from building a gas plant, but it would require the company to find a new location.  
The two final arguments attack the decision that a large gas peaker plant is the right remedy for a looming energy crisis. SELC contends that Dominion didn’t prove the cost of the gas plant is reasonable, citing the company’s deeply flawed process for considering alternatives and its failure to include fuel cost data. SELC also complains the SCC didn’t require Dominion to prove that its claimed threat to reliability could only be satisfied with a fossil fuel plant, but had merely taken the company’s word for it. 
These are accurate complaints about Dominion’s flawed process and strained analysis, and compelling reasons to reject Dominion’s plan — but they were just as compelling on November 25, when the SCC issued its order granting the CPCN.  
Indeed, the SCC had to both close its eyes and grasp at straws to reach the conclusions it did. For example, a footnote in the SCC’s order cites a Dominion witness’ testimony for the proposition that a Sierra Club witness had agreed a gas plant would be needed eventually. The commissioners did not take the time to find and review the Sierra Club’s testimony, which would have shown the Dominion witness had mischaracterized the evidence. Indeed, the Sierra Club’s modeling showed an alternative portfolio of clean resources would provide more energy than CERC at less cost. 
But apparently, gaming the process, ignoring the law and mischaracterizing the evidence are all things Dominion is willing to do to get an expensive fossil fuel plant approved in the face of the rigorous conditions set by the VCEA. 
On December 29, the SCC set a date of January 23 for Dominion to reply to the issues raised by SELC in its motion for reconsideration; presumably the commission will then set a date for a new hearing on those issues. The timeline could push a final decision on CERC out beyond the end of this year’s legislative session, making the interplay of politics and policy all the more interesting.

Kelly Ayotte signs legislation related to immigration enforcement in May. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Beginning Jan. 1, people in New Hampshire may face new penalties if they post “No Trespassing” signs on land not their own. Owners of nuisance dogs that repeatedly bite will face higher fines. And the Division of Motor Vehicles must create a “blue envelope” program to allow drivers with autism spectrum disorder to obtain envelopes with information on how to best communicate with them if an officer pulls them over.  
The Legislature passed more than 300 bills in 2025, and Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed all but a few. While most of that legislation took effect shortly after Ayotte’s signature this summer, a number took effect on New Year’s Day.
Here are the newly effective state laws in 2026. 
A ban on gender-affirming care for minors
In 2024, the Legislature banned “genital gender reassignment surgery” for those under 18. In 2025, the body banned virtually all other forms of gender-affirming care. 
House Bill 377, which took effect Jan. 1, bars medical professionals from carrying out any procedure on a minor “attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or her gender or sex,” including with surgeries, hormone therapy, and puberty blockers. Minors who began their procedures prior to Jan. 1 may continue them, but the practice must end moving forward, and providers who ignore the law must face “administrative disciplinary action,” though not criminal charges. 
Transgender rights advocates have decried the law as harmful to transgender youth who have used the treatment to align themselves to their gender identity; supporters argued the procedures can have permanent effects and should be studied more.  
An end to sanctuary cities
Starting in 2026, local law enforcement agencies will be required to follow immigration detainers issued by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Those detainers require local police to hold a person that has been arrested for up to 48 hours in order for ICE agents to arrive and potentially take custody if the person has violated immigration laws. 
The bill, House Bill 511, also prohibits cities and towns from passing “sanctuary city” policies in which police departments are instructed to not inform ICE about potential immigration violations of people in custody and to disregard the retainers.
A slew of fee increases
A number of fee increases have gone into effect this month, part of a push by lawmakers last year to find revenue without raising taxes. Among the increases are the fee for a new driver’s license, from $10 to $20; a rise in vanity plates from $40 to $60, and a jump in the price for a new motor vehicle registration from $25 to $35.
There are also fee hikes for specific industries. Pesticide dealers will now pay a $160 fee for each new pesticide they register; tractor registration fees are now $11, up from $6; and cement mixers are increased to $12, up from $1.80.
A prohibition on ambulance ‘balance billing’ 
Starting in 2026, people who ride an ambulance will no longer be personally charged if the ambulance ride costs more than their health insurer is willing to pay. Senate Bill 245 bans the practice of “balance billing,” also known as surprise billing. The bill also sets mandatory rates for how much ambulance companies can charge insurers.
“This bill is going to make sure that when you have that ambulance come to your house for your mother or your father or your loved one, that there’s not a surprise bill that comes afterwards, that really makes you feel, ‘Wow. How can I pay for this?’” Ayotte said at a bill signing in August. 
A crackdown on AI use and chatbots against minors
This year, it will be a violation of child endangerment laws for the owner of a chatbot or other online service to use artificial intelligence to “to facilitate, encourage, offer, solicit” sexually explicit conduct, use of illegal drugs or alcohol, acts of self-harm, or acts of violence from a child.  
The new law, passed via House Bill 143, is in part directed toward chatbots that use AI technology to allow children to role-play conversations with different personas, whether through a video game, movie, TV show, or other interaction. The owner or operator must know that they are intending to facilitate or engage that behavior; those who do may face a civil lawsuit brought by the state Attorney General’s Office and may pay a fine of at least $1,000 per violation.
The laws also target the use of artificial intelligence to create “intimate visual representation” of children, equivalent to child sexual abuse imagery. Starting Jan. 1, doing so will be a Class B felony and a registrable offense, under Senate Bill 300. 
Landlords cannot require electronic payment for rent
Beginning in the new year, tenants have the right to refuse to pay rent via electronic means. Previously, landlords could require payment through apps such as Venmo or Zelle; now, under House Bill 309, the landlord “shall allow at least one other non-electronic form of payment” to pay for a lease, a lease renewal, or an extension. 
Mandatory accessible voting machines at town meetings
As of January, a pilot program to expand accessible voting is now permanent. In 2024, lawmakers required cities and towns to provide accessible voting machines at local elections, like town meetings and municipal elections. Now, under House Bill 67, the state will continue that mandate in a long-term arrangement. The machines, which are already used in federal elections, allow people with disabilities to easily vote using a keyboard or touchscreen and print out a ballot with their choices selected. 
Last year, municipalities tested out a system in which they borrowed the machines from the Secretary of State’s Office; moving forward, cities and towns will continue borrowing the machines but will pay for the cost of programming the machines for local elections. 
Voter information sharing between poll workers and state
Election workers in cities and towns will also be empowered to request personal information from state records to confirm people’s eligibility to vote in that polling district. Under House Bill 464, the Department of Safety and Secretary of State’s Office may share records that could show proof of a would-be-voter’s citizenship, such as birth certificates, as well as age and domicile. 
The new powers come as the state prepares for the federal midterm elections in November, and more than a year after the passage of House Bill 1569 in 2024, which required new registrants in the state to provide hard copies of proof of citizenship in order to vote. 
Meanwhile, Senate Bill 221, which also took effect Jan. 1, requires town supervisors of the checklist to verify voter rolls every year, rather than every 10 years under the previous law. 
A new parental right to their minor child’s library records
Parents will also have new record-seeking powers. As of the new year, House Bill 273 allows parents to request from public libraries their minor children’s borrowing records. That includes printed materials, DVDs, CDs, and other audio-visual materials; the information must be requested by a parent or legal guardian.  
Dumping yard waste in public bodies of water now illegal
Starting Jan. 1, it will be illegal to dump yard waste into any state body of water, on the ice of such water, or on the banks of the water. Anyone who “purposely or knowingly” violates this law will face a felony violation. The bill, House Bill 416, added yard waste to a list of existing materials not allowed to be dumped into waters, including bottles, glass, crockery, cans, scrap metal, junk, paper, garbage, tires, old automobiles or car parts, and trees. 
Meanwhile, House Bill 179, which took effect Thursday, imposes stiffer financial penalties on people who discharge hazardous or toxic wastes and have failed to pay the expenses associated with the cleanup. After 90 days of nonpayment of those expenses, the new law imposes a $1,000 additional fine per day until the expenses are paid. 
A new ‘C-PACER’ system for energy-efficient development
Developers and property owners will have access this year to a revamped financial mechanism to pay for energy efficient apartment buildings. Known as C-PACER, the new system will replace an older system that observers said was poorly designed and burdensome for towns. Now, the program will be run by the New Hampshire Business Finance Authority. 
Supporters say the voluntary program could make it easier for developers to find savings through energy efficiency and then use those savings to make the housing projects more attainable.  
Department of Education subpoena powers for teachers
As lawyers continue to spar over a state law barring certain concepts around race and gender from being taught in public schools, the Department of Education now has the ability to issue subpoenas to teachers. House Bill 520, which took effect Thursday, allows hearing officers at the department to issue subpoenas to teachers and school staff. 
Those subpoenas can be carried out for investigations into code of conduct violations by teachers, and can include books, papers, documents, and other items. 
The U.S. District Court of New Hampshire struck down the state’s “banned concepts” law in 2024; lawyers for the state have appealed that ruling to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. But supporters of HB 520 say it will help the department investigate other forms of misconduct, such as harassment and sexual assault. 
A quicker return of confiscated firearms
New Hampshire residents who relinquish their firearms to police due to a court order could now have an easier time getting those weapons back when the order expires. 
House Bill 506 requires that courts ensure a “prompt” return of the firearm to the individual once the protective order expires. The bill states that courts may choose to carry out background checks to see if the person is barred from under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System or under records held by state police. But those background checks are not required. And under the new law, individuals have a right to request a hearing to challenge a court’s decision to withhold the firearm, in which the Department of Safety must show up in court and provide “clear and convincing” evidence that the person is barred from having the firearm. 
Should the department not show to the hearing, the court must return the firearm to the individual by default, the bill states.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AyotteSigningMay222025-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-05 05:11:57.607709

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A health care administrator who narrowly lost a bid for the Arkansas House last year is running once again, this time against an Air Force veteran in Tuesday’s special election.
The two are vying for the Democratic nomination in the hopes of flipping a Republican-held district that includes portions of North Little Rock and Sherwood as well as the Camp Joseph T. Robinson military base. Rep. Carlton Wing, R-North Little Rock, was serving his fifth term when he resigned in September to head Arkansas TV, the state’s recently rebranded public television outlet.

Wing’s resignation triggered a special election, and the special primary for House District 70 pits Alex Holladay against Cordelia Smith-Johnson.
The election has Holladay knocking on the same doors he visited a little over a year ago before Wing defeated him by 316 votes.
“It’s like a battle scar, like, ‘Yeah, I did this before, and it worked, they remember me,’” Holladay said.
Cordelia Smith-Johnson (Courtesy of the Arkansas Secretary of State)
Smith-Johnson has not run for office before but said residents comment on her accessibility and willingness to take on challenges.
“[They say], ‘You’re not scared to say this, you’re not scared to challenge a person on this,’” Smith-Johnson said. “I’ve been in the Air Force. I’ve never been scared of a fight.”
The primary winner will face Republican Bo Renshaw in the special general election on March 3. Regardless of who wins Tuesday, Smith-Johnson and Holladay will have a rematch in the regular primary, also on March 3.
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders initially scheduled the special election to align with the regularly scheduled one in November. The state Democratic Party sued. Sanders relented after a judge ruled in the party’s favor.

 Health care

Smith-Johnson left the Air Force in 2019 and is now a prevention coordinator for the Army National Guard. Holladay recruits health care professionals for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
Both candidates said health care affordability is a major policy concern.
Smith-Johnson said many fellow veterans have expressed frustration about “the long wait time to see a specialist” because Arkansas doesn’t have enough highly specialized physicians. Her campaign website states veterans should have adequate housing and job opportunities as well as needed physical and mental health care.
“No one who served this country should have to fight for basic services,” the website states.
Holladay said he’s concerned about the impact of Medicaid cuts on District 70’s elderly population, in addition to the fact that “it’s just way too confusing getting care.”
“My dad is currently on long-term hospice,” he said. “Navigating that process is a nightmare, and I’m a professional.”
The federal government’s upcoming changes to Medicaid include work requirements and higher out-of-pocket costs for enrollees. KFF projects that Medicaid expansion states like Arkansas, could see a 14% drop in enrollment.

 Education

Both candidates said they got into politics via the education system. Holladay considered running for school board in North Little Rock in 2023. The seat in his zone wasn’t up for election until 2026, so he ran for the Legislature in 2024 instead, he said. 
What inspired Holladay to run was frustration with the LEARNS Act, the 2023 law that created a school voucher program that allows state funding to be used for certain private school and homeschooling expenses.
The state needs to implement “stricter guidelines” over how school voucher money is spent, he said. The state also should ensure an “equilateral education” for Arkansas children regardless of where they live or what type of school they attend, he said.
Smith-Johnson said school vouchers take away funds public schools could use for services to students with disabilities. Her daughter is homeschooled, but when she was in a traditional school setting, she was falling behind because she “didn’t have the resources” she needed from her individualized education plan, Smith-Johnson said.
“I stepped in to be the voice, and I got the parents to come stick with me on behalf of their kids, and we got things done, and I realized then that there’s power in a voice,” Smith-Johnson said.










I’ve been in the Air Force. I’ve never been scared of a fight.

 Affordability and the prison proposal

Both candidates favor expanding access to pre-K. Smith-Johnson’s campaign website says she supports state-funded child care, and Holladay’s website expresses support for the child tax credit.
Smith-Johnson said a key tenet of affordability is ensuring low-income people’s access to food assistance such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. She said she opposes new federal work requirements for SNAP recipients because they’re “not feasible,” including for veterans.
“I grew up on SNAP benefits,” she said. “My mom worked, and we still survived on SNAP.” [2026 Primary Election Voter Guide: The candidates, the ballot measures, and the tools you need to cast your vote.]
Holladay said some voters have told him they’re upset that Sanders wants to build a multimillion-dollar, 3,000-bed prison while people are “struggling to go to the grocery store.”
“I’ve been surprised by the number of voters that bring it up,” Holladay said. “I don’t even ask. They just bring it up because one of our [campaign] taglines is, ‘What matters to you?’”
Voters in Senate District 26 will also head to the polls Tuesday to choose a Republican candidate for their own special election. District 26 includes part of Franklin County, where the state bought 815 acres of land for the planned prison. The project met backlash from local residents, including the late Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield, whose death in September triggered the election.
Smith-Johnson said she too has heard District 70 voters bring up the prison unprompted. She used to work as a probation officer, and she said a more effective response to crime in Arkansas would be restructuring the probation system.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)In a recent commentary in Rhode Island Current, Robert Hackey (who has trained many of Rhode Island’s best health policy students over many years) and co-author Chloe Johnson forcefully argues that Rhode Island can’t wait nine years to address the national primary care workforce shortage in a way that protects Rhode Islanders now.  
We agree.
Building a new medical school at URI isn’t adequate. 
But we disagree about the value of such a medical school, which we think is a critical element of a long-term solution to our primary care woes.
A new medical school won’t cure R.I.’s primary care shortage. Here’s a better idea.

Primary care is critical to Rhode Island’s health services delivery system because the supply of primary care physicians has been shown, over and over again, to be associated with better public health outcomes and lower costs.
We think everybody in Rhode Island should have a regular source of primary care.
Rhode Island needs 133 to 266 more clinicians than we have now, according to a 2024 presentation to the Rhode Island Senate Study Commission on the new Medical School by the advocacy group Primary Care for All Americans.
That means committing the state to developing this workforce, but an arms race to steal them from neighboring states is not a viable long-term strategy.  A new medical school, if it admits Rhode Islanders preferentially and obligates them to practice in Rhode Island for a number of years, is critical to this “grow your own” strategy.










Building a new medical school at URI isn’t adequate. But we disagree about the value of such a medical school, which we think is a critical element of a long-term solution to our primary care woes.


Rhode Island’s primary care workforce strategy should also include developing primary care nurse practitioners and physicians’ assistants. Nurse practitioners now constitute about 50% of the primary care workforce. But though a number of good studies show that nurse practitioners can provide the same quality of care for specific procedures as physicians, high quality primary care is a team sport with physicians using their training to help lead the team and handle complex cases.
That new medical school can also help seed the development of new primary care residencies, which, as Hackey and Johnson correctly indicate, are critical to addressing our workforce needs.  (We should also be developing nurse practitioner residencies to make sure all our primary care clinicians are well trained.)  
A new medical school is also an economic engine for the state, as testimony to the special legislative commission’s report explains. And that new medical school gives Rhode Islanders their best shot at attending medical school near home — most of the Rhode Island high school students who go to medical school now have to leave the state to do so. There is good evidence that students who go to both medical school and residency in their home state are much more likely to stay and practice here — and we need lots more Rhode Islanders to go to medical school, do a primary care residency, and then stay to practice here, in their own communities. 
We need to act today on the more immediate fixes Hackey and Johnson note: improving primary care physician take-home pay; reducing the primary care administrative burden; improving electronic medical records so they are user friendly and helping clinicians manage their workload, instead of adding to it. 
In the medium term, creating robust loan repayment programs is essential, so clinicians in training today will take primary care jobs in Rhode Island. We need to continue to fund scholarships with obligations to practice primary care in Rhode Island, so we train more primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and PAs who commit themselves to practicing primary care here; and build many more new community-based residency programs for primary care physicians, nurse practitioners and PAs. Our strong community health center system is the logical base for this work. 
There is no quick and easy fix to this national problem that took 30 or more years to develop. Massachusetts now has a new statewide Task Force on Primary Care Access, Delivery, and Payment. Delaware is reportedly planning to use $100 million of its Rural Health Transformation Grant funds to build a new medical school and help address the challenges we also face. Rhode Island’s U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is leading discussions in Washington to implement essential reforms in Medicare to rebalance its payments from specialty care to primary care,  
The cost of a new medical school represents a tiny fraction of Rhode Island’s $4 billion yearly health care spend, much of which is unnecessary or wasted. A new medical school alone won’t fix primary care fix the mess — but it is an important step forward, one that will give hope to Rhode Islanders, a place to study near home for our students, and the pathway for everybody in our state to have a relationship with a skilled, compassionate clinician as they seek long, healthy and fulfilling lives in our state.

The House Study Committee on Cancer Care Access released its final report following a series of public meetings across the state held last year. The committee, chaired by Rep. Lee Hawkins, a Gainesville Republican, was tasked with identifying barriers to care as cancer cases in the U.S. are expected to rise.
“The rural oncologist is really a dying breed. We don’t have very many oncologists who are setting up shop in rural areas, and part of that is related to the fact that oncology in general is having difficulties with workforce sustainability,” said Dr. Kristin Higgins, chief clinical officer at City of Hope Cancer Center Atlanta and a member of the study committee, in an interview.

Georgia faces a significant disparity in access to care between its metro hubs and rural communities. According to the committee’s findings, although one-fifth of Georgians live in rural counties, only as much as 8% of the state’s oncologists practice there.
To address a shortage of rural doctors specializing in cancer care, the committee recommended expanding the state’s Physician Loan Repayment Program to include specialists practicing in rural areas and increasing the amount of loan forgiveness available. Currently, Georgia offers $150,000 over four years to physicians practicing in rural counties. The report also suggests encouraging rural rotations for medical students.
The committee found that Georgia’s rural counties – or counties with less than 50,000 residents – often face higher poverty rates and hospital closures, making travel to urban treatment centers difficult for patients.
“When you are in smaller communities around the state — I always think about Dublin, Georgia, which is right in the smack dab center of our state —  you have to go to Macon or to Savannah or to Augusta or to Atlanta. There are so many that don’t have that access that I have been so fortunate to have,” said Lynn Durham, CEO of Georgia Center for Oncology Research and Education and a three-time cancer survivor who advocated for the study committee’s creation.
According to the Georgia Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan 2024-2029, which calls for increased attention to addressing disparities among cancer deaths, minority and rural populations are disproportionately affected by cancer mortality. Men are also more likely to die from cancer than women.
“I think Georgians deserve access to cancer care close to home. I hear all the time that people want to be with their support systems when they’re going through one of the toughest journeys of their life,” Durham said. “They want to be home and get the best possible treatment they can right here.”
To improve early detection, the legislative panel’s report recommends supporting the use of mobile cancer screening units in rural and underserved areas, such as the Brunswick-based Southeast Georgia Health System Wellness on Wheels. The mobile health clinic provides free or low-cost breast cancer screenings and travels to surrounding counties, such as Glynn, Brantley, Camden, Long and McIntosh counties.

“In 2025 alone, the WOW mobile mammography unit performed approximately 100 site visits with over 400 patient encounters,” said Chad Roberson, director of imaging services at Southeast Georgia Health System.
But running a mobile clinic presents its own challenges. Roberson said that the mobile unit operates “both a clinic and a heavy-duty truck, requiring additional repairs and regular maintenance to perform effectively.” He said that with such a specialized vehicle, issues can arise during periods of high use, increasing costs and causing downtime. He also said the mobile units require health care workers willing to travel long distances and work irregular hours.
The committee also proposed increasing the percentage of tobacco settlement funds appropriated for cancer prevention and screening. Georgia has received about $4 billion from the master settlement agreement with the tobacco industry over the last 27 years, with about $600 million dedicated to cancer-related activities.
Advocates argue that funding for access to cancer care is crucial as federal funding cuts to Medicaid from H.R.1 passed over the summer, which along with expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, is set to reduce health care funding by more than $50 billion by 2034, according to a November 2025 report from the Georgia Health Initiative,
Fabienne Antoine-Nasser, government relations director with American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, urged the state to increase funding for cancer-related programs, particularly the tobacco use prevention program, a state program that was discontinued in May due to federal cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Antoine-Nasser suggested raising taxes on tobacco, which could generate $350 million in annual revenue if increased by $1.50 per pack, would help address federal funding gaps.
“I believe that taking a really staunch look at (raising tobacco taxes) … would have such a great impact and really help Georgians who are pre-diagnosed and want to be able to get access to prevention measures, or post as well who want to get access to care,” Antoine-Nasser said.
The committee report also called for supporting the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University in its pursuit of National Cancer Institute designation. Currently, the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University is the state’s only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and establishing a second in another region of the state could provide patients with greater access to a wider range of treatments through clinical trials.
While the committee did not recommend full Medicaid expansion, a long-standing goal for some health advocates like Antoine-Nasser, it did recommend simplifying Medicaid access, enrollment and renewal for pediatric patients and addressing reimbursement rates for oncology-related codes. American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network sent Hawkins a letter in July outlining how federal budget cuts under the Trump administration could affect access to care, saying that policies could cut Medicaid funding for Georgia by an estimated $8 billion over the next decade, with $2.2 billion of those cuts specifically falling on rural areas.
“Protecting and strengthening Medicaid access and access to care is going to be so imperative,” Antoine-Nasser said, pointing to estimated losses of health care coverage due to expiring ACA enhanced tax credits. If these tax credits expire, which the House is set to vote on a three-year extension in January, the GHI report projects that 340,000 Georgians will become uninsured.
Hawkins said in an interview that because of funding uncertainty at the federal level, he is not sure if he can move forward with any recommendation, at least not until the impact of federal funding cuts becomes clearer.
“As of right now, until that shakes out, I do not have any proposed legislation,” Hawkins said. “Just about all the recommendations would need to be funded, and with the One Big, Beautiful Bill, our health care funding is up in the air right now.”
The chairman also seemed concerned about the impact from the expiring Affordable Care Act  subsidies, saying that without a federal fix, insurance costs could skyrocket for Georgians.
“The numbers that I read, it looks very depressing for individuals being able to afford their insurance. I mean, some of the policies are doubling in cost,” Hawkins said.
Lawmakers can consider the recommendations in the upcoming legislative session, which starts Jan. 12, and Higgins was optimistic they would find bipartisan support.
“(Access to cancer care) is not going to be controversial. It’s not going to be a controversial area of funding,” Higgins said. “Everybody is affected by cancer.”

Freestanding birth centers can address maternal health inequities, but many are facing mounting financial and regulatory pressures. (Photo courtesy of Sarah Simmons)Dr. Heather Skanes opened Alabama’s first freestanding birth center in 2022 in her hometown of Birmingham. Skanes, an OB-GYN, wanted to improve access to maternal health care in a state that’s long had one of the nation’s highest rates of maternal and infant mortality.
Those rates are especially high among Black women and infants. Skanes’ Oasis Family Birthing Center opened in a majority-Black neighborhood, offering midwifery services as well as medical care.
But about six months after the center’s first delivery — a girl who was Alabama’s first baby born in a freestanding birth center — the state health department ordered Skanes to shut it down. A department representative informed her that by holding deliveries at the birth center, she was operating an “unlicensed hospital,” she said.
Hospital labor and delivery units are shuttering across the nation — including more than two dozen in 2025 alone. Freestanding birth centers like Skanes’ could help fill the gaps, but they too are struggling to stay open.
They face some of the same financial pressures that bedevil hospitals’ labor and delivery units, including payments from insurers that don’t cover the full cost of providing maternity care.
Birth center owners also must contend with arcane state rules and antipathy from politically powerful hospitals that view them as competition, especially in rural areas with few births.
Nationwide, the number of freestanding birth centers doubled between 2012 and 2022, but more recently the pressures have taken a toll: About two dozen centers have closed since 2023, bringing the total number down to about 395, according to the most recent data from the American Association of Birth Centers.
Hospitals block much-needed birth centers in the South

In November, Pennsylvania Lifecycle Wellness and Birth Center announced it would shut down birth center services, citing pressure from regulatory challenges and sharp surges in malpractice premiums. It had served Philadelphia for 47 years. And New Mexico’s longest-operating freestanding birth center stopped delivering babies in December.
“When a new business opens, within the first three to five years you expect a certain number will close,” said Kate Bauer, executive director of the American Association of Birth Centers. “But we’ve had several long-standing birth centers close [in 2025] and that hits particularly hard.”
In California, which has some of the strictest birth center licensing rules in the country, concern over the closure of at least 19 birth centers between 2020 and 2024 prompted the state legislature to pass a law in October to streamline birth center licensure.
An appealing alternative
Freestanding birth centers are not attached to hospitals and aim to provide a more homelike, less traditional medical setting. They employ midwives and focus on low-risk pregnancies and births. Some also have an OB-GYN or family medicine doctor on staff, and they often have partnerships with nearby hospitals and doctors if more specialized care is required.
Some Black and Indigenous midwives and doulas say birth centers can be helpful alternatives to their community members, many of whom have had experiences in more medicalized settings that left them feeling marginalized, dismissed or unsafe.
Midwife Jamarah Amani, executive director of Southern Birth Justice Network, runs a mobile midwifery clinic serving majority-Black and Latino neighborhoods in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The nonprofit, which aims to make midwife and doula care more accessible, recently bought a building for a freestanding birth center it aims to open in 2027.
“[Midwifery] presents like a luxury concierge-type of service, and our goal is to really change that and to bring it back to the community in a very grassroots way,” Amani said. She added that expanding access to prenatal care could help address inequities in maternal health, as maternal death rates among Black women are three times higher than those among white women.
Freestanding birth centers also can be a solution for communities without a hospital nearby.
The closest hospital to the Colville Indian Reservation, located in northern Washington state, is half an hour away, said Faith Zacherle-Tonasket, founder of the nonprofit xa?xa? Indigenous Birth Justice.
So far, the group has trained nearly a dozen tribal doulas and midwives to serve the area. In the next few years, it plans to open a freestanding birth center. Zacherle-Tonasket said Indigenous-run birth centers are crucial alternatives for tribal women, who also have some of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation and often face prejudice in clinical settings.
“They don’t feel safe. So a lot of them just don’t get prenatal care,” said Zacherle-Tonasket. “Bringing traditional midwives that are from our own communities, that were born and raised in our communities, that know the families — we know that those babies will be birthed with love.”
Regulatory hurdles
When the Georgia legislature relaxed state health care regulations in 2024, it felt like a long-awaited win for Katie Chubb. A registered nurse and mother of three who’s worked in health and nonprofits, Chubb has spent years trying to open a birth center in Augusta.
The state denied her application to open the center in 2021. Georgia, like many states, requires health care providers to get state approval, called a certificate of need, before they can build a new facility or expand services. Rival providers, like other hospitals, can challenge an application, effectively vetoing their local competition.
That happened in Chubb’s case: Two local hospitals filed letters of opposition against her and refused to say they’d accept emergency transfers from her birth center, another requirement for opening.
Georgia currently has three freestanding birth centers, a fraction of the more than two dozen that operate in neighboring Florida.
“We’re seeing women giving birth in hospital hallways or at home unassisted, because there’s no in-between option like a birth center,” Chubb said. In October, Georgia lost another labor and delivery unit at a rural hospital two hours north of Augusta.
“Women are just left to figure things out.”

In Kentucky, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a bill in March that aimed to clear the way for freestanding birth centers by exempting them from the certificate of need process.
But Republican lawmakers attached a last-minute anti-abortion amendment to the bill, prompting Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear to veto it. The legislature eventually overrode his veto. Midwifery advocates hope the new law will help make it easier to open a birth center in the state.
Georgia legislators similarly revised Georgia’s certificate of need rules in 2024, exempting freestanding birth centers. Chubb, who championed the new law, hoped it would clear the path for herself and others.
But they hit another roadblock. The state still requires birth centers to secure a written agreement with a local hospital to accept transfers of clients in emergencies. Chubb and at least one other prospective birth center owner have been unable to get their local hospitals to sign such transfer agreements.
“We’re still fighting,” Chubb said. “Behind closed doors we’re still working very hard on getting legislation and regulations changed to make opening birth centers more equitable.”
Some hospitals view birth centers as a threat to the viability of their labor and delivery units, siphoning off patients and revenue from a service that’s already unprofitable for most hospitals.
Daniel Grigg, CEO of Wallowa Memorial Hospital, a 25-bed critical access hospital in northeast Oregon, said there aren’t enough births in the area for both hospitals and birth centers.
“When you’ve got a small-volume community like we have, every birth helps the providers keep their skills up and their competency,” he said. “When you’ve got a midwife taking, say, 10 patients out of that pool,” it can have an impact on physicians and hospitals.
Alabama lawsuit
After the Alabama Department of Public Health shut down Skanes’ birth center in 2023, she joined with two other women who had also been attempting to open birth centers in Alabama: Dr. Yashica Robinson, an OB-GYN in North Alabama, and Stephanie Mitchell, a licensed midwife in Alabama’s rural and economically disadvantaged Black Belt region. Together they sued the Alabama Department of Public Health over what they called a de facto ban on birth centers.
The state insisted its tighter regulations would ensure that birth center facilities are safe. The birth center owners said the state’s rules were overly burdensome and clinically unnecessary for the low-risk, nonsurgical births that are attended by midwives. And, they said, the rules prevented more families from accessing care where it’s desperately needed. The state has lost at least three hospital labor and delivery units since 2020.
“Entire swaths of the state are maternity care deserts without access to essential health care,” said Whitney White, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the birth center owners and their co-plaintiff, the Alabama affiliate of the American College of Nurse-Midwives.
“Hospital labor and delivery units are closing, and pregnant folks are reporting they’re really struggling to access the care they need, struggling to get appointments, struggling to find a provider,” White said.
US hospitals see stark decline of obstetric services, study shows

Last May, an Alabama trial court permanently blocked the state from regulating freestanding birth centers as hospitals. Birth center staff are still overseen by state boards of midwifery and nursing.
All three Alabama centers are now open. But their licensed midwives are delivering babies under a cloud of uncertainty about the future.
The state appealed the ruling in November. The case is ongoing.
Struggles and solutions
Bauer, of the American Association of Birth Centers, said many centers face the same financial barriers. Uncomplicated births at freestanding birth centers cost less than they do at hospitals, but research has shown that insurers, including Medicaid, reimburse centers at lower rates. Some state Medicaid programs don’t cover some of the nonclinical services, such as lactation consultants and doulas, that birth centers may provide. And malpractice premiums are rising.
“We’re volunteering our time, essentially, to keep the birth center open as a service to the community,” said Sarah Simmons, co-owner of Maple Street Birth Center in rural Okanogan County, Washington. The center can’t afford to hire a front-desk staffer or another midwife, Simmons said. She added that on average, the center makes less than a third of what the local hospital makes for providing the same obstetric service.
But there may be solutions to some of these financial problems. For example, the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a national health care policy center, has recommended that health insurance plans, both Medicaid and commercial, pay hospitals and birth centers monthly or quarterly “standby capacity payments” per woman of childbearing age covered by that health plan in the facility’s service area. It also recommends that plans pay a separate delivery fee for each birth.
In 2024, Democratic U.S. senators proposed a bill to allow for a similar payment model.
Standby payments could help freestanding birth centers, especially those that fill gaps in maternity care deserts — but not unless centers receive payments that are comparable to those that hospitals get, said Simmons, whose center serves four sparsely populated counties along with the Colville tribal communities.
“This would be most beneficial to freestanding birth centers if pay parity laws were enforced, so rural freestanding birth centers were paid the same rates for the same services as rural hospitals, ” she said.
State grants also can help, but birth centers say a one-time infusion won’t be enough. In 2024, Washington opened grant applications for distressed hospital labor and delivery units and freestanding birth centers.
Ashley Jones, of True North Birth Center and president of the Washington chapter of the American Association of Birth Centers, said the grant has helped keep their doors open.
Meanwhile, Chubb, the Georgia nurse, recently had to take another job to support her family while her birth center remains in legal limbo.
“I’m just waiting until the government figures out what they’re doing.”

(Getty Images)As Americans struggle to afford groceries and utilities, a new study finds that three Ohio cities are among the most expensive for another essential — medical care. 
Cleveland, Toledo and Cincinnati are in the top 11 in terms of how big a bite medical expenses take out of their incomes, according to a WalletHub analysis of the 100 largest American cities.
For decades, inflating health care costs have far outpaced inflation in the economy as a whole. Between 2000 and 2024, the cost of medical care rose 121%, compared to 86% for the overall economy, according to the Peterson-KFF Health Tracker. 
Meanwhile, grocery prices have jumped more than 29% since 2020 with “no end in sight,” NPR reported in September. And many Ohio electricity consumers have seen increases as high as 44% just this year, according to Consumer Energy Solutions.
Ohioans’ pay hasn’t kept up. Adjusted for inflation, median annual income has actually dropped from about $71,000 in 2019 to $67,873 four years later, according to the Ohio Housing Finance Agency.

All of that is leaving families in a bind, the WalletHub report said.
“As health care gets increasingly more expensive, more and more people find themselves struggling to afford essential services and medicines,” it quoted analyst Chip Lupo as saying. “While some cities have lower prices than others, the average income in many places still may not be enough to keep up with the costs, especially when consumers have also faced inflated prices across all other facets of their budgets over the past few years.”
So it’s not great news that some Ohio cities are among the nation’s most expensive when it comes to health care. 
WalletHub analyzed data collected in November by the Census Bureau and the Council for Community and Economic Research. 
It compared the cost of doctor, dentist and optometrist visits as well the prices of ibuprofen and insulin glargine in each of the 100 largest cities. It then expressed those costs as a percentage of the cities’ median annual incomes.
Cleveland had the dubious distinction of coming in second, with medical costs making up 11.35% of median monthly household income. 
“This is largely due to the fact that Cleveland has the lowest median household income in the country, at $39,187 per year,” the report said, adding that medicine prices were relatively high in the city, while the cost of provider visits was relatively low.
Toledo came in fourth on the list, with medical costs making up 11.03% of median monthly income, and Cincinnati was 11th, at 8.98%. Columbus was 64th at 6.09%, putting it in the lower-cost half of big cities.

The fate of child care in Ohio is also impacted by federal decisions, including funding for Head Start programs and a Child Care and Development Block Grant.
Advocates say the recent government shutdown already caused issues in a field that’s struggling to keep up with demand and costs.
“The disruption to Ohio’s federally funded Head Start programs in 2025 – proposed budget cuts and the destabilizing government shutdown – was unprecedented,” said Julie Stone, executive director of the Ohio Head Start Association, Inc.
With Congress’ Jan. 30 deadline to yet again pass a federal spending bill, the potential for future struggles is mounting.
“Ohio’s children, families, providers, and communities are counting on strong federal investments and stable, year-round funding,” the child advocacy group Groundwork Ohio wrote in a fundraising email to supporters this month.
Groundwork’s president and CEO, Lynanne Gutierrez, said they are holding on to hope that agreement can be made on the federal level. Plus, with a strong infrastructure at the state level, she said there’s lots of data that can inform the work of the next governor, whoever that may end up being.
While the major-party candidates have not been officially decided yet, Gutierrez said her group has had conversations with the campaigns of both Dr. Amy Acton and Vivek Ramaswamy, gubernatorial candidates on the Democratic and Republican sides respectively.
“We see opportunities with both candidates, because this really is a bipartisan issue,” Gutierrez told the Capital Journal. “We’re committed to being a partner to whoever the next governor is.”
State funding will be a big part of the 2026 strategy for child care advocates, as they face a $600 million budget shortfall that will hit in 2028 as one-time federal funding goes away, according to Gutierrez.
“We believe that, just sort of back of the envelope math, that gap will mean there’s 30,000 kids per year who would lose access to care,” Gutierrez said.
Head Start leaders share the concern around the funding shortfall, and Stone said the strength of Head Start’s services “will be crucial to maximizing family access to care.”
As for state funding, the most recent state operating budget left eligibility for the Publicly Funded Child Care program at 145% of the federal poverty level, despite calls for the level to be raised to 160% or even 200%.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXA cost-sharing model called the Child Care Cred Program that splits child care costs among the state, employers and employees who apply for the program received a $10 million appropriation. The budget provision started out as GOP-led legislation in both the Ohio House and the Ohio Senate, but policy analysts say other states who have tried the program have seen “lackluster” results.
The Child Care Choice Voucher Program also received $50 million over the next two years in the state budget. The money will come from federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds.
While grant programs to support recruitment and mentorship in the child care sector were included in the budget, the amounts the state contributed to them went from as much as $3.2 million in House budget drafts, down to $2.85 million in the final budget.
There’s going to be a harder lift as the new year begins, partly because the incremental funding changes advocates have attempted to persuade the Ohio legislature to take have fallen by the wayside, leaving the large gap, a number of that could prove too eye-popping for policymakers to take on.
“I’m sure we’re not the only (sector) with a funding gap, and there’s not going to be new federal money that’s going to be able to cover this gap,” Gutierrez said.
Accessibility and affordability continue to be issues for child care providers and families alike. According to a 2025 child care survey of central Ohio conducted by the Ohio-based non-profit Action for Children, 16% of providers in that area are unsure whether they will remain open in the next three months, a 5% increase from 2024 data.
“Providers have even deeper concerns about long-term stability, with over half (58%) of all providers unsure if they will be open in the next 12 months, without additional public support,” the report stated.
The research found that nearly half of the providers who participated in the report say their monthly revenue doesn’t cover expenses. The providers are also seeing less-than-capacity enrollment, with about 70% enrollment from facility to facility.
“Under-enrollment can cause financial challenges for child care providers who often operate on thin margins even when fully enrolled,” the report stated. “Lack of full enrollment can put the program at risk of closure, and so, decrease stability for the families it serves, and exacerbate shortages of affordable, quality care.”
The cost of child care has been debated by the legislature for years, with various bills attempted, from cost-sharing models to family tax credits. But with state funding dips and federal money being cut or fading away, struggles may continue for families who need the care.
The Action for Children study found child care to be “out of reach” for many households in central Ohio, and for those who can afford it, it’s “often their largest single monthly expense.”
In Franklin County, for example, the lowest median cost of child care makes up 14.6% of the average income in the county, where the median household income is $1,367 per week.
Gutierrez said driving down cost will of course be a big part of Groundwork’s work within the legislature next year.
“Affordability is the number one for families … (we’re) looking at both child care and potential child tax credit policies to help hard-working families,” she said.

That includes Ohio secretary of state, attorney general, auditor, treasurer. Two Ohio Supreme Court justice seats will also be up for election this year.

Former Ohio Department of Health director Dr. Amy Acton is running as a Democratic candidate for governor. Former Congressman Tim Ryan announced he will not run for governor, essentially clearing a path for Acton to be the Democratic nominee.   
Acton has received nominations from the Ohio Federation of Teachers, Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, the Ohio Association of Public School Employees, AFSCME Ohio Council 8, former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, and the United Auto Workers.
There are two Republican candidates running for governor — entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and political newcomer Casey Putsch. The Ohio Republican Party officially endorsed Ramaswamy in May 2025.
Ramaswamy has secured trade union endorsements including the Ohio Teamsters Union and the Central Regional Council of Carpenters. President Donald Trump and the Center for Christian Virtue’s president have also endorsed Ramaswamy, who ran for president in 2024. 
Putsch lives in northwest Ohio and is a founder of the nonprofit Genius Garage car charity.  
Political newcomer Heather Hill is also running for governor as an independent after leaving the Republican party. 
Former Democratic state Rep. Elliot Forhan and John Kulewicz, a retired attorney and Upper Arlington City Council member, are running in the Democratic primary for Ohio attorney general. Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is also running for attorney general. 
Democratic Ohio House state Rep. Allison Russo and Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, are running in the Democratic primary for secretary of state.
Current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and retired Air Force intel officer Marcell Strbich are running in the Republican primary for secretary of state. 
Current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for state auditor in 2026. 
A Republican primary for the nomination for Ohio treasurer includes former state Sen. Niraj Antani, current state Sen. Kristina Roegner, former state Rep. Jay Edwards, and Lake County Treasurer Michael Zuren.
No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer. 
Two Ohio Supreme Court races will be on the 2026 ballot.
Democratic Ohio Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Brunner is being challenged by four Republicans competing in a primary — former Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Colleen O’Donnell, Fifth District Court of Appeals Judge Andrew King, Second District Court of Appeals Judge Ron Lewis, and State Appellate Judge Jill Flagg Lanzinger. 
Brunner is the only Democratic judge on the 6-1 Ohio Supreme Court. 
Republican Ohio Supreme Court Justice Dan Hawkins is up for reelection next year against Democratic candidate First District Court of Appeals Judge Marilyn Zayas, who previously ran unsuccessfully for Ohio Supreme Court in 2022 when she lost to Justice Pat DeWine by a 13% margin. 
The filing deadline to run for Ohio office is Feb. 4, Ohio’s primary election is May 5, and the general election is Nov. 3. 
The last time a Democratic candidate won any of Ohio statewide executive offices was back in 2006 when Ted Strickland was elected governor, Marc Dann was elected attorney general, Richard Cordray was elected treasurer, and Jennifer Bruner was elected secretary of state. 
Also in 2026, former Ohio Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown will challenge appointed Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, who replaced JD Vance in the chamber. Husted is seeking his first election to the position.

A small group of Venezuelans, their loved ones and advocates gathered Sunday at the Gen. Simón Bolívar Memorial near the National Mall to celebrate the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.
President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that U.S. military forces captured Maduro and Flores in an overnight raid on their home. Both were brought to the U.S., where they face narco-terrorism charges.
The U.S.’ overnight military operation knocked out electricity in parts of Venezuela’s capital of Caracas and included strikes on military installations. That was followed by Trump’s remarks Saturday that the U.S. would “run” Venezuela in the interim.
Many in the U.S., however, remain divided over Trump’s invasion and capture of another country’s leader, especially considering the lack of congressional approval to carry out the operation. Critics worry it will drag the U.S. into another costly war, saying the president is only doing this to gain access to Venezuelan oil.
But, Maduro’s capture is also being welcomed by many Venezuelans as he is widely seen by opponents — within his country and by foreign governments — as having illegitimately won Venezuela’s 2024 election.
The memorial statue where Sunday’s festivities took place honors Simón Bolívar, popularly known as “The Liberator” for his work securing the independence of multiple Latin American countries, including Venezuela, from Spanish rule in the 1800s.
‘The usurper president’
In attendance was Gabriela Montero, an award-winning Venezuelan pianist and human rights advocate who performed at the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony for Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado.

“This is not a matter of the U.S. coming in and taking our riches and taking our resources. This is about removing from office a group, and in this case, right now, the usurper president, and allowing, in this next phase, a space for a transition which will finally lead the road to our freedom,” Montero said.
When asked if he had any reservations about U.S. military action in Venezuela, Montero’s husband Sam McElroy responded, “none, whatsoever.”
“I can fully understand why people, for example, are concerned about the extrajudicial nature of the bombing of the boats, and how this was done without an act of Congress, or without consulting Congress. But, you also have to deal with the problem as you see it and as you find it,” McElroy said.
“It was an extraction of two criminals, not an extraction of a president, because he’s not the president of Venezuela,” he said. “He was the illegitimate usurper, a criminal who was extracted. So we must get that right.”
Both Montero and McElroy consider Edmundo González to be the legitimate winner of the 2024 presidential election.
“Venezuelans, we have, for the last 20-plus years, voted. We’ve marched. We’ve tried to find our way to democracy through democratic means,” Montero said.
“We’ve done everything that was required of us as a peaceful people without the arms that the military and the government, unfortunately, own, and we’ve done everything that we could to be able to free ourselves and to become a democratic state again, and it’s been impossible.”
Carlos Figueroa attended Sunday’s celebration with his family.
He expressed gratitude to the Trump administration, saying he never thought he’d see Maduro brought to justice for creating “unbearable conditions” in Venezuela. He said that after decades, many Venezuelans who initially fled the country will feel safe coming home.
“The rule of law is not yet restored in the country. When that happens, then, of course, millions of Venezuelans will return back. And, definitely, that’s my expectation too,” Figueroa said.
‘Hands off Venezuela’
Just blocks away at the White House, another small group gathered, but with different intentions: To protest both U.S. military action in Venezuela and the capturing of Maduro and Flores.

Robbie McLuckie was part of that group. He held a sign reading, “Hands off Venezuela.”
“I’m just really concerned about the military action on Venezuela. I think it should have gone through Congress, and the Trump administration took unilateral action and impacted the sovereign rights of another country,” McLuckie said.
“Obviously, Maduro is a complicated, bad guy. He wasn’t a good leader. He mistreated his people. But, that doesn’t mean we need to be invading other people’s countries without congressional approval, kidnapping their leader, and bringing them back. I think that’s really scary.”
Also part of that group was a demonstrator named Jose, who shared similar concerns.
“We know very well that, you know, the natural resources are one of the primary interests to do all these kinds of attacks,” Jose said.
“You know, I’m from Bolivia, and Bolivia, we have one of the biggest resources of lithium, and we know that this is going to happen to us,” he said. “If that happened to Venezuela, we are next.”
But Venezuelans, like Montero and Figueroa, remain steadfast in their support for the Trump administration’s operation.
“A lot of people think they understand Venezuela. They’ve just arrived in the conversation. We’ve been in this fight for 27 years,” Montero said.
“Ask a Venezuelan, ask us what our story is, ask us how much we suffered and we’ve lost. Ask us, you know, to inform you, to educate you,” she said. “Don’t presume to know, because this is a complex situation.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)As 2026 begins, so does the second year of Maine’s two-year legislative session.
The official start of the second regular session of the 132nd Legislature is Jan. 7, but throughout the fall the 35 members of the Maine Senate and 151 members of the House of Representatives have been revising proposals and introducing emergency measures with the guidance of analysts and other staff. 
Most legislation is proposed before the start of the two-year cycle, ahead of what is referred to as the “long session,” which typically lasts from January through June. 
This year’s “short session” — scheduled to end on April 15, though it’s possible it’ll run longer — will be focused on legislation carried over from 2025, with some new proposals, including a supplemental budget.  
Legislation 
During the first year of the 132nd Legislature in 2025, legislators passed a biennial budget and a budget addition, as well as hundreds of new laws, which added protections from ticket scams, prohibited the doxing of children, and shielded health care providers by allowing them to remove their names from the label of abortion drugs, among other things.  
But lawmakers and the governor pushed off the fate of hundreds of other bills to the second regular session. 
Gov. Janet Mills postponed her decision on 61 bills that have already passed both chambers of the Legislature, such as proposals to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine and establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following the state’s largest toxic foam spill in Brunswick.
Mills can either veto these bills within the first three days of the next session or allow them to become law without her signature after that. 
She’s already announced her intention to allow at least two to become law: one that will restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement and another that will require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns.
The 61 bills being held are in addition to nearly 400 that the Legislature opted to carry over into next year. That legislation includes all of the measures that were left on what are referred to as the appropriations and study tables. The bills that end up on these tables have largely passed the full Legislature but still needed to vie for remaining funding, or in the case of studies, legislative staff in order to help conduct them. 
The House and Senate will also consider some new proposals the Legislative Council, a group composed of the ten legislative leaders, approved in the fall. 
For example, the council accepted a bill from Senate Assistant Majority Leader Jill Duson (D-Cumberland) that seeks to protect due process in immigration detentions. 
Each bill is assigned to one of the 17 joint legislative committees, which hold public hearings and work sessions and then cast votes that serve as recommendations for how the full Legislature should vote. But, the full Legislature doesn’t always agree with the committee. 
The chamber in which a bill’s sponsor resides determines whether the House or Senate takes a bill up first. Legislation has to make it through both the chambers (​​which means passing at least four steps on the floor in each: first reading, second reading, engrossment and enactment) in order to get to the governor, who can either sign the bill, allow it to become law without her signature or veto it. 
If Mills does the latter, lawmakers can override a veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber, though the Legislature has so far never done this during her tenure. 
But, there are also other — less visible — ways bills can die. Notably, the appropriations table, where bills are placed to vie for remaining funding if not funded in the budget. (During the 131st Legislature, less than 10% of bills placed on the appropriations table ultimately became law.)
Any bills the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee decides to fund off the table still need approval again by the full Legislature and ultimately the governor. 
Budget 
Each legislative session, lawmakers are tasked with passing a biennial budget in the first year and a supplemental budget in the second year to adjust for changes in revenue or priorities. 
There remains a fair amount of economic uncertainty as the governor and lawmakers begin to debate adjustments. 
The state is expected to take in nearly $250 million more over the next two years than previously estimated. But as Maine State Economist Amanda Rector said during a Dec. 15 briefing to the appropriations committee, “It is important to bear in mind that there is a high degree of risk associated with the forecast as a result of the extremely uncertain economic environment we continue to face,” noting federal changes such as tariffs and a lack of jobs and inflation data, among overall economic unpredictability.  
The governor proposes her budget plan first, which she submits to lawmakers, specifically the appropriations committee. The appropriations committee then holds public hearings on each part of the plan before it puts forth a budget bill to be considered by the full Legislature.  
Unlike the federal government, which can take on debt, the governor is required to propose a balanced budget. The Legislature then bears the responsibility of enacting a budget — in conjunction with all other spending bills — in which spending doesn’t exceed available resources in those specific fiscal years.
Like other bills, the budget bill can either pass as an emergency measure, which requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers and would allow it to take effect immediately upon approval by the governor, or as a non-emergency measure, which only requires a majority vote in both chambers and would result in the bill taking effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns. 
Last session, the Democratic majority passed both the initial biennial budget that largely continued funding at the same levels and the budget addition that later added policy changes without Republican support.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which the White House said will be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center.  (Photo courtesy of Kennedy Center)Nebraskans will remember 2025 as a year when grocery, coffee shop or online retail receipts got them in touch with “affordability” … or lack thereof. As we begin a new year, all of us should consider other meanings for the word. 
To wit: CBS’s “60 Minutes” ranks among television’s most iconic programs. Its long, well-respected run began five years after the assasination of John F. Kennedy. Both benchmarks are back in headlines … reminding us of what we can’t afford.
As widely reported, the new, inexperienced editor-in-chief at CBS News killed a “60 Minutes” segment last month that exposed serious problems in the administration’s immigration enforcement practices. 
The piece’s cutting came on the heels of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts board — handpicked by the president — added his name to the building, which is a memorial to JFK. 
I rarely write about other media, lest readers confuse criticism with a cheap shot or praise with professional bias. I’ll take that chance here because the “60 Minutes” dustup is more than simply looking at one piece of journalism. 
It’s about whether journalists can continue practicing their profession as they have since 1791, when we ratified the Bill of Rights. If you’re keeping score at home, the Fourth Estate has been at it about 235 years. 
You know the particulars: No government interference with citizens’ rights and freedom to be informed … as we do also with speech, assembly, prayer and petitioning. 
The government did not directly spike the “60 Minutes” story, which was about the country deporting immigrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador. The reporter has publicly denounced the decision as political rather than journalistic. 
Her boss argued that the story should be held until the reporter obtained comments from the administration, something the reporter had sought several times but got no response. 
The reporter wrote, rightly, that if officials can undo a story by not commenting when given the chance, they effectively have a “kill switch” for any piece with which they might disagree.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Journalism holds accountable those in power, who spend taxpayer money, make and enforce laws by which we live, govern according to the Constitution and are responsible for safeguarding the rights of those who gave them such power. 
When “news” capitulates in the face of government displeasure or criticism — before or after the fact — freedom is restricted and information filtered or erased. In a democracy, that’s simply unaffordable, a price too steep to pay.
The postscript to the “60 Minutes” hullabaloo was a modern “miracle.” CBS had already sent the segment to a Canadian streaming service, where it was promptly bootlegged and shone all over the internet. It’s a solid piece of journalism, well-reported and neither sensational nor unseemly. What we’ve come to expect from “60 Minutes.” The hope is that we can continue to do so.
Slapping another name on the Kennedy Center fails any number of tests, not the least of which is that only Congress, because federal law created the place, can effect such a change. The president and the center’s board know that, legal principles apparently be damned.
Other failures are at work here. One is history. In 1955 President Eisenhower appointed a commission to consider a new public center for the performing arts in the nation’s capital. That culminated in the National Cultural Center Act passed in 1958. As president, JFK led the effort to raise funds to build the center. 
After his assasination, federal legislation renamed what was then the National Cultural Center to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a “living memorial” to the former president. 
Attaching another name, even a twice-elected president who had nothing to do with the center’s inception and spirit, chafes against this history and simple good taste. Just last week, when the Kennedys were mourning the loss of JFK’s granddaughter, the president belittled their support of the center.
Not that long ago we witnessed much political hand-wringing about government overreach, nefarious plots and ploys we were told unnecessarily injected the feds’ reach where it didn’t belong. The worry? The government was meddling in our personal lives, changing the rules and costing us our freedoms.
Overreach can happen in other ways, too. When, for example, the government casts a large shadow over the reporting of the news. Or it decides that the rules and regulations of the institutions and infrastructures on which our politics and our way of life operate can be ignored or flouted.
A democratic republic like ours, in its 250th year, can afford neither.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)It’s a new year here in the Free State of Florida and you’re freer than ever!
Free to tote guns; free to kill bears; free to drain and pave; free to call ICE if you spy some brown-complected fellows in the Home Depot parking lot.
Most of all, you’re free to make New Year’s Resolutions.
Not the usual crap about getting more exercise, practicing mindfulness, adding legumes to your diet or volunteering.
Nonsense.
We’re Americans: selfish, lazy, and overweight.
Now, I don’t know what resolutions your elected officials and other powerful Florida folk have made, but here are a few guesses and predictions for the Year of Our Lord 2026.
Assuming there’s not a world-wide conflagration, an almighty flood, or a plague of frogs, in which case all bets are off.
1. In preparation for a 2028 presidential run, Gov. Ronald Dion DeSantis will resolve to learn to smile properly.
And be nice.
Or nice-adjacent.
As you recall, voters didn’t exactly warm to him in 2024. He was, as one columnist put it, “an all-around odd duck and not in a good way.”
The solution? Charm School!
Avenues of Excellence in Coral Gables offers private lessons in everything from social discourse to how one does and does not eat one’s chocolate pudding.
2. Sen. Stan McClain and Rep. Dean Black resolve that in 2026 they will protect Florida’s Confederate monuments, slapping fines on Damn Yankees who dare try and remove them.
It didn’t pass last year but, by God and General Lee, the bill will be heard in the Legislature this year.
Why not go bigger? Get more Confederate names back on schools and roads.
Ditch the “Barack Obama” and “Harriet Tubman” street signs and return to calling the Old Dixie Highway the Old Dixie Highway.
The Pentagon has brought the names of Confederate generals Bragg and Benning back to the military bases where they belong. (There was a federal law against that, so Pete Hegseth found some people with the same last names that he could borrow.)
Now, how about righting the wrong done to Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest? Jacksonville wokesters forced N.B. Forrest High School to change its name to “Westside.”
Political correctness run amok.
Forrest was a valiant soldier, a human resources entrepreneur (some called it “slave trading”) and, as Grand Wizard of the Invisible Empire, a pioneering anti-DEI campaigner.
3. How ’bout them ’Noles!
I do not mean this in a good way.
FSU’s once-vaunted football team did not cover itself in glory this season.
Nor did the University of Florida’s: The Gators went 4-8; the Seminoles 5-7.
A couple of directional colleges went to bowls: FIU appeared in the Servpro First Responder Bowl (lost) and USF in the StaffDNA Cure Bowl (also lost).
On the plus side, the ever-annoying University of Miami beat the even-more-annoying Ohio State in the first playoff.
But Texas had eight teams in post-season play.
Texas. Eight.
Florida athletic programs are struggling. They have to build indoor practice facilities. They have to hire a coach and pay him millions, then millions more when they fire him.
It’s tough.
Therefore, every Floridian must resolve to give generously to the Name, Image, and Likeness Collective of their choice to help buy the best players in the nation.
While you’re at it, you can support some of their proud sponsors, including Cambio Tequila and Social House Vodka.
4. Why don’t we all pitch in and help ban more books this year?
Local cranks and Moms for Liberty can’t do all the work.
Many of Toni Morrison’s books are off the shelves, as well as “Slaughterhouse Five,” Kurt Vonnegut’s mind-bending anti-war novel, which one Mom for Liberty called “shocking and perverse.”
She elaborated: “I don’t think [my daughter] needs to fill her head with pictures and ideas of Shetland ponies having sex with girls.”
Still, too many works of literature remain unbanned.
John Keats’ 1820 poem “The Eve of St. Agnes,” for example, which promotes unmarried sex and the eating of strange, possibly hallucinogenic, foodstuffs: “spiced dainties” and “lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon.”
Or “Moby Dick” (that title!) which depicts two men sleeping in the same bed and calling each other “husband and wife.”
Or William Faulkner’s “Go Down, Moses,” a Critical Race Theory novel which implies that slavery was really quite bad.
Get to work, people. Make 2026 the year our children read nothing but the clean-ish bits of the Bible.
5. Members of Florida’s well-upholstered “developer community” make the same resolution every New Year’s: erect strip malls, big box stores, golf courses, and ticky-tack exurban “communities” on what’s left of Florida’s unspoiled lands.
I wouldn’t be surprised if they inscribed their vow in the blood of road-kill critters on sheep skin.
Even though tiresome “knee-jerk obstructionists” (as one legislator calls people who care about clean water, habitat destruction, and sprawl) fight back.
Sometimes the tree-huggers even win.
As the Phoenix’s Craig Pittman reported, the Sarasota Audubon Club stopped the nation’s largest homebuilder from parking 170 houses next to a bird sanctuary.
In Orange County, enraged residents said a big hell no to a Texas outfit planning to build an 1,800-house monstrosity on land zoned rural.
But this year, developers are getting a little help from their friends in the Florida Legislature.
The peoples’ representatives plan to push through a brace of bills that would hamstring the public’s ability to object to developments, allow city or county administrators – not elected commissioners, answerable to the voters – to approve projects, and override local government.
No opportunity for corruption there, no sir.
6, The Florida Democratic Party (Yes! It still exists!) also makes the same resolution every New Year’s: Win an election.
Any election.
And dang, if they didn’t snag one in 2025!
A non-Republican female human beat a Donald-Trump-and-Ron-DeSantis-endorsed Republican male person to become mayor of Miami.
Republicans were typically gracious in defeat.
The Miami-Dade County Party Chairman said, Democrats were “making a mountain out of a molehill.
“It’s not a rebuke of the president or the party. Democratic city elects Democratic mayor.”
Even though this Democratic city hasn’t elected a Democratic mayor in 28 years.
If nothing else, it may perk up our Donkey friends.
A little.
David Jolly, a former U.S representative and former Republican, is running for governor as a Democrat.
But Rep. Byron Donalds, Donald Trump’s preferred candidate, leads in the polls.
As befits a MAGA man, Donalds is given to saying things divorced from both history and intelligence.
Perhaps you are unaware that, while Jim Crow wasn’t great, at least “the Black family was together” and politically “conservative.”
Never mind the lynchings.
7. Speaking of the gubernatorial race, the Republican Party of Florida might consider worrying about the upstart candidacy of one James Fishback, a 31-year-old Elon Musk fanboy now being sued by his former hedge fund employer.
Fishback’s building name recognition in a peculiar way, getting thrown out of an economic conference for confronting Federal Reserve board member Lisa Cook (the one Trump keeps trying to fire), demanding foreign students pay $1 million a year in tuition at Florida universities, and calling Byron Donalds a “slave” and “DEI Donalds.”
Combustible Florida U.S. Rep. Rep. Randy Fine, who was once ordered by a judge to attend anger management classes, and who said Palestinians in Gaza should “starve away,” calls Fishback “a total weirdo.”
Obviously, he’s an exemplary MAGA candidate.
8. The governor and the grim band of anti-intellectuals who rule higher education in Florida have yet to declare this resolution out loud, but it’s pretty clear they want 2026 to be the year they turn all our universities into New College.
Once a highly regarded liberal arts school where non-traditional students – outside-the-box thinkers, gay kids, trans kids, arty kids – were as welcome as more mainstream students, where learning was creative, not prescriptive, New College is now sad and second-rate.
Determined to quash academic freedom across the state system, DeSantis has installed ideologically aligned presidents at UWF, USF, FIU, FAU, and FAMU.
The interim (soon to be permanent) president of the University of Florida, a climate change skeptic, has ordered UF to be “institutionally neutral.”
What he means is “conservative.”
UF has shut down its Department of Environmental Horticulture (“environmental” is a bad word), abolished its Center for Inclusion and Multicultural Engagement, and shuttered its Office of Sustainability.
Many humanities and social sciences programs are endangered, too.
But the spanking new Hamilton School for Classical and Civic Education, run by the very conservative former state Supreme Court chief justice Charles Canady and endowed by, among others, by the right-wing Council on University Reform and billionaire DeSantis donor Ken Griffin gets all the money it wants.
Institutional neutrality roars into the future, charged with teaching the superiority of Western Civilization.
All I can say is Happy New Year, y’all.
And good luck.
We’ll need it.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0934-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 00:11:42.031318

We do little to prevent this, so there is only one plausible conclusion: We are okay with it.","Last month Abdulah Kanchero, of New Haven, and Francisco J. Diaz-Aquino and Johanna  Beatriz Navas-Gonzalez, of Stamford, died in the cold, unsheltered.
On the night Kanchero passed, the Unhoused Activist Community Team (UACT), including 18 people who had been turned away from full warming centers, occupied New Haven City Hall. After sending police to throw everyone out into the frigid night, the administration relented and opened an additional overflow warming center in a meeting room in the Hall of Records.
Following the deaths in Stamford, Gov. Ned Lamont released state funding for homelessness services to partially make up for federal cuts in that area.
Whenever the death of an unhoused person makes the news, there is wringing of hands and perhaps token action. Here’s the thing: Winter comes every year; and we know that it will kill about 700 unhoused people in this country. We do so little to prevent these deaths, there is only one plausible conclusion: We are okay with it.
Our economy needs homelessness, to support the commodification of real estate, which makes a few people rich while leaving housing unaffordable for the rest of us, and to keep worker bees buzzing busily. This year the Harris Poll found that 40% of U.S. Americans were dissatisfied with their jobs but would not quit because of fears about an uncertain economy.
“Why work?” you may ask.
“So that you don’t die on a park bench,” is a compelling answer.
Though we need homelessness, most people dislike coming face-to-face with it. My friend Rico, who has frequently lived unsheltered, once told me, “If you’re visible, you’re criminal.” The day before any parade or festival, hit the streets at dawn, and you will see police rounding up unhoused people. Sometimes they take a social worker along for cosmetic purposes, but these workers do not have enough safe accommodations to offer everyone being displaced or arrested for the crime of being poor.
New Haven Police ticketed and arrested U-ACT members and unhoused people on the Green the day the Christmas tree was erected. God bless us, everyone.

Government’s power to criminalize homelessness was bolstered by the U.S. Supreme Court’s Grants Pass decision and an executive order issued by President Donald J. Trump, which I’ve written about in depth elsewhere. When the president acted on that executive order with a militarized response to homelessness in the nation’s capital, unhoused people endured arrest and involuntary psychiatric commitment. Some took refuge deep in the woods, disconnected from any services through which they might have obtained housing.
The point has never been to end homelessness, only to punish people who experience it.
I am part of a crew of volunteers who raised the funds for and continues to support Rosette Neighborhood Village, tiny homes in New Haven for formerly unhoused people. After a tent encampment was demolished by the city, we envisioned a place where that community of neighbors could stay together. We also knew that people need a door to close, for privacy and safety. Modular units were a tenable solution. We put them up in a day for about $20,000 each. That is how you respond to an emergency.
When I visited my friends at Rosette Monday, I explained to one man how to get rid of the condensation in his unit. We’ve had a problem with drips ever since the city ordered United Illuminating to turn off our power and hence the built-in heating. Space heaters don’t warm the units evenly. Condensation results. Ostensibly, the city cut power because we do not meet state building code, which requires an individual kitchen and bathroom in a dwelling unit. (Residents share kitchen and bathroom facilities in the Amistad Catholic Worker House only steps away.)
When we appealed to the state, the city sent its own lawyer and building inspector to argue against our petition. Twice, sympathetic state representatives have introduced enabling legislation for tiny home communities administered by faith groups for unhoused people. But the bills never make it to the floor.
My colleagues came up with a rapid and affordable way to provide dignified transitional housing, without spending a dime of public money. If homelessness is a problem in search of a solution, why wouldn’t our local, state and even national governments be beating a path to our door to learn how to replicate the program?
Simple – because homelessness is not a problem. It’s a strategy to maintain an unjust economic system – and a highly effective strategy at that.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-05 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The job market is broken — and I’m graduating into it,Madisyn Kuhnly,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/05/the-job-market-is-broken-and-im-graduating-into-it/,"I love Connecticut and I want to build a career here, but this state does not do enough to make room for new graduates like me.","I’m a graduating senior majoring in communication at a Connecticut university, and instead of looking forward to the moment I cross the stage, I feel a knot in my stomach every time someone asks, “So, what are your plans after college?” 
The honest answer? I don’t know. And that terrifies me.  
All year, I’ve been doing everything I was told would set me up for success. I’ve been polishing my résumé, networking, taking internships, building a portfolio, and looking at job boards months before graduation. I’ve talked to professors, alumni, and friends. And still, every time I even think about graduation, I spiral. 



I’ve also talked to students who graduated last year, the ones who were sitting exactly where I am now. They tell me the job search is “humiliating,” “exhausting” and, most commonly, “brutal.” One friend applied to over 120 positions before getting a single interview. Another, a strong student I’ve always assumed would thrive, is still unemployed. Several others have jobs that have nothing to do with communications at all: barista, receptionist, retail. 
Sometimes, after hearing about how oversaturated this job market is, I wish I had picked a different major. But now I am in too deep. I have invested four years and thousands of dollars in this path. I cannot just turn back. So instead, I sit with the anxiety of wondering whether all this effort will pay off. 
My fear is not just emotional. It is backed by data, especially for communication and journalism majors. 
Connecticut officials like to point out that there are thousands of job openings. According to the state Department of Labor, there are 80,000 job openings statewide. But when you narrow that to media and communication roles, the picture changes. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that media and communication jobs nationwide are projected to grow more slowly than average. 

Madisyn Kuhnly

According to PR Daily, “The marketing and media/communications sectors have been among the hardest hit since the pandemic. When comparing current job openings to February 2020, they’ve endured drops of 24% and 26%, respectively.” 
Part of the problem is that many “entry-level” communications roles are not entry-level. The National Association of Colleges and Employers found that “even before AI, many entry-level jobs were facing extinction, with 35% of employers posting jobs on LinkedIn requiring three years of experience for them.” 
For communications jobs such as PR assistant, social media coordinator or event coordinator, employers often expect polished portfolios, formal client experience and multiple internships. Many students cannot afford unpaid internships. Many work full-time to pay tuition. Many commute long distances and cannot take low-paying opportunities in New York or Boston. 
We graduate qualified but not experienced enough for jobs meant for recent graduates. 
Even when we apply, we wait. And wait. And wait. 
A 2024 hiring report showed the average hiring timeline was 44 days. Communications roles, which often require writing tests, multiple interviews and portfolio reviews, can take even longer. Job seekers on forums like Reddit complain that they’re still looking for jobs many months after graduation. 
In a state like Connecticut, that timeline is dangerous. According to the United Way of Connecticut, 40% of households in 2023 were ALICE households, people who work but still cannot afford basic needs. Many new graduates fall into that category immediately — not because they are unqualified, but because the system is not built to support them. 
So yes, I am scared. I am scared I will walk across that stage, degree in hand, only to end up lost in the same maze last year’s seniors are still navigating. 
Connecticut can change this story. 
First, employers must stop calling jobs “entry-level” when they require years of experience. If companies want local talent, they must be willing to train us. 
Second, Connecticut’s colleges need real pipelines between communications programs and in-state employers, including marketing agencies, nonprofits, hospitals, universities, state agencies and local media outlets. Communications students should not be left to network or sink. 
Third, the state needs to offer paid internship opportunities, especially in communication, where unpaid internships still dominate.  
Finally, employers must shorten hiring timelines. Even a simple “no” is better than months of silence. 
I love Connecticut. I want to stay here. I want to work here. I want to build a career here. I want to build a family here. But I cannot do any of that if the state and its employers do not make space for graduates like me. 
Graduation should feel like a beginning, not an end. 
I have spent four years earning my communications degree. I just want a fair chance to use it.

It would be very easy for Maryland to get swept up in the fervor of a partisan gerrymandering arms race. But is that the right thing to do?
Bill Ferguson, President of the Maryland State Senate, has offered a wise, principled and practical argument against the idea. The General Assembly should heed his advice when it convenes for the 2026 session.
No one wants to see the election of a Democratic majority in Congress more than I do. But I’m writing today on a matter of principle that transcends party.

Instead of getting down in the mud and wrestling with our political adversaries, let’s defeat them at the polls with better ideas for serving the people and solving the nation’s problems.
Attempting to redraw Maryland’s eight Congressional districts to disenfranchise one-fourth of the State’s voters and deny them a voice in the Congress—in what would likely be a vain attempt to capture the one remaining seat held by a Republican—is not only a fool’s errand. It’s wrong.
This isn’t the Maryland way—or shouldn’t be. In these perilous times for the future of our democratic republic, it’s more important than ever to set an example, remain true to our principles of representative government, and not be lured into a tawdry pursuit of base partisanship that has already compromised the integrity and reputation of the Congress in the eyes of the American people, and poisoned the civility of our politics.
Fifty-two percent of Maryland voters are registered Democrats and control seven of the State’s eight seats in the House of Representatives. Moving Democratic voters from adjacent districts into the 1st Congressional District with the goal of defeating the lone Republican in the Delegation could put our incumbent Democrats at risk.
Experts with long experience running Maryland elections told the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission that it may already be too late to change the Congressional district map if the State hopes to ensure an orderly primary and general election process in 2026.
We can’t control what the leaders of other states do. But we can control what we do. Let our adversaries do their worst, and reveal themselves to the American people in doing so. Let them carry that mud-spattered banner, while we take up the challenge of defeating them with the power of our ideas and our commitment to deliver results that improve the lives of our people.
If America’s political system is broken, let’s dedicate ourselves to fixing it, not deal another blow to its credibility. In Maryland, let’s decide to be leaders—not merely followers in an unworthy cause.
We won’t preserve our democratic ideals and principles by imitating the tactics of political adversaries in other states who are determined to extinguish the voices of their opponents.
The speculative notion that the boundaries of Maryland’s eight House districts can be redrawn to guarantee that they will all be represented by Democrats in the next Congress is a bad bet and a bad idea.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 05:56:54.544346

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The Nebraska Medicine board announced Sunday that it had launched an “informational website” aimed at shaping public opinion against letting one of the nonprofit’s owners sell its 50% leadership stake to the other, the University of Nebraska.
The ramping up of the now-public dispute over the group’s future governance comes as the NU Board of Regents prepares for a hearing and possible vote Friday about whether to pay Clarkson Regional Health $500 million for full control.
The regents also will consider a related $300 million transaction for several Clarkson properties in and around the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s midtown Omaha campus, bringing the total price of the buyout to $800 million.
Board argues risks
Nebraska Medicine’s board, steered by people who have led some of the state’s major businesses, appears focused on peeling regents’ support from the proposal. The new website making the group’s argument is www.protectnebraskahealthcare.org.
The site argues, among other things, that compensation for specialists, doctors, nurses and staff could be compromised by state involvement. It seeks more time to find a new private partner for NU to take Clarkson’s place.
Lance Fritz, the former Union Pacific CEO who chairs the Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors, warned in a statement Sunday that ceding control over Nebraska Medicine to the government might put patients and health care providers at risk.
“It’s important that Nebraskans have access to clear and accurate information on this issue,” Fritz said. “We hope this website helps people understand what is being considered and why it is a serious concern.”
NU leaders argue opportunity
NU leaders have argued that patients will see no difference in the quality of care provided or the costs of that care. They argue NU is simply adapting to an ownership structure that reflects most modern academic medical centers.
University leaders, including NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold, have said they do not yet know how much of the $800 million would come from private donors versus public funds. Gold also acknowledged the difficult timing.
The broader NU system also faces the likelihood of additional budget cutting with the State of Nebraska confronting a projected budget shortfall and Gov. Jim Pillen’s push to cut at least $500 million in state spending.
Pillen, a former NU regent whose family runs a hog operation based in Columbus, supports the NU purchase and potential shift in ownership structure. He has said it will protect a vital asset for Nebraskans and their needs.
If the purchase happens, NU would be the sole owner of Nebraska Medicine, which offers hospitals and medical care primarily in eastern Nebraska. Nebraska Medicine’s board has described the push as akin to government healthcare.
Leadership structure questions emerge
Today, NU and Clarkson split leadership on the Nebraska Medicine board. NU says the independent board would still lead UNMC’s medical partner, but it was not immediately clear who would appoint the directors after Clarkson departs.
Following the sale, Clarkson, which helped the university build the core hospital building at 42nd and Dewey Streets, has pledged a $200 million gift to help replace it. Gold said none of the project’s public funding would pull from the budgets of other NU campuses. The campuses together finalized cuts last fall totaling $43 million. 
Clarkson offers NU its half of Nebraska Medicine, properties for $800 million

Clarkson has said it plans to use the purchase-related funds from NU to grow a local private foundation focused on providing grants aimed at making Nebraska the healthiest state in the U.S. and improving how health care is delivered and carried out.
NU leadership is facing questions of its own internally, Gold wrote in an email to UNMC faculty, staff and students on Sunday afternoon. Gold announced a campus forum set for noon Tuesday at UNMC’s Truhlsen Events Center.
Gold shared a frequently asked questions document that seeks to emphasize the university does not intend to change how Nebraska Medicine is managed. The document argues Nebraska Medicine was already run by its owners. It says Nebraska Medicine employees will not become state employees.
“When [Clarkson] began to consider resigning its position in Nebraska Medicine, it approached the Board of Regents to see if the University of Nebraska would be interested in sole-member governance,” Gold wrote. “This is a tremendous opportunity for the University of Nebraska Medical Center.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Members of Montana’s Congressional delegation quickly praised President Donald Trump and the military for the capture Saturday of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, characterized by the administration as head of a drug cartel.
U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, one of three military veterans who are members of the all-Republican delegation, said on social media that Trump acted within his powers to take “decisive military action” against an illegitimate “narco-terrorist dictator.”
“America should not be viewed as conquerer, but rather as a liberator of freedom for the (Venezuelan) people,” Zinke said in a social media post. “With the help of the United States, I am confident they will now be able to use their resources to build a better and more prosperous future.”
Trump announced on Saturday the United States would “run the country” until “a proper transition can take place.”
Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, also was captured, and they both will face a U.S. indictment on narco-terrorism and conspiracy charges levied in 2020, States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C., bureau reported.
Many elected Democrats condemned the strike and said it superseded Congress’ authority to declare war, but in posts on social media, Montana’s delegation defended the action.
“Maduro was an illegitimate dictator and narco-terror kingpin with American blood on his hands,” said U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, who, like Zinke, also served as a U.S. Navy SEAL. “The American people and the Western hemisphere are safer as a result of this operation. Thank you to our brave military and @potus.”
U.S. Air Force veteran and Rep. Troy Downing said the action shows the United States will protect its people.
“Venezuela is a fake narco-state and Nicolas Maduro was a complicit narco operator, both of which posed a direct threat to the health and safety of the American people,” Downing said. “This morning’s targeted operation put the world on notice that the United States will respond with force to criminals and adversaries threatening the safety and welfare of Americans. Peace through strength is the mission.”
States Newsroom’s D.C. bureau said the U.S. and many other countries determined Maduro’s reelection in 2024 was illegitimate.
Trump also has said the operation related to securing oil.
U.S. Sen Steve Daines, the most senior member of the Montana delegation, praised the effort.
“I commend @POTUS and our brave military and law enforcement for helping bring indicted narco-terrorist Maduro to justice today,” Daines said in a post Saturday. “The world is safer thanks to peace through strength.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1174-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-04 17:57:47.873601
