A celebration of Jon’s life will be held next summer.


Jon Fox died at home in Waterville, Vermont on September 23, 2025. His final days were sweet and full of laughter. Friends and family traveled to see him from near and far, as if beckoned by his call.
Jonathan Dean Fox was born in New York City on May 27, 1949, the second child of Sherwood Dean Fox and Marcia Seidenbond Fox. Throughout his life, he continued to share a close bond with his two sisters, Janaki Costello and Deborah Fox, who both traveled to Vermont to be by his side when he passed.
An independent thinker and a willful spirit, Jon traveled to California after high school to attend San Francisco State University. It was there that he met his match in Adrianna, who was his equal in passion and vision. Eager to make a better world, they migrated to Vermont in the early 70’s and settled in Waterville. The home they built at the top of the steep hill became a true haven for family, friends, and many German Shepherds.
Jon and Adrianna raised three daughters on the hill. Jon taught Lissa, Molly, and Jill to be fierce and strong and caring. He taught them how to properly stack wood, do the New York Times crossword puzzle in pen, and throw a softball. As kids, they jokingly referred to him as The Almighty Patriarch, but he truly was. He could be gruff and ornery, but underneath that imposing exterior was a deep gentleness. Jon’s natural generosity extended to the girls he coached in softball over two generations, many of whom he stayed in touch with years after he stopped coaching. As a craftsman and builder, he gathered around him a vast community of tradespeople, and helped mentor a new generation of builders. He was a source of comfort to anyone who needed a helping hand or a shoulder to lean on.
A lifelong baseball fanatic, Jon loved the Boston Red Sox, which really means he hated the Yankees. His love for the game manifested itself most strongly in his grandsons Jasper and Rowan. Jon’s happy place was on his front porch in the sunshine, holding Adrianna’s hand, watching their grandsons toss a baseball on the front lawn.
Jon held his memories close throughout his 76 years, even when dementia made it harder for him to find words or names. Late in his life, he would sit in his shop, surrounded by tools he could no longer use, everything organized and smelling of oil, of summer days spent at the job site, of leather toolbelts and iron nails. He never forgot that he made things with love and care, things that were meant to shelter and nurture, and he knew that he had built much more than houses.
Jon kept his loved ones safe in the world. He was a provider and a protector, and the home and community he built with Adrianna was a refuge for those who knew and loved them.
Jon is celebrated by his wife and partner of 55 years, Adrianna Wood Fox. His spirit lives on in his daughter Lissa Fox and her partner James Nagle (Montpelier, VT), and James’s daughter Juna Nagle (Washington, DC); daughter Molly Fox Zhu, her husband Kit Zhu, and their sons Jasper Fox Zhu and Rowan Fox Zhu (Portland, OR); and daughter Jill Fox (Montpelier, VT). Jon is loved by his sister Janaki Costello and her husband Heine Costello (El Cerrito, CA), their sons Josh Costello (Berkeley, CA), Adam Costello, (New York City), and Jamie Costello (El Cerrito, CA), along with their families; sister Deb Fox and her husband Ron Epstein (Rochester, NY), their children Eli Fox-Epstein (Los Angeles, CA) and Malka Fox-Epstein (Rochester, NY), and their families; dear cousin Karen Mullarkey (New York City); and his best friend Kent’s daughters Maia Corduan and her husband Jess Canty (Hardwick, VT), and Hiata Corduan (Rockland, ME), who held a special place in Jon’s heart.We would like to thank Lamoille Home Health & Hospice for their exceptional care. Every aspect of it, from intake to nursing to personal care, was skilled, sensitive, and sincerely concerned about Jon and our family. We especially thank our nurse, Chantal, who is an angel.

Why are there no penalties?",Malena Carollo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/10/rooftop-solar-hookups-miss-deadlines/,"PG&E and Southern California Edison routinely blow their deadlines to hook up new solar panels, an advocacy group says. But after years of complaints they have not been punished.","In summary
PG&E and Southern California Edison routinely blow their deadlines to hook up new solar panels, an advocacy group says. But after years of complaints they have not been punished.


The state’s two largest utilities routinely drag their feet connecting solar panels to the electric grid, missing state-mandated deadlines as much as 73% of the time, according to a complaint filed to regulators by solar advocates.
The complaint filed by a solar energy advocacy group urges the California Public Utilities Commission to hold utilities accountable when they fail to meet such deadlines. The commission is formally reviewing it. 
The advocates have complained for years that such delays hinder California’s transition to renewables. State utility regulators are separately revisiting the process for connecting rooftop solar to the grid, including examining whether and how the utility commission should require utilities to comply with the timelines it established years ago.
But the commission has yet to reprimand utilities for regularly missing these deadlines.
“The rule is there, but the commission hasn’t chosen to enforce [it],” said Kevin Luo, policy and market development manager for the California Solar & Storage Association, a group advocating for the adoption of solar energy that filed the complaint.
“The rule is there, but the commission hasn’t chosen to enforce [it].”Kevin Luo,  California Solar & Storage Association
When Californians add solar panels to their rooftops, they begin a complex “interconnection” process led by the utilities to ensure the array is correctly installed and able to provide power for both the customer and the grid, which receives power the customer does not use. For each interconnection step, the utility is allotted a certain amount of time, ranging from five business days to 90 calendar days.
The timelines for several of the more extensive steps – including design, construction and installation – were clarified in a 2020 decision after solar panel owners complained that California’s major investor-owned utilities were blowing their deadlines. 
The delays can have significant financial consequences for panel owners, widening the period after they have laid out money for solar cells but before they see a reduction in their power consumption or payments from selling excess solar power back to utilities.
Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric all report their compliance with these timelines on a quarterly basis. The reporting is for projects over 30 kilowatts, which are often for businesses, not residential homes, and account for the majority of solar projects.
These data show that PG&E and Edison routinely exceed the allotted windows. 
In the complaint, filed in late August, the California Solar & Storage Association noted the utilities take longer than permitted to connect customers between 19% and 73% of the time, depending on which stage of the process is examined. 
For example, the utilities are given 10 business days to acknowledge someone’s request for interconnection – PG&E’s median time for this step was 20 days, with its longest being 245 days. One of the most crucial steps is a system impact study, which looks at how the addition of a customer’s solar array will affect the grid and identifies any potential issues with hookup. PG&E kept to its timeline 49% of the time, while Edison met its deadline 43% of the time, according to the complaint. 
San Diego Gas & Electric typically meets its deadlines and wasn’t included in the solar association’s complaint about timeliness.
PG&E spokesperson Mike Gazda responded to the complaint by stating that “PG&E is a strong advocate for solar energy and has interconnected nearly 900,000 solar customers—more than any other U.S. utility—to support customers who have made the choice to go solar, strengthen California’s energy grid and reduce our state’s carbon footprint. We look forward to addressing the latest claims made by the solar gorup through the appropriate regulatory channels.” 
Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford said the company takes “complaints seriously and [is] working with the California Public Utilities Commission to thoroughly address any issues related to our interconnection processes.”
Utilities have previously said that delays can be caused by permitting issues, unfamiliar new technologies, or other agencies needing to be involved. 
So what happens when they break the rules? 
The utilities commission declined to lay out specific penalties when it clarified the timelines in 2020. It rejected a recommendation from a working group including industry representatives and consumer advocates to “clearly indicate that financial penalties” could happen if a utility fails to meet the timelines on 95% of projects.
“The commission must first determine whether timeline certainty is improving,” the decision said. Regulators could set out penalties in the future “if it determines such a construct would support timely interconnection.” 
The commission declined to comment because the case is an “ongoing adjudicatory proceeding,” Adam Cranfill, spokesperson, said.  
Without some kind of punishment, advocates argue, there’s not only no incentive for utilities to follow the rules, there’s a disincentive because of how the money flows.
“From their perspective, solar and storage is competition for them,” Luo said. “Having people with their own solar and storage reduces the need to continually expand the grid and build out transmission lines.” 
California’s rooftop solar industry has been mired in controversy in recent years because of the state’s “net energy metering” program, which governs how much utilities are required to pay solar customers for extra energy their panels generate. The program is meant to incentivize adopting renewable energy sources and offset the significant cost of rooftop solar, but utilities argued it creates an unfair cost burden for those without solar who pay more for costs such as grid maintenance. As a result, the current iteration of the program pays out significantly less than prior versions.
Three environmental groups sued over the change, and the California Supreme Court ruled last month that the lower courts should reexamine the case’s details instead of deferring to utility regulators.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621-Renewable-Energy-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439

A bill would help by making more midwives and doulas accessible.,"Guest Commentary written by

Erica Moore-Smith
Erica Moore-Smith is a therapist and licensed clinical social worker in Riverside County


In 2018 I walked into my doctor’s office, newly pregnant and excited to hear my baby’s heartbeat for the first time. I left feeling ashamed of my body.
The doctor didn’t ask about my medical history, my lifestyle or my goals for birth. She didn’t even take blood tests. Instead, she looked me up and down and said I would probably develop gestational diabetes and high blood pressure and would likely end up needing a C-section. 
None of these predictions were based on facts — only on how I looked. (I’m a Black woman with a smaller than average build.) What should have been one of the most joyous milestones of my life was replaced with fear, sadness and disappointment. 
As a medical social worker, I knew her words didn’t have to become my story. But I couldn’t shake the thought: How many other women — especially women who look like me — walk out of medical offices believing those words and internalizing fear and shame, because the doctor is considered the expert?
Too many women — especially Black women — enter pregnancy carrying fear. 
We read the statistics: In California, a woman dies every five days on average, either during or after childbirth, but Black mothers are nearly four times more likely to die than others. African Americans account for 5% of pregnancies but 21% of pregnancy-related deaths.
Black women also have heard stories about celebrities like Serena Williams nearly dying after childbirth because her concerns weren’t taken seriously. We wonder: If they didn’t listen to her, why would they listen to me?
That’s why alternatives like midwifery and doula care aren’t just “nice extras” for well-off expectant parents. They are lifesaving, cost-effective health care options that should be covered and accessible to every woman, especially Black women, who could use some peace of mind.
My search for better pregnancy care
My fears came early in my pregnancy. I used to tell myself that if I died in childbirth, at least I made it to 30. It sounds dramatic, but for many women of color it feels like reality. That first obstetrics appointment only reinforced those fears. 
I turned away from traditional obstetric care, and my husband and I researched alternatives and chose a midwifery birth center. That meant paying $9,000 out-of-pocket, when my insurance would have covered hospital care for free. But for me, safety meant being respected, listened to and cared for as a whole person.
The difference was transformative. The midwives never rushed me. They invited questions and explained every option, they prioritized my voice and they prepared me and my husband through prenatal classes.
The research is clear: When women have access to midwives and doulas, outcomes improve. There are fewer unnecessary interventions, fewer complications and more positive birth experiences.
Hospitals will always have an important role in maternity care, but birth should not be limited to them. For women who are good candidates for out-of-hospital birth, midwifery and doula care should be encouraged and supported by our health system.
Instead, half of California’s birth centers have closed in recent years. Midwives say it’s partly because the state makes getting and keeping a license too difficult. Recently lawmakers passed a measure that would eliminate some of those barriers. Assembly Bill 55 awaits — and deserves — Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature.
Certain Medi-Cal health plans cover doula and midwifery services, but they shouldn’t be the exception. All health insurance plans should cover these services.
Equally important, physicians need better training in how to talk to patients. The way medical providers speak to women early in pregnancy can shape their entire experience. Instead of fear-based predictions, women deserve informed, respectful conversations that empower them to trust their bodies and their choices. 
In 2020, California began requiring hospitals to train labor and delivery staff in unconscious bias. Many hospitals have yet to begin the training.
In my case, my doula provided emotional support and advocacy. She and the midwife gave me confidence and peace, treating me like a person, not a checklist of risks.
I gave birth to my first daughter in four hours, without developing high blood pressure or gestational diabetes or needing a C-section. When I got pregnant again, I chose a home birth. The first hands to touch our second daughter were my husband’s. 
It was calm, beautiful and healing — everything I had once been told wasn’t possible for me.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/032324_MLK-Maternity_JAH_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439

Neighbors call it just another incinerator,Alejandra Reyes-Velarde,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/10/resynergi-plastic-waste-recycling-pollution/,"The Sonoma County company Resynergi says it will depart the state, just as Gov.

The Sonoma County company Resynergi says it will depart the state, just as Gov. Newsom sends CalRecycle back to the drawing board on potentially nation-leading rules governing plastic waste and plastic products. 


The plan sounded like a magic bullet from the future to solve one of the world’s most vexing environmental waste problems. 
In Rohnert Park, just north of San Francisco, a startup company called Resynergi planned to use a form of “advanced recycling” to reuse plastic. Its process would chemically transform old plastic, blasting bits of it with microwaves until they turned into an oil that could then be used to make new plastic. 
But the process – known as pyrolysis – was a hard sell to Sonoma County neighbors, who protested so much that the company withdrew its application and now plans to move out of state. 
The fight that boiled over in Rohnert Park in recent months is a window into the tensions ahead for California as the state overhauls nation-leading regulations governing plastic pollution and packaging. (CalRecycle, formally known as the Department of Resources Recovery and Recycling, will hold a public hearing about those rules Oct. 7.) 
While California is establishing some of the most forward-thinking plastic responsibility and recycling rules in the country, a dirty secret is that most plastic recycling methods are ineffective at best and illusory at worst. 
Millions of tons of plastic go to the state’s landfills each year, and millions more are shipped to Southeast Asia, where plastic is rarely recycled. Instead it is illegally dumped, and often burned.
Last year, Attorney General Rob Bonta brought suit against ExxonMobil for “perpetuating the myth … that you can recycle plastics, including single use plastics, and that it’s sustainable and good for the environment … It’s not true. It’s a lie.” ExxonMobil has since countersued Bonta for defamation.
California’s regulators, meanwhile, are working to implement a 2022 state law that moves the state toward a circular economy for plastic – by making companies that produce packaging and single-use plastic items responsible for what happens to them after people throw them away. Those companies, along with environmental groups, have been weighing in as CalRecycle has been writing regulations, now years in the making.  
Recent comments by Gov. Gavin Newsom suggest the state is aiming to strike a balance, finding a way to encourage recycling companies while hitting the state’s goals – all while avoiding more air pollution or other environmental impacts. 
As for Resynergi, local and environmental advocates say that the way local, county, and regional regulators handled the company points up the challenges the state will face as it regulates plastic and defines whether and how it can be recycled. 
“It does make me nervous, since it took seven years to get any enforcement on a facility that’s a two hour drive from the Capitol,” said Nick Lapis, advocacy director for Californians Against Waste. 
A credible solution to plastic waste? 
Resynergi’s departure came as Sonoma County officials began to ask more serious questions about its operations, almost a decade after the company first arrived. 
In 2017, company founder Brian Bauer chose Rohnert Park, a small, middle-class community surrounded by farmland, to develop and test his process.
He set up shop in a development called SOMO Village – a 200-acre neighborhood with homes, a high school, and commercial space. Developers market it as a climate-conscious place, built to be carbon-neutral, which Bauer said was a draw for Resynergi.  
In early conversations, according to Bauer, Sonoma County officials “suggested” his business could follow simpler recycling guidelines. Sheri Cardo, a spokesperson for Sonoma County’s Department of Health Services, confirmed the department had talked with Bauer about its operations as a recycling research and development site, and that his characterization was accurate.  
In 2023, when Bauer sought to expand operations, he approached the city of Rohnert Park’s planning division for permits. 
Officials told Bauer his facility was considered a heavy manufacturing site, and that Resynergi’s location – 600 feet from a school – demanded an environmental review, according to documents obtained by residents through a public records request. In a response late last year,  Resynergi argued that such a review could take too long, and moving quickly “could make or break substantial investment from a large strategic investor.”
Within a month, planning officials had flipped and were now siding with Resynergi, granting it a more flexible, less burdensome administrative use permit. The decision avoided additional public review. 
But to operate legally, Resynergi had to secure approval from county officials and the regional air district.
In California, pyrolysis is classified as a type of incineration, associated with toxic and hazardous waste. Businesses must obtain a solid waste permit from local authorities, who enforce the state’s public resources code. In the past, three facilities have received permits to use pyrolysis, two for the purpose of destroying medical waste. All are now closed, according to CalRecycle.
California counties issue waste permits on behalf of CalRecycle. The Bay Area Regional Air Quality Management District permits and controls pollution that microwaving plastic could produce.

County officials started looking into the company when they realized Resynergi’s plans would make the company a fully operational and “fixed component in the county’s waste system,” said Cardo, the county spokesperson. 
“Although your facility might be considered a recycling facility in vernacular language, it is not under state law,” wrote Christine Sosko, Sonoma County’s director of environmental health.
CalRecycle spokesman Lance Klug said in an email that Sonoma County’s response followed state standards.
But environmental advocates say the way city and county officials handled Resynergi reflects regulators’ confusion about the processes for advanced recycling  – confusion fueled by the plastic industry.  
Jane Williams, director of California Communities Against Toxics, argues that federal and state law make it clear that pyrolysis facilities have to follow rules as incinerators. “It’s really interesting for me to see, having worked on these incinerators for so long, how these guys pulled strings,” Williams said. “They pulled whatever out of their pockets so they could convince people this is a recycling facility.” 
The American Chemistry Council, a trade group supporting the plastic industry, disagrees. And Resynergi’s Bauer said he doesn’t think his company’s process counts as incineration. 
“Communities across California and the country are searching for credible solutions to plastic waste,” Bauer wrote in an open letter to the community. “This city has the chance to lead by example.” 
Community fears toxic air pollution 
People living in and near SOMO Village found out that Resynergi planned to burn plastic on a larger scale when the Bay Area Air Quality Management District notified the public of the company’s permit application.
The community protested, filling city council rooms at each meeting and waving signs depicting polluting smoke stacks. Some parents spoke through tears to their city leaders. “Our air is not your experiment,” one poster read. 
Among the local opponents of Resynergi was Stephanie Lennox. She lives about 20 minutes from Rohnert Park in rural Forestville, but her two daughters go to Credo High School right next to the facility. She wondered about emissions and the risk of an explosion. 
“My Lord, don’t we need a solution to our global plastic pollution,” Lennox said. “But my daughters’ lungs are not part of your beta testing phase for your ‘world’s global plastic solution.’”

Local organizers said they wanted city and county leaders to follow state law and the federal Clean Air Act.  
When plastic is burned, additives like flame retardants or other chemicals that don’t break down can create toxic emissions, said Veena Singla, a researcher at the University of California San Francisco.
Resynergi applied to the regional air district to obtain a permit for pollution control equipment in April, after the company had already begun operating their technology.
In August, the air district issued three notices of violation to Resynergi for constructing and operating without a permit. 
Bauer admitted to operating the equipment without a permit. The company never burned plastic in Rohnert Park he said; it did burn plastic at “prototype levels” in Santa Rosa.
But, Bauer added, Resynergi was trying to follow the rules as he understood them. As a startup, he said, “you don’t even know if you will get a prototype to work. You’re also trying to figure out how the permitting process works.” 
Millions spent to sway regulations 
Resynergi’s departure wasn’t because of a community outcry, Bauer said. The turning point, he said, was “the pull from other states; how they treated climate technologies such as ours …combined with the overall culture of accepting what we’re doing.”
Plastics manufacturers and industry advocates like the American Chemistry Council have campaigned to redefine terms and loosen environmental regulations for the process Resynergi is developing. After the lobbying, 27 states have reclassified pyrolysis as manufacturing instead of solid waste operations, said Davis Allen, a researcher for the Center for Climate Integrity. That classification helps operators get around federal air requirements, he added. 
Resynergi’s Bauer told CalMatters that “one of those (states) is a candidate,” and that the company will move out by the end of the year.   
An analysis by the climate accountability newsletter HEATED found the chemistry council and groups aligned with it have spent as much as $30 million to promote the concept of advanced recycling as a mainstream and established one. That language aims to sway not just state laws, but federal clean air policy as well.  
Between 2021 and 2022, when lawmakers were discussing plastic producer legislation, the American Chemistry Council spent more than $1.6 million on lobbying state legislators, according to publicly available data published by the Secretary of State.
The American Chemistry Council’s Ross Eisenberg says that pyrolysis and other chemical recycling processes do work. These processes turn “hard-to-recycle plastics into the raw materials for high-quality products while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and fossil energy use during production compared with virgin production,” he said. 
“America’s plastic makers are investing billions of dollars to modernize and expand recycling capacity and improve efficiency,” Eisenberg said, adding that the companies are “advocating for smart policies that enhance collection and sorting so more plastics can be remade into new products.”
This year, the Environmental Protection Agency said it isn’t taking further action on the matter, but industry representatives said they’ll continue to lobby at the federal level.
Ambitious rules and tough realities for plastic
California’s goals to reduce plastic pollution and make producers responsible for plastic waste are ambitious in size, scope, and speed. Within seven years, state law seeks to reduce plastic packaging by 25%, make single-use plastic packaging 100% recyclable or compostable, and divert most of that packaging into recycling. 
Allen, from the Center for Climate Integrity, says laws like this can be a good idea – as long as regulators focus more on reducing plastics and less on recycling them. 
“Almost any solution that is based on the idea that plastics can widely be recycled just isn’t really going to work,” Allen said. “There just aren’t easily available solutions to a lot of the problems that limit the effectiveness of recycling.”

But in March, regulations aimed at achieving the state’s goals were dealt a setback after two years of hearings. The day they were due, Gov. Newsom directed CalRecycle to start the regulatory process over. 
The governor asked for changes “to minimize costs for small businesses and families – while ensuring California’s bold recycling law can achieve the critical goal of cutting plastic pollution,” said Daniel Villaseñor, a spokesperson for the governor, in an email to CalMatters.
The Plastics Industry Association and the American Chemistry Council hailed the governor’s announcement as an opportunity. “We believe California’s regulations should be clear, technology-neutral, and performance-based,” said the council’s Ross Eisenberg.
According to Klug, the CalRecycle spokesman, the state “remains committed to fostering business innovation that promotes a safe and clean future for all Californians.” 
But environmental organizations like the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Surfrider called the decision disappointing. 
Williams, the California Communities Against Toxics activist, said she’s concerned that more recent draft language may encourage pyrolysis facilities like Resynergi, which, she says, don’t belong in the state.   
If California “rolls out the red carpet,” she said, “The only thing that will stop a whole new fleet of incinerators being built in California now is open, persistent community opposition.” 
Resynergi also took part in CalRecycle workshops for the regulations. The company’s departure announcement praised the “innovative spirit of California … instrumental in the company’s growth.” 
Brian Bauer said he’s hopeful the state plastic regulations will ease regulations for companies like his, but he plans to return to California either way. 
“So it might be a couple years,” Bauer said. “We’ll be back to California in due time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/082725_Rohnert-Park-Incinerator_CS_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439

“These events underscore, once again, that our capital city is in crisis.

At a press conference Sunday afternoon, Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said that Marshall is welcome to meet with him to share solutions, and noted the state Legislature in 2022 had effectively ended concealed carry permit requirements for firearms.

“I don’t know that one could look at our record objectively and what we’ve done with our city council and say that there’s a refusal to acknowledge crime is an issue in the city of Montgomery,” Reed said Sunday. “I need solutions, and he’s willing to offer some solutions around bail and bond reform. I’m open. We’ve been talking about that for several years. So offer some solutions around permitless carry, I’m open.”
The Metro Area Crime Suppression (MACS) Unit was created in 2024 to help reduce crime in Montgomery, and decreased violent crime by 30%, according to a June press release.
Gov. Kay Ivey in a statement Monday morning said more will be done, threatening intervention in the state’s capital. 
“To start, in addition to our active MACS Unit, I have asked my ALEA Secretary Hal Taylor to extend the patrol area for our Capitol Troopers to include other key downtown areas,” Ivey said. “I will plan on asking the Legislature to support additional resources to allow our state law enforcement presence to be more effective in downtown Montgomery.”
Chip Hill, Reed’s former chief of staff, said in an interview that while he was on staff from January 2020 to October 2024, the city did as much as it could. He said as soon as Reed took office, they replaced all out-of-date police cars, rearmed the police and invested more money in the police department. The Montgomery Police Department got $49.3 million from the city budget in fiscal year 2020; MPD is scheduled to get $62.2 million in the 2026 fiscal year, which began last week, an increase of about 26% over 2020. 
“So everything we had the power to do something about we did,” Hill said.










We tried to pass an ordinance and we tried to restrict guns altogether, because our thought was, if we have a restriction on an area, then you're able to guard that area and check people as they come in. So then you're able to limit it and check it. It was just frustrating when people constantly criticize, but they don't want to give you the tools.


– Chip Hill, former chief of staff to Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed


Montgomery City Council passed an ordinance in September 2024 that required those that carry weapons to also carry a photo ID within the city’s entertainment district, which includes the part of downtown where the mass shooting happened Saturday. The state forced the city to repeal the ordinance, Hill said, under a law that prohibits local governments from restricting the state’s gun laws.
“We tried to pass an ordinance and we tried to restrict guns altogether, because our thought was, if we have a restriction on an area, then you’re able to guard that area and check people as they come in. So then you’re able to limit it and check it,” Hill said. “It was just frustrating when people constantly criticize, but they don’t want to give you the tools.”
Alabama’s high gun violence rates
Alabama has long had some of the nation’s highest gun violence rates. The state had the fourth-highest firearm death rate in the nation in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at 25.6 deaths per 100,000. More people died by gunfire in Alabama that year than in New York State, which has nearly four times Alabama’s population.  
Weak state regulations contribute to Alabama’ ranking by the Giffords Law Center, an organization that tracks gun laws and violence in the United States, as some of the weakest gun laws in the country. 
Reed said in a statement Monday afternoon that while there is no law that could have prevented the shooting, legislation could help.
“But real safety requires more than additional troopers or task forces—it requires the courage to confront the culture of easy access to guns and a lack of responsibility among those who carry them. Montgomery is strong, and we will continue leading from the front to make our capital city safer for everyone,” Reed said.
Hill said the city tried to work with the Legislature for years to limit the number of weapons in Montgomery, but never passed a law. The only gun safety law the Legislature has passed since 2010 is a ban on Glock switches, a modification that makes a hand gun fire like a machine gun, which passed this spring.
Miguel Diaz-Lucier, the city’s communications director, said in an interview Monday that there is no current law that could have prevented Saturday’s mass shooting.
“If you’re in public, anybody can have a gun, and police can’t check you. If you’re on the streets, they can’t do anything to you,” Diaz-Lucier said. “I’m not sure what you do, except for the Legislature, maybe they can come up with a law that’ll do something.”
Diaz-Lucier said that even if the city had more authority to prevent gun violence, the capital is at a disadvantage in revenue compared to other major Alabama cities due to not being able to use property taxes on state buildings in the city for its budget. 
“The Legislature decided that they were not going to allow any cities to have an occupational tax at the same time that we passed it, so even though our council passed it, it made it a moot point,” Diaz-Lucier said. “The occupational tax would have given us some extra funds that we don’t have access to. So it’s kind of the situation we are in as a city.”
Messages seeking comment from Rep. Tashina Morris, D-Montgomery, and Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, were left Monday morning. Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, said in an interview Monday afternoon that there is no single solution to gun violence.
“I think it has to be an all of the above approach of willing to look at different solutions from a family and individual level all the way up to certain things the state can do,” Ensler said. “Just acknowledge that none of those things alone is going to stop every situation, but collectively, it can make a difference, and people need to be open minded to that.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0565-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439
,California,2025-10-07 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Refinery fire spotlights California’s gas supply crunch and high prices at the pump,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/refinery-fire-gas-prices-california/,Damage from the Chevron El Segundo refinery fire hasn't been tallied yet. But gas prices are likely to soar anyway because two other refineries are closing.,"Thankfully, last week’s explosion and fire at California’s second largest refinery, Chevron’s El Segundo plant, was not an environmental catastrophe. But it could have serious economic and political impact.
It occurred as Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democratic figures were in the midst of a 180-degree political pirouette: a shift from denouncing makers of gasoline as price gouging polluters, to beseeching them to continue production.
California once had dozens of refineries, but today nine are still producing gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel for airlines and military warplanes. Two have announced plans to shut down within a few months.
Valero’s refinery and the Phillips 66 plant in Southern California together represent about 17% of the state’s refining capacity, according to the California Energy Commission. State legislators reportedly have offered Valero state subsidies to keep its Benicia refinery in operation, fearing closure would raise Californians’ already high gas prices.
Chevron’s damaged El Segundo plant, if closed, would double the loss in refinery capacity to more than a third of the state’s total, causing a supply crunch that would assuredly result in higher pump prices.
California’s 30-million-plus cars and light trucks average 340 billion miles of travel each year and burn 13 billion gallons of gas, all but a trickle of which comes from the nine refineries. There are no pipelines to bring in fuel from other states, and importing gasoline from Asia or the Middle East via tankers is fraught with uncertainty and high costs.
Newsom, backed by fellow Democrats in the Legislature, spent months excoriating refiners for high prices, even though the state’s very high fuel taxes create much of the gap between prices in California and those in other states. Newsom called a special session of the Legislature to pass legislation that he said would penalize profits deemed to be too high.
The official criticism seemed to meld with the state’s declared intention to phase out gasoline-fueled cars in favor of those powered by electricity, thus shutting down oil production and gasoline refineries. Newsom’s administration has said that by 2035 the sale of new gas-powered cars would be banned.
The evolution Newsom envisions, however, also requires the state to continue some refining until the last of the state’s gasoline-powered cars are permanently parked, raising questions about how the change would be managed.
The Phillips 66 and Valero announcements forced the issue. The state’s politicians realized that a rapid decline in refinery capacity could send gas prices soaring, thereby creating a political backlash. Newsom’s evident presidential ambitions would be hammered by a sharp price spike.
Accordingly, in the last days of the legislative session, Newsom and legislators backtracked, passing measures to boost petroleum production. More recently, Newsom signed legislation to make gas with 15% ethanol available, saying it would lower prices by up to 20 cents a gallon. Apparently, legislators also have been feeling out Valero about some state subsidies for its Benicia plant, but so far they’ve had no success.
Chevron, whose refineries in El Segundo and Richmond have about a third of the state’s refining capacity, moved its headquarters from California to Texas last year and has made no secret about its disdain for California’s anti-petroleum policies, while dropping hints that it may close one of its two plants.
The extent of fire damage at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery, and the effect on gasoline supply and prices, are still unclear. However, it’s a reminder of how tight California’s gas supply has become and how cataclysmic the closure of its refineries could be — economically and politically.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/100225-El-Segundo-Fire-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439

From kiosks designed to speed customer check-in to vibrant casino games, Nevada’s tourism industry is putting artificial intelligence to work.  But one of AI’s potential best uses – its ability to assimilate massive amounts of data and identify patterns that could detect fraud and money laundering – is taking a back seat to automating table games and replacing bartenders.  
“AI is being used on the operations side, but not necessarily on the compliance side,” says attorney Michael Beckwith of Dickinson Wright, who is speaking Tuesday at the Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas about maximizing the ability of AI to analyze massive amounts of data, discern patterns, and detect other cues valuable to casinos in preventing fraud and money laundering. He says casinos are already employing AI technologies for those purposes “but not on the large scale, and not the most cutting edge technology.”
The hang up, according to Beckwith, is a perceived lack of profitability in ferreting out fraud. 
“There just isn’t that much money in it,” he says, adding investment in AI is likely “to go to the operation side of casinos first. Eventually, if there’s a benefit there, maybe it filters back to compliance.” 
A study published by MIT found most efforts to grow revenue via AI are a bust, with only about 5% of AI pilot programs driving substantial increases in revenue. 
“Most projects die in pilot purgatory. Meanwhile, headlines are warning of an ‘AI bubble,’ and some investors are shorting AI stocks on the idea that generative AI’s big enterprise moment is already stalling out,” Forbes reports. 
AI, and its subfield, ML (machine earning), a form of AI that uses algorithms to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make predictions, are used by some casinos. Their use by compliance executives and crooks remains a double edged sword for the gambling industry. 
In casinos, AI can speed up ‘Know Your Customer’ protocol via biometrics and rapidly analyze identification sources. It can identify customers with a history of criminal activity. Additionally, it can monitor transactions to flag efforts to avoid cash reporting thresholds, and large cash deposits that are cashed out in casino chips after minimal play. It can also reduce work for compliance executives by automating Suspicious Activity Reports.
Criminals, on the other hand, are upping their game through the use of AI. 
In Vietnam, a gambling ring evaded biometric ID measures by generating deep fake videos courtesy of AI, and online gamblers have been known to create fake identities, complete with forged documents, for the purpose of opening accounts.
The International Gaming Institute at UNLV intends to “explore everything from the opportunities of the technology for the industry to the risks of the technology as well,” says Kasra Ghaharian, IGI’s Director of Research. “How is the industry currently using AI? How are they thinking about using it? What do they think is going to be the impact on the workforce? Where are they seeing significant returns on their AI investments?”
Additionally, IGI wants input from policy makers and regulators to learn if gambling regulation is equipped to deal with the technology in “upholding regulatory principles such as keeping gambling safe and protecting the public from potential harms,” Ghaharian says. He warns that operators must be deterred from crossing ethical lines in which AI is used to exploit vulnerable gamblers. 
IGI’s findings are expected to be released in a report to be presented next year at the International Conference on Gambling and Risk Taking. 
“While AI is still a developing technology, its capability to identify behavioral patterns and transactional anomalies in real-time could potentially help analyze betting trends and movement of funds across platforms that could be beneficial in combatting (sic) money laundering,” Nevada Gaming Control Board chairman Mike Dreitzer said via email. 
Crime pays 
Despite the potential assistance from AI, not all casinos are eager to throw out ‘undesirable’ players. 
“it’s the casino’s job to make sure that they keep unwanted people out. And if they’re not, it’s almost like they’re letting tainted money come in,” illegal bookmaker Matt Bowyer told the Current last week, just days before he is scheduled to report to prison to serve a one-year sentence for money laundering.
Bowyer, an associate, and another illegal bookie, Damien LeForbes, lost close to $24 million in ill-gotten gains at Resorts World in a little more than two years. The casino, which intentionally altered records to conceal Bowyer’s source of income, according to a complaint filed against the casino by regulators, incurred a $10.5 million fine from the Nevada Gaming Commission.
“Resorts World made $14 million but I’m going to prison,” Bowyer observed.” I was committing a different crime than they were, but what they did is still a crime. Let’s be real. They were definitely allowing money laundering. They were allowing illegal bookmakers to play.”
Dreitzer of the GCB declined to comment when asked whether the state’s fine was sufficient to deter licensees from allowing gamblers to play with dirty money. 
Under President Donald Trump’s administration, an anticipated non-prosecution agreement between Resorts World and the DOJ has yet to materialize. 
Beckwith, a former prosecutor for the Eastern District of California, acknowledges AI “is only as good as the humans overseeing it. And we want human oversight. Red flags may come up and they may be ignored, but there’s going to be a history of them. The records are easily attainable, like a bank record. Using AI would likely encourage better behavior.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2210332783-1024x540.jpg,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Michael Moss got a certificate on Friday and was freed from confinement after spending about  eight years in prison.
“I still didn’t think I was going to make it,” Moss said about his parole application. “It was my fourth time going up and I finally made it,”
But as a condition of  release, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles required Moss to complete the Perry County Parole and Probation Reentry Education and Employment Program (PREP), a 90-day residential curriculum to assist with the transition back into the community.

“I had a bad drug problem, and it led me to prison,” he said. “I made bad choices. Coming here and into this program, it turned my whole life around. I got a job waiting for me. This is as long as I have been sober. I have gotten a lot of support.”
Moss, along with roughly 50 of his colleagues, is one of more than 400 people who have graduated from the PREP Center over the last five years.
The recidivism rate for those who have completed the program thus far is zero, which means that no one who has gone through the training and classes has been reincarcerated.
The re-entry program was established by Cam Ward, director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, who was looking for a way to enhance public safety and assist those who are considered a higher risk to reoffend because of their background and criminal histories.
“I saw this work in other states,” Ward said. “I was actually in Michigan and saw it. I have seen it in other place, and my vision was, ‘We have day reporting centers now, we are about to open up our 13th one in Shelby County, but if we had a residential, we could do really intensive job training program that some people need, high risk individuals.’”
Given its success, the Perry County PREP center has become a cornerstone of the effort by Ward and staff at the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles to continue to draw down the state’s recidivism rate by drawing lessons from both its successes and its failures.
The individuals ordered by the parole board to complete rehabilitation at the center are transported to the facility once they are released from the custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections. They are taken through intake and checked for contraband and processed before getting escorted to the dormitories where they will remain for the next three months.
The PREP center operates in a similar way to a college, complete with classes and workshops hosted by organizations that the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles partnered with to oversee specialized parts of the curriculum. The goal is to provide students with the skills they need to successfully reenter into their communities.
Each weekday, students are transported to a campus in Thomasville where they will attend a variety of courses for the day. Among them classes related to substance abuse and cognitive behavioral therapy.
Jeremy Grant, who graduated alongside Moss on Friday, spent three years in prison for a parole revocation. He won parole in June.
“My stepfather was abusive, and there was unforgiveness and things in my life that I had to let go of and understand the core reason why I was addicted to drugs,” Grant said. “Drugs are really just a symptom of the problem, and unless you get to the bottom of it, you will never know what the real problem is.”

Grant completed the rehabilitation program like Moss and he has lined up two jobs in construction.
Program participants also enroll in career and technical training programs.
The results garnered by the residential rehabilitation program are a factor in reducing the state’s recidivism rate, which went from 34% to 29%, placing it 12th in the country.
Alabama participates in Reentry 2030 with the stated goal of reducing recidivism in the state to less than 15%. This rehabilitation program, given what the graduates have accomplished, will set the foundation for that goal.
“If we replicate this, and do this kind of programming, we will get there,” Ward said.
The key will be to apply lessons from the residential program to other people who have been paroled but report to the other centers in Alabama.
“Some people require more intensive supervision,” Ward said. “You have to check on them in their home. You do more drug testing. Accountability is the key.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7451-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439

Dean Plocher, a Republican from Des Peres, is among the 17 applicants for the circuit judge vacancy in St. Louis County created when Thomas Albus was appointed U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. A judicial commission will interview the candidates, narrow the field to three nominees and then submit those names to Gov. Mike Kehoe for consideration. 
If he makes it through the process and is appointed to the job by Kehoe, it would be a return to the bench for Plocher. In 2005, he was appointed to serve as a municipal judge in the 21st Judicial Circuit in St. Louis County. He ran successfully for the House in 2015, replacing Republican John Diehl after he was forced to resign for sending sexually charged text messages to a 19-year-old House intern.
Plocher eventually rose to become speaker of the Missouri House, the most powerful job in the legislature. 
Records show Dean Plocher charged the state for travel already paid for by his campaign

During his time as speaker, Plocher was accused of trying to steer an $800,000 software contract for the House around the standard bidding process. It was later revealed he’d illegally sought taxpayer reimbursement from the legislature for airfare, hotels and other travel costs already paid for by his campaign.
He also faced criticism for spending $60,000 remodelling his office and turning another office into a makeshift storage room stocked with liquor, beer, wine and soda.
Plocher denied any wrongdoing, but the allegations sparked a months-long ethics investigation. Though it was ultimately dismissed, the Republican legislator leading the investigation said Plocher pressured potential witnesses and used his office to obstruct the inquiry. 
The scandals that plagued Plocher’s final year in the legislature also inspired a pair of whistleblower lawsuits. 
One, filed by the former chief clerk of the House, alleged harassment and intimidation during battles with Plocher over ethics charges and hiring decisions. It was dismissed in December, though that decision has been appealed. 
The second, filed by a current legislative employee, alleges retaliation, threats and abuse after reporting alleged illegal behavior and mismanagement of public resources to the ethics committee. The employee also alleges being pressured by a lawmaker to violate the Missouri Sunshine Law to keep public documents out of the hands of the media. 
That litigation is ongoing with a hearing on a motion to dismiss scheduled next month.

Phil Murphy.","Signs advertise a Kean University forum featuring gubernatorial hopefuls Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) and Jack Ciattarelli (R) Oct. 4, 2025. (Photo by New Jersey Monitor)On Monday night in Nutley, Republican gubernatorial hopeful Jack Ciattarelli pitched his gubernatorial candidacy to more than 100 people crowded inside Mamma Vittoria banquet hall.
Ciattarelli, who is making his third bid for the state’s top job, opened his remarks by referencing a group of protestors gathered outside on Franklin Avenue in this Essex County town.
“How disappointed are they going to be in 28 days?” Ciattarelli said to applause from the crowd of his supporters. “Because I’m here to tell you right here, right now, in 28 days, we’re declaring victory. We’re winning this race.”
It’s now four weeks until New Jersey voters decide whether Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, or Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, will become our next governor in a race that has become increasingly bitter as both sides claim the other is lying about their record. Rising costs, immigration, Sherrill’s military record, and Ciattarelli’s support of President Donald Trump have dominated the campaign in its most recent weeks.
The two are competing on Nov. 4 to replace outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who is wrapping up his two terms as governor in January and cannot seek a third term this year. Vic Kaplan, a Libertarian, and Joanne S. Kuniansky, representing the Socialist Workers Party, will also be on the ballot.










We’re not playing tiddlywinks here. This is New Jersey politics. It’s a rough-and-tumble sport.


– Ben Dworkin, director of Rowan Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship


Sherill told reporters during a campaign stop at Kean University Monday that the large turnout for June’s six-person Democratic gubernatorial primary indicated how eager the party is to remain in power for a third straight term.
“That’s the kind of enthusiasm we’re seeing on the ground. We are working to get that, take that enthusiasm and ensure that every single person gets to the polls,” she said.

Polling edge
Since polling ramped up at the start of September, surveys of the contest have usually shown Sherrill with a sizable single-digit lead.
Though some polls have suggested a closer race — including a tied result from an Emerson College poll released last month — Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll director Dan Cassino believes Sherrill has the edge.
“I think we do see Democrats freaking out and getting worried and being nervous because they’re Democrats in New Jersey and that is their species’ being,” Cassino said. “I don’t think we have any particular reason for them to be nervous, but I think they very much are.”
An Axios report cited private conversations with unnamed Democrats to say the party is increasingly concerned that Sherrill could lose the race. Sherrill brushed the criticism off on Monday, suggesting national Democrats “are in a different place.” 
“This is just the kind of, I think, electorate that is ready to fight hard for the things we care about, and I think we’ll see those results in November,” she said. 
Ashley Koning, director of Rutgers University’s Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, warned the race would come down to turnout — something next to impossible to forecast.
“Turnout has never been something that’s predictable, but it certainly is not predictable now, and when you overlay the national political context on top of our race in this state, it is incredibly difficult to get a good handle on where this actually is, other than of course it’s close,” Koning said.
Polls of New Jersey’s 2021 gubernatorial race — when Murphy faced Ciattarelli — mostly missed the mark. Though Real Clear Politics’ polling average showed Murphy up 7.8 points over Ciattarelli, the governor won reelection by just 2.8 points.
Pollsters have made some changes to prevent another miss. Fairleigh Dickinson University’s poll began weighting its results by education and region to more accurately reflect attitudes across the state, Cassino said, though the effect of such changes is so far untested.
There are other reasons to think the race will be close, and the candidates’ increasing acrimony numbers near the top of the list.
Sherrill and Ciattarelli have launched ads seeking to tar their opponent in what Cassino said is a bid to drive down turnout among their rival’s base.
“The fact that it’s turned negative tells you both candidates think this race is up for grabs,” Cassino said, later adding, “This is trying to winnow the electorate down to just the most committed voters because both sides think they have an advantage there.”

Rough and tumble
Turnout in this year’s governor’s race is expected to be low, as is typical for the state’s odd-year elections. In 2021, just 40% of the state’s eligible voters cast ballots in the general election.
But the campaigns’ turn toward mudslinging could also just reflect the growing bitterness of American politics.
“I think that’s what politics is nowadays. I think we have seen more and more nationalized campaigns, including here in the Garden State,” said Koning. “This is just what politics is. This is what it’s expected to be, and that civility and decorum that used to once, potentially, accompany it is gone.”
Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship, said this year’s negativity hasn’t reached any high-water marks.
“Negative campaigns, contrasts over policies happen all the time. Personal attacks are unfortunate, but they happen in this game. We’re not playing tiddlywinks here,” he said. “This is New Jersey politics. It’s a rough-and-tumble sport.”
Trump could also prove an unpredictable variable in the race.
Sherrill has invoked him often on the campaign trail, hoping to tap the same animus that helped propel her to her first congressional term in 2018. On Monday, she criticized the effect of Trump’s tariffs and the continued federal government shutdown, which Democrats blame on Republicans and Republicans blame on Democrats.
“Voters are seeing Trump is costing them an incredible amount of money, and every time they go to Jack to say, ‘What are you going to do about it?’ his response is largely, ‘I agree with it,’” she said.
Ciattarelli’s mentions of Trump have largely been to mock Sherrill for her focus on him.
“If you get a flat tire on the way home today, it’s President Trump’s fault,” Ciattarelli joked in Nutley. “There’s nothing this woman won’t blame on President Trump.”
Historically, New Jersey backs the governor who doesn’t share the president’s party affiliation. Murphy bucked that trend to win reelection in 2021, but at least some of that win can be attributed to the pandemic, Dworkin said.
The state also rarely selects a governor from the same party three times in a row. New Jersey last did so when Gov. Richard Hughes was elected to succeed Gov. Robert Meyner in 1961.
“I think the fact that we’re really not sure which one of these kinds of trends is going to be dominant reflects the closeness of the race,” Dworkin said.

OAK GROVE — Alabama officials charged with protecting residents from surface impacts of underground coal mining have notified the federal government that they’ve suspended plans to require that expanding mines monitor for potentially explosive methane gas.
The decision is a reversal of the state’s previous agreement with federal regulators spurred by a fatal home explosion above the expanding Oak Grove mine here in rural Jefferson County.
After months of pressure from local residents and close media scrutiny, primarily a lengthy investigation by Inside Climate News, federal officials had issued Alabama a Ten Day Notice, a regulatory action meant to force state officials to address the risks of methane escape from active coal mines.

Longwall mining, fairly common in Alabama’s coalfields, releases methane gas. That risks explosions if it escapes to the surface through cracks in land disturbed by the mining method.
Within days of that December 2024 notice, state officials agreed to require that coal mining companies launch methane monitoring programs across Alabama, giving the operators 90 days to file updated plans outlining how they planned to comply. Later, at the request of the coal lobby, the state’s top mining regulator extended the deadline by six months, giving coal companies until Sept. 30 to file their updated plans.
When that extension was announced, officials with the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement told the state they believed the delay was “excessively lengthy.”
“If your original … response had contained an eight-month response time with little information/justification,” OSMRE’s Birmingham Field Office director wrote to Alabama regulators in March, “it is unlikely that your … response would have been deemed adequate.”
Now, as that extension has come to an end, the state regulator, Alabama Surface Mining Commission director Kathy Love, has notified OSMRE that she has “indefinitely suspended” any requirement for methane monitoring plans.





In a letter obtained by Inside Climate News, Love wrote to the federal agency that she is requesting a formal review of the Ten Day Notice sent to Alabama, which she argued may have been improperly motivated by “media pressure and a citizen’s unknowledgeable complaint.” The Ten Day Notice, Love wrote, was “not warranted or adequately supported and therefore should be withdrawn.”


Though the March 2024 home explosion was an “unfortunate” incident, Love wrote, her agency did not and does not believe that the expanding longwall mine poses an imminent risk to public safety.
Jack Spadaro, a West Virginia-based former top federal mine safety engineer, said that Love’s conclusion could not be further from the truth.
“Shame on her for making that statement,” Spadaro said. “If someone gets blown up and burned alive, that appears to me to be a danger to the health and safety of the public.”

D. Leon Ashford is an attorney representing the family of W.M. Griffice, the grandfather who lost his life as a result of the March 2024 explosion. In a statement, Ashford wrote that Love’s letter contains “factual inaccuracies and misleading statements.” Regulators have known for decades that fugitive methane poses a risk to citizens living above mines and should work to mitigate them, he wrote.
“It is deeply troubling to read what appears to be a complete abandonment by ASMC of its responsibility to protect Alabama citizens from known and preventable harm from the release of fugitive methane,” he wrote. “The Griffice family, along with all the residents of the Warrior River Basin, deserve better. We urge the ASMC to rescind its request for OSMRE to ‘withdraw’ the Ten-Day Notice and implement the actions it previously represented it would take to protect the health and safety of the public.”
The ASMC and its director did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

An ‘unknowledgeable’ citizen

Eighteen months ago, Lisa Lindsay watched as her neighbor stumbled up to her home in rural Alabama. His body, covered in soot, was still smoking. Moments before, she’d felt the shockwaves of a nearby explosion surge through her body.
Tim Griffice, still in shock, told Lindsay and her husband that the explosion at the next-door home of his brother, W.M., had knocked him out of bed. He ran out of the house to the sound of his nephew’s screams, he told them: “Help me! Help me!”

Tim and his nephew, who was inside the home when the explosion occurred, went back into the structure to retrieve W.M. from the flames. About a month later, W.M. Griffice would die from the injuries he suffered that day. His grandson remained in hospital for weeks, recovering from injuries that are expected to impact him for the rest of his life.
Members of the Oak Grove community, including Griffice’s family and the Lindsays, are all certain of what caused that explosion: the coal mine slowly expanding beneath their homes. Griffice’s family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the owners of the Oak Grove mine, alleging that their negligence in allowing the escape of explosive methane gas into the Griffice home was to blame.
In court filings, Oak Grove has denied responsibility for the explosion and the resulting loss of life. The mine did not respond to a request for comment on this story.
In the months that followed the explosion and Griffice’s death, neighbors including Lisa Lindsay repeatedly expressed their concerns about their own safety to state and federal officials, begging regulators to implement meaningful reforms that would prevent another tragedy in their community.
In an interview with Inside Climate News, Lindsay said she’s likely the “unknowledgeable” citizen referenced by Love in her letter to OSMRE.
Love’s statement that “there was no imminent danger to the health and safety of the public,” Lindsay said, was “absolutely inaccurate and infuriating.”
Before moving to her current position as ASMC director, Love worked for years at a public accounting firm conducting internal financial audits for coal companies across the state.

Lindsay said she doesn’t claim to be an expert on coal mining, but she added that it only takes common sense to know that what happened to her neighbor has the potential of happening again.
“I admit to being an ‘unknowledgeable citizen.’ I am not a coal mine expert. I do not have years of working relationships in and with the coal mining industry, like many in this situation do have,” Lindsay said. “I just have the privilege of being a citizen of this state and country that gives me the right to ask questions, observe, learn and voice my opinion, even if, and when, it earns me a target on my back. That is part of serving your state, country and fellow citizens that anyone can, and should, do.”

The experts’ view

While Lindsay may not be an expert on coal mining safety, Spadaro has spent years in coal fields across the country, first as a federal coal regulator and now as an expert who consults on cases involving coal mine safety, including methane-related explosions.
He said that without additional regulations requiring methane mitigation and monitoring above the Oak Grove mine, which continues to expand, residents’ safety is at stake.
“There are still hundreds of people at risk in the areas underlying this mine, and they’re all at risk of having something similar happen to them,” he said.
In the absence of state action to address the hazards from the escape of methane, Spadaro believes the federal government should revoke the state’s ability to regulate its own mining and take over the job of keeping residents safe themselves.

“The state of Alabama has failed its mandatory requirement under federal law to protect the public from danger,” he said. “We’ve already had one house explode—a man who caught on fire and died and another person that was severely injured with burns. So the Alabama officials who are not going to require methane monitoring are in violation of federal law.”
Spadaro also balked at Love’s suggestion in the letter to federal officials that implementing methane mitigation and monitoring would be financially prohibitive for coal operators.
“That’s just bulls—,” he said. “It’s not expensive to install methane monitors and venting devices to alleviate these hazards.”
Eva Dillard, a staff attorney for Black Warrior Riverkeeper, a nonprofit environmental organization, called the state’s decision to roll back the monitoring requirement “both astonishing and reckless.”
“Now Alabama mines have been given a pass by the ASMC and can delay indefinitely the enhanced subsidence and methane monitoring requirements that OSMRE imposed to safeguard the public from similar harm,” Dillard said.
She said that federal officials have relied on the anticipated implementation of these safety guardrails in approving other mine expansions in the state. Now, however, these projects will move forward in the absence of meaningful safeguards for residents living atop active mines. Rolling back these reforms, Dillard said, places the finances of coal companies “over the safety of surrounding communities.”
Spadaro said he believes that ASMC’s decision to ask the federal government to withdraw its regulatory action eight months after state regulators agreed to make necessary reforms is happening now simply because they believe the Trump administration will be more likely to side with coal companies over residents who fear for their lives.
“It’s just opportunistic,” Spadaro said. “That’s all there is to it. Alabama wants to defy longstanding regulations and law, which seems to go hand in hand with what the Trump administration does.”
Reading the letter made Spadaro sick to his stomach, he said.
“It’s disgusting that these people who run the Alabama program care so little about the individual who has already been killed and the public that is still facing these kinds of hazards.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/W.M.-Griffice-home-for-March-24-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 07:59:30.869928

What is the state’s plan for shelter starting now, to ensure people stay alive?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Isaac Evans-Frantz: Gov. Phil Scott should work with people providing services to unhoused Vermonters — not just provide recommendations.","This commentary is by Isaac Evans-Frantz, of Brattleboro. Evans-Frantz is the clerk of the Brattleboro Selectboard and the director of Action Corps, a nationwide organization that campaigns for U.S. policies to save the lives of people affected by climate disasters and violent conflict. He wrote this commentary as an individual selectboard member — the views represent his own.


On Sept. 10, Gov. Phil Scott announced plans to deliver recommendations for how Burlington can tackle the homelessness crisis. Along with his recommendations, he should take responsibility for the problem in a collaborative fashion, not simply telling one municipality what to do.
In August, Scott came to Windham County. On his itinerary were visits to Grafton Village Cheese, Jelly’s Deli in Londonderry, Jamaica State Park and the Vermont EMS Academy in Newfane. Missing was a visit to a local agency that supports people who are unhoused. 
The day before Scott’s visit to Windham County, President Donald Trump wrote on social media, “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY.” He deployed the National Guard to Washington, D.C. and vowed to forcibly remove unhoused people from our nation’s capital.
This summer, here in Vermont, we have seen our state government remove families with young children and senior citizens with oxygen tanks from motels without a plan for a safe place for these Vermonters to go, let alone even a tent, sleeping bag or place to camp. This has stretched social service agencies beyond capacity, and municipalities have struggled with the fallout. 
Since 2020, Vermont’s homeless population has more than tripled in size, the largest increase in any state. A top driver of homelessness here is our housing shortage. A study a few years ago found that my town of Brattleboro, for example, was over 500 housing units short of the need. There’s been important progress, but much more is needed. 
On May 30, the Brattleboro Selectboard voted against urging a veto of H.91. With this decision, a majority of our selectboard voted in support of the legislature’s forward-looking proposed solution to move away from the state-run motel program and to regionalize homeless services. In speaking directly with Brattleboro residents across neighborhoods earlier this year, I heard a consistent message: residents want to see adequate shelter for our neighbors experiencing homelessness. This means planning shelter — including non-congregate options — with plenty of lead time, and in collaboration with our municipality, local service providers and people with lived experience.
I was heartbroken on April 1 when many of our vulnerable neighbors lost access to shelter in motels without the provision of even a tent and sleeping bag. That day, I spoke with Mark Caslin, a lifelong Vermonter and military veteran who had recently survived a serious medical event, who was staying at the Econo Lodge by Exit 1 off of I-91. I have not been able to locate him since, and I fear for his well-being.
This happened again on July 1, when 107 children and medically vulnerable adults in Brattleboro were required to leave their motel rooms. That day, I spoke with several of these individuals. Larry Jones was one. Mr. Jones, who has lived in Windham County for 20 years, relies on an oxygen tank, insulin pump, and walker. He told me he was afraid he would die in the woods. This is not an irrational fear, as he requires electricity to survive, and already we know of a death in neighboring Windsor County as a result of people being required to leave the motels because their annual 80 nights of allotted shelter are up.
We are heading into colder months, with freezing weather just around the corner — well before the December 1 start date for the State of Vermont limited cold-weather provisions. For medically vulnerable people and families with children, survival between now and December 1 will be difficult, and harm will be irreparable. Loss of life among unhoused Vermonters has become far too common. Now is the time to prepare. What is the state’s plan for shelter starting now, to ensure people stay alive?
While there may be differences in approach, there is widespread support for the common goal of ensuring no one in our community dies for lack of shelter.
In past instances, the Scott administration has rushed to stand up emergency shelters, including one last year in Brattleboro that no one used and that wasted Vermonters’ taxpayer dollars. Advanced planning with input from local providers could make a world of difference. We have skilled and knowledgeable organizations here in Brattleboro and around the state; these organizations, and others, have the expertise, data and lived experience to guide more effective solutions.
Along with issuing recommendations for Burlington, the governor should retrace his steps from his 14-county tour and this time speak directly with the social service providers, town staff and people with lived homelessness experience, listen to their recommendations and work collaboratively with a humane and effective approach to ensuring all of our safety in these coming colder months.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)New data show Indiana’s entries into the state’s foster care system increased by 30%, from just over 6,000 children to nearly 7,900 children, between 2023 and 2024 even as the national average fell from 2%. 
The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System defines an entry as a child who “began an out-of-home care episode” during the time period, which follows the federal fiscal year from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. 
Between 2023 and 2024, the overall number of children in foster care, measured by those children in care on the last day of the fiscal year, grew from 10,500 children to nearly 12,000 children — a 13% increase.
Nationally, the number of children in foster care during the time fell 3%.
Indiana Department of Child Services Director Adam Krupp called the statistic a “snapshot in time,” noting that rates steadily decreased to a historic low in 2023. 

“That historic low generated a lot of questions,” said Krupp, who was appointed in January by Gov. Mike Braun. “… questions like, ‘Are we doing enough to keep children safe?’”
Krupp emphasized before an interim legislative committee that the safety of children would be the first priority under his leadership. Speaking to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, he noted that a 2023 Evansville neglect arrest made national news after authorities discovered a baby with over 50 rat bites. DCS had been monitoring the family for months but ultimately decided the children should stay in the home.
Three DCS staffers were fired over that case and later sued the state. 
“… that gets national recognition, and there is an expectation and a predicted outcome that you’re going to see an uptick in cases because we need to look at things a little bit differently,” said Krupp. 
He noted that CHINS cases, or Children in Need of Services, had been steady during his tenure, starting at 13,657 in January and falling slightly to 13,510 in August, according to the DCS dashboard. Likewise, the number of children with DCS cases has remained steady during that time, from 16,748 to 16,393.
“It’s hovered in that range for the better part of the last year coming out of what very clearly was an all-time, historic low,” said Krupp. “We’re not going to do anything to swing the pendulum one direction or the other too far. We’re going to prioritize keeping kids safe. And if that means there are 13,510 kids in the system, then that’s what it is.”
 Criticisms of DCS

Even in those years when cases were declining, critics flagged concerns about DCS “tear(ing) apart families at rates well above the national average.” 
With the 30% increase, the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform noted that families were separated at the sixth-highest rate in the country, specifically saying Indiana’s caseworkers “confuse poverty with neglect,” citing an IndyStar story about “missed red flags” in a foster home.
Nearly four out of every five Black Hoosier kids will experience a maltreatment investigation during their childhood, higher than the statewide average for other races and above the national average of 53% for all Black children. 
The 2023 study, spanning from 2015 to 2019, analyzed state-level differences in child welfare agencies. In response to the study, DCS noted that its care rate for Black children had fallen in the following years.
Black Hoosier children top the nation for likelihood of DCS investigation

Richard Wexler, the executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, calls child protection agencies “state family police,” and flagged the new foster care entry data in a blog post. 
“None of this is because Indiana is a cesspool of depravity with vastly more child abuse than the national average,” said Wexler in the post. “In fact, in Indiana in 2023, 86% of the time, when children were thrown into foster care, their parents were not even accused of physical or sexual abuse. Forty percent of the time, there wasn’t even an allegation of drug abuse.”
Krupp said that, in response to that criticism, he’d explicitly told DCS employees, “we’re not policing poverty.”
“It’s about safety. And just because a home that you walk into to perform an assessment for a report that came through the hotline — that home might look very different from what you grew up in or what you are familiar with,” said Krupp. “That does not mean they are neglecting their child in that home. It’s just different.”
Upon seeing a home with no functioning plumbing or without heat, “an overzealous individual” might try to remove a child, said Krupp. 
“Whereas we can remedy that situation either same day, overnight or the next day because we (can) call up a community partner,” he added. “We don’t want that child taken away from their home to become part of the child welfare system for something that is very fixable and solvable in an immediate or short-term situation.” 
However, Krupp did say that Indiana’s cases are “much more heavily on the neglect side,” as opposed to abuse.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A River Parishes refinery is under heightened scrutiny from state regulators after it unlawfully discharged industrial waste containing arsenic, cadmium, chromium and other toxic heavy metals into public areas and waterways. 
Atlantic Alumina, also known as Atalco, is facing dozens of environmental violations stemming from  breaches that occurred last year in the giant levees of its waste containment lakes at its aluminum oxide refinery near Gramercy. The facility is the only one remaining in the United States that refines alumina, a process that produces a caustic red slurry the company stores in several manmade lakes near the St. James-St. John the Baptist parish line.
In August, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality issued the company a “Notice of Potential Penalty” compliance order that detailed the violations state officials documented during a series of inspections that began over a year ago. Now, the company must also address a slate of new requirements LDEQ has tacked onto Atalco’s solid waste permit renewal application, records show.
Federal and state inspectors first noticed the pollution discharges from Atalco’s “red mud” lakes over a year ago, according to a 606-page LDEQ inspection report finalized in March. The report details how a slurry of corrosive waste cut erosion channels through the giant levees around the waste lakes and escaped into the public drainage system that flows to the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas. 
In June, an Illuminator investigation into thousands of pages of state and federal documents and interviews with scientists and area residents indicated that Atalco polluted public land and state waterways with toxic waste for months — never notifying the neighboring community.   
Atalco has not responded to multiple requests for comment. 
In an effort to prevent future incidents, LDEQ is now requiring Atalco to provide more detailed maps and engineering drawings of its drainage systems and the perimeter ditches they flow into surrounding the facility’s “red mud” lakes.
The agency also wants the company to provide an updated, more detailed plan to address levee erosion and leaks from the waste containment lakes. The plan must include more details on how Atalco inspects its levees daily, the training requirements for its inspection personnel, how leaks are documented practices and who’s notified when leaks are discovered. It also must include a slope stability analysis, an assessment that shows if the levees were constructed at the most optimal angles to prevent erosion.
Atalco has not yet responded to LDEQ’s latest request, which it received on Sept. 17. The company has 60 days from that date to file a response. 
A Louisiana refinery spilled toxic waste into the community and knew about it for months

In the meantime, Atalco is grappling with an LDEQ notice issued Aug. 22 that laid out violations stemming from last year’s levee breaches and subsequent waste pollution discharges that have occurred since then. 
The notice recaps the incidents and regulatory violations described in the Illuminator’s initial reporting and a follow-up report about a repeat of the levee breaches this summer. LDEQ singled out Outfall 003, the public drainage ditch that flows into the Blind River Swamp. 
“On or about May 29, 2025, inspectors from the Department observed four (4) erosion channels or breaches along the … levees near Outfall 003, where reddish-orange caustic material/liquor was seeping into the receiving ditch for Outfall 003,” the notice stated. “Additionally, the Department observed several of the receiving streams within the Blind River Swamp further downstream from the facility’s outfalls to be turbid, objectionable in color (reddish-orange), and have a caustic odor.” 
The four breaches from May 29 are just some of the violations for which Atalco has been placed on notice. On the same day, LDEQ found an unauthorized discharge of “unknown origin” that formed a “stagnant red pool” within a marshy area past the facility’s outer fence. Then, on June 11, inspectors discovered another off-site discharge of pollution coming from the opposite side of Atalco’s property.
“The Department observed the discharge resulting from a break within the containment ditch levee near a hole in the facility’s fence,” the notice states.
Atalco has responded to LDEQ’s notice, indicating the company intends to comply with the agency’s orders and take corrective actions to address the violations. 
“Respondent will develop a Red Mud Lakes Integrity and Operational Workplan,” Atalco wrote in its response. “Respondent will provide supplemental information to the Department, as additional details become available … Respondent has taken immediate correction actions to control discharges to waters of the state.”
The company attached more than two dozen photos to its response showing construction and repairs it has made to its levees and other areas of the facility. 
The LDEQ notice states that Atalco could face up to $32,500 per violation for each day it goes unaddressed. The agency routinely includes such stipulations in its violation notices but almost never levies maximum penalties. 
For instance, following a 2017 compliance inspection, LDEQ cited Atalco for 78 violations mostly related to the company’s air pollution permit and allowed the company to pay a fine of $75,000 without admitting to any wrongdoing.  
For the latest violations against Atalco, LDEQ has invited the company to make a negotiated offer to settle the case. Attached to the agency’s notice was a form that Atalco can fill out and submit with a settlement offer for an amount the company thinks is fair.  LDEQ does not have to accept the offer, however. 
The agency did not respond to detailed questions the Illuminator submitted regarding its latest notices to Atalco.

This has Washington officials trying to improve the state’s already well below-average error rate in providing benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Ideas include increasing case reviews and establishing a new team focused on reducing mishaps.
The so-called “big, beautiful bill” that congressional Republicans passed in July is set to reduce federal spending on nutrition programs nationwide by an estimated $186 billion over 10 years. 
This could cost over 130,000 enrollees their food benefits due to more stringent work requirements, according to state officials. And it stands to shift tens of millions in administrative costs from the federal government to the state.
But Washington could face many tens of millions more in new costs if it doesn’t address its error rate. 
While the federal government funds SNAP benefits, states run the program for low-income residents. The two levels of government share administrative expenses. In May, the most recent month for which data is available, over 905,000 Washingtonians received a total of $167 million in SNAP benefits.
Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of food stamp benefits usually paid for by the feds, depending on how often they make mistakes doling out payments. 
Those with error rates between 6% and 8% would pay for 5% of benefits, amounting to around $100 million in Washington. Between 8% and 10% would cost the state about $200 million. And anything over 10% will force the state to shoulder a staggering $300 million in new costs.
“This change is a completely fundamental shift in the responsibility of the federal government to the states,” said Claire Lane, director of the Seattle-based Anti-Hunger and Nutrition Coalition. 
States will have to start paying those shares in October 2027, as part of the Trump administration’s self-described crusade against waste, fraud and abuse.
The costs could force some states to limit enrollment or doom their food stamp programs altogether. 
“There are a lot of states concerned that this is not sustainable,” Lane said. “Making states pay enormously to feed a lot fewer people is going to be tragic for many hungry people.”
Luckily, Washington is ahead of the pack on this issue. Its error rate in the 2024 federal fiscal year was 6.06%, just above the minimum threshold. Most of those mistakes were overpayments. The national average is just under 11%. 
For federal fiscal year 2025, Washington’s SNAP program, known as Basic Food, was trending toward an error rate over 8%, according to the state Department of Social and Health Services, which runs the program. This would put its penalty at $200 million annually. 
Before this, Washington had been on the right track, reducing its rate from 9.33% in fiscal year 2022.
States have the option to choose between their 2025 and 2026 fiscal year error rates to decide how much they’ll pay. Federal fiscal years start Oct. 1. In subsequent years, penalties will be based on the rate from three years earlier. 
But with major changes to eligibility on the way, officials fear the state will slip up more often, not less. 
Preventing mistakes
The Department of Social and Health Services wants a half-dozen new full-time employees to increase case reviews and monitor error trends. 
It’s looking to establish a small data-driven team with the sole mission of minimizing mistakes. The department also proposed expanded reviews of cases handled by staff with above-average error rates. Money to use artificial intelligence that can automate some of the process would also help, the agency said. 
The Department of Social and Health Services is seeking nearly $1.7 million to bring the ideas to fruition. The agency recently submitted a request for supplemental funding to the governor’s office. Gov. Bob Ferguson in December will propose to state lawmakers a budget tweaking the two-year spending plan he signed in May. 
In its request to the governor, the department described the ask as the “bare minimum,” as it continues to develop other plans.
“We will continue to ensure accuracy while we work with Gov. Ferguson’s office and the Legislature to find solutions that avoid or reduce increased costs to an already strained state budget,” Department of Social and Health Services spokesperson Norah West said in an email. “This makes good fiscal sense and provides additional support to DSHS employees and the Washingtonians they serve when they get the correct benefit amounts the first time.”

Other states are taking similar action. Oregon, for example, has created a dedicated team focused on finding ways to reduce its 14.06% error rate. 
Some states with particularly high error rates, like Oregon, could get an extension before they have to pay benefit costs. That provision was added to win over Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, the key vote to get President Donald Trump’s megabill through the U.S. Senate. Alaska’s error rate is highest in the nation, at nearly 25%. 
The Department of Social and Health Services also wants $4.6 million for information technology upgrades to respond to changes in the new federal law.

It’s just two blocks from the Sun Fresh grocery store that operated at 31st Street and Prospect Avenue until it shut down in August.
The retired Army veteran and Purple Heart recipient has lived in the neighborhood for 35 years. He’s seen the area when it was a food desert before and is troubled by the desert’s return.
Ramsey is trying to do his part by growing and giving away more than 1,000 pounds of produce. But he knows that’s only a bandage for a bigger wound. He is worried for his neighbors — often elderly or low-income — who will now have a harder time finding nutritious food.
“I’ve seen an uptick in neighbors needing the service of the community garden,” Ramsey said. “The impact of the store closing is being felt throughout the neighborhood, and we’ll get by because we always get by. But I’m beginning to see resentment set in, and that scares me.”
The Sun Fresh closure is just part of a growing urban food desert and food insecurity problem in the area. Six miles away in downtown Kansas City, Kansas, the Merc Co+op will close at the end of the year, returning that area to food desert status after just five years of operation.
“I live in a food desert if I am not able to get to a full service grocery store easily,” said  Kristina Bridges, a research assistant professor in University of Kansas Medical Center’s department of family medicine and community health. Food insecurity is defined as whether “in the past 12 months, have you run out of food before you could get more? If the answer is yes, you have food insecurity.”
Together, the two grocery store closures will hamper thousands of residents in low-income and low-food-access areas that Dina Newman from the Center for Neighborhoods calls “communities of concern.”
Tight profit margins at grocery stores mean that grocers often avoid the risk of investing in these communities of concern. As a result, food desert maps follow disinvestment patterns that resemble historic redlining.
Those living in a food desert or experiencing food insecurity have measurably worse health outcomes including a life expectancy shortened by 2.29 years, according to American Cancer Society researchers. While some like Ramsey work to provide short-term community-level solutions, Bridges says broader long-term approaches are also needed.
 Logistics of a food desert

With the two local grocery stores closing, new food deserts will emerge.
In the late 1980s, Newman was a single mother without a car. She knows the struggle of navigating a food desert firsthand.
“So if I’m working … I have to plan it out to get to the bus to get over to a store. Then l’m waiting at the bus stop, which is sometimes just a patch of dirt,” Newman said. “Then I have to transfer buses with a full load of groceries. What about my child, are they with me? Am I safe alone after dark? You are juggling all this just trying to get to the grocery store, that’s the challenge.”
She recalled one incident during the winter when an ice storm came while she was shopping. Out of necessity, she put her socks over her shoes in an attempt to get some traction and not fall and spill her groceries.
“This is all your hard-earned money in these groceries, you’ve got to get them home,” she said.
Ramsey says that many people in his neighborhood now have to walk up to a mile or take the bus to get fresh food at places like Aldi or Happy Foods. He says the effort required to get nutritious food means that many with limited means will just turn to more convenient options like corner stores and gas stations.
“I can’t throw a rock without hitting a fried chicken spot,” Ramsey said. “So we’re eating processed food, cheap food that we can get our hands on, because access to fresh healthy food is not an option for us.”
 Historic patterns with current consequences

While food deserts and food insecurity touch both urban and rural populations, there is a racial disparity. According to a 2024 USDA report, 8% of white households face food insecurity while the number is 21% for Black households and 16.9% for Hispanic households nationwide.
Notably, that report is the last USDA survey on food security for the foreseeable future. The Trump administration has labeled the report “redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous.” 

If a census tract was redlined as “declining” or “hazardous” in the 1930s Home Owners’ Loan Corp. maps, that translated into a 107% and 149% increase in the likelihood that the same census tract would be a food desert today, according to a 2022 study covering 102 U.S. cities.
“It just feels like this is all intentional,” Ramsey said.
Bridges says KU Medical system has been mapping food insecurity among patients since 2017 and sees a strong correlation between rates of Type 2 diabetes, modern food insecurity and historic redlining.
“It’s really no surprise that the bubbles (on the map) overlapped,” said Bridges. “We have big food insecurity bubbles, big Type 2 diabetes bubbles. … They were north, where downtown KCK and the Merc is, and the east side where the Sun Fresh was. …If we pull out our old redlining maps, it’s exactly the same pattern.”
The seemingly structural nature of the problem has led many advocates to use the term “food apartheid” instead of “food desert,” since a desert occurs naturally while food insecurity appears to occur as the result of man-made systems.
“I knew what food apartheid was before food apartheid was a phrase,” Ramsey said. “You go to certain places and the quality of the food is vastly different. … We’re forced to take the scraps and it’s an affront to our personhood.”
The lack of access to nutritious food has hurtful consequences. Chronic diseases like obesity, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes become more common, but so do complications from deficiencies in fiber and good gut bacteria that are primarily found in fresh fruits and vegetables.
Bridges says understanding these connections between food deserts, food insecurity and chronic disease is something that even some doctors need education on. She recalls speaking to a practitioner who said they didn’t believe there was a problem with food insecurity because “his patients were all fat.”
“That completely misses the mark,” Bridges said. “Just the long-term chronic stress of being food insecure or living in a food desert releases cortisol in your body that can cause a host of things … including obesity.”
 Economic reality of grocery stores closing

Both the Prospect Sun Fresh and the KCK Merc Co+op faced the economic headwinds of operating a grocery store in a historically disinvested neighborhood. While each faced unique issues with their locations, they shared similar challenges.
The Prospect Sun Fresh’s former operator — nonprofit developer Community Builders, which also runs Sun Fresh at 4209 E. 50th Terrace  — said they faced a litany of operating challenges at the Prospect location and lost approximately $5 million trying to keep the store open from February 2022 to August 2025.
“We stepped up to fill a void that no one else was going to fill,” said Community Builders CEO Emmet Pearson at an Urban Summit meeting after the Prospect Sun Fresh closed. “The previous operator reached out to us because he tried to get other operators to come forward and no one else would.”
The city had previously invested $17 million to $18 million into shopping center infrastructure at Linwood Boulevard and Prospect Avenue and was the landlord of the Sun Fresh location. Pearson says that meant Community Builders couldn’t fully control the environment around the store due to limitations in their lease. Board of directors member Kiki Curls says that directly hurt business.
“It’s the element that’s outside the store that impacted us doing business,” said Curls at the Urban Summit meeting. “When you have open prostitution, open drug use and drug sales, when you have folks that pull down their pants and defecate in front of the door when people are coming in store, people do not come back.”
Community Builders themselves received $750,000 in direct cash subsidy from the city to help at the Prospect Sun Fresh in May 2025 along with $161,500 in rent relief. Pearson and the board of directors say that was a drop in the bucket compared to their operational challenges.
Security was $5,000 to $6,000 a week with the cost of a single off-duty police officer paid between $60 and $90 an hour. The store had a “persistent sewer smell” for months that they say stemmed from infrastructure issues. Community Builders said these issues combined to drive sales down and customers away, which ultimately led to taking a loss and closing the store.
Across the state line, the Merc Co+op is in its waning days. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, had invested approximately $7 million to bring in the Lawrence-based fresh grocer.
After three years of planning and five years of operation the Merc announced in June that it would close at the end of this year. Merc cited poor financial performance at the downtown KCK location and that operating it further could hurt the long-term viability of the cooperative, which has operated in Lawrence for 50 years.
Contributing to the closure was the failure of promised nearby redevelopment, which was intended to increase population density, median wages and foot traffic in the area, needed to help support the grocer. A $25 million redevelopment of the Reardon Convention Center across the street from the Merc never came to fruition after several extensions. And a nearby $145 million Minnesota Avenue Triangle mixed-use project fell through, with developers citing funding gaps.
Patrick Shabram, a location research consultant with G2G analytics who helps grocers identify viable locations by projecting future sales, says there are many considerations to determining whether a grocery store will succeed. He said the top three indicators that most grocery stores look for are population density per area competitor, income level and the education level of a neighborhood.
As a general rule, Shabram said a grocery store targets $100,000 in sales per square foot in the first year of operation. Notably, the net profit margin for grocery stores nationwide is just 1.7% according to FMI, a food industry association, which means that even a slight dip in sales could doom a store.
Shabram said the challenge grocers face in opening in an underserved area is balancing the social good of opening a store in an area that needs it while also maintaining profitability.
“I provide the most accurate sales forecast I can so that there can be the proper expectations,” Shabram said. “Then I’m basically saying do what you can to make it work.”
He says that often means looking into grants and incentives to make it through the first couple of lean years while the store establishes itself. He says other ways grocery stores look to improve profitability are pulling in shoppers from neighboring areas or selling higher-margin items like prepared meals or retail. But he says visibility, access, parking lot size, the store’s fit in the neighborhood and size of the store are all major determinants of grocery store success.
“There’s no one answer for every scenario. But a lot of times I’m encouraging people to open smaller stores,” Shabram said. “That might mean it won’t have all the items needed for weekly shopping at the store, but you can provide access to fresh foods that weren’t available at the dollar store.”
 Community solutions and addressing root causes

The local governments on both sides of the state line say that they are working to attract grocery stores to replace the recently shuttered locations.
In the meantime, stopgap solutions are being pursued.
Newman — in her capacity as founder of the Kansas City Black Urban Growers — partnered with area urban farmers and the Kansas City Defender to create the Hamer Free Food Program. They will give out monthly food boxes to residents within one mile of the closed Sun Fresh. The program is in the pilot phase, and 50 household slots were filled in a matter of hours.
Ramsey works with the nonprofit Urban Green Dreams and will continue to manage community gardens as he hopes to give away 2,000 pounds of food this year. He also works to help educate students in nearby classrooms about growing food.
“I’m running into kids who don’t know that potatoes come from the ground or that peaches come from trees,” he said. “They know every flavor of Takis, though.”
Throughout the metro area, nonprofit Kanbe’s Markets place coolers and tiered baskets of fresh produce in independent corner stores on a consignment basis. The idea is to bring fresh produce to where people shop in low-food-access census tracts. Kanbe’s has joined with 50 community partners to place fresh fruits and vegetables in 100 corner stores, including one five blocks from the soon to close Merc Co+op.
“All these downstream things, just to feed people today, are essential,” Bridges said. “But we also need to be thinking of upstream and long-term solutions.”
Bridges said that the root causes of food deserts and food insecurity are a tangled web of health care, agriculture, education and economic factors. She believes a shift to viewing nutritious food as medicine could bring about a drop in chronic disease. That drop in preventable disease could also save the public and insurers money in the form of reduced insurance premiums, fewer claims and fewer overwhelmed emergency rooms.
“It wouldn’t obviously be a quick fix,” Bridges said. “But if you are going to do things like subsidize a building, but then not also address all the other things creating this poor economic situation like jobs, mental health, transportation access and quality of schools, then of course we’re not going to have an environment where a grocery store would survive.”
She points to some smaller programs that offer medically tailored groceries, ready-to-eat meals or fruit and vegetable vouchers. Bridges does say that getting multiple sectors to cooperate presents a sizable challenge in upscaling programs like those. But it’s a challenge that she says must be taken on to truly address the issue.
“Even though they (local governments) tried to be intentional in supporting the two grocery stores in these areas,” said Bridges, “it takes a bigger commitment from multiple sectors to really reinvest in the neighborhoods that have been divested from to address the root cause.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The voting rights focused firm Law Forward and former Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold filed an amicus brief Monday in a lawsuit brought by the National Republican Senatorial Committee to strike down a law that limits the amount of money political parties can contribute to individual candidates for office. 
The lawsuit was initially brought in 2022 by two Republican candidates, including then-Sen. J.D. Vance. The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Republican argument and now that decision is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court is expected to hear the case during its 2025-26 term, which began on Monday. 
In the amicus brief, Feingold and Law Forward argue that the weakening of campaign finance laws over the past few decades has deeply harmed American democracy — making elected officials more responsive to the needs of their wealthiest donors, in or out of their states and districts, rather than their constituents. 
“We don’t have to guess what will happen if additional campaign finance rules are torn up, we’ve already witnessed it in Wisconsin. Striking down these federal limits will remove guardrails that are necessary for a representative democracy to thrive,” Feingold said in a statement. “The erosion of regulations is responsible for an alarming increase in the amount of money flowing through elections, giving wealthy donors an outsized voice in the political process, reducing the public’s faith in their elected representatives, and diminishing voters’ willingness to continue participating in the political process.”
During his 18 years in the Senate, Feingold regularly focused on campaign finance issues, including the passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which is commonly known as McCain-Feingold and instituted a number of rules guiding the use of “soft money” by outside groups running ads to influence elections.
The Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. FEC decision in 2010 weakened the law and the brief filed Monday argues the erosion of campaign finance rules has damaged the country’s politics and made its government vulnerable to corruption. 
“For a representative democracy to thrive, elected officials must be responsive to their constituents and avoid even the appearance of corruption,” the brief states. “Campaign finance regulation exists to reinforce these guardrails. Yet, for years, opponents of regulation have persistently chiseled away at the limits established to prevent excessive campaign cash from corrupting our elections.” 
The brief uses Wisconsin as an example, which since 2015 has not placed a limit on the amount political parties can give to candidates. That change has resulted in wealthy donors from Wisconsin and across the country giving maximum contributions to candidates’ campaigns while giving much larger donations to each candidate’s party — essentially using the party committee as a middleman to funnel millions of dollars into candidate accounts. 
“With each election cycle, the total contributions made, especially for statewide candidates, grows at a shocking rate, incentivizing candidates to court the wealthiest donors,” the brief states. “And, as Wisconsin elections have drawn more and more national attention, the pool of prospective donors has expanded to include increasing numbers of millionaires and billionaires residing in other states. Thus, the cycle continues. The flood of money into Wisconsin’s elections has bred accusations of corruption and threatens to drown out — if not completely silence — the voices of average voters.”
The brief argues that the decision by Wisconsin Republicans in 2015 to weaken the state’s campaign finance laws resulted in a downward spiral that opened the floodgates to money pouring into high profile races — most notably campaigns for governor and state Supreme Court. 
“Wisconsin’s experience shows exactly what happens when we eliminate these crucial guardrails,” Law Forward attorney Rachel Snyder said. “The wealthiest donors route massive contributions through political parties, effectively buying themselves significant access to and influence with both political parties and elected officials. This isn’t about partisan politics — it’s about preserving a democracy where average citizens’ voices aren’t drowned out by billionaires’ checkbooks.”

Since Sept. 30, a team of about 25 Idaho State Department of Agriculture staff members and another 15-20 contractors have been applying a copper-based chemical called Natrix to every nook and cranny of a 3.5-mile section of the Snake River, as well as injecting the chemical into some of the underwater pools of the Snake River. 
Not only is the Snake River the longest river in Idaho and a source of irrigation and drinking water, but it is also a major tributary of the Columbia River, which empties into the Pacific Ocean. 
State officials’ goals are to stop the mussels from spreading beyond the infested area into other parts of the river system and to completely eradicate all of the mussels that have been detected here so far.
“We’re throwing everything at it as if this is the last time we would ever have to, want to or be able to do a treatment,” Idaho State Department of Agriculture Deputy Director Lloyd Knight said.
 Quagga mussels were first discovered in Idaho in 2023

Quagga mussels are a nonnative, invasive species that was first detected in water samples taken from the Snake River near Twin Falls in September 2023. 
Officials again identified quagga mussels in some of the same parts of the river in 2024 and again this September, although officials said the area of the Snake River infested with mussels has decreased from 7.2 miles of river in 2024 down to 3.5 miles of river this year. 
Idaho State Department of Agriculture officials said one breeding pair of adult quagga mussels can produce more than 1 million offspring in one year – reproducing so fast they threaten irrigation, drinking water, agriculture and recreation. Infestations of quagga mussels can clog pipes used for irrigation or drinking water and damage dams or boats, officials said. 
Additionally, quagga mussels are filter feeders, and they can disrupt the food web by taking up a huge chunk of the food and nutrients that native species are competing for, officials said.

“That’s why it’s important we throw everything we can at trying to eradicate these things,” Knight said. 
Knight estimated this year’s treatment plan could cost $2.5 to $3 million. 
But Idaho State Department of Agriculture Director Chanel Tewalt said the department is not asking for any additional state general fund money to fight the mussels at this time. Between $6.6 million that state legislators approved to fight quagga mussels in 2024 to funding taken from the sale of invasive species stickers, Tewalt said the department is not seeking additional general fund money. 
 What does Idaho’s plan to kill the quagga mussels look like?

The infestation of quagga mussels appears to be limited to the stretch of the Snake River right around Shoshone Falls, a large scenic waterfall that is higher than Niagara Falls. 
On Friday, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture invited the Idaho Capital Sun and other reporters from around Idaho to observe the treatment program and tour the infested portion of the Snake River by boat. 
In an effort to completely kill all of the quagga mussels, contractors are applying a copper-based chemical called Natrix in concentrations of one part per million to the Snake River.
The copper is designed to flow over the quagga mussels’ gills, suffocating and killing the mussels, Knight said. 
The copper chemical also suffocates and kills fish and other aquatic life with gills, officials said, though some species of fish and aquatic life appear resistant to the copper. 
Officials said they have seen fish killed this year by the copper treatment, but not as many as were killed during the first year of treatment in 2023, when tons of fish died and floated to the surface of the Snake River. 
“There is some additional take that occurs on other organisms (besides the mussels that are targeted), but the nice thing about this river run environment is there’s a good, healthy populations (of aquatic life) up river from where our treatment area is and we expect rehabilitation to occur (after treatment ends),” said Jeremey Varley, southern chief treatment engineer for the Idaho State Department of Agriculture.
This year, crews are using some tools and equipment that has been commonly used in irrigation systems in an attempt to apply the copper chemical to hard-to-reach parts of the Snake River.
Gravity boxes attached to canyon walls above shore help mix river water with the copper chemical near the surface of the water. 
And new this year, Varley, who is a certified scuba diver, rigged a new system that uses buoys, a diaphragm pump and a manifold to pump the copper chemical into pools of water 20 feet below the surface of the river to target mussels below the water.
To connect and rig the system, Varley donned a full wet suit and dove down under water, where the visibility was less than 5 feet and water temperatures were a chilly 62 degrees.
“That’s something that Jeremey came up with,” Knight said. “It’s something that is very unique to here. Nobody else has tried it anywhere else.”
Knight said the Natrix treatment being applied to the Snake River is the largest treatment of its kind in the United States and has never been attempted at such a large scale anywhere else in the U.S.

Meanwhile, as contractors are applying the copper chemical, crews are also collecting water samples in the same stretch of the Snake River. The samples are stored on ice and analyzed in a lab located at College of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls. 
On Friday, Michelle Jakaitis, the principle microbiologist for the bacteriology and parasitology lab at the state’s animal health lab, said she had not seen any live quagga mussels in water samples since the treatment program began Tuesday.
“Since treatment has occurred, we have seen much fewer (quagga mussel) veligers, and all of them have been dead, which is exactly what we expect, and we’re very glad,” Jakaitis said Friday.

During the treatment program Jakaitis and the team at the lab are using microscopes to analyze water samples from 10 a.m. until 8:30 p.m. each day. 
“It is quite a time commitment, but it is very important, and it has been very useful and informing (us) that the treatment is doing exactly what we’re expecting it to do,” Jakaitis said. 
It may be too early to tell if the treatment was totally effective. 
Following previous years’ rounds of treatment, crews did not detect the quagga mussels in samples taken earlier this year and during the early summer months of 2024. 
But officials did detected the mussels again in early September in 2024 and 2025
Knight said the department’s crews will continue sampling and testing the water for five more years to continue to monitor for the invasive mussels.
Although all Idaho state departments and agencies other than public schools are having to implement budget holdbacks of 3% to cover for state revenues shortfalls, Knight said the Idaho State Department of Agriculture officials decided to prioritize the quagga mussels response and are cutting other areas instead. 
“No, this is obviously a priority that we are throwing everybody and everything at,” Knight said.

Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) addresses a rally on the second anniversary of a Supreme Court that overturned the federal right for abortion in Clawson on June 24, 2024. | Lucy ValeskiYet another Michigan Democratic candidate seeking statewide office has called the situation in Gaza and the Israeli military offensive against the Palestinian people there a genocide – this time from U.S. Senate hopeful Mallory McMorrow.
McMorrow was pressed with a question on Gaza and accepting money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the United States. 
The state senator from Royal Oak said plainly that she would not be accepting money from AIPAC, not now or in the future, nor was she seeking its endorsement.
She also called the war and the strife there a moral abomination. When asked if she would call it a genocide, McMorrow, after a deep breath and long pause, said it was by definition a genocide.
“We have Benjamin Netanyahu trying to tell us what we’ve been seeing with our own eyes is not true,” McMorrow said of the Israeli prime minister, whose government has been at the forefront of the military action against Palestinians in Gaza. “It is true. And two things can be true at once.”
McMorrow noted that there has been a disturbing loss of life on both sides of the conflict, including the inciting Oct. 7, 2023 inflection point when Hamas terrorists attacked multiple settlements in southern Israel, including a music festival, murdering more than 1,000 civilians and taking hundreds of hostages. 
She also said her husband is Jewish and that her daughter, Noa, has an Israeli name. Both of those aspects of her public and private life garnered death threats against her after the Oct. 7 attack, which she said was the most horrendous affront to Jews since the Holocaust.
But the response from the Israeli military and the Netanyahu government was just just as horrendous, McMorrow said.
“[The war and genocide] has to end immediately,” McMorrow said. “The position of the United States should not be that we support Netanyahu with no check and balances … as an ally gone rogue, by a leader who, in their own country, is deeply unpopular. If there was an election to be held today in Israel, he would no longer be the prime minister. We have to end the war now.”

McMorrow said she supported a resolution put forward by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) calling for the nation to cut off offensive arms sales, which in her estimation was the most effective leverage the United States had to end the war.
The candidate also called for flooding the Gaza region with humanitarian aid so as to make those shipments valueless – outside of their intended purpose – to Hamas, which could potentially steal those supplies.
“We cannot be bombing Gaza to the point where it is unlivable, uninhabitable,” she said. “We have to negotiate a permanent ceasefire, and the release of all hostages. Hamas apparently agreed to that yesterday.”
McMorrow added that it was her belief that the U.S. needed to get to a place where it was brokering a real two-state solution with Israel and Palestinian leaders to secure a lasting peace between the two parties.
“My view on this is that we have completely lost the humanity in the issue,” McMorrow said. “It is talked about as like a third-rail litmus test, without acknowledging that these are human beings. They’re people, and our position should be that there is no individual life that is worth more than another individual life.”
As to the debate on whether the situation should be called a genocide, McMorrow said she doesn’t care what you call it.
“There are members in the Jewish community [to whom] it means something very different to them. That if you’ve lost family in the Holocaust, it means the specific medical testing, gas chambers, being put on a train,” McMorrow said. “I don’t want us to get lost in, ‘do you agree with this definition or not?’ I want to get to the solution.”
Although the commentary was likely encouraging for pro-Palestinan Michigan voters, Dropsite News – a Substack blog produced by journalist Ryan Grimm – reported last month that McMorrow had privately produced an AIPAC position paper that at least one pro-Israel donor said was “outstanding.” Those details came from a donor call obtained by Drop Site news, which was also published online.
The paper was never made public and the McMorrow campaign denied that that the candidate filled out any AIPAC questionnaire. The campaign also noted that the the donor did not speak for the campaign.
McMorrow’s campaign did not respond to a question on the position paper when asked by a Michigan Advance reporter.
Still, of the three top candidates in the race, McMorrow now positions herself with Abdul El-Sayed, who has plainly called the situation in Gaza a genocide and has been adament that he would not take money from AIPAC.
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), has called for an end to the conflict but also has a strong pro-Israel record. AIPACTracker, which tallies money spent on candidates through the PAC, lists Stevens as having received a sum total of $5.17 million from the organization.
A request for comment from the Stevens campaign, and for clarification on the amount of money the representative has received from AIPAC, was not returned at the time of publication.
Stevens told Punchbowl News in August that she opposed the Sanders resolution. Stevens clarified that she didn’t believe an arms blockade would end the war, nor would it build a lasting piece or get Hamas to surrender.
Aside from McMorrow and El-Sayed in the U.S. Senate race, at least one gubernatorial candidate has made his stance on the Gaza genocide clear – Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II.
The candidate, speaking to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee’s national convention in Dearborn, also known as ArabCon, issued his support for Palestinians facing hunger and strife in the Israel-Hamas war, saying that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was committing a genocide
“This is not a matter of opinion. It is a matter of fact,” Gilchrist said.

After years of legal wrangling in public, the case pitting access to public lands against trespass laws enters a sometimes-veiled arena.
The post Early career clerks, not Supreme Court justices, will first review Wyoming corner-crossing case appeared first on WyoFile .","After four years of legal battles, Fred Eshelman’s trespass lawsuit to block people from corner crossing to reach public property will land Oct. 17 on the U.S. Supreme Court conference table, where justices will likely consider a recent law-school graduate’s recommendation whether to take up the case.
The nine justices won’t necessarily be the first ones to scan the 388 pages filed in the case titled Iron Bar Holdings vs Bradley Cape. A clerk — an early career lawyer — will review the file initially, soon joined by two other clerk colleagues.
Before the justices mull Eshelman’s petition, these “three smart kids in their mid to late-20s are conducting the closest and most important reads,” according to Dan Schweitzer, an expert in Supreme Court processes.
If the high court follows its typical routine, one of the clerks will write a short memo that recommends whether the Supreme Court should take up Eshelman’s case, according to Schweitzer’s 2019 guide for state lawyers. Justices review these “critical initial assessments” and “may take a closer look by reading some or all of the briefs” and perhaps the opinion that is being challenged and appealed.
Before Eshelman’s case made its way to 1 First St. NE, Washington, D.C., the corner-crossing legal wrangling involved four misdemeanor citations, numerous motions, affidavits, depositions and testimonies, two trials plus deliberations, opinions, orders and two appeals.
“[T]hey don’t have a great deal of experience, particularly in some specialized areas of the law.” Dan Schweitzer
All this debate must now pass through a checkpoint at one clerk’s desk and computer.
If it seems counterintuitive that the gatekeepers at the court’s portico of 16 Corinthian Italian marble columns appear wet behind the ears, Schweitzer and others provide some insight.
“These are individuals who, fairly recently, graduated from law school, typically, at the top of their class from the best schools,” according to the court’s own description. “Often, they have served a year or more as a law clerk for a federal judge.”
Schweitzer recognizes clerks’ likely youth and inexperience — more as a warning to petitioners to be clear and concise in their pleadings than as any dig at clerks’ capabilities or intellect. That clerks make an initial review “puts a premium on clarity,” for the writers of any petition, Schweitzer wrote.
“They are very bright young people,” Schweitzer wrote. Nevertheless, “they don’t have a great deal of experience, particularly in some specialized areas of the law.”
Top of the class
For the Court’s October term, seven clerks each came from the University of Chicago, Harvard and Yale; five from Stanford; two each from Michigan, Notre Dame, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Virginia; and one each from Columbia, Georgetown and George Washington. Of the 38 clerks, 53% are men, 47% women, according to David Lat, who assembled the roster for his substack column Original Jurisdiction.
Together, the clerks have served 71 clerkships before being selected by one of the justices and have collectively served in those positions under 39 different judges, Lat wrote.
Iron Bar is the name of Eshelman’s company that owns the Elk Mountain Ranch in Carbon County. Cape is a Missouri hunter and fence builder who, with his friends, corner-crossed in 2020 and 2021 to hunt on public land surrounded by Eshelman’s ranch. The Wyoming chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers supported the four Missouri men with fundraisers to ensure they would be heard in court.
Wildlife-rich Elk Mountain rises from the checkerboard landscape of property ownership in southern Wyoming, a pattern that’s a vestige of the railroad-grant era of the mid-1800s. Alternating square-mile sections of public and private ownership characterize the area.
Corner crossing is the act of stepping from one piece of public land to another adjacent public parcel where they meet at a common corner. Eshelman’s lawsuit seeks to defend what he believes is a private property right to block people from passing through the airspace above his land, exposing such folk to potential trespass charges even though they do not set foot on his land.
If corner crossing is illegal, the public can’t reach property owned by all Americans; Eshelman essentially reaps the bounty of that land for himself, the hunters contend. The case has implications for public access to 8.3 million acres of public land across the West.
The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act conditionally allows corner crossing in the checkerboard area of Wyoming and five other states. That court noted that corner crossing is the only way for the public to access its public land on Elk Mountain without using an aircraft, suggesting that its ruling applies only to landlocked public property.
Eshelman has petitioned the high court to hear his appeal, asserting that the 10th Circuit functionally allowed trespassing that could affect 150 million acres of private land. Among his claims is that the 10th Circuit unconstitutionally allowed for the taking of private property without compensation.
Eshelman wants the justices to hear his arguments that the 10th Circuit got it wrong when it decided he couldn’t block Cape and his buddies. That would, for the first time, establish that corner crossing is illegal, experts say. The hunters say the Supreme Court doesn’t need to consider Eshelman’s case, but they are prepared to defend their 10th Circuit win.
Eshelman’s case is one of approximately 7,000-8,000 petitions the court expects to receive this term, which runs from now until October 2026. The court will grant certiorari and hear oral argument in about 80 cases.
For Eshelman’s case to advance on Oct. 17, four of the nine Justices must vote to accept it. The justices could instead reject it, in which instance the 10th Circuit ruling for Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma would stand.
No reasons given
For four years, the Elk Mountain tumult has taken place in the public arena. Fifty-eight citizens of Carbon County assembled for potential service on a six-person jury in the hunters’ misdemeanor trial, where they were found not guilty of trespassing. Courts have published lawyers’ motions and transcripts and have distributed their own findings and orders freely.
Only nine people, however, will be in the Supreme Court conference room on Oct. 17, and its doors will be closed. It is a room “as secret as any in government,” the Supreme Court Historical Society states.
“No outsider enters the room during conference,” the historical society explains. “The junior Associate Justice acts as ‘doorkeeper,’ sending for reference material, for instance, and receiving it at the door. The Court keeps private matters private.”
Justices do not have to give a reason when they accept or reject Eshelman’s appeal. Alternatively, the court also could “relist” Iron Bar v Cape for more discussion later. Experts say that’s an indication that at least one justice is interested in pursuing the issue.

An official will summon the justices to the conference room five minutes before the long discussion starts Oct. 17. The justices will shake hands.
The 36 ritual handshakes are a reminder “that differences of opinion on the Court did not preclude overall harmony of purpose,” the Supreme Court states.
The historical society explains the apparent paradox of secrecy at the highest level of public interest.
“[I]n light of the complete confidentiality of the conference, the Supreme Court is one of the most open of government agencies and one of the most public of courts,” the group explains. “It acts only on matters of public record; it hears counsel’s arguments in public; all its orders and opinions are on the record; all materials presented to the Court for reaching its decisions are available to the public.”
The court usually releases a list of the cases the justices will take up within days of the conference.

Republicans own this closure and all health care harm caused by allowing enhanced tax credits to expire, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post Barrasso wrongfully pins blame for government shutdown on Dems appeared first on WyoFile .","The day after Halloween, the “Obamacare” enrollment period begins, and this year, Wyomingites signing up may find that U.S. Sen. John Barrasso played a costly trick on them instead of the health care treat he promised.

Opinion

Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon before he began his political career, likes to tout his credentials as “Wyoming’s Doctor” each campaign. It’s a reminder of his days dispensing medical advice on TV.
But he’s got a big credibility problem after the Oct. 1 federal government shutdown, which he’s blamed on the Democrats’ “idiocy” for not averting the closure by compromising with Republicans.
Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican as majority whip, helped push the incredibly misnamed “One Big Beautiful Bill” across the finish line without passing a single one of the Democrats’ nearly 50 amendments. So much for that bipartisan spirit the GOP always says it wants.
There are many reasons for Americans to hate the bill, which does more damage to health care access than any piece of federal legislation I can recall.
For starters, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the measure will reduce Medicaid spending by $793 billion over the next decade to pay for tax cuts that benefit the nation’s wealthiest citizens. But that’s not the “trick” I referred to above.
The bill will cause skyrocketing health insurance premiums in the federal marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. This is due to the GOP’s insistence that the enhanced tax credits that helped make health insurance affordable for many Americans must expire at the end of the year.
The enhanced tax credits started in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, 11.4 million people were enrolled in the ACA marketplace. Today, participation has more than doubled to 24.4 million, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.
“This government shutdown is all about whether Republicans will get away with raising healthcare premiums by 75% for 20 million Americans and throwing 15 million people off their [Medicaid insurance],” Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont wrote on X.
Those numbers may be even bigger, according to KFF, a health policy research organization. The group says consumers getting subsidies through the marketplaces will see an average increase of 114% in 2026. KFF also predicts many healthier enrollees on marketplaces will simply drop their coverage because they can’t afford it, leaving them fiscally vulnerable if they need medical care.


Low-income workers will be hit hard if the enhanced tax credits expire. The Urban Institute estimated ACA premiums may jump 400% for people who make between $23,000 and $30,000 annually.
The last thing Barrasso wants is for voters to connect the dots when they find out their health insurance premiums are soaring and blame him. Personally, I’d like every Wyomingite who will have higher ACA health premiums to get a bill with a photo of Barrasso proudly standing next to President Donald Trump, so they know exactly who to “thank.”
A photo of U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, is also in order because she’s playing the blame game, too.
“It’s time for Senate Democrats to stop these political games and join Republicans in doing the right thing for the American people by voting to keep our government and our national parks funded,” Lummis said in a statement.
Republicans aren’t stopping with attacks on Democrats for not agreeing to a continuing resolution to keep spending limits on contested issues at their current level while both parties negotiate an agreement. No, they’ve got a dirty trick that the GOP has perfected: If you say something loud enough and keep repeating it, people will believe it’s true. Like “clean” coal.
And it works. Last week, after the shutdown began, an acquaintance asked me if it happened “because Democrats want to give money to illegal aliens.”
In late September, Republican officials like Vice President JD Vance debuted a new rallying cry: “Democrats are about to shut down the government because they demand we fund health care for illegal aliens.”
Republicans ridiculously manage to tie every controversial issue they encounter to imaginary hordes of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border and demanding everything Americans have, pillaging cities and towns all along the way.
“We’ll probably have a shutdown because one of the things [Democrats] want to do is they want to give incredible Medicare, Cadillac, the Cadillac Medicare, to illegal immigrants,” the verbally fumbling Trump said.
It doesn’t seem to matter how often Democratic officials like U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, condemn these outright lies; the charges are difficult to shake.
“Federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to provide medical coverage to undocumented individuals. That’s the law,” Jeffries told CNBC the day before the shutdown. “And there is nothing in anything that we have proposed that is trying to change that law.”
Trump counters truth with threats, because that’s how he does business. The president warned ahead of the last Senate vote before the shutdown that his administration and the Office of Management and Budget could do things “that are irreversible,” like mass firings and cutting programs favored by Democrats.
Allowing enhanced tax credits to expire will likely ignite a chain reaction of negative results. People who can’t afford marketplace premiums will obtain inadequate insurance with high deductibles or go without any at all. Because they don’t see doctors regularly for preventive care, their health risks will increase.
People with private insurance will also be affected. Companies are already planning to increase rates because they anticipate a drop in healthy enrollees and a rise in the average cost of claims. 
Hospitals will have higher uncompensated care costs because sick people tend to go to emergency rooms as a last resort. Hospitals will make up the loss by charging those who can afford private insurance more for services, or discontinue certain care, like the five maternity wards that have closed in Wyoming in the past 12 years.
Wyoming Democrats, instead of letting Barrasso and Lummis paint them as villains, should make it clear that the blame for all of the health and financial pain caused by ending the tax credits — including the high cost of the government shutdown itself — rests with Republicans.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN –  Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen last week weighed in on the latest request from the U.S. Department of Justice for the state’s voter registration data — showing a willingness to fulfill the request.
Federal officials have asked states for detailed information from their voter rolls, including names, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers, saying they want the information to ensure accurate voter registrations. Democratic-led states and some led by Republicans have declined or are pushing back against federal efforts to gather the data over state laws protecting data and privacy concerns. 
Critics have questioned the safety and potential national security risks of letting any administration consolidate such voter data in one place.
In a Sept. 29 interview with KFAB, Evnen, after seeking guidance from Attorney General Mike Hilgers, said he was “fine” with handing over the voter data because the state’s maintenance practices are “complete and proper.” 
“I don’t have any problem with [the DOJ request] … I’m glad that they’re looking at other states, because while I’m very confident about Nebraska, questions have been raised about some other states,” Evnen said.

The Justice Department sent a letter to Nebraska’s secretary of state on Sept. 8 with a Sept. 22 deadline to provide the data. A voter advocacy group sued to block the request, asking a Lancaster County District Court to find that the DOJ request violates Nebraska law protecting data privacy.
Evnen’s comments followed Hilgers’ saying during a press conference last month that he would be open to turning over the voter data to the DOJ. The federal government has sued two Democratic-run states for the data, the first legal challenge the department has brought against states to obtain the records.
The secretary of state, in his KFAB interview, again employed framing based on the “myth” of widespread voting by non-citizens, a notion that some election experts have warned could undermine trust in elections. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, analyzed elections from 2003 to 2024 and found 24 instances nationally of noncitizens voting out of millions of votes cast.

“The reason why this is all front and center now is because over the last four-plus years prior to this administration, 10 or 15 million people walked across the border of the United States without the legal right to do so,” Evnen said.
Evnen is balancing defending the state’s elections, which his office administers, and echoing the concerns of some Republicans and President Donald Trump over election integrity since the 2020 presidential election, as the secretary looks to quash any challenger from his right flank in his 2026 re-election bid.
When asked by the Examiner earlier this year how many non-citizens had been removed from the state’s voter rolls or voted in past elections, a Secretary of State’s Office spokesperson said the agency had not “removed anyone due to their status as a non-citizen, nor do we believe that there are many such people registered to vote.” 
Evnen also said he has been in touch with the DOJ to get clarification on how the voter data would be used and how it would be protected. 
Fulfilling this request from the DOJ would be a reversal of the state’s stance from a similar request made to then-Secretary of State John Gale in 2017 during the first Trump Administration. 
Gale declined to turn over Nebraska’s full voter information because it wouldn’t comply with state law. He expressed concerns about data privacy. A public and more limited version of Nebraska’s voter file, including names and addresses, is available as a public record for a fee.

Facing criticism from a top state official in his final days on the job, Metro Nashville’s chief development officer defended an agreement with Boston-based Fallon Company for a massive project on the Cumberland River’s East Bank.
Bob Mendes, a former Metro Council member who headed up Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s efforts for projects citywide, told the Lookout the mayor considers the master plan with Fallon “unprecedented in how good it is for Metro.” The contract achieves 99 years of “guaranteed affordability” for nearly 700 housing units on 30 acres of city-owned land the company is developing, he said.
The contract also contains a provision under which Metro will receive rent payments of up to 1% of the gross sales prices on every building on the property each time it changes hands for 100 years, Mendes said.
“There’s a lot of aspects of it that broke new ground as far as modernizing development deals for the city,” Mendes said.
Mendes made his comments in response to criticism from Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who recently told reporters Metro has to spend $3 million to run the East Bank Authority because Mendes negotiated a contract with Fallon that keeps Metro from collecting rent until after a building on city property is complete.
Metro City Council
“If I was a taxpayer in Davidson County, I’d be pissed that I’m having to supplement something that I should not have to supplement because Bob Mendes worked out a contract that Fallon probably agreed to before the ink was dry because it was so good for them,” said Sexton, a member of the East Bank Authority.
Sexton’s comments are a recent example of state legislators scrutinizing the decisions and governance of Nashville’s leaders and locally elected officials. Tennessee officials have been vying for more control over the state’s top-earning county, seeking greater influence over the authorities and boards that oversee the Nashville International Airport, Sports Authority and the Music City Convention Center.
The Metro Nashville Council unanimously approved the 99-year lease deal for 30 city-owned acres in April 2024. 
City planners had been working on plans to redevelop Nashville’s East Bank — riverfront land that was mostly devoted to parking lots — for years, publishing a vision plan for the transformation in August 2022 under former Mayor John Cooper’s administration. Cooper, who had experience as a developer before entering politics, negotiated a deal with the Tennessee Titans to build a new $2.1 billion stadium on the East Bank with the help of at least $1.26 billion in public funding. 
Nashville’s council approved that deal in April 2023 after substantial opposition from members of the public and about a third of the council’s 40 members. The state authorized $500 million in bonds for construction of the new stadium for the Titans, and Metro Nashville is putting in $760 million toward the stadium project.
Cooper’s administration selected Fallon as the master developer for the first 30 acres of Metro-owned land shortly before his term ended. Cooper ultimately decided against seeking re-election, leaving the mayor’s race open to a slate of fresh contenders.
O’Connell, who represented Nashville’s downtown district for two terms, highlighted his opposition to the stadium deal in his mayoral campaign to set himself apart from other candidates. When O’Connell successfully secured the seat, he and Mendes, who both staunchly rejected the stadium deal, were positioned to steer negotiations for the land surrounding the new stadium.










If I was a taxpayer in Davidson County, I’d be pissed that I’m having to supplement something that I should not have to supplement because Bob Mendes worked out a contract that Fallon probably agreed to before the ink was dry because it was so good for them.


– House Speaker Cameron Sexton


While not on board with the public financing in the stadium deal, the pair embraced many facets of the overall East Bank vision plan, including affordable housing, enhanced public transportation and more pedestrian infrastructure. Mendes did not have development experience prior to taking his post in O’Connell’s administration, but his career as an attorney in the private sector has concentrated on business transactions and commercial litigation.
Sexton, a Crossville Republican who also owns a home in Nashville, has focused on negotiations between Metro and the Tennessee Performing Arts Center, which is slated to move to the East Bank from its longtime home at Deaderick Street across from the War Memorial Plaza in downtown Nashville. 
The speaker said he believes O’Connell took the “reins” from Mendes and inserted himself into the talks, meeting recently with Gov. Bill Lee to keep TPAC in the East Bank equation.
Besides TPAC, the new Titans stadium will take up a large part of the 100-plus acre portion of the East Bank owned by Metro. Tech giant Oracle is set to build a campus on 60 acres along the banks of the Cumberland River after receiving a $175 million economic incentive from Metro. It is slated to bring in 8,500 jobs as the company makes a $1.2 billion capital investment.
The East Bank’s infrastructure is estimated to cost $147 million with Fallon’s share of the expense at $72.6 million, TPAC’s at $67.6 million and Metro’s at $6.8 million. Fallon is to build 1,550 residential units, 695 of which are to be designated as “affordable.” 
East Bank developer proposal hints at potential struggle to keep revenue, housing promises

Besides his concerns about the Fallon deal, Sexton isn’t enthused with the way the East Bank Authority operates, calling it more of an oversight committee than an “authority.” The speaker said he believes it should operate more like the Metro Airport Authority, which makes independent decisions,  rather than being required to send all of its decisions to the 40-member Metro Council for final approval as the East Bank authority does.
The state is tied up in lawsuits with Metro over its effort to cut the council down to 20 members and a move to give the state more control over appointments to the airport authority.
State Rep. Bob Freeman, a Nashville Democrat who sponsored the private act setting up the East Bank authority, said he told House members that East Bank Authority decisions would have to go to the full Metro Council for approval, since the city owns the property.
Any changes in the authority’s power would have to go back to the Metro Council and, likely, to the legislature as well.
The mayor’s office believes the East Bank development plan is still in its infancy, and O’Connell hasn’t wavered in his commitment to bring TPAC to the area.
Besides the affordable housing, Metro plans to create a Nashville campus for youth empowerment on Brick Church Pike to replace the existing juvenile justice center located on the East Bank. 
For his part, Mendes, whose last day was Wednesday, said he understands Sexton’s frustration but pointed out the contract is complicated. He said the speaker’s criticism isn’t the reason for his departure after two years in the post.
Fallon is on track to break ground by the end of 2026 on a hotel and the affordable housing building, he said, about the same time the Titans stadium is ready to open.
Mendes recalls how people felt about the Gulch in the late 1990s when development started taking place there, transforming it into one of Nashville’s liveliest areas.

The child care program she relies on — the only one on Hatteras Island — informed her they will close their doors at the end of the year.
It’s not an uncommon scenario. In August, the state Division of Child Development and Early Education saw 47 child care programs shutter with only 22 new programs opening.
On Monday, Trant shared her story with the North Carolina Task Force on Child Care and Early Education. Gov. Josh Stein tapped the group in March to identify solutions to expand access to affordable, high-quality child care.
Trant said her 5-year-old and 2-year-old twins benefited greatly from Little Sprouts Child Care in Frisco. But staffing shortages and an unsustainable financial model forced their hand. She received word of the closure in a note, tucked into her child’s backpack in July.
“I was distraught, and I was pissed off to be frank,” said Trant. “My husband and I don’t have family around us to be able to help or lean on. I sell real estate. I work full time.”
But with the only licensed child care center on the island closing, her family is facing a tough decision.
“We’re faced with the choice of do I quit my job, which frankly pays our mortgage and buys groceries, or do we close our business that has sort of become a staple in the community, or do we move?”
Trant said her twins were born prematurely and having them in a structured childcare facility has been tremendously beneficial. An unlicensed facility is not a tenable solution.

On average, there is only one licensed child care slot available for every five families who need one in North Carolina. In rural areas like Hatteras Island, the odds of finding an open slot at a high-quality center can be even greater.
Cassandra Brooks is the owner and operator of Little Believer’s Academy, which runs two child care centers serving Garner and Clayton.
She said many child care providers are finding that the money coming in doesn’t cover the amount they need to cover their lease, their staffing and supplies.
“It just does not equal up. So you have to say, is this worth it? And a lot of them have said this is not worth it,” Brooks told the panel.
Brooks said she knows child care providers are making the difficult decision now whether to stay in business in North Carolina another year.
“No one wants to feel like a failure in any business that you start, especially many small businesses. This is like their heart. This is like their baby. But at the end of the day, if you can’t operate and you can’t pay your staff, then you don’t have a viable business,” said Brooks.
Parents are also doing the math. Few can afford to pay more.
The average annual cost of infant care in NC is $11,720, according to an interim report released this summer by the task force. For two children in child care, the average annual cost is nearly $19,500.
Angelia Shipp, who operates the Doletta Learning Center, said her licensed center in Forsyth County has seen enrollment decline as state and federal stabilization funding approved during the pandemic has sunsetted.
“Stabilization was very good when we had it, but now the stabilization is gone. It has caused a lot of the providers here to close their centers. And I am one of them. I am on the brink of making that decision to close my doors,” said Shipp.
Shipp said she’s proud of those who have graduated from her program, but with just one child in her child care center now, the finances no longer work.
“Without funding, we cannot sustain our homes. Our children are going to fall through the cracks,” Shipp worried.
Brooks said high housing costs have also hurt her employees. One worker, a single mother who recently split from the child’s father, had just ten days to find a new place to live or face eviction.  She felt blessed when a person at her church agreed to rent her “a little shack” for $800 a month.
“My teachers are already struggling. They’re going to struggle even more. They’re on food stamps. They’re on Medicaid. They’re on all these things,” confided Brooks.
A 2024 study found 42% of early childhood teachers rely on public assistance to meet their basic needs.
Like Shipp, Brooks benefited from stabilization grants to provide her workers with higher wages. But without support from the state, that could change.
Brooks was asked Monday what advice she would give to her younger self or someone who is considering opening a childcare facility in North Carolina.
“I would say don’t do it,” answered Brooks, thinking of her own daughter. “Utilize your resources, your talents in a different way.”

Lt. Governor Rachel Hunt, who co-chairs the task force on child care and early education, said lawmakers must take seriously that the industry is an essential service facing a real crisis.
“We need every business, and every county commission, legislator, every branch of government to understand that and that moms and dads are not going to be able to go to work. And then we are not going to be the number one place for business,” said Hunt.
A recent study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation found that 35% of parents who experienced disruptions to their employment in 2024 reported leaving the workforce due to issues with child care.
The state task force is slated to issue a final report with recommendations to strengthen public and private investment in child care infrastructure by the end of this year.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-2219362965-child-care.jpg,,,2025-10-07 06:57:24.854597

The state's reimbursement rate is well below other states. (Photo by The Good Brigade/Getty Images)Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Medicaid rate increases for home and community‑based services providers who take care of individuals who are elderly and disabled, those with intellectual and developmental disabilities and individuals living with traumatic brain injuries. 
West Virginia uses state and federal money from Medicaid to reimburse county senior centers and private companies that employ direct care workers who help low-income residents remain in their homes.
“This rate increase reflects our commitment to protect and uplift West Virginia’s most vulnerable residents,” Morrisey said in a news release Oct. 3. “My administration will continue making investments in our state’s health care system to increase access and improve outcomes for West Virginians.”
The rate increase is meant to improve pay for direct care workers, who currently earn around $13 an hour, but there is no requirement on how providers spend the money. 
Brad Story
Brad Story, CEO of the West Virginia Behavioral Healthcare Providers Association, said that West Virginians with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) “deserve the opportunity to live, learn, work and thrive in their communities.” 
Without the rate increase, Story said that services that help them do that would be at risk.
“We are extremely grateful to Gov. Morrisey and his administration for the rate increase and investment in our community and home-based providers,” he said on Monday. “This is a great step in the right direction to lessen the strain on our providers and families across the state. We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with the state to strengthen every corner of behavioral health in West Virginia.” 
Former Gov. Jim Justice announced a similar rate increase last year in hopes of increasing the number of in-home caregivers. The state has dealt with a shortage of workers who can help seniors or people with developmental or intellectual disabilities remain in their homes, which is also a cost-saving measure for the state compared to institutionalized care.
A 2023 survey said West Virginia needed to increase its rate of reimbursement and the worker salary range to $15.50-$18.60 per hour; Justice’s rate increase reflected the study’s recommendations. 
The state Department of Human Services oversees several waiver programs that allow adults and children using Medicaid to remain home with family, and caregivers can receive help with care services.
In a news release, human services Secretary Alex Mayer said Morrisey’s rate increase ensured providers would “have the resources to deliver high-quality services, helping individuals live with dignity and independence. These investments are vital to the health and future of our state.”
“West Virginians deserve care that allows them to remain in their homes and communities, supported by family and providers they know and trust,” Mayer said.

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota won’t get federal disaster relief for communities affected by the June 20-21 storms until after the government shutdown ends, according to the state Department of Emergency Services.
President Donald Trump last month approved Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster relief to help communities damaged by the severe weather repair and replace infrastructure. The storms included several tornadoes, as well as large hail and heavy wind, which caused significant damage to the state’s agricultural industry.
The state will not be reimbursed for any damages while the shutdown is ongoing, but officials will continue working on reimbursement requests to submit to the federal government in the meantime, according to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services.
The presidential declaration, which did not include a dollar amount, makes federal assistance available to 19 counties.
Trump approves federal disaster relief for June storms in North Dakota

A preliminary estimate of the damages submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in July exceeded $11.4 million.
The Department of Emergency Services in a September Emergency Commission meeting said it expects to receive about $16 million in relief money from the federal government. Officials said they expect the state to provide about $2.5 million in assistance.
The 19 counties eligible for relief under the presidential declaration are Barnes, Burleigh, Cass, Eddy, Emmons, Foster, Grant, Griggs, Kidder, McLean, Morton, Oliver, Ransom, Sheridan, Sioux, Steele, Stutsman, Traill and Wells.
The National Weather Service on Monday announced that a tornado that touched down in Enderlin on June 20 had been upgraded to an EF5, the most severe category of tornado. EF5 tornadoes have top wind speeds exceeding 200 mph.
The Enderlin tornado is believed to be the first EF5 in the United States since 2013, according to the National Weather Service website.
The Governor’s Office in September submitted a separate request for federal disaster relief for August storms, which is still under review. The storm caused an estimated $6 million in damage, especially to electrical infrastructure. The state has requested assistance for Barnes, Grand Forks, Griggs, Kidder, Nelson, Steele and Stutsman counties.
The federal government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to adopt a budget or stopgap funding, resulting in hundreds of thousands of federal employees being put on furlough and others working without pay. North Dakota agencies last week said that they expect federally funded services provided through the state to be largely unaffected by the shutdown.

Jeff Landry to announce the opening of Camp 57, a facility at the prison that will house immigrant detainees. (Photo by Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator) Civil rights advocates say a Honduran man is being held illegally at Louisiana State Penitentiary’s new immigration detention facility because he’s under an order that protects him from deportation, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court Monday.  
Oscar Amaya, 34, also served his criminal sentence for a past conviction, according to the suit filed Monday in the Baton Rouge federal court district by the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. 
The groups have called for the Trump administration to provide valid reasons why Amaya continues to be held.
“Our Constitution is clear: no person can be punished twice for the same offense,” Alanah Odoms, executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana, said in a statement. “Amaya already served his time for his criminal convictions. Keeping him locked up indefinitely in one of the most notorious prisons in America amounts to a de facto life sentence without any due process. That’s unconstitutional and cruel.”
U.S. authorities granted Amaya protection from deportation when he fled Honduras 2005 at age 14 after he demonstrated that he would face torture or death if forced to return to his home country. The violent MS-13 gang had started recruiting him at age 12, according to court records.
Amaya lived and worked in the U.S. without incident until 2016, when he was arrested and convicted of attempted aggravated assault. He was sentenced to four years in prison and released into ICE custody after two years for his record of good behavior. 
The Trump administration issued a deportation order for Amaya earlier this year and has tried to deport him multiple times to countries other than Honduras, according to Monday’s court filing. He had been held at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Pennsylvania before being transferred to Louisiana State Penitentiary.
Amaya arrived at Angola sometime after Sept. 4, when ICE placed the first 51 detainees at the newly renovated Camp J segment of the prison. Calling it Louisiana Lockup, the governor said it would house the “worst of the worst” violent criminal offenders. It has the capacity to hold 400 people, though officials have not shared its current population.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi was with Landry and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at the state prison last month to mark its unveiling. Reached for comment Monday, a Justice Department spokesperson had no comment on the Amaya lawsuit, instead referencing Bondi’s remarks from the Sept. 4 ceremony at Angola. 
At the time, she touted joint efforts among federal, state and local law enforcement targeting “dangerous illegal aliens” allegedly involved in “drug and human smuggling.” 
Bondi thanked Landry “for your use of this incredible facility, locking them up and keeping them here where they will be prosecuted … and they won’t go anywhere,” she said, standing in front of the updated prison wing.
Two weeks ago, Louisiana officials were met with reports that immigrant detainees at Angola were conducting a hunger strike. They were foregoing food to protest a lack of medical care, prescription medication, toilet paper, hygiene products and clean water, according to immigrant advocacy groups. 
The Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections called the groups’ claims “misleading.”  SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bondi-Noel-Landry-Angola-1024x627.jpg,,,2025-10-07 06:57:24.854597

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Colorado businesses, universities and state agencies say they have been left in the dark about the Trump administration’s cancellation of half a billion dollars in federal clean energy grants following the federal government shutdown.
The terminated grants include over $300 million to Colorado State University, $70 million for Xcel Energy and $50 million for the Tribal Energy Consortium.
“The attempt to use a government shutdown to unlawfully rescind already appropriated funds and terminate federal employees is illegal, pure and simple,” U.S Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday. “These acts of retribution are intended to stoke fear, and Democrats must use every legal and legislative tool to reverse these decisions and hold the administration accountable — which is exactly what we intend to do.”

The U.S. Department of Energy announced last week the cancellation of about $7.5 billion in funding for over 200 clean-energy projects across the country. Many of the awards came from the Biden-era Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.
In a social media post last week, Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote that the cuts targeted “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda,” referring to the proposed framework to address climate change championed by progressive Democrats called the Green New Deal. Vought then listed affected states, most of which are led by Democratic governors and voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.
President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office last week that the administration “can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them,” as reported by NPR. The federal government shut down last Wednesday as congressional Republicans and Democrats grappled over how to fund the government and whether to extend expiring health care subsidies.
“While we have not formally received any official federal notices of termination, we understand that two Colorado projects that total $5 million are on DOE’s list, which specifically targets states where a majority of Americans cast their votes in favor of the Democratic nominee for President,” Ari Rosenblum, a spokesperson for the Colorado Energy Office, wrote in an email. “This clearly politically motivated targeting of grants by the Administration will balloon energy costs, threaten grid reliability, increase pollution, and create instability in our business community.”
CEO has two grants on the termination list, each for $2.5 million. One funds local governments to support work to implement new building energy codes and another provides technical assistance to building owners to comply with standards.
The affected Colorado grants are in five of Colorado’s eight congressional districts and include $2.9 million for a Denver company to study how barges off the coast of Louisiana could transport carbon dioxide, $5 million for a solar thermal energy company in Broomfield and $27 million for Westminster-based Tri-State Generation and Transmission to enhance electric grid flexibility against extreme weather.
“We had been working with DOE over the last two years on the award, after being selected in October 2023,” Tri-State CEO Duane Highley said in a statement. “Over the next few days, we will review our appeal options. While disappointing, the withdrawal of this award does not change our plans to increase grid resiliency and reliability in the most affordable manner for our rural members in Wyoming, Nebraska, New Mexico and Colorado.”
Amanda Bybee, the CEO of Amicus O&M Cooperative in Boulder, called the grant cancellations politically motivated. The company’s three-year, $1.5 million grant was meant to help develop a standardized training process for solar operation and maintenance technicians. It has technically been on pause since February, when their continuation application did not get processed by the new presidential administration, but Bybee said the company has not received an official termination notice following last week’s announcement.
“We had spent about a third of the money, so we had a million dollars to go, and the sad truth is that we will not be able to make that up with other sources,” she told Newsline. “I really don’t see what we’re doing as political. We’re trying to train the technicians who are out here maintaining energy assets, and making sure that they are safe and efficient in the way that they do this work.”
Hank Price, the managing director of SolarDynamics in Broomfield, said the company was also waiting for DOE to approve the next phase of work for two projects under the grants — combined at about $5 million — when the presidential administration changed. That put the projects in “limbo,” Price said.
“As a result, we were expecting this outcome. So, in some sense it is good to have DOE make a decision so we can move on. We can at least contest the decisions now, not that we are optimistic that it will make a difference,” he wrote in an email.
The funding to CSU was awarded to research and create methane-cutting technologies and prevent leaks from oil and gas operations. That contract had been delayed already in January, according to Colorado Public Radio.
“These seven projects support critical research that directly serves the oil and gas industry, energy companies, and energy-producing communities nationwide,” Tiana Kennedy, the university’s associate vice president for communications, wrote in an email. “The cuts would eliminate research positions at the university and halt collaborative work that provides industry and policymakers with trusted data and develops technologies to make the nation’s energy infrastructure safer, more efficient, and competitive.”
The Colorado School of Mines had about $48 million worth of grants canceled, and the University of Colorado system lost about $8.3 million.
Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the decision to the Department of Energy.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, a “school choice” advocate in the Legislature, is working with the state Department of Education to create a “school choice portal,” along with the state’s first School Choice office. It may be housed in the state education department. 
Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, is wanting the state to more efficiently assist students who are exiting the public school system to enroll in homeschooling, private schools, microschools and more.
The school choice portal, as she called it, would allow parents who are homeschooling to submit the required applications and find a certified teacher who could approve a homeschool student’s portfolio of schoolwork.
“The catalyst is just that we need to move into this century … A school choice portal was a way that I thought maybe we can have it all in one place, easy for parents to access,” Hess Crouse explained Monday at a meeting of the Educational Choice Subcommittee in the House of Delegates. Hess Crouse serves as chair of the subcommittee.
Homeschool students are required to submit a portfolio each grade level. State law doesn’t require a certain type of teaching certification or experience to review the students’ portfolios. 
Parents could also submit a students’ scores onto the portal.
“Right now, parents have to either email or mail their paperwork to the county boards of Ed and then the boards have to put all that within the system,” Hess Crouse said.
The technology would have been mandated in a House bill from earlier this year, but the measure failed to get through the Senate. 
Education department Deputy Superintendent Sonya White told lawmakers that the department is working on implementing the portal sans the legislative mandate. 
“Sometime before the end of this month, we expect to have the site ready for initial review and testing,” White said.
The technology could reduce county school boards’ workloads when assisting families who need information from the public school system to change to homeschooling or private school. The information would now be maintained in the portal operated by the WVDE, which the department is developing in-house at no extra cost to the state. 
Students are assigned a unique school identification number, known as a “WVEIS number,” in the public school system, and families need this number in order to apply for the Hope Scholarship, the state’s school voucher program.
Hess Crouse also said there will likely be legislation next year to create a state Office of School Choice. 
White said the education department is exploring possibly running the office at the estimated cost of $500,000, which includes paying for a manager and four program assistants to work around the state.
“It would be contingent upon appropriation,” she said. 
Hess Crouse said she’d prefer it to be housed elsewhere outside of the state department of education.
“It was something that just started with a conversation, and my vision for it may be a little different than the state board’s vision for it, but it’s basically to give parents a place to go to ask the questions and get the truthful answers on school choice,” Hess Crouse said, adding that she is told parents often receive conflicting information from school boards about their students’ options and records. 
“I wanted our parents to have the correct information to where they could go and they knew the information they were going to get would be unbiased, and that they would know what they had to do, what was required for them by law, whatever choice it was they made,” she said.
State School Board President Paul Hardesty said last week that lawmakers’ focus on school choice has resulted in tens of thousands of students leaving the public school system, prompting statewide school consolidations and closures. Under the current school funding formula, counties receive state funding based on the number of students.  
Sixteen public schools closed in 2024, up from nine in 2023, according to the WVDE.
“The financial instability of the system continues to grow and continues to grow and gets worse and worse,” Hardesty said, adding that the state schools were bound by many regulations while private schools and homeschools are subject to limited state guidelines. 
In response to his comments, Hess Crouse put out a statement on Monday, pointing to West Virginia’s nearly-bottom ranking nationally in education outcomes. 
“Parents deserve to decide what works best for their children, whether that is homeschooling, private school, microschools, charter schools or the Hope Scholarship,” she wrote. “At the end of the day, education belongs to parents, not the state. The school boards can no longer bully families into staying in a system that does not serve them.”

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, had a chance to provide the world with financial information about disgraced sex trafficker and financier Jeffrey Epstein. 
It only recently became known that Crapo was asked to join the senior Democrat on the U.S. Senate Finance Committee in a subpoena for the Epstein material held by the Treasury Department. For some reason he refused.
For years, and particularly before it became standard practice to refuse to work on virtually anything with anyone in the other party, Crapo and Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat now the ranking member of the Crapo-led Finance Committee, have annually teamed up to pass legislation to provide funding to rural schools. They did so again in June in an increasingly rare example of bipartisan legislating. 
But bipartisanship clearly doesn’t extend to information the government, particularly the Treasury Department, has on Jeffrey Epstein. Crapo, it seems clear, has been stonewalling any effort to force release of material that members of his staff reviewed more than 18 months ago. 
One of many mysteries about Epstein, who was in prison in 2019 awaiting trial at the time of his death, was how the guy amassed a fortune estimated at $550 million, as well as several lavish estates and a private island. 
Where all that money came from and for what purpose are central questions in understanding Epstein’s crimes. Wyden has been on the case for months. When he asked Crapo to help him Crapo refused. 
After the New York Times recently reported that JP Morgan Chase, “arguably the world’s most prestigious bank,” had long treated Epstein as a “treasured client,” while essentially ignoring mounting questions about the vast sums of money flowing into and out of his accounts, Wyden insisted the bank provide information. The Oregon senator demanded an explanation as to why the bank continued to cover up Epstein’s “suspicious transactions for six years after firing him as a client.” 
Earlier Wyden introduced legislation that would compel Treasury Secretary Scott Bessett to turn over his department’s Epstein record, while Crapo voted against a separate effort to compel release of Epstein documents.

But before Wyden introduced his Epstein legislation a curious thing happened, way back in February 2024, while Joe Biden was still president. As the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported earlier this month: 
“For several hours on Valentine’s Day in 2024, staff from Oregon U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden’s office and the Senate Finance Committee sat in a room in the U.S. Treasury Department reviewing, thousands of suspicious financial transactions made by deceased and disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
“The transactions totaled more than $1 billion and included payments to women from eastern European countries where many of Epstein’s alleged victims are from. Along with Wyden’s team, staff from the offices of Republican Sens. Mike Crapo of Idaho and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee reviewed the documents, according to Wyden. Spokespersons for Crapo and Blackburn did not respond to requests for comment from the Capital Chronicle.
The Senate staffers we allowed to look at document and take notes but not allowed to make copies. 
“And because you can’t take that stuff out of the room,” Wyden said, “I asked, particularly, if the Republicans would be willing to join me in a subpoena that would get the rest of the information that was crucial, and they wouldn’t do that. And that was during the Biden years.”
In a Sept. 2, 2025, letter to Bessent, the Treasury secretary, Wyden elaborated on one document his staff and Crapo’s reviewed in 2024. 
“One of the documents,” Wyden wrote, “indicates that between 2003 and 2019, there were more than 4,725 wire transfers totaling $1.08 billion involving Jeffrey Epstein and his associates … These documents also contain details of hundreds of millions in payments to Epstein from Wall Street financiers, including $170 million Leon Black paid Epstein for purported tax and estate planning advice.” 
Leon Black is a billionaire private equity investor. In 2023 Black reached a $62.5 million settlement with the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands that, as the Times reported, released Black “from any potential claims arising out of the territory’s three-year investigation into the sex trafficking operation” of Epstein. Black contends he did nothing wrong, but he sure did pay a lot of money to avoid further investigation of ties to Epstein. 
“Furthermore,” Wyden wrote to Bessent, “records show that Epstein used correspondent accounts at multiple Russian banks, to process hundreds of millions of payments related to potential sex trafficking. Several of these Russian banks are now under U.S. sanctions and many of the women and girls Epstein targeted came from Russia, Belarus, Turkey and Turkmenistan. These records outline specific names of women and girls, correspondent bank account numbers in Russia used to process the payments, as well as details on Epstein associates who had signatory authority over Epstein’s accounts and signed off on payments related to sex trafficking.”
So why hasn’t Mike Crapo joined Ron Wyden in a quest to get this information from the Treasury Department? Why has Crapo put on ice his committee’s oversight jurisdiction over the Treasury Department? Why wouldn’t he pursue Epstein documents while Biden was in office? 
I emailed Crapo’s press office, as well as person who handles communication for the Finance Committee. No response. Nothing. 
Specifically I asked: 
– Did Crapo’s staff review the Epstein documents? 
– Who specifically was involved in the review? 
– Why has Crapo not joined Wyden in pressing for the release of these materials? 
I wanted to know – perhaps his constituents would like to know – why Crapo wasn’t demanding answers about Epstein’s finances. Opinion polls clearly indicate the American public, people in both parties, believe answers are necessary. 
There are at least three plausible reasons Crapo refused when he had the chance to get Epstein information to the public. 
Perhaps he thinks it’s not important. 
Perhaps he thinks there is some privacy question involved, even though Epstein is long dead and his chief accomplice is in jail. 
Or perhaps those records Crapo’s staff saw in 2024 get too close to someone Crapo doesn’t want to offend, a big campaign contributor or Wall Street banker or CEO. 
Had Crapo agreed to that subpoena last year we’d likely know a whole lot more about Jeffrey Epstein today.

The resolutions could signal a lack of support for school choice among everyday Mississippians, something opponents have previously noted. 
Municipal boards in Clinton, Pearl, Florence and Jackson all adopted anti-school choice resolutions in September, citing constituents’ disapproval.
READ MORE: Lawmakers want to expand ‘school choice’ in Mississippi. Here’s what it looks like in neighboring states
School choice refers to a number of policies that give more educational options to families outside of traditional public schools, often allowing them to use public dollars to fund this education. Despite the recent success of the state’s public education system, powerful state lawmakers such as House Speaker Jason White say the issue will headline the upcoming legislative session.
Gov. Tate Reeves has been a vocal supporter of increased school choice, which proponents say parents across the state have been demanding. 
But Nancy Loome, executive director of the public school advocacy organization The Parents’ Campaign, said the local ordinances are a testament to the opposite, and the role public schools play in Mississippi communities such as Clinton, where Loome lives. 
The Clinton Board of Aldermen adopted a resolution on Sept. 2 opposing school choice initiatives that “redirect critical public funds away from local public school districts and instead subsidize private, unaccountable education providers.”
“The board members believe, rightly, that it is one of the biggest threats to their communities — not just their public schools, but their whole communities,” Loome said. “They’re not going to sit by in silence while the folks we elect on the state level push through something that would be very detrimental to their cities.”
The Clinton resolution also notes that in other states, voucher programs often have not improved academic outcomes and that, in many cases, families with students who already attend private schools are the main beneficiaries. 
In Mississippi, school-choice advocates say the policies will improve access to quality education — in most cases, this means private schools or homeschooling — for low-income students. House leaders have insisted they will create a program that caters to the neediest students in Mississippi, and that it will be regulated, so it won’t bankrupt the state’s public schools. 
But Chip Wilbanks, a Clinton alderman, doesn’t think expanding school choice will have that outcome. 
He and his wife, like many of their neighbors, moved to Clinton to raise their family because of the strong public-school system, Wilbanks said. The district is consistently one of the highest rated in the state.
Wilbanks
Wilbanks said he hasn’t yet encountered a Clinton resident who supports expanding school choice. 
“The public school district is the epicenter of our town, and the success of our city is tied to it,” he said. “I know there’s no current bill on the table, but we wanted to get out in front of it and say we’re not for this as a concept.”
Wilbanks said his main concern with school-choice policies is the diversion of funding from public schools. He hopes the city’s resolution will encourage more voters to inform themselves about the issue and investigate beyond party lines. 
“Clinton votes very Republican, and this is a Republican-pushed issue,” he said. “I just want people to look at the issue for themselves and see how they think it would affect small towns like Clinton that are dependent on public schools.” 
Florence, another conservative Jackson suburb, adopted an anti-school choice resolution for similar reasons, said Mayor Pro Tempore Brian Grantham. 
While he was campaigning for his seat on the Florence Board of Aldermen over the past few months, school choice kept coming up, Grantham said. 
“A lot of people I talked to were concerned about the impact on our schools in Rankin County and in Florence,” he said. “Most people really like the school system, and they really don’t want to see any major changes. When you have something good going, you want to keep it that way.” 
The story is more complicated in the state’s capital city. 
Jackson Public Schools, the only urban district in the state, most recently received a “C” rating from the state Department of Education and has struggled more than its neighboring districts.
Still, Jackson Councilman Kevin Parkinson, a former charter school administrator, helped lead the effort to adopt the Jackson City Council’s resolution, which he says is “anti-privatization,” rather than “anti-school choice.” 
Parkinson
Charter schools fall under the “school-choice” umbrella, but Parkinson said there’s a difference between supporting charters and supporting vouchers that use public dollars for private education, which Mississippi lawmakers are considering. 
Vouchers, he said, are not supported by his constituents in Jackson. Still, Parkinson is nervous it will happen anyway because of aggressive efforts from state lawmakers. 
“We’re not perfect, but for the first time, other states are modeling their education on what Mississippi is doing,” he said. “This would be a generational step backwards.”
The Board of Aldermen in Pearl adopted an anti-school choice resolution on Sept. 16. Board members did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Martin Thielen
Martin Thielen stated the above pre-election, in February of 2024.
As a Methodist pastor in Arkansas and Tennessee, his view is that religion is being waylaid by the right to promote a philosophy which is the opposite of what Jesus preached. He decries religion’s use as a political tool. Thielen details his views in a Methodist publication.
A Pew Research Center study analyzed how religion was changing in West Virginia and the U.S. The findings were somewhat surprising in view of the way that the MAGA movement is marketing itself as bringing religion back, especially in red states like West Virginia.
Religion is generally falling in importance for West Virginians, 70% deeming it important in 2023 versus 89% in 2007. Even more interesting is the data regarding observance — 51% of West Virginia’s adults seldom or never attended services in 2023. That is significantly more than 2007, when only 41% did not attend. The figures for the U.S. overall were telling, with nearly half (49%) stating that they did not go to services in 2023.
In 2007, 78% of adults in West Virginia indicated that they were Christians. But in the short space of 16 years, that figure had fallen to 64%. And only 62% in the U.S. identified as Christian in 2023. In 2007, there were only 2% of West Virginia residents identifying as “other religions;” half of these were Jewish. By 2023, that figure had risen to 3%, with 1% being Buddhist.
In 2023, 86% West Virginians believed in God. But the number was even higher in 2007 — 93%. And the number who were “absolutely certain” in God’s existence dropped tremendously from 76% to only 56% in 2023. The 2023 figure was even lower for all U.S. residents, only 54% were certain. 
There was also a major change in the number of residents who classified themselves as “religiously unaffiliated.” The figure for West Virginia was only 19% in 2007, but it grew to 31% by 2023. That figure was slightly lower for the U.S. — 29%.
Views are also changing regarding some items which have religious aspects. For example, in 2007 much less than half (38%) of state residents believed that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. That figure had risen significantly to 54% in 2023 for West Virginians, and 64% nationally, which brings into question the popularity of the extreme MAGA anti-abortion position.
In 2014, more than half of West Virginians (51%) opposed same-sex marriages. That figure fell to 44% for the state and 32% for all Americans.
The bottom line is that both the U.S. and West Virginia are becoming less religiously oriented, despite MAGA politics. Along with that change, our residents’ views on key social issues are becoming more progressive versus past years. It also reinforces my own view that the GOP did not win the presidency based on their opposition to “wokeness.” The 2024 election was won due to inflation and economic issues, as well as former President Joe Biden’s failure to control the southern border. Plus, Biden’s failure to resign back in 2023 and hand the reins of government over to former Vice President KamalaHarris.

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal).With legal clarification from Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman in hand, the Oldham County Board of Education is poised to consider offering Bible education classes to students in the public school district. 
Ohio-based nonprofit LifeWise Academy offers off-campus instruction to public school students around the country and has pending requests before school boards across Kentucky. The Oldham County request could be discussed during a special meeting on Wednesday. 
The attorney general’s office released an opinion in late September on a law that allows school boards to accept proposals for “moral instruction” from third party groups. The legislature changed the law earlier this year. 
Oldham County Board Chair Carly Chem said in an email to the Kentucky Lantern that the reasoning behind requesting the opinion was to “ensure that the board was following the law with this particular statute.” An attorney for the board, Rudy J. Ellis III, requested the opinion along with Republican state Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, who represents Oldham County. 
“The statute is written so loosely that we needed clarification on what we needed to do in order to confirm we were following the law,” Clem said. “The opinion gave us just that.”
The attorney general’s opinion addresses several points, including advising school boards that they may reject proposals but not without supplying a reason. A school board is “not required to approve a request submitted by a qualified provider to provide moral instruction to students, provided that a board’s decision to deny a request is not arbitrary or motivated by ‘animosity to religion.’” The opinion also says a school board that denies a request “must disclose to the applicant the ‘substantial evidence’ it relied on” and disclose to the Kentucky Department of Education all reasons for denying the request. 
With the moral instruction law passed by the Kentucky General Assembly in the spring, LifeWise Academy has formed planning teams in school districts across the state to propose programs to local school boards. The proposals typically say that LifeWise employees and volunteers will transport students off school grounds for Bible-based character instruction during school hours with parents’ permission. 
The Warren County Board of Education narrowly rejected a LifeWise Academy proposal. Meanwhile, the McCracken County Board of Education approved a request. Marshall County Schools has had an active LifeWise program since 2023. 
The Heritage Foundation awarded LifeWise one of its Innovation Prizes earlier this year, which included a financial award. LifeWise reported in its most recent IRS filing that its revenue exceeded expenses by $17 million. The organization reported its revenue grew from $13.8 million to $35.3 million from 2023 to 2024.
In Oldham County, LifeWise Academy’s proposal is for one hour of Bible-based character education weekly, starting with students at Locust Grove Elementary School in third to fifth grades.
Kentucky Citizens for Democracy, a group of Oldham County residents, has opposed the LifeWise proposal over the summer. Anita Davis, the group’s associate director, told the Lantern that she felt the attorney general’s opinion “does clarify” the law and supports that “school boards have the independence and authority to make those decisions locally.” 
Davis, formerly Oldham County Schools’ chief academic officer, said “the loss of instructional time is substantial evidence” for school boards statewide to reject these programs. 
A  rejection based on students losing time in the classroom wouldn’t be based on religion, she added. 
School boards could get requests from faith groups of any religion.
“You have to be very, very careful as a school board that if you’re going to do this, you can’t say one can come in and one cannot based on the religion that they represent,” Davis said. 
In a statement, LifeWise founder and CEO Joe Penton told the Lantern, “LifeWise welcomes the opportunity to work with communities that want to make Bible-based character education during school hours available to students. It is up to each school district in Kentucky to determine the released time religious instruction policies for their area. It is our hope that school boards ensure that parents who want Bible education during school hours for their children have the freedom to choose that option, given that religious release time has been legal for over 70 years.” 
In 1952, in a 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld New York City’s “released time” program that allowed students to leave school to participate in religious instruction. The court had earlier ruled in an Illinois case that bringing teachers into public schools to provide religious instruction was unconstitutional.

Breckinridge appear to have little in common. Breckinridge was the Democratic Party's nominee in 1860, losing to Republican Abraham Lincoln. Breckinridge went on to become a Confederate general. (Liam Niemeyer, National Endowment for the Humanities)While some Kentucky Democrats are pulling for Andy Beshear to run for the Senate next year, others want him to toss his hat in the ring for their party’s 2028 presidential nomination.
Evidence suggests that our two-term governor is more inclined toward the latter option. And he’s attracting national attention. NPR’s Steve Inskeep interviewed Beshear on “Morning Edition” last week. Washington Monthly just published an article headlined “Why Andy Beshear Is a First-Tier Presidential Contender.” 
If he were to win the Democratic nod, Beshear would be the first lifelong Kentuckian to top a major party’s ticket in 168 years.
That gap underscores Kentucky’s declining prominence in national affairs since the Civil War. “Between 1824 and 1860, there were 10 presidential elections,” explained James Klotter, Kentucky’s official state historian, in an email. “A measure of Kentucky’s importance in the nation is that the state had a candidate running for president or vice president in eight of the 10 races.”
When our nation was young, not many states had a greater impact on national politics, the economy and society than Kentucky.
“Kentucky was the breadbasket for the nation as late as 1840, when it ranked first or second in the production of corn, wheat, hemp, tobacco and bourbon, and fourth in rye, and was a leader in the horse and mule industries,” Klotter said. “Louisville was the third largest city in the South, after New Orleans, and Baltimore, and Lexington’s cultural strengths earned it the title of ‘the Athens of the West.’”
In addition, Kentucky, the first state admitted to the Union west of the Appalachian Mountains, was the gateway to our first West — the vast territory from the Appalachians to the Mississippi River. After the Revolutionary War, thousands of westward-bound migrants trekked through the Cumberland Gap or floated down the Ohio in flatboats and other vessels.
Many who stopped in Kentucky later moved on to other states. Volume I of Lewis and Richard Collins’ 1874 “History of Kentucky” lists more than three dozen Kentuckians who became governors, acting governors, lieutenant governors or secretaries of state elsewhere. Another 28 became diplomats.
Kentucky emigres sometimes transplanted Kentucky place names to other states. Elizabethtown is the seat of Hardin County in southern Illinois, which also includes the towns of West Frankfort and Eddyville.  
Anyway, the last major party presidential nominee from Kentucky was Democrat John C. Breckinridge in 1860. Elected vice president in 1856 and sworn in at age 36, the Fayette countian still ranks as the youngest vice president.  
Breckinridge was born near Lexington. Beshear is a Lexington native. Other than birthplace and party label, Breckinridge and Beshear apparently have nothing in common. 
Beshear is arguably the most progressive governor in Kentucky history. Breckinridge ran for president in 1860 as a pro-slavery Southern Democrat.
In a four-way race, Breckinridge finished second to Kentucky-born, anti-slavery Illinoisan Abraham Lincoln, a Republican. Breckinridge was also runner up in slave state Kentucky but to Constitutional Unionist John Bell, not to Lincoln, who trailed Northern Democrat Stephen A. Douglas. One of our greatest presidents-to-be managed just 1,366 votes in the Bluegrass State. .
While most Kentuckians stuck by the Stars and Stripes in the Civil War, a minority, including Breckinridge, favored the Confederacy. He was a Confederate general and the last Confederate secretary of war.
Virginia native Henry Clay, Kentucky’s greatest statesman, spent much of his political career trying to stave off disunion and civil war. He thrice sought and lost the presidency as a Whig — in 1824, 1832 and 1844. Ashland, Clay’s Lexington home and estate, is preserved as a museum. 
Elevated to the White House in 1848, Whig Zachary Taylor, an American hero of the Mexican-American War, was born in Virginia. But he lived most of his life in Louisville, Klotter pointed out. “Old Rough and Ready” is entombed in the Derby City’s National Cemetery which bears his name. (Springfield, his home, is preserved as a private residence near the burial ground.)
In 1952, Graves County-born Democratic Vice President Alben Barkley of Paducah tried for his party’s presidential nod, but only briefly. Gov. Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, Barkley’s distant cousin, got the nomination and came up short against Republican Dwight Eisenhower.
Not only did Kentucky lose political and economic clout after the Civil War, its population also dwindled. “Kentucky was a populous state, in the top fifth among the states,” Klotter said.
In 1860, Kentucky and Tennessee had 12 electoral votes each — more electoral votes than 25 of the Union’s 33 states. (Today Kentucky has eight electoral votes, Tennessee 11.)

“Boy, we sure hate what they’re doing to our country,” goes the thinking that one often hears expressed, “but we wish that our side could stop pussyfooting around and learn a thing or two from the right about doing what it takes to win!”
In some ways at least, it’s an understandable sentiment. Over the last several years, progressives have watched in horror as a determined minority movement has seized control of and radicalized the nation’s laws and governmental institutions in unprecedented ways. In numerous areas – public and higher education, personal bodily autonomy, the role and rights of corporations and workers, racial and gender equality, the distribution of the nation’s wealth, separation of church and state, gun ownership, combating the climate crisis, and even America’s role in the world – the right has succeeded in overturning decades of slow but mostly steady progress and imposing a series of dramatic policy 180’s.
What’s more, to add to the frustration, the change in no way reflects any kind of significant shift in public opinion or popular values.
Rather, like so many past authoritarian movements that seized upon narrow electoral victories and, either by hook or crook, converted them into massive power shifts and policy sea changes, modern American conservatives have used passion, large doses of cynical pragmatism and an unapologetic willingness to shatter legal and societal norms to secure their objectives.
Think about it – the proof of this reality is in the numbers. Donald Trump lost the popular vote in two of the last three national elections and won less than 50% of the vote in his 2024 victory. Congress has been divided by the narrowest of margins for years. In North Carolina, registered Democrats still slightly outnumber registered Republicans and as multiple razor-thin Supreme Court races demonstrate, it remains a deeply “purple” state.
If ever there was a time in which public attitudes would seem to demand divided, middle ground government, this is it.
Instead, of course, we have the opposite. Rather than generally staying the course or pursuing incremental change, Republicans in Washington, DC and several states like North Carolina have repeatedly swung for the fences and moved with all the speed they can muster to roll back past progressive wins and lock in unpopular, ultra-right policies – like slashing taxes on the rich, disempowering workers, undermining reproductive freedom, abandoning efforts to combat climate change and militarizing law enforcement.
Will they succeed in effecting a lasting overhaul of American society?
Maybe.
While it’s true that many, if not most, hard right and authoritarian regimes in modern times have eventually foundered, Trump and company have taken some steps – perhaps most notably in the courts – that will make rooting out some of their changes quite difficult.
That said, a recent public opinion poll in North Carolina helps shine a light on what could be an important Achilles’ Heel.
The issue is gerrymandering – the drawing of political maps to rig elections for partisan purposes.
As has been well-publicized, Republicans have been moving aggressively at Trump’s specific direction of late to further gerrymander already rigged electoral maps in a handful of states they already control in hopes of retaining their narrow control of the U.S. House in the 2026 elections. This includes North Carolina, where it appears Republican legislative leaders are likely to pass legislation later this month that would eliminate chances for Democrats to prevail in the First Congressional District – a region in the state’s east that takes in most of the so-called “Black Belt,” currently represented by Democrat Don Davis.
If this effort succeeds – and some reports indicate that Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger has pledged to do the deed in exchange for a Trump endorsement in his 2026 GOP primary, although Berger has denied this — the state’s already rigged U.S. House map would shift from 10-4 Republican to 11-3.
As a new poll conducted by a GOP polling firm and released by the good government nonprofit Common Cause demonstrates convincingly, however, such a move will be enormously unpopular. The poll found that 84% of voters – including 78% of unaffiliated voters and 65% of Republicans – said gerrymandering maps for partisan advantage is “never acceptable.” Two-thirds of GOP leaders said the practice should be illegal and nearly half conceded that the current already rigged maps were likely unfairly drawn.
Could this remarkable consensus in public opinion ultimately help give rise to a shift in attitudes and behavior among enough voters (and help anger enough progressives) to help swing upcoming elections against Trump and set the nation on a different path? In such closely divided times, it certainly seems possible.
Whatever the case, the blatant and desperate nature of the scheme provides a strong indication that, like many other authoritarian fear-dependent regimes down through human history, the Trump movement is grappling with some significant fears of its own.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Redistricting-Daniel-1024x766.jpg,,,2025-10-07 05:56:13.464233

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)After a lower court ruled that the state had violated indigent criminal defendants’ constitutional rights by failing to provide them legal representation, Maine officials will argue before the Maine Supreme Judicial Court on Tuesday in an effort to appeal orders to temporarily release people and drop charges while they wait for an attorney.
Maine’s lack of representation for indigent defendants — those who can’t afford their own counsel and have to rely on the state for a public defender — has been deemed a constitutional crisis after the American Civil Liberties Union sued the state and the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services, which is responsible for providing representation. 
Last month, the commission reported that more than 400 defendants were still waiting for attorneys. At the same time, the public defense system is stretched thin and facing a $13 million shortfall which means it will soon be unable to compensate contracted criminal defense attorneys. 
Budget shortfall, burnout strain attorneys in Maine’s indigent defense system

In January, the Kennebec County Superior Court ruled the state’s failure to provide timely counsel to defendants who can’t afford an attorney a constitutional crisis. Two months later, Maine Superior Court Justice Michaela Murphy ordered the state to address the issue. If not adequately resolved, Murphy also said the state must start conducting hearings to release indigent defendants who have been jailed without legal counsel for at least 14 days, and to temporarily dismiss charges against defendants without representation for more than 60 days after their initial court appearance.
But the state appealed that decision and those hearings, which were slated to start in June, have been on pause until Maine’s highest court weighs in. As a result, no defendants were released or had their charges temporarily dismissed, according to the ACLU. 
In an August brief urging the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to uphold the lower court decision, the ACLU wrote, “after a painstaking review of the caselaw and the record, the trial court correctly concluded that the [commission and State of Maine] had violated the Sixth Amendment by failing to provide counsel at critical stages of pretrial proceedings.” 
Arguments in the case will start on Tuesday.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1483489085-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 05:56:13.464233

(FatCamera/Getty Images)Virginia’s Maternal Mortality Review Team will continue its operations until August of next year. The future of the team, however, will depend on future congressional action and Virginia’s willingness to continue it. That’s because federal funding to support the cohort’s work had already been allocated before it was recently cut from the pending national spending plan.
When Congress shut down the government last week amid stalemates on annual appropriations bills, an effort to extend funding that Virginia uses to address maternal deaths was left out of the legislation. Dubbed the Enhancing Reviews and Surveillance to Eliminate Maternal Mortality, or ERASE MM, nearly $90 million has gone towards state committees around the country that review birth-related deaths and analyze the causes. Committees’ findings have helped spur protocols aimed at preventing hemorrhage, sepsis or suicide of new parents. 
The Virginia Department of Health confirmed that Virginia’s team will continue its data collection until August 31, 2026, since the 2025-2026 funds had already been allocated. U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond told The Mercury ahead of the shutdown that she “absolutely” plans to work on legislation to reauthorize the funding in the future. 
While Virginia collects a variety of maternal health data, the “Pregnancy-Associated Deaths” dashboard  is bolstered by the ERASE MM funding, a spokesperson from VDH said, and is slated to conclude by next year. 
According to VDH, the dashboard takes into account a “woman’s life, health, and healthcare utilization in the five years before death.” 
The review team explores the factors that contribute to someone dying during or after pregnancy, whether related to their community, their health before pregnancy, patients’ health care provider, or the facility where they gave birth. According to data collected between 2018 and 2022, 34% of pregnancy-related deaths in Virginia happened during pregnancy and 27% occurred within 42 days of giving birth. Accidental overdoses, cardiac-related incidents and infections were the top three causes that were identified. 
Despite white women outnumbering Black women in Virginia by roughly five to one, Black pregnancy-related deaths nearly doubled that of white women.
‘Momnibus bill’ plans announced at Virginia’s Black Maternal Health Summit

Virginia’s review team fits into the slate of recent state efforts to improve maternal health. A series of related bills called the “Virginia Momnibus” — a riff on the term omnibus — passed the legislature this year and were signed into law by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The bills adjusted Medicaid reimbursement rates for midwives and established pilot programs to remotely monitor hypertension. 
Not every bill passed, however, like an effort to require unconscious bias training for health care worker license renewal. If passed, it would help target one aspect of why Black women are more likely to die in childbirth, in which the National Institutes of Health have noted health care workers’ racial bias can play a role. Virginia’s own data collected also shows higher death rates for Black parents. That measure, which has been carried by members of both political parties, passed the legislature before meeting Youngkin’s veto for the second year in a row. 
More broadly, maternal mortality-related data collection has helped inform policies in recent years and garnered the bipartisan support ERASE MM had when then- President Donald Trump signed it into law seven years ago. Earlier this year, Youngkin signaled support for Virginia’s continued work on enhancing health outcomes for new parents. 
While Democrats led on addressing maternal health issues in the state in recent years, Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, emphasized the bipartisan work in a recent call with The Mercury and stressed how Virginia’s next governor will need to sign a budget that takes broad health care needs into account next year. 
“We’ve worked really hard to say that maternal health, it doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or Republican,” she said. “If we really want to be a strong, growing commonwealth, we have to take care of our moms.”

Sargent Reynolds Community College in Henrico. (Photo courtesy WWBT)The number of students registering for dual enrollment and career and technical education continues to grow in the commonwealth, but simultaneously, student enrollment at Virginia’s community colleges has declined by 7% over nearly a 10-year period, creating a financial strain on the system and negatively impacting smaller colleges, state researchers revealed Monday. 
Results from a study conducted by researchers for the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, presented on Oct. 6, come as lawmakers weigh policy decisions, including funding support  for the Virginia Community College System (VCCS), ahead of the upcoming General Assembly Session beginning Jan. 14. 
Researchers recommended that the state Board for Community Colleges initiate a strategic review and propose a plan for how the system can more efficiently deliver services, especially in regions with smaller colleges.
David Doré, VCCS chancellor, said at Monday’s presentation that he supports the report, which aligns with the system’s Accelerate Opportunity strategy plan to increase dual enrollment access, improve efficiency and enable stronger student outcomes.
“The importance of an efficient, transparent and unified community college system cannot be overstated,” said Doré. “As we look ahead, the Virginia community college system remains steadfast in its commitment to continuous improvement and accountability, always striving to meet the needs of our students, employers and communities.”
Researchers found that dual enrollment has increased at VCCS, growing by about 13,000 from 2021-22 school year to last school year. The state’s dual enrollment program allows students to earn college credits before graduating from high school with school divisions and colleges picking up the costs.
Virginia’s community colleges also relied more heavily on state funds in fiscal year 2024, with a 12% increase over the previous seven years. Declining enrollment and fixed costs, such as infrastructure and staffing, were contributing factors.
CTE programs are also being subsidized by community colleges with excess revenue from academic transfer programs, according to researchers. CTE programs typically cost VCCS more than academic transfer programs, at $466 per credit hour compared to $242 per credit hour. 
Smaller colleges with fewer than 1,000 students are also spending more per student, around $21,000. Schools with 10,000 or more students spend $13,000.

VCCS informed researchers that the system has established a periodic review of individual colleges and implemented budget reductions in response to revenue declines, including staff layoffs. 
Researchers also found that data predicts a reduction in the number of high school graduates in the future because of declining birth rates, changing opinions about the value of a college degree, growing interest in technical and career-focused training and the increased enrollment in online courses, which are impacting enrollment and costs.
The number of students taking online courses more than doubled, from 17% in the 2015-2016 school year to 41% in the 2024-2025 school year. In-person courses dropped from 39% to 11% during the same time period.
Researchers also found that students tend to be “less successful” in asynchronous courses, or those that allow students to complete their coursework on their own schedule, but the differences are not substantial. Success was defined as a student earning a “C” grade or above, or passing a pass/fail course.
The research team recommended VCCS require students retaking an asynchronous course that they failed or withdrew from to meet with an advisor, monitor their success and work with individual colleges to determine the root causes.
Researchers also found that CTE enrollment grew by 8% from the 2015-2016 and 2024-2025 school years. Most of the growth is attributed to the short-term training program Fast Forward, which is designed to prepare students for careers in high-demand fields, including health care, information technology and skilled trades.
VCCS should try to identify opportunities to improve the program, researchers recommended, including by evaluating whether completers obtain and keep their jobs in the field for which they are trained, and whether wages increase three to five years after a program’s completion.
Senate Subcommittee Chair on Higher Education Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, who sits on the commission, said she agrees with the recommendation and the effort by VCCS to review the trends and propose a plan to deliver services more efficiently. 
With the financial strain on VCCS, she said, consolidating the 23 schools is not the best plan for the schools, students or communities, she said.
“There are some people who think that 23 is too many, but I don’t agree because some of these community colleges are kind of like the lifeblood of these communities,” Locke said to the Mercury. “All 23 need to remain, but with this, they can see how they can more effectively use the system.”

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Unless you’ve been in a coma or a cave since Friday morning, you probably know about the bloody fantasy that Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for state attorney general, shared in 2022 with a Republican House of Delegates member.
The lurid anger Jones’ comments reveal is as clear as it is sobering. His message was unmistakable.
‘Beyond disqualifying’: Jay Jones controversy jolts Virginia’s pivotal 2025 elections

What baffles me is why Jones — a lawyer, a former delegate, and a highly educated guy — would knowingly, freely entrust such career-killing collateral in writing to an elected officeholder of the opposition party.
As first reported by the National Review, Jones mistakenly sent to Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, a text venting his resentment over eulogies being made for a moderate Democratic former delegate from southwestern Virginia. But when he became aware of the misdirected missive, he unspooled a hypothetical scenario to Coyner in which he held a gun with two bullets, and before him stood Todd Gilbert, then the Republican speaker of the Virginia House, and two of history’s most genocidal despots — Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, who was behind Cambodia’s killing fields.
To the question of which of the three he would shoot, he didn’t mince words.
“Gilbert gets two bullets to the head,” Jones texted. “Spoiler: put Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know and he receives both bullets every time.”
Just a bad joke, right? If only.
Jones then doubled down on the depravity, telling Coyner that he hoped Gilbert’s wife, Jennifer, would one day hold her child as it died so she and her husband would know the anguish that parents of children killed by gun violence feel, according to the report.
Most everyone with a platform — from the president to editorialists to ordinary folks posting on social media — has already sounded off.
Jones, for his part, released statements admitting his words, saying they made him “sick to my stomach,” that he had apologized to the Gilberts, and that he takes “full accountability.” In a televised interview Friday night, he said, “I wish that it hadn’t happened, and I would take it back if I could.”
His Democratic ticketmates, Abigail Spanberger in the governor’s race and Ghazala Hashmi, who is running for lieutenant governor, issued statements distancing themselves from Jones but didn’t call for his withdrawal from the ticket. Jones said he intends to remain in the race.
Now, the damage is done. It is significant, and it has legs in a nation still reeling from the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk — killed at an event on a Utah college campus by a single bullet in an instant that was captured on amateur video in gory, unexpurgated detail. In minutes, it trended worldwide on social media.
Jones faces an aggressive reelection bid from incumbent GOP Attorney General Jason Miyares. A statewide poll of likely Virginia voters by the Washington Post and George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government, published in the Post on Friday, showed Jones with a 6-percentage point edge over Miyares, which is within the poll’s margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. I doubt the same poll, conducted now, would be so charitable to Jones.
Set aside the uncommon cruelty Jones’s texts express and the fact that he persisted after Coyner expressed her disapproval and asked him to stop.
It’s troubling that Jones knew he had given a sitting Republican state legislator firsthand, game-changing material to use against him should he seek future office, yet he accepted money from donors and the nomination from his party only to have this scandal blindside them.
Jones should be better than this. He is descended from Democratic Party royalty with an honored legacy of advancing civil rights. His grandfather, Hilary Jones, was the first Black member of the Norfolk School Board and the Virginia Board of Education. His father, Jerrauld Jones, was among the first African American students to integrate Norfolk’s Ingleside Elementary School as Massive Resistance collapsed in Virginia. He was a passionate and extraordinarily eloquent delegate whose legendary 1999 House floor speech defeated a bill on track for final passage that would have authorized Confederate flag license plates. He finished his distinguished public service career as a Circuit Court judge in Norfolk.
An appreciation: Jerrauld C. Jones

Jay Jones knows the blood sport elective politics has become since his father’s time. Why, then, would he presume that his 2022 texts would remain confidential between himself and Coyner? As it turns out, the National Review reported, she made screen shots of the texts and promptly forwarded them to Gilbert.
Many want Jones to quit the race, but I agree with him that this is a decision for the voters. After all, we live in a time of coarse and even violent rhetoric between the hostile tribes that American culture is increasingly becoming. New York billionaire Donald Trump once famously bragged that he could “stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters.” Since then, he’s been elected president. Twice.
For some voters, what Jones wrote, compounded by the mystery of why he let his campaign get this far as a malignant secret waited in ambush, constitutes a disqualifying lapse of accountability and judgment.

Photo via Getty ImagesHow much does it cost to run for the U.S. Senate in Georgia? Millions of dollars are already pouring into the coffers of Republicans hoping to claim the office – and of Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is fighting to hold onto it.
In dueling Monday morning press releases, Republican Congressman Mike Collins and former football coach Derek Dooley each touted sums approaching $2 million in direct contributions over the last three months.
The candidates were referring to third quarter reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. Those reports count donations made through Sept. 30, but are not due to the FEC until Oct. 15. As of Monday evening, none of Georgia’s major Senate candidates’ reports had been posted to the FEC’s website.
Collins’ campaign boasted raising $1.9 million from more than 40,000 donors, with an average contribution of $47.31. The campaign said donations came from all of Georgia’s 159 counties and all 50 states plus Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
“There is no denying this is a movement growing stronger every day, and people are voting with their wallets,” Collins said in a statement. “I am amazed and truly grateful for the trust so many have put in this effort. Ours is a campaign fueled by the hardworking people of this state who are energized, mobilized, and ready to fire Jon Ossoff and send an America First conservative workhorse to the U.S. Senate.”
Collins also reported transferring just over $1 million from his congressional campaign and said he ended the quarter with $2.4 million cash on hand.
Dooley’s campaign said the former University of Tennessee Coach and attorney brought in just over $1.85 million, though did not provide details about the source of the contributions, and entered the last quarter of the year with $1.7 million cash on hand.
“This incredible, early support for our campaign proves that hardworking Georgians want a political outsider with common-sense leadership representing them in the U.S. Senate,” Dooley said in a statement. “For the past eight weeks, we’ve hit the ground running at full speed in order to build the operation needed to win this seat back for the people of Georgia. I’m deeply honored by everyone who has joined our campaign, and I am greatly humbled by the trust they have instilled in me.”
Carter was the first major Republican to enter the race, tossing his hat into the ring in early May – Collins and Dooley entered in late July and early August, respectively – and Carter has used his head start to amass a healthy nest egg.
Carter’s second quarter report ending in June showed just over $4 million cash on hand, including a $2 million loan from himself.
Whichever Republican emerges victorious from the May primary is likely to be on the receiving end of a flood of GOP money. Ossoff is the only Democratic senator running for re-election in 2026 in a state won by President Donald Trump in 2024, making his seat in Georgia a top target.
But Ossoff has also been busy filling his campaign coffers. Ossoff’s campaign has not yet released his latest numbers, but his June filings show the senator ending that month with $15 million cash on hand.
Democrats are hoping a close fundraising race for the GOP side portends an ugly primary fight that will damage the eventual winner.
“Mike Collins and Derek Dooley’s neck-and-neck fundraising reports further underscore that Georgia Republicans are in a messy, chaotic U.S. Senate primary for the long haul,” said Democratic Party of Georgia Senior Communications Advisor Devon Cruz.

A new analysis of Federal Reserve data shows that young adults across the country are carrying dangerous levels of credit card debt, with higher-than-average levels in Ohio.
The news comes as inflation continues to grow, consumer sentiment worsens, and student debt continues to balloon.
Austin-based Upgraded Points studies ways consumers can maximize benefits from their credit card points and miles. But it also conducts other analyses.
For the consumer debt project, it looked at data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. It identified cardholders aged 18-34 with debt that was more than 90 days delinquent and broke the data down by state and metro area.

“For millions of Americans, credit cards have become a lifeline for groceries, gas, and other essentials amid the aftershocks of historic inflation and the highest (annual percentage rates) in decades,” a statement accompanying the analysis said. 
“The strain is hitting young adults hardest: earlier in their careers with thinner savings, facing a tough entry-level job market, and budgeting around the return of student loan payments, a growing share of 18- to 34-year-old cardholders now face serious delinquency.”
In July, the Trump administration paused a program in which 2 million were able to repay student loans at rates based on their income. 
There are also concerns that other repayment programs are being phased out and payments will go up.
For Ohio’s young people, the findings of the Upgraded Points analysis weren’t great. 
The Buckeye State ranked 16th for severe delinquency, with 17.1% of young people having that status in the first quarter of 2025. 
That compares to 12% in 2022.
The average credit card debt among all young Ohioans was $3,352, and 35.5% of them were at or above 75% of their credit limits.
Among large cities, Cleveland came in 10th in the nation, with 18% of its young people seriously delinquent. 
Columbus came in 28th (15.3%) and Cincinnati came in 30th (14.7%) out of 55 large cities.

Out of 100 mid-sized metros, Youngstown came in 12th (22.4%), Toledo came in 31st (19.6%), Dayton came in 45th (17.9%), and Akron came in 46th (17.8%).
With spiking utility costs and deep cuts coming to the social safety net, the credit numbers appear to mean more economic stress for the masses in a state where more than 25% are already so poor they qualify for Medicaid.
It makes for a difficult future for young people, the Upgraded Points report said.
“Younger Americans are more likely to overuse their credit cards and rack up lasting debt for several key reasons,” it said. “They are earlier in their careers with less accumulated savings to fall back on, and they face a particularly challenging job market for entry-level workers.”
 The fact that federal student loan payments have recently resumed has only compounded these financial challenges, squeezing monthly budgets even tighter, the analysis said. 
“As a result, more and more young adults are delinquent on their credit card payments, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, signaling a growing crisis for the nation’s youngest adults.”

(Photo by Emily DeBolt/New York Department of Environmental Conservation)To track the arrival of invasive species in their beloved lake, the Newfound Lake Region Association monitors data from two sources: water samples, which they pull directly from the lake’s blue depths and preserve carefully in a refrigerator, and Facebook posts from observant anglers. 
This September, the latter source turned up something the association had for years been hoping they wouldn’t see: a photograph of a tiny, free-floating crustacean whose smaller-than-a-fingernail body consists mostly of a long, delicate tail. 
When Newfound Lake Region Association Conservation Program Manager Paul Pellissier first saw the photo, he confirmed the creature was a spiny water flea, an invasive species first spotted in New Hampshire two years ago. The discovery wasn’t exactly a surprise, but it was distressing: the spiny water flea is very hard to eliminate once it arrives in a water body, Pellissier said, and though it’s harmless to humans its presence can significantly upset a lake’s food chain and broader ecosystem.
In New Hampshire, the spiny water flea has not been present long enough to know just what that upset might look like for the state’s lakes. Newfound is only the third New Hampshire lake confirmed to host the creature, which was first spotted in lakes Winnipesaukee and Winnisquam in 2023. But lakes elsewhere in the country, including the Great Lakes, have been dealing with water flea invasions for decades, and scientists said findings from those systems could shine a light on what New Hampshire can expect from this new, hard-to-shake visitor.
Tiny invader, outsized impact
Spiny water fleas, native to Europe and Asia, likely arrived in the United States in contaminated ballast water that cargo ships released into the Great Lakes in the early 1980s, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. The creatures are small, but their long tails can entangle, allowing them to form masses that appear like black-spotted bits of jelly bristling with their namesake spines. They also frequently get caught on fishing tackle, which is thought to be a major way the animals are transferred from water body to water body, Pellissier said.
Since the 1980s, the creatures have become established in the Great Lakes as well as in other inland lakes, including Lake Champlain in Vermont. Their effects, said zooplankton expert Donn Branstrator, reverberate through the ecosystems they invade.
This is due to the fleas’ unique biology compared to native species, said Branstrator, who works as an associate professor of biology at the University of Minnesota Duluth. Branstrator began studying zooplankton in the Great Lakes as a graduate student in the late ’80s, when spiny water fleas had just begun to garner attention. Ever since, studying the animals — how they move between lakes, reproduce, and affect the ecosystems they infiltrate — has been a central part of his career.
One impact of a spiny water flea invasion stems from the animals’ voracious appetites. Upon arriving in a lake, spiny water fleas begin feeding on other tiny animals that live suspended in the water column, leading to population crashes. Lakes that Branstrator has examined saw their zooplankton populations cut in half, he said. These lakes also saw their zooplankton biodiversity — a measure of how many different types of the organisms are present in a system, which scientists often consider a key indicator of an ecosystem’s health — fall by about 20%, according to Branstrator.
This change has ripple effects that extend both up and down the food chain. Native zooplankton typically eat the tiny plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, collectively known as phytoplankton, that also live free-floating lives in the water column. But when spiny water fleas eat most of those native zooplankton, the photosynthetic organisms at the base of the food chain have fewer predators — and in turn, they could run wild, Pellissier said.
“You’ll have greener, murkier lakes because of that,” he said.

Some research has also suggested that the changes caused by spiny water fleas could also include increases in cyanobacteria blooms, which New Hampshire has dealt with increasingly in recent years. 
When spiny water fleas overrun native zooplankton, the effects also cascade up the food chain. Spiny water fleas are bigger than most native zooplankton, so they are less palatable to native fish, which find them difficult to eat. This is a problem, Pellissier said, because young fish mostly eat zooplankton before they are big enough to move on to larger meals. 
While larger fish can swallow the fleas, they might still be harmed, too, Branstrator said. His team has observed tangled masses of water fleas inside fishes’ stomachs — and in some cases, they have seen evidence that the fleas’ spines punctured through the fishes’ stomach linings, he said.
When a water flea infestation takes hold, therefore, fewer fish may make it to adulthood, and those that do may be less hardy.
This effect has been demonstrated in the Great Lakes, Branstrator said, where recreationally and ecologically important species like walleye and yellow perch have become smaller and less abundant since water fleas’ arrival. 
The changes spiny water fleas cause in native plankton populations, Branstrator said, happen fast; then, they stick around. In Minnesota, even in datasets that stretch over 10 years or more, he said, the shifts have remained mostly consistent.
“This happens within a couple years, then it’s maintained,” he said. “That is a pattern that has been repeated time and again throughout the Great Lakes and other inland lakes. … I would anticipate no difference in these lakes that you have out there.”
The Great Lakes are a different system from New Hampshire’s lakes, Branstrator said, and there are other factors at play in each system, such as the invasive zebra mussels that coexist with spiny water fleas in the Great Lakes and not, as of yet, in New Hampshire. However, he said, he expects many of the lessons learned from the invasion of spiny water fleas in the Great Lakes are still transferable to New Hampshire.
What can be done?
When it comes to removing spiny water fleas from a lake, scientists have explored plenty of ideas, Branstrator said. But, he continued, “nobody has figured out how to eradicate them.”
Lack of success treating the infestations, though, has not been for a lack of ideas. Branstrator said past proposals have included controlling the animals with predatory fish, like the pumpkinseed sunfish, which with its tough snail-crushing teeth is one of the few native fish species well-adapted to consuming spiny water fleas. But pumpkinseed sunfish prefer shallow waters, while water fleas tend to prefer deep, cold areas, Branstrator said. And, he added, to begin with, “it’d be kind of absurd to think you could add that many fish to a system” to handle a booming water flea population.
Some other aquatic invasive species, like zebra mussels, are treated with toxic chemicals (though with mixed results). But, according to Branstrator, water fleas disperse so quickly and broadly throughout a lake that the area in need of treatment would be prohibitively large for that technique.
“All of a sudden, you’ve got millions. Their life cycle is short, and they reproduce fast, and, you know, trying to stop exponential growth is a difficult thing to do,” he said. 
Preventing further spread and looking ahead
When it comes to handling a spiny water flea infestation, like what the Newfound Lake Region Association is anticipating they will now have on their hands, Pellissier said he expects to focus on managing the fleas’ impacts and preventing further spread.
“Once we have it, we have it, so it becomes more a question of, can you manage the impacts?” he said.
While the effects on fish populations are difficult to address, the effects of spiny water fleas on phytoplankton can be kept in check, Branstrator and Pellissier said, by limiting the amount of nutrients that are allowed to flow into a lake. This means preventing fertilizer runoff and stormwater runoff and mitigating erosion, Pellissier said.
“If algae is nutrient limited to begin with, it doesn’t matter if you take the brakes off of grazing or not. They’re not going to grow,” Branstrator said.
It will also be important to continue monitoring New Hampshire’s lakes and for everyone — especially anglers — to do what they can to prevent the spread of these animals and protect fish, Pellissier said.
Branstrator’s research has indicated that humans transfer water fleas between water bodies, often on fishing tackle. He has also proven that extended exposure to dry air is enough to kill spiny water fleas, with about 1½ hours of drying time killing the fleas’ adult forms and four to six hours enough to kill their eggs, according to his work. But when the fleas are tangled together or clinging to damp gear, they may take longer to dry, and to die, Branstrator cautioned.
When there isn’t time to let things dry, cleaning boats, fishing gear, and anything else that’s been immersed in lake water thoroughly with hot water or a mild bleach solution is another good way to prevent the spread of spiny water fleas, Pellissier said.
Branstrator added that everyone has the potential to make a difference by cleaning or drying their gear and boat properly, because it likely takes multiple “seeding” events for the water fleas to establish in a lake or other water body.
Pellissier said he hopes those who spend time on New Hampshire waterways will take spiny water fleas seriously and do what they can to prevent further spread.
“My concern is that this thing is so small, and nearly invisible, that people won’t give it the respect or attention that it deserves,” he said.
He also hopes the water samples that the Newfound Lake Region Association has been collecting will help form the basis for a long-term understanding of how the creature affects New Hampshire waters. The association is working with the Department of Environmental Services and the University of New Hampshire to track that data, he said. 
“That, I think, is going to be really important baseline data to understand the impacts of spiny water flea on Newfound, and potentially understand what the impacts might be on other lakes across the state,” he said. “… We can actually see that impact play out on Newfound.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spiny-water-flea-NYDES-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-07 05:56:13.464233

Adam Mathews, R-Lebanon, speaks during the Ohio House session, May 24, 2023, at the Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio. (Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal)Two Ohio state lawmakers are looking to the state’s name, image, and likeness laws to address the spread of deepfakes.
They contend the provisions allowing a college football player to make money appearing in a commercial also offer a good framework to protect everyday Ohioans.
The sponsors portray their plan as a way to address a “growing threat” without reinventing the wheel, and their idea has the backing of Ohio’s attorney general. But the Motion Picture Association worries the changes will stifle free expression.
The proposal
Ohio state Rep. Adam Mathews, R-Lebanon, explained Ohio House Bill 185 removes a provision in Ohio’s NIL law limiting protections to people whose likeness has “commercial value,” when it used for a commercial purpose.
“This gives it to all of those that may not be Ryan Day, Joe Burrow, or other household names that get paid to be in commercials,” Mathews said.

He added that while the impetus for changes may be artificial intelligence, they’re proposal isn’t limited to deepfakes.
“It also applies if people were to use Photoshop (or) cutting pictures out and using a glue stick. It is tech agnostic. But it is there for that protection of your name, image and likeness.”
Under the bill, using anyone’s likeness without prior written consent is prohibited.
Obviously, using someone’s likeness for commercial gain, say, in an advertisement, without consent is off-limits, but the sponsors note existing exceptions covering literary, historic, and audio-visual work remain in place.
The bill also installs explicit penalties for the malicious use of deepfakes.
Still, what exactly counts gets murky.
The measure describes its scope as covering any production where “a reasonable trier of fact” would confuse the fake with reality.
Pushback
In written testimony, the Motion Picture Association argued it’s not enough to simply retain exceptions in state law.
Granting every individual sweeping protections over their likeness pushes the burden to a producer to demonstrate their work falls within one of the existing exceptions.
“This in and of itself is a substantial expansion of the right of publicity and materially shifts the balance from protecting free speech to protecting individual likenesses,” the association argued.
And relying on whether a reasonable trier of fact gets confused, the group said, could have sweeping implications.
“In the movie Forrest Gump, filmmakers used digital technologies to have the lead character encounter and converse with Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. In its current form, the bill makes such uses presumptively impermissible.”
The Motion Picture Association proposed several amendments.
First, the group doesn’t want to see Ohio’s NIL rights expanded to everyone regardless of commercial value.
Doing so would “permit individuals to prevent others from telling their stories, or to avoid critical or satirical portrayals, which are squarely protected by the First Amendment,” the association stated.
Additionally, the association wants to limit liability to those who “knowingly” distribute a deepfake recording with the intent to “harass, extort or cause physical harm” to another person.
Instead of maintaining existing speech protections, the association wants the sponsors to include explicit protections of work relating to the public interest, commentary, criticism, scholarship, satire, or parody.
Sponsor’s take
The bill’s sponsor Adam Mathews argued that the Motion Picture Association’s push to restore the commercial purpose language is a non-starter. Those changes would “gut the bill,” he said.
Meanwhile, his co-sponsor, state Rep. Ty Mathews, R-Findlay, claimed that the association’s First Amendment concerns are overblown.
“I believe that this bill is not going to really restrict their capability at all,” he said.
But in nearly the same breath, both lawmakers underlined the bill’s First Amendment implications.
“If some Hollywood filmmaker wants to create an image of you, Chairman (state Rep. Thad) Claggett, someday, they would need your permission, if they’re going to utilize your image in a disparaging way,” Ty Mathews said.
Rep. Adam Mathews chimed in, “it would be for the disparaging way, or any other way. If it weren’t disparaging, then they would just have to pay you for it and have that consent.”
The Motion Picture Association noted that courts have long recognized strong protections for parody or satire, “which are critical elements of protected speech.”
“Satirized portrayals of real-life individuals on television shows like Saturday Night Live and cartoon representations on shows like The Simpsons or South Park thus enjoy strong protections,” the association said.
Perhaps recognizing the problem, Ty Mathews attempted to walk back his statement.
“Maybe it was a bad example to use you as a public figure for that one,” he said. “Again, we do have specifically laid out here, protections of traditional satire.”

For nearly a century, the Kelley’s Falls Dam in Manchester, New Hampshire, generated as much as 2,400 megawatt-hours of electricity per year. When the small hydroelectric station in a downtown park came up for relicensing in 2022, its owners faced what many dam operators now expect when trying to extend the lifespan of these power generators: strict requirements that would force them to spend millions on upgrades to qualify for a new operating permit. Instead, Green Mountain Power made a choice that has become common among hydroelectric operators. The utility simply surrendered its licenses.
Last year, the plant shut down.
Nearly 450 hydroelectric stations totaling more than 16 gigawatts of generating capacity are scheduled for relicensing across the United States over the next decade. That’s roughly 40% of the nonfederal fleet (the government owns about half the hydropower stations in the U.S.). The country is now on the verge of a major shift in hydropower. The facilities could be relicensed to supply the booming demand for electricity to power everything from data centers to aluminum smelters. Tech and industrial giants could even help pay for the costly relicensing process with deals like the record-setting $3 billion contract Google inked with hydropower operator Brookfield Asset Management in July for up to 3 gigawatts of hydropower. Or, as has been happening for years, the U.S. could continue to lose gigawatts of power as hydroelectric facilities shut down rather than absorb the high costs of relicensing — especially with cheaper competition from gas, wind, and solar.
The fleet of dams that helped electrify the nation starting in the late 1800s provides the second-largest share of the country’s renewable power after wind, and by far its most firm. But the average age of U.S. dams is 65 years, meaning the bulk of the fleet wasn’t built with newfangled infrastructure to enable unobstructed passage for fish and other wildlife. As seen in New Hampshire, the cost of upgrading facilities to allow for that passage can soar into the tens of millions of dollars — on top of the expense of upgrading custom-built equipment for each plant. Complicating matters further, after decades of decline in the hydropower sector, the manufacturing muscle for turbines and other hardware that make a dam work has largely atrophied in the U.S.
The relicensing waiting game
The biggest obstacle to a hydropower comeback may be the relicensing bureaucracy. The problem is that the Federal Power Act — passed in 1920 to regulate hydroelectric facilities — does not give any single agency full authority over hydropower the way the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has over atomic energy. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issues the key permits on the national level, but other agencies also play a role. The Fish and Wildlife Service, for example, may require a National Environmental Policy Act review to examine a dam’s effects on a specific fish species, a process that involves assessing multiple spawning cycles. And once that’s done for salmon, the agency may undertake yet another multiyear study on trout. FERC, meanwhile, can’t issue its licenses until state agencies overseeing waterways approve permits. That alone can eat up years.
As a result, it takes eight years on average to relicense an existing hydropower facility, according to the National Hydropower Association, the leading U.S. trade group. That’s more than five times slower than licensing for the typical atomic power station. (Nuclear, hydroelectricity’s closest competitor for clean, always-available power, is also notorious for its slow permitting timeline.)
“It takes longer to relicense an existing hydro facility than a new nuclear facility,” said Malcolm Woolf, the National Hydropower Association’s chief executive. ​“It takes just 18 months to get a new license for a nuclear plant.”
With no central body in charge of permitting hydropower plants, multiple state agencies have been known to take advantage of the once-in-a-generation certification process — eliciting support for tangentially related projects from dam owners who once represented a big and growing business.
“This is major infrastructure. These facilities cost billions of dollars,” Woolf said. ​“They’re like bridges and roads. They get a license for 50 years. The state agencies view [the relicensing process] as an opportunity to extract concessions from what they view as a deep pocket.”
At times, those concessions have little to do with the functioning of the hydropower plant itself. Woolf cited examples of dam owners pressed to build an amphitheater for Boy Scouts, and to fund the construction of regional roads that wouldn’t even go to the plant.
“One … regulator was requiring a facility to pay for a feral-pig-eradication program,” Woolf said.
“In the 1970s, maybe the industry was a deep pocket,” he added. ​“But now, with the low cost of other fuels like wind and solar and gas, it’s driving these facilities to bankruptcy and to surrender licenses.”
The eight-year timeline for relicensing is just an average.
In Idaho, the Hells Canyon hydroelectric plant has gone for 20 years without a permanent license. In Maryland, the Conowingo Dam’s relicensing process has also stretched on for two decades. In Massachusetts, the Northfield Mountain plant is in the middle of a 15-year permitting slog.
To continue operating, hydroplant owners obtain one-year extensions as they inch toward full licenses. ​“But if they don’t have a long-term license,” Woolf warned, ​“they’re not about to invest millions in upgrades.” 
One potential bright spot in the relicensing quagmire has been a shift in federal tax policy. For years, the wind and solar industries have benefited from a rule that treats facilities as new if owners reinvest at least 80% of the plant’s market value into upgrades like new turbines or panels, making them eligible for bigger federal write-offs. In January, the Biden administration’s Treasury Department granted hydroelectric facilities the same flexibility.
But so far, no hydroelectric facility has made use of the federal investment tax credit except one small plant that was destroyed in a flood, thus requiring a total reconstruction. That’s because until recently the industry still lacked clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.
“The question in the hydropower industry was, if you think of the Hoover Dam, is it 80% of the electric generating equipment? Or 80% of the whole Hoover Dam and the reservoir? So that’s what the Treasury clarified,” Woolf said. ​“It’s 80% of the electric generating equipment. So if you replace a 50-year-old generator with a new generator, you’re going to satisfy that.”
While renewables face ongoing opposition from the Trump administration, the president specifically named hydropower as a key priority in his Day 1 executive orders on energy. In July, Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, preserving hydropower’s access to key federal tax credits for the next eight years. If a hydro project is built in a designated ​“energy community” and uses domestically manufactured equipment, the tax credit can cover as much as half the investment.
A fishy problem
Providing safe passage for fish through dams is a perpetual challenge, especially at older facilities that lack proper infrastructure. But dams that have been updated with newer, thinner turbine blades are also an issue, as the blades become guillotines for trout and salmon navigating through. American eels pose an even greater problem, as the snake-like fish — which can make up as much as half the biomass in rivers across the country — migrate downstream to spawn as breeding-age adults.
One of the simplest and most widely used tools to prevent fish from being killed in a dam’s turbines is a screen that blocks them from entering the plant’s water intake. Other methods include fish ladders or elevators that allow wildlife to ascend rising water to reach the other side. Less practical are trap-and-haul systems where fish are manually captured and set free above the dam.
“Fish-passage solutions can be extraordinarily expensive,” said Jennifer Garson, the former director of the Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office. ​“The problem is the burden falls completely on hydropower operators to make these upgrades.”
The key to overcoming the issue may be marrying the refurbishment of hydropower stations with environmental upgrades. In 2019, the startup Natel Energy, which designs fish-safe hydropower turbines, installed its pilot project in Maine, then another in Oregon the following year. Natel’s technology — based on thicker blades that don’t sever fish as they move through the dam — was validated by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The company won $9 million from the Energy Department to scale up its supply chain.
While the fish-safe blades are thicker than traditional turbine blades, Natel claims that its equipment is more efficient than the older equipment it’s replacing. Compared with turbines that are nearly 40 years old, CEO Gia Schneider said, the new Natel units produce more electricity per spin on average.
“They’re going to modernize, get fish-safe turbines that will safely pass eel, salmon, and herring that need to go through the plant, and they’ll get 5% more energy,” Schneider said.
Even replacing newer blades comes with little loss in efficiency. 
“At another plant where we’re working on the design, the turbines are pretty young – only installed 10 years ago,” she said. ​“There, we’re going to get maybe 0.2% less energy out.”
On balance, Schneider noted, plant owners get more out of the facility, because even with new traditional turbines, dams require very fine exclusion screens and other equipment that restrict water flow enough to reduce energy output by anywhere from 5% to 15%.
“You’re losing a lot more from these bolt-on solutions,” she said. ​“At the end of the day, if you get 0.2% less on the turbine side, … on the whole-plant level, you’re coming out ahead.”
Old hydropower, new opportunities
At the moment, hydropower finds itself in a similar position to that of nuclear energy a few years ago, where existing facilities risk closure due to relicensing costs amid competition from cheaper newcomers. The U.S. is now actively looking to restart its nuclear program, with the once far-fetched prospect of new large-scale reactors under serious consideration. Even if hydropower can similarly flip its fortunes, few in the industry anticipate an appetite in the U.S. for a Hoover Dam–size project. Still, there is ample opportunity for new hydroelectric capacity.
Just 3% of the nation’s 80,000 dams generate electricity. In 2012, an Energy Department report found that the U.S. could add 12 gigawatts of new power by overhauling those facilities to produce electricity. More than a decade later, ​“none of it was built,” Woolf said.
There are plenty of hydropower critics who welcome that stagnation. The history of damming rivers is rife with ecological destruction that fish-passage routes don’t entirely solve, as well as social upheaval from land seizures that uprooted poor, Black, and Indigenous communities from their homes to make way for new reservoirs.
And in parts of the U.S. where water is growing more scarce as the climate warms, reservoirs are drying up. Hydropower output in the American West hit a 22-year low last year after below-average snowfall, according to analysis by the Energy Information Administration. Yet other parts of the U.S., such as the Northeast, are getting wetter as the planet heats up.
While debate over hydropower continues in the U.S., nations overseas are moving ahead with new dam projects. In July, China started construction on what will, upon completion, be the world’s largest power station, a giant hydroelectric facility in Tibet. Last month, Brazil held its first auctions for new small- and medium-size dams with hopes of turning $1 billion in investments into more hydroelectricity. And Ethiopia just opened its megadam project meant to alleviate electricity issues in the country, despite pushback from Egyptians who say the facility could negatively impact the flow of water on the Nile.
The U.S. could get in on the game, or at least work to clear away hurdles preventing the country from taking advantage of the infrastructure that already exists. As the Trump administration looks to re-shore heavy industry through tariffs, Woolf said, ​“hydropower is a great resource for colocating manufacturing because you’ve got energy infrastructure and you’re typically in fairly rural areas where land is less expensive.” For data centers, reservoirs could offer the additional service of providing water for cooling hot computer servers, along with electricity. And when the U.S. still had 33 operating aluminum smelters in 1980, many of them relied on publicly owned hydropower facilities to provide cheap power. These plants could, in theory, play that role again as new demand for domestically produced aluminum — to manufacture electric vehicles and clean-energy equipment — puts strain on the remaining six smelters.
“We know we’ve got load growth. We know we’ve got grid variability from renewables and extreme weather.

BELLEFONTAINE, Ohio – One by one, Mary Rutan Hospital’s former patients, some wearing bandages or warning that their replacement knee might set off the metal detector, shuffled into an unassuming municipal courthouse on the edge of downtown.
The people who showed up to Bellefontaine Municipal Court on a recent Thursday met with one of three lawyers representing the only hospital in Logan County, population 46,500. Virtually none of the former patients had lawyers of their own.
But most defendants in the Mary Rutan cases didn’t appear. A magistrate, at the request of the hospital, entered default judgments (losses in absentia) against about 10 no-shows, one after another.
Every default judgement sets the hospital up to take, or “garnish,” 25% of the defendants’ paychecks until they pay off the hospital bill and court costs, plus an 8% annual interest rate determined by state law.
Almost every case on that Thursday docket came from Mary Rutan, a 106-year-old hospital that, as a nonprofit, is exempt from state and federal taxes. Each lawsuit was a small piece of the hospital’s recently ramped-up strategy to lean on its patients through the courts to pay their bills.
Between 2000 and 2023, Mary Rutan sued fewer than 400 former patients per year on average across both municipal and county court, according to an analysis of court data.
But since the beginning of last year, Mary Rutan has sued nearly 2,700 patients and counting. 
Debts ran as low as $215 and as high as $153,000. Dozens were for less than $1,000. The Municipal Court cases target about $3,000 of debt per patient, according to a sampling of about 230 cases we reviewed. In all but one case, court records show these defendants had no attorney to represent them.
In Logan County court, which handles bigger cases, the average bill pursued by the hospital is about $26,000.
The hospital is driving a massive increase in the caseload of the municipal court docket, records show. So far this year, nearly two in three civil cases filed in Bellefontaine Municipal Court have come from Mary Rutan, which has already filed more cases this year than it had in all of last year, with three months remaining in 2025.
Data from Bellefontaine Municipal Court, Logan County Court of Common Pleas.
Hospitals vary in their treatment of people with unpaid medical debt, but several experts suggested in interviews that Mary Rutan Hospital, about an hour west of Columbus, was in a league of its own.

Mary Rutan Hospital CEO Chad Ross declined interview requests, as did the hospital’s two outside attorneys who handle most of its collection actions.
But in a lengthy statement, Ross said the hospital offers generous financial assistance, charitable care, and flexible payment plans, plus other care that’s undercompensated by Medicare and Medicaid.

He attributed the recent spike in cases to varying factors, including a backlog of deferred cases during the pandemic and different legal changes that shape the timing of lawsuits or might require the same person to be sued by the hospital in multiple separate lawsuits instead of just one.
He said Mary Rutan must remain “fiscally responsible” to continue to serve the community.
“Like many community hospitals, we depend on patient payments as part of keeping our doors open,” he said. “This allows us to keep services local, recruit and retain staff and invest in new equipment and technology. Turning to collections is always a last resort – only after we have worked to offer patients every available alternative.”
Read the full statement from Mary Rutan Hospital CEO Chad Ross here.
Signal Ohio has interviewed 17 Mary Rutan patients-turned-defendants, plus others familiar with the hospital’s billing practices. We also reviewed court files of thousands more patients. Many described confusion or disagreement over how much they owed, why they owed it, and why their insurance didn’t cover the costs of care. They talked about the struggle of getting simple accounting information from the hospital or debt collector. Some said they didn’t know they had been sued until their paychecks were garnished.
Many knew others around town who were also sued by the hospital. For instance, Chelcie Norris was sued for $1,300. Her husband, James, was sued for $9,000. Both had their wages garnished.
Courtney Henderson, a factory supervisor, said she has helped her current employer’s administrative staff facilitate garnishments of multiple coworkers for Mary Rutan. She herself has been sued twice recently by the hospital and just finished paying off a $1,300 court judgment after the hospital garnished 25% of her paycheck, or about $600 to $800 a month.
“It just seems like every week I’m being told one person’s garnishment is ending and another is starting,” Henderson said.
Mary Rutan wields clout in the community. It’s one of the top employers in Logan County. It files its lawsuits via two local attorneys, one of whom, Zebulon Wagner, is the Bellefontaine City Council president. And Wagner works at TDH Law (Thompson, Dunlap & Heydinger), a firm that previously employed the hospital’s current CEO.
About half of American adults keep a three-month emergency savings fund, according to the Federal Reserve. But for many living paycheck to paycheck, including some of those interviewed by Signal Ohio, a car crash or unexpected illness is enough to trigger financial ruin.
 ‘Do not take me to that place’ 

Tuff Kline, 31, is a cosmetologist at Kut N Loose in town. In September 2022, she was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy, a painful and dangerous condition that occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus. This caused internal bleeding and required outpatient surgery on short notice.

It struck during a three-week gap after Kline left her private insurance and before she enrolled on her husband’s, she said in an interview.
She said she tried to set up a payment plan, but the hospital wanted $1,500 a month, far more than she could afford.
Mary Rutan sued Kline in common pleas court earlier this year for $31,407. She considered hiring an attorney, but questioned why she’d spend more money when she’s already deep in debt.
Instead, she negotiated a payment plan on her own. She owes $130 per week toward the full bill, plus $400 in court costs, all against the 8% annual interest rate set in law. It’ll take nearly six years to pay off for a total cost of around $39,000.
If the hospital cared about a tragic and dangerous end to her pregnancy, the billing department didn’t show it, Kline said.
“I’ve made it very clear to anybody and everybody around me, even if I am dying and I will die in five minutes, do not take me to that place,” she said.  “Just the way they treated me from the minute I had surgery to the minute they sued me. It’s just been nothing but negative, not good, just unhuman. They just have no compassion anymore.”
 Bankruptcy only option for some

Court records show that most of the time, the hospital gets its money one way or another. Sometimes patients pay in full and the hospital drops the case. Sometimes all parties agree to a payment plan. Most often, wages are “garnished.”
A rare exception comes in the handful of cases where patients declare bankruptcy to shed the unpaid bills.

Dustin Overly, a contractor who said he had health insurance at the time, was clearing out a beaver dam when he got his foot stuck and fell backward awkwardly. He dislocated his knee and tore a ligament on the way down. After two surgeries, a year and a half of physical therapy, and a layoff from a contracting job, Mary Rutan successfully sued him for $23,209 in March 2024.
While declaring bankruptcy destroyed his chances of buying a home any time soon, he said it was his only option.
“I wasn’t too proud of it, but I don’t have $25,000 hanging around either,” he said. “I don’t think it played out the way I figured it was going to play out at all. Injuries happen, sometimes they just catch you off guard. But a small injury can turn out to be a big pain, I guess.”
Signal Ohio identified at least one other person being sued by Mary Rutan who notified the courts of a bankruptcy. His attorney didn’t respond to an inquiry.
 ‘I feel helpless’

In court on a recent Thursday, one woman appeared and asked to address a magistrate in a formal hearing. Speaking faintly, she said she suffered a “brain injury” and asked for a delay in the lawsuit against her. Hospital lawyers, and the magistrate, obliged.
In interviews, several patients reported being unable to verify medical charges after Mary Rutan notified them of unpaid bills. Henderson, the factory supervisor, said Mary Rutan sued her over an $809 bill in 2022 and again for $1,300 in 2024.
She was confused that she owed any money at all because, both times, she was covered through Medicaid, the government-funded health care program for the poor and disabled. But the charges were from so long ago that she couldn’t verify them through her Medicaid plan providers.
Henderson just finished paying off the second lawsuit. But she said the strain of having 25% of her paycheck garnished made her unable to save enough money to find a new home large enough for her whole family when she recently had to move unexpectedly.
“I got stuck with paying it. And I don’t know where this all is coming from,” Henderson said.
An employee at Mary Rutan Hospital, who asked not to be named in this article, thought she had settled her debts with the hospital after she was sued over a $17,100 bill. She said she refinanced her home to pay the tab; she thinks the charges were related to the birth of her daughter.
Then Mary Rutan sued her again last year for $5,700, for which she negotiated a payment plan. She said hospital officials also have informed her that she owes $22,000 in unpaid pediatric bills. She hasn’t been sued for that yet.
The employee incurred tens of thousands of dollars of debt even though she said she had insurance coverage – through Medicaid for the first wave of charges and through her husband’s employer for the second.
“I feel helpless,” she said.
 ‘I think it does incredible damage to our community’

Matthew Curry is a lawyer in Delaware, Ohio, who previously helped banks foreclose on homes and collect on other debts. Now, he defends people who are being sued over debts.
In an interview, Curry said he’s handled about a dozen Mary Rutan Hospital cases. He said the lawyers that represent Mary Rutan are responsive and willing to accept payment plans, which can help people avoid the financial damage of a court judgment against them.
But unlike other creditors, Mary Rutan is unwilling to settle for less than the full amount owed, he said.
Curry said he’s been shocked by the number of lawsuits Mary Rutan has filed against its patients over unpaid debts. Most hospitals, he said, send unpaid bills to collections and accept whatever they can get.
“The sheer volume, I’ve never seen anything like it,” Curry said. “Not on medical billing.”

Amanda Capehart is a former paralegal for the law firm of Smith, Smith, Montgomery & Chamberlain, which handles a majority of Mary Rutan’s debt collection lawsuits. 
In an interview, Capehart said she has personally struggled with health care costs and sympathizes with patients who told her they couldn’t afford their bills or get clear information from the hospital or their insurer.

She left the firm on moral grounds and now works for another lawyer in town.
“And that’s why I had to quit. Like I couldn’t do it to people anymore. It was awful,” Capehart said. “It would be one thing if it was a credit card loan or a car loan, but no, this is people getting health care and typically they probably don’t have insurance and that’s why they have to go to the emergency room.”
Andy Stahl, a behavioral health therapist, has worked for Mary Rutan as a provider. But it was health care for his three children that turned him into a defendant against the hospital. Acting as his own attorney, he fought the hospital in court, challenging what he said were suspect line items on his bill and whether the hospital properly served him a court summons.
He lost and was ordered to pay $1,628. In an interview, he said he’s thankful he was able to pay up and settle without any kind of garnishment. But many aren’t so lucky. While he doesn’t think the hospital is doing anything illegal, he questioned the morality of a health care provider suing its patients en masse.
“I think that it is excessive. I think it does incredible damage to our community,” Stahl said. “It creates a lack of trust in the local health care system – the only health care system in here. … I imagine it indirectly has caused deaths or injury, because people aren’t going to go back when they need care because a lot of people can’t afford it. Most people don’t have thousands of extra dollars to pay.”

 Trying to survive

Medical debt is a unique financial problem for a few reasons, said Ruth Lande, a former hospital billing administrator who now works with Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that raises funds to help buy Americans out from towering medical bills.
For one, it comes up fast and often without warning. And even when planned in advance, costs are difficult if impossible to compare. The financial risks are highest for the roughly 6.4% of Ohioans who have no health insurance.
But even for those with insurance, copays, coinsurance, out-of-network surcharges and other add-ons have shifted health care costs from insurers to consumers. She said that’s how people wind up a few hundred dollars in arrears.
“That’s a very common amount, around $1,200,” Lande said. “Employer-based deductibles are often several thousand [dollars], and that’s exactly what people don’t have.”
Mary Rutan’s policy, as is a best practice in the industry, is to only sue if the debtor “appears to have assets to pay the bill.”
The policy is messier in practice. The hospital sued Malia Pyles in June for $5,713 for failure to pay her bills related to a 2020 diagnosis of C. Difficile, a bacterial infection that causes miserable gastrointestinal distress. She was making $13 an hour at the time in a factory job. She said she has taken out a loan against her house to pay on a $192 per-month plan.
Mary Rutan sued Heath Keckler in 2022 after he failed to pay a $2,400 medical bill. These days, he pays the hospital $100 per month, even as he receives disability pay following a kidney transplant. He said he “basically had no say” in the matter.
Lande said most hospitals in her experience don’t sue their patients over unpaid bills.
“I think any justification for suing comes from an idea that there are people out there with plenty of cash who are not paying their medical bills,” Lande said. “So if you believe that, then you believe that suing is reasonable. However, that’s really not the case that I’ve ever seen.”
And then there’s hospitals’ core mission: helping patients. Lande said she worries about what happens when fear of debt turns into people declining necessary health care.
Mary Rutan is the only hospital within a 30-minute drive of the town. The sparse population leaves the independent hospital in a weak bargaining position against insurers who pay for most services, several experts said in interviews.
Andy Engel, a Columbus attorney, worked for his family’s debt collection company in Southwest Ohio, mostly representing hospitals.
He said the lawsuits might be the hospital’s way of “training” people against using emergency rooms as a source of primary care.
While the widespread garnishment surely hurts the community, everybody benefits when the hospital remains open, he said. In his opinion, the stingy reimbursement rates from Medicaid and Medicare are at the root of the medical debt trap, not the patients or the hospital.
“My guess is they’re in dire straits and they want people to understand they’re not doing this because they’re mean, nasty individuals,” he said. “They’re trying to survive.”
 Mary Rutan runs a profit most of the time

Mary Rutan’s tax records show it’s a profitable operation, albeit on thin margins. Over the decade ending in 2023, it averaged $4.4 million in profit per year. That’s a profit margin of about 4%. But it reported a $6.6 million net loss in 2022, its first since the Great Recession.
Ross, the hospital’s CEO, didn’t respond to specific questions, and his statement doesn’t directly address the hospital’s financial health.
He said too many Americans are uninsured or underinsured, exposing them to surprising and hefty medical bills. He said the hospital last year provided $21.8 million in uncompensated care, including charity care and losses associated with Medicare and Medicaid shortfalls.
“Importantly, Mary Rutan Health follows all federal and state guidelines for billing and collections, and we are committed to treating every patient with fairness and respect throughout the process,” he said.
Tax records over the most recent decade available show the hospital has written off an average of $3.3 million each year of the past decade in “bad debt,” meaning money it’s owed but likely will never see. (This accounting doesn’t stop the hospital from trying to collect on the debt.)
The bad debts have been increasing since the pandemic. That’s part of a statewide trend, according to John Palmer, a spokesman for the Ohio Hospital Association.
Citing data from the American Hospital Association, he said that 41% of U.S. adults have health care debt if you include credit cards and debts to family. Fourteen million people in the U.S. owe more than $1,000 in medical debt, and about 3 million people owe medical debt of more than $10,000.
 When medical debt comes for a former debt collector

Rhonda Chamberlain used to work for Mary Rutan’s debt collections arm. Now, she’s paying $130 a month to the hospital after Mary Rutan sued her for $6,800 last year.
The debt traced back to physical therapy Chamberlain received following a motorcycle accident in 2019, she said in an interview. By then, she no longer worked for Mary Rutan. She was uninsured when she injured her neck and hip.

She said she didn’t pay her bill while her lawyer negotiated with the insurance company of the driver who caused her accident. She said her lawyer also hoped to get nearly $2,000 in interest removed but was unsuccessful.
Part of Chamberlain’s repayment involved a $2,500 lump sum, which she got under a renter’s insurance payout she received after an apartment fire.
She struggled to find a new place she could afford on the $34,000 she makes a year as a school custodian. Eventually, friends agreed to rent her and her son a couple rooms. Her expenses, including her monthly payment to Mary Rutan, make it hard for her to afford food. Her friends help her make ends meet by sharing theirs.
Chamberlain teared up as she described her friends’ generosity, saying it prevented her from being homeless. She thinks she’ll have her medical debt paid off in two or three years.
“$130 is a lot of money to me. It might not sound like a lot to other people, but it is,” she said.











At the Statehouse in Columbus, a bipartisan pair of lawmakers wants to restrict some of the legal tactics health care providers can use to force patients to pay their bills.
If enacted, House Bill 257 would do three things:

Prohibit providers from garnishing wages
Prohibit providers from reporting medical debts to credit bureaus
Cap interest rates on medical debt at 3%

The bill is sponsored by Rep. Jean Schmidt, a Cincinnati-area Republican, and Rep. Michele Grim, a Toledo Democrat. They say heart attacks or bike crashes shouldn’t destroy Ohioans’ credit. And health care providers shouldn’t be able to seize patients’ income when they have rent to pay and mouths to feed.
Several debt collection law firms have publicly opposed the bill, arguing it would deprive barely profitable hospitals from using legitimate tools to cover their costs. And limiting medical debt from lenders would set the stage for irresponsible lending, they argue.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Agriculture and industry, as well as municipalities, face looming restrictions on water supplies essential for economic growth. Rural residents experience declines and possible closure of schools, health care facilities, churches, business and professional establishments, and other community services. Federal actions threaten agricultural markets, health care, clean energy, housing and numerous other programs.
The list of critical issues facing Kansans is long.
How do state lawmakers respond? Members of the Republican supermajority join President Donald Trump and tilt at windmills. They outlaw “wokeness” at state universities. They override a veto to assign “pregnancy compassion awareness” to the Republican state treasurer. They stand quietly aside as Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” does damage to Kansans throughout the state. Their leaders propose an unprecedented special legislative session to gerrymander the single Democrat in Kansas’ congressional delegation out of her seat.
Rather than embracing Trump in attacking imaginary enemies, I would suggest state lawmakers look to the work of past Kansas reformers who led the state in addressing critical issues. Their solutions have served Kansans well over many decades.
Look, for example, to Rep. Jess Taylor, who in 1966 led the Kansas House of Representatives to reapportion a grossly malapportioned house chamber. Taylor, a Republican and former speaker of the House, represented the most malapportioned district in the state. He engaged Republicans and Democrats, urban and rural interests, to bring the Kansas House into compliance with the U.S. Supreme Court’s edict of one person, one vote. Urban and suburban voters gained representation, while 38 of Taylor’s colleagues, mostly Republicans, were turned out of office.
Consider the bipartisan leadership of Gov. Robert Docking, Senate President Robert Bennett, along with House Speaker Pete McGill and Minority Leader Pete Loux, who in the early 1970s steered reforms of the state’s political institutions — legislative, executive, and judicial — mired in constitutional restrictions written 100 years earlier. After careful study, Kansas lawmakers proposed and voters adopted 20 constitutional amendments that transformed legislative processes, strengthened the chief executive and unified a fragmented judiciary. These institutions consequently became more responsive, accountable, and capable of serving Kansans well into the 21st century.
These institutional reforms triggered other initiatives. For example, Bennett and McGill were instrumental in securing passage in 1974 of the campaign finance reforms that have assured a substantial degree of transparency in state politics to the present day.
Once elected governor, Bennett oversaw the conversion in 1975 of a politicized Highway Commission into an up-to-date Department of Transportation, which has operated professionally now for the past 50 years and focused attention on road conditions rather than highway politics.
In the mid-1980s, Gov. John Carlin persuaded legislative leaders of both parties to address the incredibly bad and long-ignored administration of property taxation. Together, they coupled modern and centralized appraisal with a constitutional amendment classifying property for purposes of taxation that stabilized the impact on taxpayers. That plan was adopted and has guided objective administration of property taxation now for nearly 40 years.
Carlin also assembled a bipartisan coalition of urban interests to update the state’s archaic liquor and banking laws and initiated constitutional amendments authorizing a state lottery and tax incentives for economic development. These steps affirmed that state government could and should act to stimulate economic growth.
Gov. Mike Hayden addressed declining investment in infrastructure by making finance of highways and the state water plan top priorities. He worked with bipartisan coalitions to secure a comprehensive highway program and initiate funding for the state water plan. Since 1989, the finance plan for highways has been replicated a number of times, and funding of the water plan has become the foundation for substantial increases in recent years.
In 1992, Senate Majority Leader Fred Kerr, a Republican, and House Speaker Marvin Barkis, a Democrat, stepped up to take on the divisive and difficult issue of school finance. Through back-and-forth debate within and across each chamber, state lawmakers fundamentally rewrote school finance by embracing public schools as a state obligation and shifting the financing of schools from property taxes to sales and income taxes. Property taxes were dramatically reduced throughout most of the state, and the 1992 law has served as a starting point for any adjustment in school finance ever since.
These Kansas reformers are covered in “Reform and Reaction: The Arc of Kansas Politics,” a book I co-edited with Michael Smith that came out last year. They took the job of lawmaking seriously and stepped forward to work on difficult public problems that had lingered years without resolution. They put their political careers on the line, built bipartisan bonds in a competitive political environment and left a lasting imprint on public policy in Kansas.
These leaders provide a better guide for state action on the critical issues confronting Kansans than does an embrace of Trumpism that distracts voters from addressing these issues.

(File photo by Getty Images)Last week, Ohio lawmakers overrode a governor’s veto, prohibiting schools from proposing emergency levies to maintain fiscal sustainability.
The reasoning used by lawmakers was that levies like these are a contributor to property tax burden in the state. 
Supporters of the bill argued that even though these levies required a vote from the people who would be subject to the tax, that voters did not know what they were agreeing to. According to them, eliminating the tax would stop voters from being duped.
It’s an interesting argument, but not one with a lot of merit. 
It seems that simply changing ballot requirements for transparency could have achieved the effect of solving the information asymmetry problem. 
Now districts are down another tool for ensuring fiscal sustainability.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Why do schools need local fiscal tools like this? 
Why not have schools more dependent on the state for funds and less so on the will of local voters? 
In the extreme, why doesn’t Ohio follow the lead of Hawai’i and eliminate school districts altogether?
A classic paper by 20th century economist Charles Tiebout gives us a reason that we may want to preserve local fiscal tools like this. 
Tiebout’s model of “Tiebout sorting” is built on the idea that people have choices about which jurisdiction they wish to live in. 
Different local jurisdictions can provide different mixes of public goods and collect different levels of taxes to finance those goods. That means people can move to communities that provide them with their needs.
Certain communities in Ohio have high taxes, good schools, and safe streets, appealing to families with children. 
Others have lower taxes and amenities like senior centers, which can appeal to people who are retirement-age. 
Still others can have their taxes allocated toward things like safety in entertainment districts, appealing to young professionals.

Strategies like school finance equalization can make it easier to deal with equity issues — people who do not have the flexibility to move jurisdictions based on their public goods needs. 
But overall, allowing communities to decide for themselves how much to raise for public goods and how to spend it allows for a diversity of communities that makes the state as a whole stronger.
In the 1970s, the state of California went through its own citizen-led property tax revolt. 
Spurred by housing prices that had more than doubled from 1970-1978, voters passed a citizen initiative that fixed property taxes in place across the state, with only small changes allowed over time.
This has led to some problems. 
Individuals and corporations have been given an incentive to sit on properties for decades without making improvements to the properties to avoid increases in property taxes. 
Schools and local governments are not able to raise money at the rate of increases in costs. 
This has been part of the policy landscape that has led to an exodus from the state over the past decade: things just don’t work there anymore.
Despite the troubles Ohio has had in its post-industrial era, the state still has a lot of positives. 
Housing and energy costs are still low compared to the rest of the country, cost-of-living-adjusted poverty is below average statewide, and the state is still an attractive place for people to start businesses and raise families. 
Blunt approaches to local government finance will only make it harder for communities to provide the range of lifestyles that will make the state economy dynamic decades into the future.

In March,1967 a Connecticut man named Harrison Butterworth sailed with six  companions to Vietnam’s Gulf of Tonkin. Their 50-foot ketch was dubbed the Phoenix. The crew was bringing one ton of medical supplies for civilians injured by U.S. bombing raids.

That year alone 12,000 U.S. service members died in the Southeast Asian war. Some 150,000 Vietnamese were killed as well. The Phoenix carried medicine, in part, to atone for the civilians wounded or killed by U.S. forces.
Until last week, when most of it was intercepted by the Israeli forces, the Gaza flotilla Sumud was on its way across the Mediterranean Sea to bring food, baby formula and medicine to starving Palestinians. The population has been obliterated by massive Israeli assaults for the last two years. The flotilla launched on August 30 with 45 boats and an international crew that included eight American veterans.
As both the Phoenix and the Sumud have understood, their efforts are only a symbolic contribution to peace. But symbols have power. The U.S. government has wasted $17 billion tax dollars on Israeli weapon sales since 2023. Corporations that profit from this horror like Colt, Boeing and Amazon all have operations in Connecticut.
Butterworth and his comrades were committed pacifists motivated by a Quaker tradition with a very long history. From aiding enslaved fugitives’ escape from slavery, to refusing enlistment in the army and going to prison, the Butterworth family has quietly been in the forefront of popular resistance to U.S. violence.
The 1967 voyage began in March toward the end of the monsoon season. U.S. officials threatened the Phoenix team with felony charges of “trading with the enemy.” The crew encountered missiles from a hostile American vessel and then a North Vietnamese ship that ordered them to turn around.
It seemed their mission would end before it began, but suddenly – and apparently without pre-meditation– Harrison Butterworth and another crew member jumped into the ocean and swam toward land. Vietnamese sailors dove in to catch them, but Harrison reached the shore. Ultimately, North Vietnamese doctors and Buddhists from the south received the medical aid.
The international flotilla sailing to Palestine faced its own dangers. Israeli drones harassed and attacked the nonviolent Sumud and its sister ships. Past voyages by similar volunteer groups have sometimes ended in tragedy.
These atrocities–mass murder of Palestinian children, targeting of journalists, forced starvation of millions– are not beyond Washington’s control. We must demand accountability from U.S. decision makers.
As we learned in Vietnam, the most powerful nation on Earth is best situated to stop today’s chaos. It was poet laureate Tracy K. Smith who warned us: history is hot on our heels. With past examples as our model, ordinary people must recognize the catastrophe in Gaza and take action.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-07 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How data can transform support for CT youth,Michelle Riordan-Nold,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/07/how-data-can-transform-support-for-ct-youth/,"Connecticut has the opportunity to lead the nation in demonstrating how data, when shared responsibly and equitably, can transform the way we support our most vulnerable youth.","With the severe cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and SNAP benefits on the immediate horizon, Connecticut needs to bolster its data infrastructure to ensure the limited dollars the state will be receiving are targeted to those most in need and are having the intended impact.
Several actions during the 2025 legislative session have moved the state closer to strengthening the technical infrastructure needed to support services that generate data for evaluating impact. Most recently, lawmakers have invested in childcare, reduced the cost burden on families, created Baby Bonds to fight generational poverty, and developed strategies to re-engage disconnected youth. Amidst a national climate where protections for vulnerable populations are eroding, Connecticut stands out for its commitment to its future.
Two policy initiatives —Baby Bonds and universal early childcare— have the potential to be transformative for the lives of Connecticut’s children. However, to realize their full impact, it’s essential that we implement systems capable of tracking progress.
Investing in our children’s future not only benefits our youth, it helps develop a stronger workforce for the future. Ensuring the recipients of the bonds are on a path to success will require cooperation among state agencies, characterized by interagency data sharing and measurement of outcomes.
Realizing the potential of this approach will require coordination not only among state agencies but also among nonprofits that administer services for the state. A key component in achieving success is a state data intermediary. The Office of Policy and Management and WestEd’s Data Integration Support Center have outlined what it would take: infrastructure, governance, and technical assistance to help nonprofits build the capacity they’ll need. This is just the foundation, and Connecticut can aim towards being the lead change agent in understanding youth outcomes.
Imagine a fully-functioning data ecosystem where nonprofit staff are not just reporting on state grants 12 months after the intervention, but where nonprofit staff are data leaders who are trained, resourced, and trusted to shape how information is collected, governed, and used. Imagine linked data from birth through young adulthood available not only to policymakers, but to the communities themselves. Youth and families could see their own stories reflected in the numbers and help guide interventions that make sense in their communities.
The Hartford Data Collaborative serves as a data intermediary that has successfully linked data from local nonprofits, the City of Hartford, and Hartford Public Schools, to provide insights including: which youth are being served by programs and how many residents in a specific neighborhood are accessing services and programs designed for them.
An established data governance process ensures data privacy, with providers driving the learning agenda. This groundbreaking initiative incorporates the community voice into the data work through the Hartford’s Youth Data Fellows program, which brings young people directly into the hands-on analysis and advocacy.


In addition, CTData Collaborative currently creates data strategic plans for nonprofit organizations through CTData’s Strategic Planning program so that nonprofits are realizing the potential of their data assets. The CTData Academy, which already offers an array of data-centric training for state residents, could deepen its role in training nonprofit staff to tell stories with data, and these stories could support the difficult decisions lawmakers, funders, and communities must make. This is not an abstract dream. These are the building blocks for a data ecosystem that would measure actual progress.
Connecticut has the opportunity to lead the nation in demonstrating how data, when shared responsibly and equitably, can transform the way we support our most vulnerable youth. A statewide data intermediary is not just another policy solution, it is the key that can unlock the knowledge already held by hundreds of nonprofits, turn it into collective action, and building far-reaching system response.
We need to think seriously about what we can do locally to preserve the efficacy of data and how we can build a better data infrastructure within our state to better serve our residents. Doing so is within our reach.
It is time for the state to take meaningful steps forward to by establishing pilot programs with philanthropically supported initiatives like the Hartford Data Collaborative to bring local data infrastructure to the next level. By linking local data with state data, we will 1) better inform policy making at the state and local level,  2) have necessary data to make better programmatic decisions, and 3) track the long-term success of program initiatives and the communities they serve.
Uncertainty about the future and de-investment from the federal government should not defeat us. In fact, it should energize us to think differently, invest wisely, make strategic decisions using data, and take pride in strengthening our social systems that support all our residents.

(File Photo by Bennett Leckrone/Maryland Matters)Maryland Supreme Court justices had pointed questions Monday for a lawyer arguing that local governments do not exceed their authority by seeking damages from large fossil fuel companies for their role in climate change over the decades.
Vic Sher argued that lawsuits against the companies by Baltimore City, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County are not trying to restrict emissions, as the companies claim, but only to protect consumers from deceitful practices by corporations — an area of law “traditionally” policed by state courts, he said.
That brought pushback from Justice Brynja M. Booth.
“How can you say that when you are asking for punitive damages?” she asked.
But justices also grilled the attorney for the oil companies, asking how he squared his argument that only the federal government can regulate interstate — and international — greenhouse gas emissions, when supreme courts in Colorado and Hawaii have allowed similar suits to go forward.
The exchanges were part of an hourlong hearing Monday before the court, which is being asked to decide whether Baltimore, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County can move forward with their suits against the fossil fuel companies.
Lower courts, in separate rulings, said they could not, dismissing the lawsuits before trial after finding that the claims focused on the companies’ communications about greenhouse gas emissions that went beyond state borders, putting the issue outside the reach of state courts.
Judge: Feds illegally capped sustainable energy funding in Maryland, 19 other states

The Maryland suits are part of a wave of more than 30 similar lawsuits filed by cities and counties across the nation arguing that massive oil and gas companies, including Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil, knowingly deceived consumers about the globe-warming impacts of their products. In doing so, they harmed coastal cities like Baltimore and Annapolis, which stand to experience increased flooding and other dangers as seas rise and storms worsen, the suits claim.
Monday’s hearing was the latest in years of arguments in Maryland courts — the Baltimore case was originally filed in 2018, the Anne Arundel and Annapolis cases in 2021 — over whether the suits can be heard in state court. Monday was no different.
Theodore J. Boutrous, Jr., an attorney representing the Chevron Corp. and the other oil companies, argued that the greenhouse gas emissions at the center of the complaints fall under federal law and the regulatory jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency. State courts, he said, are ill-equipped to handle such questions.
“They’re asking this court to take Maryland law and project it around the United States and around the world,” Boutrous said of the Maryland jurisdictions.
Boutrous contended that even if the cities and the county are not seeking to explicitly cap emissions, monetary damages could have the effect of constraining the companies’ activities.
“Damage awards have a regulatory effect,” Boutrous said. “They’re meant to change behavior.”
Allowing state courts to “indirectly regulate emissions” by imposing massive fines would intrude on the federal government’s authority over interstate air pollution, Boutrous argued.
Sher, for his part, argued that any lessening of emissions would come from economic forces.
“The only limitation will come from the market,” Sher said. “There is no regulation.”
That’s evidenced by the relief that the plaintiff jurisdictions are seeking, Sher said. Though the companies would pay punitive damages, there would be no “capping” or “enjoining” of their greenhouse gas emissions, Sher said. They could continue their practices — and pollution — unabated, he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The deception about climate change previously influenced the market, Sher said, and an award of damages to the cities and the county would set it right.
“It made a difference,” he said. “It had an effect on the world.”
Justices wondered whether the concerns about deceit in the marketplace could actually be separated from the concerns about air emissions. They also wondered whether companies had a duty to warn consumers about a global phenomena widely discussed for decades, and how more honest communications from the companies would have changed behavior specifically in Maryland.
But the panel also interjected with plenty of questions for Boutrous. They asked about the Hawaii and Colorado supreme court rulings that have allowed the climate cases to move forward in their courts. They also asked about Sher’s argument that only market forces would restrict emissions, not the court’s ruling.
“They’re using the lawsuit to try to change market forces to reduce emissions,” Boutrous said.
Boutrous also argued that it would be unwieldy for municipalities and counties across the United States to be permitted to move forward with litigation against the same large oil and gas companies.
“Think of the number of suits here,” Boutrous said.
He argued that if Maryland courts ruled that the companies should have warned the public, that outcome would have implications far beyond the state — even crossing international borders.
“This court would be imposing a duty that would run to China, to Great Britain — that would run all around the world,” Boutrous said.
But Sher argued that the nature of modern commerce means those effects are unavoidable.
“The notion that Maryland law cannot affect behavior outside of Maryland is wrong,” Sher said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_7277-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 22:57:12.469845

The one-time payment of $700 is meant to provide a measure of financial support to federal workers who are required to continue reporting to work but will not be paid during the shutdown that began Oct. 1. The Federal Shutdown Loan Program is one of several efforts to assist Maryland’s large federal workforce. during the shutdown.
“A federal government shutdown creates immediate financial hardship for our dedicated public servants,” said Maryland Labor Secretary Portia Wu said in a prepared statement.
Shutdown support for federal workers comes from range of businesses, charities

“Maryland is home to a significant number of federal employees, and it is our responsibility to provide a bridge for those who are working without pay,” Wu’s staetment said. “This loan program is a critical lifeline to ensure that our neighbors can continue to put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads while we await a resolution.”
About 269,000 Maryland residents were employed by the federal government before layoffs and buyouts began earlier this year. There were also more than 160,000 federal civilian jobs located in Maryland at that time.
Federal workers deemed essential continue to report for work but do not get paid. Historically, those workers have received back pay when the shutdown concludes.
Current federal workers who are Maryland residents and deemed essential employees can apply for a one-time $700 loan through the state’s Federal Shutdown Loan Program. The interest-free payment must be repaid to the state within 45 days of the conclusion of the shutdown.
Should the shutdown continue into next week, the department would send out the first checks on Oct. 16.
Federal workers and contractors who have been furloughed may be eligible for unemployment benefits, the Labor Department announcement said.

The Chesapeake Bay Journal
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has selected a career employee with two decades of experience at the agency as the new head of its Chesapeake Bay Program Office in Annapolis.
In an email to Bay Program participants, the agency said that Dan Coogan was scheduled to begin Oct. 6.
He currently is the agency’s deputy assistant administrator for Infrastructure and Extramural Resources and oversees the Office of Mission Support in Washington, D.C., which is responsible for acquisitions, grants and facility operations.

Coogan will take over as the state-federal partnership is preparing to put the finishing touches on an updated Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement that will guide restoration and cleanup activities beyond 2025. He will be the Bay Program’s seventh director, or acting director, in six years.
Much of his experience is in programs managing grants and budgets. That could be useful because about two-thirds of the Chesapeake Bay Program’s annual budget of about $90 million goes toward grants to states, local governments, universities and nonprofits.
In the Office of Mission Support, he oversaw an annual budget of $900 million and 1,400 full-time equivalent employees who provided services and programs to support the rest of the agency.
In past roles over the years, Coogan has overseen a wide range of actions to streamline and improve agency operations, ranging from reducing the number of overdue Freedom of Information Act responses to helping lead implementation of massive grant programs under the Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, both of which distributed record amounts of agency funding for environmental initiatives.
Coogan joined the EPA in 2004 and holds a bachelor’s degree in government and politics from the University of Maryland, a master’s degree in public policy, and a doctorate in public policy from George Washington University.
He lives in College Park with his family and enjoys running, cycling, gardening and coaching youth sports.
Coogan will take over for Lee McDonnell, who has served as the acting Bay Program Director since December 2024 and helped guide the partnership through efforts to revise its watershed agreement and develop a new governance structure for the partnership.
McDonnell will return to his position as chief of the Science, Implementation and Analysis Branch within the EPA Bay Program Office.

Brian Burns, a retired pharmacist who chairs the committee, said that about 9,000 Jacksonians live in rental properties with landlords who have past-due water bills. The disclosure signals to the large number of people who could be impacted by water shutoffs as private utility JXN Water continues its crackdown on delinquent accounts.
But it lacked much context. What kind of complexes? How many? Which ones and where are they located? How much does each complex owe? 
Committee members raised concerns about the figure.
“Do you think 9,000 is the number? Like we’re having a crisis with 9,000 tenants?” asked Jennifer Welch, a local property manager who co-chairs the taskforce. “Because we haven’t really said that number.” 
Members of the task force then learned that JXN Water had issued final notices last week to four apartment complexes with past-due bills, one of the last steps before the utility stops service if the owner does not pay within 21 days. But Carla Dazet, JXN Water’s representative on the task force, did not say the name of the complexes. 
Fewer than 1,000 residents live at those four complexes, but after the meeting ended, Burns and Welch would not say which four complexes were poised to lose water. 
“We are not releasing that information,” Welch said after the housing task force concluded its meeting. “If you would like to know that, you should contact JXN Water.”

JXN Water spokesperson Aisha Carson did not respond to a request for comment before press time. The private operator that manages the city’s water utility is not subject to the Public Records Act, and its administrator Ted Henifin has been selective about which information to share with the public.

Water shutoffs at apartment complexes with past-due bills totaling more than $200,000 began over the summer, displacing some residents. Jackson Mayor John Horhn had convened the task force in part to coordinate relocation assistance to tenants who were forced to find a new place to live. 
Some members of the committee seemed hopeful the owners of the four unnamed complexes would pay up and spare their tenants the same fate. During the meeting, Victoria Love, the manager of the city’s rental registry, said one of the complexes was federally funded with 156 units and three vacancies. The rest were market rate. 
“With Blossom Apartments being the example, I don’t feel like owners will press their luck,” Love said.
Soon after this discussion, the task force elected to go into executive session. Under the Open Meetings Act, an executive session is a legal justification that public bodies can use to limit members of the public from certain discussions, such as prospective litigation, personnel issues or confidential business decisions.
Welch said the task force was going to review a “delinquency sheet” and that she did not know the names of the four complexes.
“We do not know the answer to that,” Welch said prior to the closed portion of the meeting. “We are going to go into executive session to discuss that.”
But when two reporters sought the reason why the task force voted to go into executive session, city spokesperson, Nic Lott, said the task force was discussing “ongoing policy issues,” which is not a reason listed in the act. 
“There’s no action taken in executive session,” Lott said. “It’s just an ongoing discussion.”

After a few minutes, Lott returned from the closed session and said that while he agreed the Open Meetings Act applied to the city’s housing task force, “our lawyers tell us that we don’t have to say anything about executive session.” 
“We’re told that we don’t have to reveal the discussion of the executive session,” he added. 
Toward the end of the closed meeting, from behind closed double doors, reporters could hear a member attending over Zoom ask the task force, “why not invite Ted to answer some questions?”
Lott then asked the reporters to sit in the lobby of the city’s administrative building, citing the fact that the Zoom could be heard outside the room. 
When the meeting ended, Burns said the task force had entered executive session to discuss “strategy related to the housing issue, the upcoming housing issue that might be occurring,” including the “water shutoff and humanitarian issues.” 
“If you displace Jackson residents out of apartment complexes, that is extraordinary,” Burns said. “So we’ve got to have the funding to help some of those people.” 
Welch said closer to 600 people may to be impacted, but she directed most questions to JXN Water. 
“It’s such a large, complicated problem that there are not great solutions with 600 people who are going to be affected from a lack of water,” she said, adding “whatever the number might be at these supposed four apartment complexes.”  
The task force is still working to understand JXN Water’s policies for notifying impacted tenants, which include putting a “sign in the yard,” Welch said.
Burns said that in the event JXN Water shuts off service to another complex, the city is looking to secure federal funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help tenants who want to move to an apartment with water. He did not think the ongoing government shutdown would impact the funding. 
The task force is focusing on the complexes that are causing the biggest issues for the city, but Burns said there are more than 80 rental properties, ranging from multifamily properties to duplexes and single-family homes, with past-due water bills. 
“We don’t want to be putting out information from JXN Water for JXN Water,” Burns said. “We want that information coming directly from JXN Water.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) As the Trump administration increases pressure on states and cities to have police assist with federal immigration enforcement, officials in Rhode Island’s capital are moving to impose new limits on how officers can cooperate.
Following a three hour hearing Monday evening, the Providence City Council’s committee on ordinance voted to advance a proposal introduced by Councilor Justin Roias in January to amend the city’s Community-Police Relations Act. Three members voted for the proposal and two, Committee Chairman Pedro Espinal and Councilor Oscar Vargas, abstained. 
Over 50 residents and community advocates spoke before the committee, nearly all were against any relationship between the Providence Police Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
“I do not want to feel like masked people could kidnap me or my neighbors off the street with support of the Providence Police and my tax dollars,” Rebecca Dupras, a Providence estate planning attorney, told the committee. “I want to feel that I can count on the police to protect me.” 
Angel Lopez of the city’s Silver Lake neighborhood said he believes amending its policing rules will only make the city safer.
“Positive relationships must work both ways,” he said. 
Among the proposed changes:

Providence Police would be barred from complying with ICE requests to establish traffic perimeters for any federal agency attempting to detain undocumented immigrants 
The city would not be allowed to deputize officers as immigration officials under the Department of Homeland Security’s 287(g) program.
The police would be prohibited from sharing personal data with federal immigration authorities, including state-issued IDs, licenses, names, addresses, dates of birth, fingerprints or biometric information.
Schools, places of worship, health facilities and courts would be designated safe spaces, meaning federal immigration authorities can’t be granted access unless they have a judicial warrant or are “acting in response to a specific act of terrorism, national security threat or when there is the threat of imminent danger of violence.”

In an interview ahead of the meeting, Steven Brown, executive director for the Rhode Island ACLU, told the Rhode Current that he believes the proposed ordinance is important in ensuring future administrations don’t go back on policy that isn’t codified.
Enacted in 2017 under then-Mayor Jorge Elorza, the Providence Community-Police Relations Act prohibits officers from assisting with federal immigration enforcement regardless of the reason the person is being detained, unless there is a criminal warrant issued for a person in Providence police custody.
But how strictly police adhere to internal policy came into question after officers were filmed at the scene of an ICE arrest on Alverson Avenue on July 13. 
At the time, Police Col. Oscar Perez told media outlets that officers responded only because ICE agents crashed their car, not to assist in ICE activity. However, body camera footage showed that some officers tried to assist federal immigration officials by asking a landlord if she could hand over her keys so ICE didn’t have to break down any doors in her home.
A review of the incident published by the Providence External Review Authority (PERA) in August found that police actions during the ICE raid “constituted prohibited assistance” in enforcing federal immigration policy.
“The assistance was operationally significant” the city’s oversight panel wrote.
PERA’s review recommended that the police department establish “clear operational guidelines” on its response to ICE or other federal agency requests for assistance related to immigration enforcement activities. 
“Guidelines should include express instructions to department personnel that they are not to render any services that directly or indirectly assist federal agencies in conducting civil immigration enforcement,” the review states.

Providence Mayor Brett Smiley took some initial steps to codify those guidelines with an executive order issued on Sept. 22 reaffirming the city’s police department will only enforce local laws.
Smiley said in a statement to Rhode Island Current Monday that “many of the updates” in the council’s proposal were in-line with his order and that local protections must be assessed by officials.
However, the mayor does have one major concern: A provision that allows community organizations to challenge potential violations in court. 
“In addition to opening up the city to legal liability, it creates a parallel process to our already existing external authority, PERA, who should have the responsibility to review these matters,” he said.
But Brown of the ACLU said allowing court challenges will ensure Providence police remain accountable for following their own policy.
“A lot of the people who might be most directly affected by violations are unlikely to pursue legal action because of their immigration status or the fear of taking such a public stand,” he said.
City Councilor Miguel Sanchez, a co-sponsor of the proposed ordinance, said the city needs to be held to higher standards in upholding its own laws.
“In today’s day and age, folks don’t want to be held accountable,” he said. “As public servants, that’s really disappointing to me.”
State Rep. David Morales, a progressive Democrat running to unseat Smiley next year, was not present for the hearing but provided written testimony in support of amending the city’s policing policy.
“At a time when trust in our public institutions is fragile and fear among immigrant communities is growing, Providence must take bold, concrete steps to affirm that it stands with and for all of our neighbors,” Morales wrote.
GOP mayoral candidate Allen Waters was the only speaker Monday who was fully against the amending the ordinance.
“I support the Providence police,” he said near the end of the hearing. “I support Immigration Customs Enforcement — we should not compete against them”
He was promptly booed by the over two dozen remaining members of the public seated in the council chamber.
Roias’ proposed ordinance now heads to the full council for consideration, where it will require two passages.

During his remarks to the crowd, the Providence-born Knight gestured several times at the bay visible outside and noted his love of the Ocean State. 
“They don’t make prettier postcards,” Knight said. “Rhode Island is a special place. And it needs an attorney general who can stand up and protect it from criminals and bad actors, whether they are found on the street corner or in the boardroom or in the White House. … I am here tonight to say I am that guy in 2026.”
Speakman told the crowd that Knight can often “speak truth to power,” and that she relies on the Navy veteran — who served eight years as a nuclear power operator — to shape her own political reasoning.
“I call him in the morning when we have a big bill to vote on at night, and I say, ‘I know how I’m going to vote. Here’s why,’” Speakman recounted. “And then he carefully and clearly explains to me why my position on the bill is wrong.”
“He cites sources. He sends me citations I read for the next three hours, and understand, of course, that he was correct, and he saved me from a bad vote.”
Knight, who worked as a special assistant attorney under Attorney General Patrick Lynch from 2006 to 2010 before opening his own practice as a criminal defense attorney, cited his recent legislative wins as proof of his mettle. He was the lead sponsor on the state’s semiautomatic weapons ban which won General Assembly approval in June.
“After July of 2026, you will not be able to buy an AR-15 in this state,” Knight said. 
Anticipated field of AG candidates includes two Democrats so far with another in the wings

Knight enters a Democratic primary that already includes Keith Hoffmann, who worked as the chief of policy and senior counsel under Neronha. Hoffmann left the AG’s office in August and formally launched his campaign on Sept. 30 — a bid reinforced by the support of Neronha. 
Neronha, who is term-limited, said recently he will not seek governorship or any other public office after his term ends in 2026. 
Knight had $90,419.25 in his campaign account as of the most recent filing from the end of June. Hoffmann’s campaign announced Monday that his account has raised $210,000 since he entered the race.
The contest to become AG has already lost one candidate. On Oct. 2, Rep. Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, exited the race only four days after announcing his campaign, when past allegations of domestic violence were brought to light. The aftermath rippled further out Monday, with Craven announcing he will not seek reelection as a state representative in 2026. Craven also relinquished his post as chair of the Committee on Judiciary, among the House’s most powerful lawmaking panels.
So far, as of Monday, no Republicans have formally announced their campaigns for Attorney General. 
The primary is scheduled for September 2026, and the general election is slated for Nov. 3, 2026.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9538-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 21:56:38.991532

A procedural order issued Monday vacates a prior ruling from a three-judge panel that declared the law unconstitutional.
The Louisiana Legislature and Gov. Jeff Landry approved the measure in 2024, and it was set to take effect at the start of this year until a group of parents filed suit against the state. A federal district court put enforcement on hold in the plaintiffs’ respective parishes while the case made its way through court.
On June 20, a 5th Circuit panel ruled that the law violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which bars the government from endorsing a religion or creating laws that favor one religion over another. Judge Irma Castillo Ramirez, who former President Joe Biden appointed to the appellate court, wrote the opinion. Judges James Dennis, a Bill Clinton appointee, and Catharina Haynes, who George W. Bush chose for the court, affirmed the decision.
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, who is defending the case, said at the time she intended to seek an en banc hearing on the case from all 17 appellate court judges – and appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.  
“Glad to see the Fifth Circuit is taking this en banc,” Murrill said in a statement Monday. “Looking forward to those arguments in court.”
The plaintiffs consist of nine families with children who attend public schools across five parishes — East Baton Rouge, Livingston, Orleans, St. Tammany and Vernon. They represent a  range of religious and non-religious beliefs, including Catholics, Presbyterians, Jews, Unitarians and others. They have argued the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments the Legislature adopted differs from the versions they follow.
Lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State are representing the plaintiffs.
Through Americans United, the plaintiffs issued a joint response Monday evening in response to the 5th Circuit’s latest order.
“The panel’s unanimous ruling last June was well reasoned and correctly followed binding Supreme Court precedent. We believe there is no reason to revisit it,” the statement reads. “Nevertheless, we look forward to presenting our clients’ case to the entire court of appeals, and we remain confident that the constitutional values and principles at the heart of the First Amendment, which guarantee religious freedom for all students and families, will prevail in the end.”
A date for the full 5th Circuit hearing has not been set.
Gov. Landry has been among the most ardent supporters of the law that calls for 11-inch by 14-inch posters of the Ten Commandments to be placed in every classroom. Schools do not have to spend their own money to acquire the posters, but they can accept donated versions.
“I can’t wait to be sued,” Landry told the crowd at a Republican fundraiser in Tennessee after signing the law.
When asked later about students who don’t have Judeo-Christian beliefs, the governor said they shouldn’t look at the posters.
“I think we’ve forgotten in this country that democracy actually means majority rule,” Landry said at the time

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Shortly after the Utah Legislature voted Monday to pick its preferred congressional map to submit to a judge in Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that has successfully challenged the state’s last congressional map also met their deadline to submit their preferred maps to the courts. 
Utah redistricting committee picks congressional map supported by Republican party

The plaintiffs — the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, the Campaign Legal Center and several Salt Lake County voters — announced they had submitted two maps for 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson to consider as alternatives to lawmakers’ map C, which the Utah Republican Party urged members to support in an email last week. 
“These maps were submitted because the map enacted by the Legislature … fails to abide by and conform to Proposition 4’s requirements,” the announcement issued by the Campaign Legal Center said. 
Proposition 4 is the 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative that has since been reinstated as law by the courts after Gibson ruled lawmakers overstepped their constitutional authority when they repealed and replaced it with a law that turned an independent redistricting commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ignore. That ruling also voided the state’s congressional boundaries last drawn in 2021, deeming them the result of an unconstitutional process.

Plaintiffs’ proposed maps
The redistricting lawsuit’s plaintiffs have proposed two maps: Map 1 and Map 2. 
Map 1, they said, “comes from a set of 10,000 maps generated by a computer algorithm designed to comply with Proposition 4’s priority-ordered redistricting criteria without considering partisan data.” It splits only one city and “has a significant population overlap” with the Orange and Purple maps proposed by the Independent Redistricting Commission in 2018. 
Plaintiffs described Map 2 as a “least change” map based on the Legislature’s adopted map C but with “changes made to correct its failures to conform to Proposition 4’s requirements.” 
“In particular, it corrects the enacted map’s failure to minimize municipal and county splits to the greatest extent practicable and the enacted map’s failure to comply with Proposition 4’s prohibition on party favoritism,” the plaintiffs said, adding that Map 2 only splits one city with an average of 84.1% population overlap with the Legislature’s map. 
In a court filing submitted to the court Monday, plaintiffs’ attorneys said maps 1 and 2 are “contiguous, preserve communities of interest, and follow natural and geographic boundaries as required by Proposition 4.”

“Neither map purposefully nor unduly favors or disfavors any political party, as Plaintiffs will demonstrate in their forthcoming brief and expert reports,” they wrote in the court filing.

Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process is far from over. 
The judge has given plaintiffs and legislative attorneys until Oct. 17 to file briefs, expert reports and other materials in support or opposition to map submissions, if necessary, to help inform her decision. 
Then, on Oct. 23 and Oct. 24, the court could hold an evidentiary hearing, if needed. 
Nov. 10 marks the latest possible date for the court to select a final map in time for the 2026 elections, according to the office of the lieutenant governor, who is the state’s top election official. 
Meanwhile, Republican legislative leaders have vowed to continue to fight Gibson’s ruling in court — up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.

Claire Celsi, D-West Des Moines, died Monday, according to a social media post from her daughter and statements from lawmakers.
Celsi, 59, entered hospice care Sept. 18 and was no longer seeking curative treatment, according to her family. She had been battling an undisclosed medical issue for several months. She returned to the 2025 legislative session following a surgery in April after having missed more than a month of votes. Further details about her medical condition have not been released.
Iowa Democratic leaders issued statements mourning Celsi’s passing Monday, thanking her for her service to the state. Celsi was first elected in 2018 to the state Senate and won reelection in 2022 representing Iowa Senate District 16. She served as a Senate Democratic assistant leader in 2024 and as ranking member of the Senate Government Oversight Committee in the 2025 session.
Iowa Senate Democratic Leader Janice Weiner said she admired Celsi’s “perseverance and determination to continue to serve her constituents and to be present at the Capitol” as she dealt with health challenges this year.
“I cannot begin to express how deeply saddened I am by the passing of our senate colleague and my good friend Claire Celsi,” Weiner said. “In her private and public life, Senator Celsi was a fearless advocate and truthteller for women, the elderly, and public education. Improving the quality of life for Iowans in nursing homes became her signature issue. Claire was an advocate for the vulnerable and voice for the voiceless, representing thousands of Iowans who felt forgotten by the political process. She often told me it was both her honor and her passion to serve in the Iowa Senate.”
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart issued a statement saying her thoughts are with Celsi’s family, friends and loved ones, saying she was a “fierce advocate” for worker protections, public education, water quality and mental health care in the Legislature.
House Minority Leader Brian Meyer also praised Celsi as “a tireless public servant who worked tirelessly for the people of her district and the state of Iowa.”
“As we mourn the loss of a dedicated leader, we also resolve to carry forward the causes she held dear,” Meyer said in a statement. “Our hearts and deepest sympathies are with her family, friends, and all whose lives she touched.”

“The hospital may be at risk of a sudden solvency crisis, which would potentially harm its community and the statewide system of care,” Vermont regulators wrote in a recent budget decision.

BRATTLEBORO — Brattleboro Memorial Hospital CEO Christopher Dougherty is on a leave of absence as state regulators express fears about the not-for-profit’s fiscal health.
“Stated as directly as possible, we are deeply concerned about BMH’s solvency,” the Green Mountain Care Board wrote in a recent budget decision. “We believe that its leadership must make big strides to adjust course.”
The 500-employee hospital named Dougherty as its chief executive officer in the spring of 2022. Two days after the state’s Oct. 1 report, the hospital announced internally that he was taking leave.

“Please be assured the board of directors remains fully committed to keeping the hospital open and continuing to serve the community,” the hospital emailed its staff Friday afternoon.
Dougherty, who started at the hospital in May 2022 after leading Shriners for Children Medical Center in Pasadena, California, hasn’t addressed his leave publicly and couldn’t be reached for comment.
On Monday night, the board announced the appointment of doctors Elizabeth McLarney and Tony Blofson as acting co-CEOs.
“They have a firm grasp of the hospital’s day-to-day operational needs and a solid understanding of our regulatory challenges,” the board said in its Monday statement.
The hospital, one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers, revealed in May it faced a projected $4 million shortfall in its $119 million annual budget upon the close of its fiscal year Sept. 30. In response, it implemented a hiring freeze and let go of six administrators in hopes of lowering its staff count by at least 30 employees.
Neither the hospital nor regulators could say Monday if Brattleboro had met its budget target. In its Oct. 1 budget decision, the state noted the uncertainty was, in part, because “missing, incomplete and inaccurate information makes it challenging to understand BMH’s current financial position.”
“We are deeply troubled by the quality of BMH’s budget submission and its reporting because the hospital may be at risk of a sudden solvency crisis, which would potentially harm its community and the state-wide system of care,” regulators wrote.
“We have a duty to establish hospital budgets that, among other items, ensure the economic operations of the hospital, preserve access and quality, and contain costs at BMH and the statewide health system,” regulators continued. “We cannot fulfill this duty when a hospital misrepresents its financial data and then refuses to address its errors.”
In response, the state reduced Brattleboro’s requested 1.7% rise in net patient revenue for the current fiscal year to 0% and its requested 3% rise in commercial health insurance reimbursements to not more than 2.4%.
Regulators also are requiring the hospital to resubmit its current budget plan and “corrected and accurate” operating results for the past two fiscal years by Jan. 31 or face outside intervention.
“If these resubmissions remain inaccurate,” they wrote, “we may hold a separate hearing to consider whether to appoint an independent observer for BMH.”
Acting co-CEOs McLarney, an orthopaedic surgeon, and Blofson, a primary care physician, have 50 years of combined service at the hospital.
“We are honored to serve side-by-side and together with our board, our executive leadership team, and our dedicated staff to help BMH move forward and continue providing the exceptional care our patients and community have come to rely on,” they said in a joint statement.

Gary Stubblefield by six months, alleging the current schedule prevents District 26 voters from having a voice during the 2026 fiscal session.
The lawsuit, which attorney Jennifer Waymack Standerfer filed in Pulaski County Circuit Court on behalf of Colt Shelby of Cecil, seeks an injunction and an order declaring Stubblefield’s seat must be filled within 150 days of his death. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester are the defendants.
“We look forward to a full victory,” Jester said in a statement provided by his spokesperson.
Shelby v Sanders Complaint 20251006
 
The complaint requests a judge hold a hearing within seven days. Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Patricia James was assigned to the case.
“The General Assembly will officially convene and begin the 2026 Fiscal Session on April 8, 2026, where it will determine how to spend billions of dollars of taxpayer money and set the state budget for the upcoming fiscal year,” the complaint says. “The Governor’s designated election schedule prevents the people of Senate District 26 from having representation at the 2026 Fiscal Session.”
District 26 includes parts of Franklin County where the state has proposed building a new prison. During the fiscal session that starts in April, lawmakers are likely to vote on funding for the controversial project, which is expected to cost $825 million, according to preliminary estimates. Many locals living near the site are staunchly opposed to the prison, and an appropriations bill for the project failed five times during the 2025 legislative session.
Arkansas law requires governors to call a special election to fill a vacant legislative seat within 150 days, unless they find it impractical or too burdensome to do so. Jan. 30 would be 150 days from Stubblefield’s death; Feb. 12 would be 150 days from Sanders’ declaration of a vacancy.
The petition asks the judge to declare that Stubblefield’s seat must be filled by the 150-day mark and to issue an order to hold the special election on Dec. 9. It is currently set for June 9, 2026 — 279 days after Stubblefield died. The special election was originally scheduled for Nov. 3, 2026, or 436 days after the vacancy.
Prior to the District 26 special election, no special election since 2011 happened more than four to five weeks after the 150-day mark, according to an unpublished memo from the Arkansas Senate’s legal counsel that was obtained by the Advocate.
After resistance, Sanders revises election date to fill vacant Arkansas Senate seat

Sanders said on Sept. 26 that she set the special election dates to coincide with next year’s midterm elections “to save taxpayer money,” streamline the election process and maximize voter turnout. She revised the schedule later that day to its current dates after bipartisan outcry.
“Following conversations with election officials, the Governor decided that holding the primary for District 26 on the statewide primary date and holding the special election on the soonest possible date afterward saves taxpayer dollars and ensures the election is free, fair, and secure,” Sanders’ spokesperson said Monday.
The special primary election currently coincides with the midterm primaries on March 31, 2025. According to the Secretary of State’s office, the state stands to save roughly $20,000 by holding part of the election alongside the regular midterms, and would have saved between $41,000 and $55,000 had the original November special election date gone forward.
But even with the revised schedule, Sanders has caught flak from Stubblefield’s daughter, Amber Sullivan; Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest; the Republican candidates to replace Stubblefield; and opponents of the planned prison.
In a phone interview with the Advocate Monday, Shelby said it seemed as though Sanders was “undermining the voting rights of the people in our district.”
“We’ve got to resolve this and ensure our voices are heard,” he said.
While the prison votes are important, Shelby said District 26 voters need to have a voice on other important issues, such as school voucher money and child care funding. Shelby said he spoke to “every single one” of the declared candidates, and that they were ready to go as well.
“We need someone in there before the budget session comes,” he said. “I think all of the candidates are ready. … They were prepared to go early on. So there’s no reason why we should hold this election in June.”
Three Republicans have announced their intent to run — Ted Tritt and Brad Simon of Paris and former state Rep. Mark Berry of Ozark. No Democrats have entered the race so far.
Adam Watson, director of Gravel and Grit and an opponent of the Franklin County prison project, voiced support for Shelby’s lawsuit.
“We’re glad to see action taken to cure such an egregious act of disregard for the constitutional rights of every citizen of SD26,” Watson said in a text message. “The Governor’s actions surrounding the prison, potential ICE facility, and now the district’s right to representation will all set a dangerous precedent for governance by executive force if left unchecked.”

The Fightin’ Blue Hens (3-2, 1-1 CUSA) kicked off their new conference slate with a victory over Florida International University, but what challenges remain in their FBS debut?
The University of Delaware’s foray into FBS football and Conference USA has started off well. The Fightin’ Blue Hens began the year with a victory over Delaware State, 35-17, but followed that with a road trip against Colorado that ended in a 24-point defeat. Since then, UD’s won two of their last three games.
The Blue Hens are in fourth place in the Conference USA standings with an early 1-1 conference record. The Blue Hens are second in the conference in scoring offense averaging just under 30 points per game through their first five. Their defense sits in the middle of the pack allowing a tad over 26 points per game.
UD has seven more games on its schedule. All but one of those contests are against CUSA schools — Wake Forest is the only non-conference opponent left on the schedule — meaning the Blue Hens will get to know their new conference foes well over the next two months. 
Let’s take a quick look at what’s in store for UD as it embarks on the bulk of its Conference USA slate.
Jacksonville State: UD at Jacksonville State on October 15
The Gamecocks are in their first season under new head coach Charles Kelly following a CUSA championship a year ago. 
It’s been an up and down start to the Kelly era. Jax State lost its first game of the season in a road battle against UCF, but bounced back the following week for its first win against Liberty. Since then, the Gamecocks have lost two of their last three.
Jacksonville State is led by its defense that allows under 400 total yards to opponents. The Gamecocks are fourth in CUSA with ten sacks and sixth in fumbles forced. The Gamecocks offense leads the conference with over 260 rushing yards per game to go along with 15 rushing touchdowns.  
The two teams have only played each other once before. The Blue Hens won that matchup by a touchdown.
Middle Tennessee State University: vs UD on October 22
The Blue Raiders are off to a similarly disappointing start as they had last season. MTSU is 1-4 with its lone win coming on the road against Nevada. The Blue Raiders are 0-1 in CUSA action after beginning their conference slate with a road loss against Kennesaw State.
Middle Tennessee has yet to score over 30 points this season and its red zone defense ranks second to last in CUSA. Opposing teams have scored on 14 out of 15 attempts in the red zone against the Blue Raiders, 12 of them touchdowns. 
These two teams haven’t faced each other since the late 1970s. UD is 2-0 all time.
Liberty University: UD at Liberty on November 1
Liberty is the closest member of CUSA to UD (geographically). The Flames are 1-4 this season with one defeat in conference play at the hands of Jacksonville State. Liberty is in the midst of a four game losing streak since beginning its season with a victory over Maine. 
The Flames offense has been held under 20 points in their last three games, although their defense is fifth in CUSA allowing under 24 points per game. The Flames’ defense is the best in CUSA against the pass allowing under 170 air yards and under 56 percent of passes to be completed through their first five games.
Louisiana Tech University: vs UD on November 8
The Bulldogs are second in the CUSA standings with an overall record of 4-1 and two conference victories. LA Tech’s lone loss of the year was an in-state battle against then ranked No. 3 LSU. Following the loss, the Bulldogs rattled off three straight wins scoring 30 or more points in each contest.
Louisiana Tech’s defense is first in CUSA with 11 interceptions on the year. Three of those takeaways were returned for touchdowns. The Bulldogs are also third in the conference with five forced fumbles this season. 
Linebacker Mekhi Mason is a player to watch on the Bulldog defense. The redshirt junior is second in the conference in tackles for loss and fourth with three sacks on the season.
UD has only faced LA Tech once before in 1982 when the Blue Hens traveled to Louisiana and departed with a 17-0 victory.
Sam Houston State University: UD at Sam Houston on November 15
The Bearkats are the only team in Conference USA without a win on the season. They’ve had to endure a tough early season schedule playing Western Kentucky to begin the season, No. 8 Texas and New Mexico State in their last game. 
Sam Houston owns the conference’s worst scoring offense (15 ppg) and scoring defense (allowing 41.6 ppg). Redshirt senior Emon Allen is a bright spot on the Bearkat defense with two interceptions this season which is second in the conference.
The University of Texas at El Paso: vs UD on November 29
The Blue Hens will finish the regular season at home against their final CUSA foe, the UTEP Miners. UTEP is 1-4 this season with a conference loss to LA Tech in its last game.
The Miners stand in the middle of the pack in both scoring offense and scoring defense. UTEP’s offense relies mostly on the pass ranking ninth in the conference in rushing offense. The Miners’ defense is first in the conference with 15 sacks this season. Redshirt senior Udoka Ezeani leads the conference with four.

Joe Lombardo. (Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Gov. Joe Lombardo on Monday announced he plans to call the Nevada State Legislature into a special session “at some point over the next few months.”
His two-sentence statement did not include a timeline beyond that, nor did it identify what topics would be considered during the special session.
“The goal will be to finish what the Legislature left unfinished — plain and simple,” Lombardo’s statement read.
Governors in recent years have not provided much advance notice of special sessions, often officially announcing them just days in advance after weeks of rumors and speculation. But two recent vacancies in the Nevada State Assembly may have forced the early public acknowledgement.
Republican Assemblymember Toby Yurek, who represents part of Clark County, resigned last week, saying in a statement he will instead serve the state in a new role. Lombardo in the same announcement said Yurek would serve as policy advisor and as a member of a statewide finance committee.
Republican Assemblymember Ken Gray, who represents part of Douglas and Lyon counties, resigned in August to accept an appointment to the National Cemetery Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
In Nevada, vacancies in the state Legislature are filled by county commissions, but only if the Legislature is expected to convene before the next public election.
Both vacant Assembly seats will be on the ballot next year. The next regular legislative session isn’t until 2027.
By publicly announcing there will be a special session, Lombardo has effectively triggered commissions to fill the vacancies. The Clark County Commission will now need to appoint someone to fill Yurek’s Assembly District 19 vacancy.. Gray’s Assembly District 39 vacancy will be filled by an appointment jointly made by the Douglas and Lyon county commissions.
By state law, their replacements must be members of the same political party.
Special sessions are limited by law to issues included in its proclamation.
Lombardo has previously said the failed film tax credit expansion bill and his crime bill from the regular session earlier this year may reemerge in a special session. Democratic legislative leaders have publicly stated they want to address the financial impact of Trump policies, specifically on programs like Medicaid, as well as issues like the recent cyberattack on the state government.
Jokes about an inevitable special session were commonplace in the waning days of this year’s regular session. November has been the rumored month, though the governor’s office and legislative leaders have only confirmed that discussions are ongoing.
Legislators and statewide elected officials like the governor and attorney general are prohibited from soliciting or accepting campaign contributions in the 15 days before and the 15 days after a special session. If a special session proclamation is issued with less than 15 days notice, the ban on soliciting donations begins immediately.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lombardo-stos-bednarski-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 19:57:52.831464

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star).State lawmakers are considering changing the legal definitions of child abuse and neglect to avoid prosecuting people who allow children in their care to engage in certain activities independently. 
Supporters say the proposal could help prevent overreach by child protective services, which disproportionately affects working and non-white families. 
The measure would amend child abuse and neglect definitions to clarify that parents or guardians must have shown willful or reckless disregard for obvious danger.
It also specifies that it is legal to let children do things alone such as play outside, babysit and go to and from school, the store or recreation facilities.

Families are currently penalized for exactly that, according to Mariel Mussack, staff attorney at the unemployment unit and youth justice project with Community Legal Services of Philadelphia. 
Mussack said clients of hers and others at CLS have suffered severe consequences from dealing with investigations stemming from what many would regard as routine situations.
“These incidents obviously can disrupt a family’s entire life and lead to lifelong consequences for parents related to their housing, their employment and their rights to parent their children. In addition, the time and cost of litigation for parents to defend themselves in these proceedings, even where they are successful in the end, can be so exorbitant,” Mussack said. “And even where a CPS investigation results in an unfounded report, the trauma to the family can be very extensive.”

Mussack recalled a client who left her one-year-old daughter briefly in the care of her 13-year-old son and, despite the children being fine, ultimately had to fight child abuse accusations. Mussack noted the Red Cross in Pennsylvania offers babysitting training to kids 11 and older.  
She and her client eventually prevailed. But in the interim, the single mother landed on a child abuse registry – making it hard for her to find work as a home health aide. 
Stories like that lead to many parents feeling afraid to let their kids do things independently “that would have been seen as completely normal in the past,” Mussack testified during a hearing before the House Children and Youth Committee Monday. 
Minority Chairwoman Kate Klunk (R-York) recalled her own experiences babysitting as a 13-year-old. She said Mussack’s anecdote was “appalling.”
“We live in a society where we ultimately are bubble wrapping our kids for the sake of additional bubble wrap, and it’s not actually helping them in any way,” Klunk said. “It’s actually suffocating them. And so we need to rip off that bubble wrap, let our kids be kids. Let our parents be parents.”

Committee Chair Jeanne McNeill (D-Lehigh) is sponsoring the bill along with representatives Rick Krajewski (D-Philadelphia) and Dave Zimmerman (R-Berks/Lehigh).
“These simple activities, you know, like kids playing outside, walking a sibling to school or being home alone should not be treated as neglect or endangerment,” said Krajewski, who recalled doing just that after school as a kid while his mother was working. “Merely allowing a child to be outside of constant supervision by an adult has led to frivolous Child Protection investigations, traumatizing children and families, and contributing to a climate of fear in our communities.”
There’s no timeline for the committee to consider the bill for an initial vote. 
Community Legal Services developed the bill with Let Grow, an advocacy organization co-founded by Free-Range Kids author Lenore Skenazy and Boston College Professor Peter Gray behind similar legislation in other states.

If Cox signs the bill, the governor will have the power to appoint the chief justice, but this time, instead of going through the selection process every four years, the role will be subject to a single, eight-year term.

The House also approved it with a 58-15 margin with all Democrats and Kearns Republican Rep. Anthony Loubet voting nay. The proposal now heads to Cox’s desk for his signature.

“The governor has agreed to a compromise, which extends by four years the term that the chief justice can serve,” House Majority Leader Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, said on the House floor. 
The appointment would mirror the process used by the U.S. Supreme Court, with the executive nominating the chief justice and the Senate confirming, Snider said.
Like during the general session, Sandy Democratic Rep. Andrew Stoddard unsuccessfully attempted to make the Supreme Court justices elect the Senate president and speaker of the House.

“To use a phrase that I repeatedly tell my kids, just because we can, does not mean that we should,” Stoddard said. “So this keeps that balance going and gets the power back to both branches.”
Ultimately, Stoddard said, his opposition to the bill was about having “a truly independent judiciary.”
“These justices are already confirmed by the Legislature. The Senate gets to give input on them, appointed by the governor. They’ve already gone through this process,” Stoddard said. “I think by requiring another layer to pick the chief justice, we’re just submitting them to more political pressure.”



Let us know what you think...


 


The original proposal was part of a judicial reform series of bills Republican legislators sponsored during this year’s general session after publicly disagreeing with two major rulings from the high court — an opinion favoring plaintiffs in an anti-gerrymanding lawsuit challenging the Legislature’s 2021 redistricting process, and a ruling upholding a district court decision to block a nearly-total ban of abortions in the state while it is adjudicated.
Lawmakers argued the changes weren’t in retaliation for the decisions, but were efforts to make the judicial system more transparent and responsive to the people. 
Cox vetoes bill that would have given governor power over appointing Utah chief justice

After weeks of contention, Legislative leaders and the judiciary reached an agreement, killing most of the proposed bills, but keeping the bill changing the chief justice’s selection. 
In his veto letter, Cox said no one from the judicial branch had asked for the veto, and while the prospect of having more power over the Utah Supreme Court was tempting, he remained skeptical on the reappointment process, which he described as “a very meaningful and problematic additional step.”
“The Bar reaffirms its commitment to the rule of law and to an independent, impartial judiciary as essential to public trust in our system of justice,” the Utah State Bar said in a statement after the 
Monday votes. “Each branch of government has distinct constitutional responsibilities, and the judiciary must remain free to exercise its duties without undue influence or political pressure.”  
Lawmakers also approved other bills during the special session, making technical changes to streamline code, and tackling issues like berm management of the Great Salt Lake amid its alarming low levels; and modifications to election records law.

The election records amendment bill sponsored by Rep. Norman Thurston, R-Provo, defines election records that may not be destroyed for at least 22 months in case of questions or contests to results. It also increases transparency, Thurston said.
Now, election officials will be required to post a cast vote record report detailing how the tabulating equipment tallies every vote. 
“Think of a gigantic spreadsheet where every row is a ballot, and then it just has some sort of a non-traceable serial number was counted for X person, Y person,” Thurston explained. With that document, anyone can add up ballots and make their own audits, he added.
The bill also will limit access to video records from cameras near drop boxes to people with a legitimate need to watch them.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Pennsylvania’s prime location, amid the nation’s largest population centers, made it an important hub for warehouses to distribute consumer goods. Hundreds sprung up along interstate highways in the last decade. 
Those sprawling structures, some larger than 1 million square feet, could play a role in answering the commonwealth’s demand for renewable energy over the next decade.
Legislation under consideration in the state House Energy Committee would require new warehouses to be wired for solar panel installations and allow local governments to offer tax incentives to retrofit existing warehouses.
“We’re building warehouses along the corridors,” Pennsylvania State Building & Construction Trades Council President Robert Bair said in a hearing on the bill Monday. “We’re employing a lot of people in those jobs, but we have a lot of roof space just sitting there doing nothing, so we can put it to use now.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Energy demand in the 13-state region that shares Pennsylvania’s power grid is forecast to skyrocket nearly 20% by 2035, according to PJM Interconnection, which manages the supply of electricity.
While long-range predictions call for new nuclear power plants to satisfy much of the demand and natural gas-fired plants to sustain the load until new technology comes online, solar energy will be critical, said Patrick McDonnell, president and CEO of PennFuture, a clean energy and environmental advocacy group.
Concerns about the reliability of natural gas generation were raised after winter storm Elliott froze supplies in December 2023 and contributed to surging electricity prices this summer that caused bills for some customers to leap by 10% to 30%.
“Diversification of the portfolio is critical in order for us to drive down those prices,” McDonnell said, adding that new standards for warehouse construction would ensure an opportunity to use their multi-acre roofs as sites for solar generation.
The bill is sponsored by Rep. Joshua Siegel (D-Lehigh), whose district is a hot spot for warehouse development. It would require new warehouses to be built with roof structures designed to carry the additional weight of solar panels. The measure would also require conduits for the electrical wiring and space for equipment to connect the panels to the grid to be included in the designs. 
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, which would enforce the legislation, would have the authority to grant waivers for projects where the installation of solar panels is unfeasible. 
And local taxing authorities, such as townships, counties and school districts, would have authority to grant tax exemptions or special tax provisions to offset the increase in value of warehouses retrofitted to allow solar installations.
“Commercial rooftop solar is a great example of environmentally beneficial land use,” said Victoria Moroney, director of market development for ForeFront Power, which develops solar and storage projects in the United States and Mexico.
She added the use of warehouse roofs for solar energy puts generation close to electricity users and benefits ratepayers because it reduces the construction of new transmission infrastructure associated with new energy sources.

“It’s not that any of these requirements are overly cumbersome or expensive,” Moroney said. “It’s just that warehouse developers don’t have this in mind when they’re developing their facilities, and that’s completely understandable.”
Energy Committee Chairperson Elizabeth Fiedler (D-Philadelphia) said New Jersey passed a law requiring warehouses larger than 100,000 square feet to be built ready for solar installations starting in 2022. 
“The trade association for commercial developers in New Jersey explained that, in fact, warehouses with solar ready roofs are easier to lease than those that lack solar preparation, and this is part of the reason they supported it,” Fiedler said.
Rep. Martin Causer (R-McKean), the ranking Republican committee member, said he has concerns about making the new construction standards mandatory.
Is the sun setting on Pennsylvania’s solar future?

“That’s sort of a new level of government involvement, because this is private property. What if the owner doesn’t want to be solar ready? Isn’t that their right to not be solar ready?” he asked.
Bair said the legislation would be subject to discussion and amendments and that providing incentives to build to accommodate solar would be another option. But he said solar power is the fastest way to increase supply.
“I don’t like the government in my business,” Bair said. ”But I also understand that with our grid needs, solar is the most rapidly deployable excess energy we can put on right now.”
Rep. Paul Friel (D-Chester) compared the design requirements to any building code, such as accessibility or fire safety requirements. “It’s all saying there’s some public policy good that goes into that building code that benefits us as a society,” Friel said, adding that such mandates should come with a return on investment for the owner. 
He asked what additional government action would be required to ensure warehouse owners would be able to sell solar energy produced on their rooftops.
“I don’t think it’s fair to increase cost, but not guarantee I have a market in place,” Friel said.
Moroney said warehouse owners would be able to contract with a solar power developer to design and construct installations on their rooftops. Where the warehouse itself has a demand for the power produced, the owner would have the option to enter a power purchase agreement to pay a set price for the energy and reduce uncertainty about energy costs. 
In a scenario where the warehouse does not have sufficient energy demand to use all of the power, owners could make use of options such as virtual net metering. That’s where energy produced by a solar project is sold at a discount to subscribers elsewhere in the community. But, it would require additional legislation, Moroney said.
A bill to create a community solar option for consumers who can’t put solar panels on their own rooftops passed in the House last year but wasn’t considered in the Senate.
“It doesn’t exactly exist in Pennsylvania right now,” Moroney said. “So creating programs that enable options for these developers is going to be really important, because no, no warehouse is the same.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-panels-california-1024x715.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 18:56:55.785058

Sam Creekmore, the Republican House Public Health and Human Services chairman from New Albany, said he believes all opioid settlement money cities and counties are receiving should be for mental health.","One of the state’s two top public health lawmakers told Mississippi Today he plans to take legislative action to ensure cities and counties spend opioid settlement money on addressing mental health, an issue he said was brought to light by the newsroom’s recent investigation. 
In September, Mississippi Today revealed that of the over $15.5 million dollars local governments have received from corporations that helped catalyze an addiction epidemic that’s killed over 10,000 Mississippians, less than $1 million had been used to prevent more deaths. Spending on other purposes is allowed because Attorney General Lynn Fitch wrote a contract in 2021 that says towns, cities and counties can spend their settlement shares on any public purpose and don’t have to report what they do with the money.  
Communities across the state are expected to get an additional nearly $48 million over the next 15 years, according to the settlements and press releases from the Attorney General’s Office. Unlike Fitch, Rep. Sam Creekmore, the Republican House Public Health and Human Services chairman from New Albany, said he believes all opioid settlement money cities and counties are receiving should be for mental health. 
He said the comments on Mississippi Today’s “The Other Side” podcast, in which he also advocated for $5 million from separate state opioid settlement funds to research the addiction treatment potentials of the psychedelic drug ibogaine.
“They need to spend it, spend that money on abatement for opioid addiction, PTSD, TBI (traumatic brain injuries),” he said on the podcast. “And they need to be spending it now.”
Sen. Hob Bryan, the Democrat Senate Public Health and Welfare chair from Amory, said he would want to see this particular legislation before endorsing it. But in general, he said he supports Creekmore’s efforts to help local governments spend settlement money to address the crisis.

Attorneys general and legislatures in some states have provided this type of guidance on settlement spending for their towns, cities and counties. Tricia Christensen, a Tennessee consultant who advises states on how to spend opioid settlement money to prevent more overdoses, said in August these types of guides are effective at encouraging local governments to address addiction. 
She said North Carolina’s version, a series of 90 detailed frequently asked questions, provides direct steps for how any local government could spend money for treatment, recovery and prevention. 
“That’s really clear guidance for folks,” she said. 
Fitch did not respond to a question Mississippi Today sent her in August asking whether she would consider creating these types of suggested guidelines. In a statement, her Chief of Staff Michelle Williams said the opioid lawsuits allow for some of states’ settlement money to be used for any public purpose, a “reimbursement” for the hundreds of billions of dollars American governments spent on the crisis throughout the 2000s and 2010s. 
Creekmore also said he would consider proposing a law that requires local governments to publicly report how they spend their settlement dollars. Maine passed a similar bill in May after years of local governments spending their money with minimal public reporting.  
Mississippi Today published some amount of city and county settlement spending information from all but one of the 147 local governments receiving money in its investigation, but the data is only current to the summer. Required public reporting for local settlement spending could reveal which localities have changed their plans since then. 
While local government leaders are the only people who are spending Mississippi’s opioid settlement money right now, the state Legislature controls the majority of the funds, which an August record from Fitch’s office shows was around $89 million after attorneys fees. Creekmore is helping to oversee most of that money through his role on the state’s Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council. 
The council was only established this year despite receiving these funds periodically since 2022, and the Legislature will only start distributing money for overdose prevention when the next fiscal year starts in July 2026. The delay is a big reason why Mississippi has spent less settlement money for abatement than every other state, both in terms of share percentage and total dollars.
Bryan said as Mississippi lawmakers use state and local settlement dollars, he would like to see a more comprehensive plan to address addiction — starting with knowing what Mississippi’s addiction response needs are. 
Then, he said, he and other decision makers could know whether they should be focused on connecting people in recovery with jobs, expanding in-patient treatment services, supporting the Department of Mental Health’s response efforts or investing in other efforts. 
“The problems of addiction don’t stop at city limits or county lines. It’s a state problem,” he said “To me, it works better if all the money is spent in some sort of coordinated fashion.” 
Creekmore said he spent the week reviewing state opioid settlement applications to help end the addiction crisis, but getting to that point took longer than he intended when Mississippi received its first check. He and his fellow lawmakers have a responsibility to act quickly and effectively with the money to address a crisis that has led to the untimely deaths of Mississippians and grief from their loved ones, Creekmore said.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said harvest was “in full swing” in the IDALS release and corn and soybean farmers said their harvests are ahead of schedule because of the weather conditions.
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, temperatures for the Sept. 29 through Oct. 5 reporting period were 12 to 16 degrees Fahrenheit above the climatological normal. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Glisan also said rainfall was “sparse” over the period, with the weekly average rainfall below a measurable amount. 
Despite what farmers described as dry conditions, the majority of Iowa is not experiencing any drought conditions, according to the latest report from the U.S. Drought Monitor. Overall, 30% of Iowa was in “abnormally dry” conditions. 
Randy Miller, a farmer and Iowa Soybean Association member based near Lacona, said precipitation early Monday morning slowed his harvest efforts. But Miller welcomed the rain and said it was “too dry for comfort” to be out in a hot combine as temperatures the past week have neared 90 degrees. 
Miller said his combines have been “smoldering” and there have been reports of neighbors and other farmers across the state dealing with combine fires due to the dry stalks and hot weather. 
“So hopefully the temperatures will cool off, this moisture will soak back up some of that, and it’ll be a more traditional harvest,” Miller said. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service ordinarily compiles harvest data in its weekly crop progress and condition reports, but the office is not publishing reports during the current government shutdown. 
Miller said Monday that on his farm, about 25% of his corn has been harvested and nearly half of his soybeans are harvested. Miller said that is ahead of schedule, considering he normally begins harvesting soybeans on Oct. 1. 
“We cut beans for however long it takes to cut all our beans, and then we pick corn,” Miller said. “So we’ve already picked corn and we’ve got half our beans cut the 5th of October, I would say harvest is rolling right along.” 
Miller said he started harvesting corn earlier than normal this year because it reached its optimal moisture levels sooner than usual. Miller said the farms around him are harvesting at a similar pace. 
Will Cannon, an Iowa Corn Growers Association board member and farmer near Newton, said he also started harvesting corn a “little ahead” of his typical schedule this year. 
Cannon said he started early in part because of disease pressure. Sections of his corn were hit with Southern corn rust, a disease that occasionally makes its way up to Iowa when weather patterns are just right, and tar spot, which can take off under wet conditions like Iowa saw in July. 
Cannon said this was the worst corn rust pressure he has experienced. 
“I think of rust as being a 1-in-20 year issue, and that combined with the wet July, I think it’s probably a once-in-a-lifetime scenario we had this year,” Cannon said. 
Cannon said he has harvested about 40% of his corn and 55% of his soybeans as of Monday. 
The crops are drying down quickly, according to Cannon, and most farmers are “pushing really hard, trying to keep up with everything drying down.” He said the Monday rain, which also kept him out of the field, would help to moisten corn and soybeans and help farmers keep their yields up. 
Trade tensions and agricultural challenges
Historically, China has been the largest buyer of soybeans, but trade war tensions from the first Trump administration and current tariff disputes between the nations have left soybean farmers in a tough position.
Cannon said the soybean industry has been the “poster child” for trade instability lately, but the tensions between the U.S. and China put a “dark cloud over the top of everything.” 
Cannon said as China buys less of other U.S. crops, like cotton and sorghum, those farmers might instead plant corn and soybeans, which in turn means more corn and soybeans on the market. 
USDA reports show planted corn acreage increased 5% in 2025 compared to 2024, while soybeans planted decreased 4%, wheat planted went down 1% and cotton planted decreased 10%. 
“This instability is causing everybody to make tough decisions, and it’s just putting pressure on all the markets,” Cannon said. 
Cannon said with “steadily eroding” grain prices the past two years, he tries to focus on the things he can do to better his farm, rather than on the depreciating market. 
“It can be really mentally challenging to stay upbeat and stay optimistic about things when every day the news is about how the markets are going down,” Cannon said. 
Overall, it means he has put off equipment upgrades that aren’t vital and tried to be very conscious about all of his input costs. 
“I’m still glad I’m in farming,” Cannon said. “I’m afraid that there’s probably a few more hard years ahead of us. But I think with some of the challenging times we’re having right now, there’s some really interesting discussions that are happening amongst farmers.
“… I think there’s some opportunities to get some really honest answers and get some really good feedback from farmers right now that could lead to some long-term positive changes in policy and how we think about farming.”
Miller said some of his grain was forward sold earlier this year, but he is still worried by the apparent loss of the Chinese soybean market. 
“When the largest buyer of soybeans in the world doesn’t buy any from you, and we’re in our window when we should have been shipping beans to them – yeah, it’s concerning, because nobody can make up for that,” Miller said. 
Despite the wet July, a dry fall and an early start to harvest season, Miller said it’s been “just another typical year in Iowa.”

Mazurek Justice Building in Helena which houses the Attorney General's Office, the Montana Supreme Court and the state law library (Photo by Eric Seidle/ For the Daily Montanan).Two groups leading efforts to ensure that Montana’s judicial elections, both at the local and Supreme Court level, remain nonpartisan have filed a motion with the Montana Supreme Court saying that Attorney General Austin Knudsen has rewritten the ballot language of a proposal his office had already determined met the state’s legal requirements, and alleging that Knudsen has confused the issue intentionally in order to sabotage it.
Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges and Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, each of which have sponsored their own versions of nonpartisan judiciary amendments, have joined together in a legal challenge for Constitutional Initiative 131, which would add just three words to the state’s constitution. The proposed amendment would make it so that the state’s Constitution would explicitly say that Montana’s judicial elections are nonpartisan.
The current portion of Article VII, Section 8 reads:


        “Supreme Court justices and district court judges shall be elected by the qualified electors as provided by law.”
 
CI-131 would change that section:

“Supreme Court justices and district court judges shall be elected in nonpartisan elections by the qualified electors as provided by law.”
 
The two groups have pushed three separate proposed constitutional initiatives that deal with the judiciary. CI-131, which was submitted by Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, has already been approved for the signature-gathering process, while two other initiatives by Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts are still pending review by the Attorney General’s Office. Essentially, two of the initiatives would do the same thing, plus a separate initiative would make any future court or judge created by the Legislature nonpartisan as well. Monday’s court filing marks a combined effort by attorneys from both groups. Raph Graybill of the Graybill Law Firm and Alex Rate of the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana are representing MNC, while Joel Krautter is representing MFIJ.
The Montana Attorney General’s Office was not immediately available for comment on Monday.
Republican lawmakers in the Legislature have contemplated converting the state’s judicial elections to partisan, something the GOP has said would bring more transparency to the judiciary. Montana’s judicial elections have been nonpartisan since 1935, but the state’s constitution is silent on whether they can be partisan or not. CI-131, if approved by voters, would keep the state’s court races nonpartisan unless and until voters changed it through the amendment process.
However, in their lawsuit, the groups say that Knudsen’s office is intentionally meddling in the wording in attempt to create confusion, essentially sabotaging the effort. While they decried the revision, they also said in a court filing on Monday to the Montana Supreme Court that the move is illegal because Knudsen’s office had already signed off on the measure, saying it was legally sufficient.
The Montana Supreme Court is the not only the highest state court, but is also the only court authorized to hear this particular constitutional challenge.
“Montana’s statutes governing the ballot statement approval process strike a balance between securing the public’s right to make an informed vote and proponents’ constitutional right to propose ballot issues on fair terms,” the lawsuit said. “Thus, the government may intervene to improve ballot statements for clarity and neutrality. But the statutes do not empower the government to leave its own editorial imprint on ballot statements on a whim, or to degrade their quality by introducing confusing and prejudicial language.”
The revised CI-131, as submitted by Knudsen’s office, expands the three word addition to a two-sentence description:


“CI-131, if passed, mandates Montana supreme court and district court elections be non-partisan. A non-partisan election prohibits labeling candidates on the ballot according to the political party the candidate aligns with including labels like independent.”
 
Attorneys for the ballot group allege that Knudsen’s office expanded the description to purposely tilt against the notion of a nonpartisan court, appearing to prohibit independent candidates for judicial office.
“The Attorney General did exactly what the statute proscribes: Opining on what the ballot initiative, if passed, will do and what voters should think about it,” the lawsuit said.
Attorneys also said that if the state’s Supreme Court does not intervene, it could set a dangerous precedent where future attorneys general can rewrite ballot statements at will.
The attorneys also said that Knudsen is not following Montana law, which says that if the office finds that there is a problem or concern with a proposed ballot initiative, the review process is the proper place to raise those concerns. In this case, they allege that Knudsen’s office had already determined CI-131 met the legal requirements.
“First, the rewritten statement would lead voters to believe the initiative prohibits them from voting for judicial candidates not signed with a political party, when that is the exact opposite of the initiative’s purpose,” the lawsuit said. “Second, the statement tells voters to presume that judicial candidates are partisan and the effect of the initiative will be to conceal this information from voters. This is pure political messaging and flatly inappropriate for a ballot statement.
“Especially egregious is the Attorney General’s gratuitous reference in the second sentence to prohibiting ‘independent’ judicial candidates.”
Attorneys for the groups also say that Montana law prohibits rewriting statements to be argumentative or controversial. Instead, the State of Montana routinely publishes a voters’ guide, a “Voter Information Pamphlet,” on statewide issues in which supporting and opposing groups give their opinion for voters to consider.
“The rewritten statement prejudicially and falsely, tells voters to presume that judicial candidates are partisan actors aligned with a political party, and that voting for the initiative will have the effect of concealing this information,” the lawsuit said. “This is exactly the kind of argument — not description — that belongs in the ‘opponent arguments’ of section of the Voter Information Pamphlet, not the ballot statement itself.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HS1A0028-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 18:56:55.785058

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-06 22:20:48+00:00,Mississippi Today,Retired south Mississippi newspaper publisher Roland Weeks dies at 89. ‘He just stood up for what was right’,"Anita Lee, Sun Herald",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/06/retired-south-mississippi-newspaper-publisher-roland-weeks-dies-at-89-he-just-stood-up-for-what-was-right/,Roland Weeks Jr. served as publisher of the Sun Herald and as a community leader in South Mississippi for 33 years.,"Roland Weeks Jr. was a leader among leaders, a man who cared deeply about the Mississippi Gulf Coast and helped shape the region through his 33-year stewardship as publisher of the regional newspaper, The Daily Herald and its successor, the Sun Herald. 
Weeks died Saturday at age 89.
Weeks, who lived in Biloxi with wife Sharon Weeks, retired in 2001 as publisher, president and general manager of the Sun Herald. He remained active in the community, continued his adventures as a pilot and served for many years as a volunteer for the Salvation Army in Gulfport, showing up weekly to wash clothes for the homeless. 
“He was just this unflinching friend to so many people,” said Ricky Mathews of Biloxi, who spent many years working under Weeks and succeeded him in the publisher’s job before his own retirement. “He loved people. I don’t know that we’ll ever meet anyone like him again.”
“Community leader is an understatement,” said Henry Laird of Pass Christian, who worked closely with Weeks as longtime attorney for the Sun Herald. “He unified the Coast. 
“He ran the newspaper much like he lived his life. He was independent. He just stood up for what was right.”
Newspaper publishing in a hurricane 
Weeks graduated from high school in Charleston, South Carolina, then attended The Citadel, followed by the executive program at Stanford Business School. He received his bachelor’s degree in engineering from Clemson University before joining the U.S. Air Force, where he served as a first lieutenant.
Weeks worked briefly as an engineer in the private sector but found his calling in the newspaper business. He started out at Columbia Newspapers in Columbia, South Carolina, where he worked as a management trainee.
He came to Mississippi Coast in 1968 — one year before Hurricane Camille — when the State Record Co., which owned the Columbia newspaper, bought The Daily Herald, then headquartered in Gulfport. 
Weeks, his trusted editor Bob McHugh and several others rode out the Category 5 hurricane in The Daily Herald’s building. When water rose in the first floor, they moved upstairs. 
“My car, as a matter of fact, was washing around in the water outside of several windows as we worked here,” Weeks said in a 2019 Sun Herald video. Weeks and McHugh called Columbia and got an agreement that The Daily Herald would publish there. 
The Coast newspaper never missed a day of publication, a tradition that has continued through the years, including for the unprecedented Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the newspaper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, the industry’s highest honor. 
The morning after Camille, The Daily Herald building was covered in debris. Weeks and McHugh cleared the front door. Employees began showing up to see how they could help.
Weeks said one of the first sights was a large sail boat washed up from the Gulf. “That told us what we could expect to find in other parts of the Gulf Coast,” Weeks said.
Weeks strove for excellence 
Weeks oversaw construction of a new building on the Gulfport-Biloxi line, where the newspaper operated from 1970-2021. The building was made of concrete with narrow rectangular windows along both sides and large plate-glass windows that could be boarded up only in front. 
Staff rode out subsequent storms, including Katrina, in that building. 
As publisher, Weeks also set about modernizing the operation and transforming the newspaper from a community publication to a statewide force. 
For the first time, he hired local columnists and photographers. He believed strongly in giving the news staff the editorial independence needed to gather and report the news. 
“We became who we are because of Roland,” said Kat Bergeron, who worked full time for the Sun Herald for 32 years as a columnist and feature writer, and still writes her Gulf Coast Chronicles column for the newspaper. “He had the wherewithal to hire editors who brought us into the 21st century before we were really in the 21st Century.”
Bergeron said she was given the freedom to get to know the Coast and its history for her column. 
“We took off and ran,” she said. 
Weeks also brought a morning newspaper to the Coast, as The Daily Herald was an afternoon publication. The Sun and The Daily Herald eventually merged into The Sun Herald.
Publisher leaves strong legacy 
Like any good leader, Weeks had the courage of his convictions, publishing news even when it was disagreeable to those in power. 
He also had a long-range vision for the Coast, promoting consolidation of government services to increase efficiency and cut waste. He played a key role in consolidating five chambers into the Gulf Coast Chamber of Commerce. 
“Roland was a giant in both of his principal capacities — newspaper publisher and community leader,” said Stan Tiner of Gulfport, who was executive editor when Weeks retired. “He was a visionary who recognized that the Coast would be more prosperous as a unified region, while giving great credit to each of the unique communities that were vital to his new home.
“As a publisher, he created a legacy of fairness and public service journalism that served the Coast and South Mississippi with distinction throughout his decades of leadership.”

Over the years, Weeks won many awards for his service to the community, including the John S. Knight Gold Medal, the top honor awarded an employee of the newspaper when it was owned by media company Knight Ridder, the Alvah Chapman Award for best-performing newspaper in Knight-Ridder, United Way of South Mississippi Philanthropist of the Year and the Gulf Coast Chamber’s Spirit of the Coast Award.
Weeks also was one of the major fundraisers and promoters of the Ohr-O’Keefe Museum of Art in Biloxi, home to the works of renowned ceramist George Ohr and a replica of the home of Pleasant Reed, a former enslaved person who built his family’s original home in 1887.
“He had so many different causes over the years that he threw himself into,” said Jeff O’Keefe, son of deceased museum founder and former Biloxi Mayor Jerry O’Keefe. “We will be forever grateful for his work with the Ohr-O’Keefe Museum of Art.” 
Weeks was humble about his accomplishments. As a publisher, he created a culture of customer service. He considered his employees internal customers. Even after he retired, Weeks frequently stopped by the newspaper office to visit, encourage employees and tell them what a good job they were doing. 
“His legacy?” Mathews wrote in a Facebook tribute. “It’s in the bridges he built between people, the resilience he instilled in our institutions, and the way he turned challenges into opportunities.”
Weeks stayed in touch with employees 
His enthusiasm for the newspaper and news was contagious.
“I count myself very, very lucky to have worked for him,” said Pam Firmin, a former Sun Herald staff writer. “He made it fun. He made things exciting. 
“He was so quick to be understanding and caring and to see the big picture. It was something that seemed to come natural to him.” 
Firmin had taken a break from the newspaper when her husband, Pic Firmin, served as executive editor under Weeks. After his retirement, Pic Firmin had cancer. Weeks regularly picked up Firmin to take him for coffee and visited Firmin daily in the last weeks of his life.
“He was so quick to be understanding and caring and to see the big picture,” Pam Firmin said. “It was something that seemed to come natural to him. He did help make the Gulf Coast what it is, but he is so much more than it.”
Flying was one of his passions 
After retirement, Weeks faithfully volunteered at the Salvation Army in Gulfport, where for years he washed clothes for the homeless alongside Pam Firmin, who said he was also “an awesome laundry mechanic.”
Weeks also found more time in retirement for his favorite hobby, flying airplanes. He was known as somewhat of a daredevil, but real talent accompanied his rolls and aeronautical stunts. 
“I’ve got so many stories,” said Joe Pevey of Gulfport, who became a close friend of Weeks after they met at an airport. Pevey described himself at the time as a Cessna pilot with a Top Gun attitude. He bought a high-performance plane that he really didn’t know how to fly. Weeks studied the book where Pevey had logged his experience and told the younger man, “’Joe, you’re going to kill yourself with this plane.’”
Instead, Weeks taught Pevey to fly the plane. “Roland quite literally saved my life,” Pevey said. Pevey considers himself a technical aerobatics pilot who thinks through his moves ahead of time, while Weeks was a natural.
“He wasn’t a pilot,” Pevey said. “He was an aviator.”
Weeks once corralled Mathews to deliver newspapers from the plane to customers who had chartered Weeks’ boat for fishing at Chandeleur Island. Weeks tested Mathews’ seatbelt strap before they started their mission in Weeks’ twin-engine plane. Mathews was positioned in a seat facing the back of the plane, where the door had been removed. 
They located the fishermen on skiffs deployed from the big boat and each time they approached a skiff, Weeks dipped sideways so Mathews could angle a newspaper toward them. 
Mathews promised himself, “If I ever make it back to the airport, I’m never getting in an airplane with Roland again. And I didn’t.” 
Weeks lived to see the internet change the newspaper business. His belief in a community’s need for strong journalism never wavered, a tradition he helped build on the Coast. 
The building whose construction he had overseen came down in the spring, the Sun Herald having moved to quarters more suited to an online operation. He was moving slowly, but Weeks showed up to see some of his former employees for one last photograph on the front steps of the building.
“You’re wonderful people,” he told the group. “You just can’t imagine the excitement that I feel and the love that I feel for all of you.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/06162930/Roland-Weeks-and-Joe-Pevey.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 18:56:55.785058

The hospital’s leaders and its nursing union have been in talks since May. Ongoing issues with contamination in the operating room stymied some progress.

On Friday evening, dozens of Northwestern Medical Center nurses from their recently-formed union gathered with friends and families outside the St. Albans hospital to rally support in a honk and wave event. Nurses held signs and balloons as they encouraged attention to their cause from foot traffic and drivers. Many of them leaned on their horns or threw a thumbs-up in support.
In February, the nurses officially unionized and have been meeting with hospital management on a biweekly basis since May to flesh out a contract. The union is now dialing up its efforts to try to bring the hospital into an agreement by Thanksgiving. 
Hospital management has yet to present an initial budget proposal, though the two sides have made progress on negotiating some concerns surrounding scheduling, parking and worker protection issues like just-cause firings.

“The membership is quite frustrated,” said Julie MacMillan, an ICU nurse at the medical center who serves on the union’s bargaining committee. “Here we are, five months in. It’s hard to bargain a contract when you don’t know all the pieces of the puzzle.” 
With regard to the length of time negotiations are taking, hospital management cited the need for diligence in presenting an initial proposal. 
“This being our first contract, it is important to negotiate thoughtfully and deliberately, and that takes time,” Northwestern Medical Center communications director Kate Laddison wrote in a statement. 
Laddison said that nationally the average contract takes about 18 months to negotiate and that other hospitals closer to home have taken more than a year to negotiate with their nurses’ unions.

The negotiations have, in part, been hindered by an ongoing issue with contamination on surgical instruments in NMC’s operating room, according to the union representatives, though Laddison said the issues are separate. 
In August, the hospital halted surgeries because staff consistently found specks of particles in plastic-wrapped trays of surgical tools. Surgeries were routinely canceled and rescheduled or delayed as the hospital paused surgeries any time it encountered contaminated trays.
Laddison was unable to respond to a request for further details about the current status of surgeries by presstime, though she did inform VTDigger that “there’s a lot going on in that area.” 
Not only did the issue stymie some progress on the contract negotiations, but it also fomented more frustration among staff.

Christine Juaire, an operating room nurse and member of the bargaining team, stressed that the operations that do occur are safe.
“Most of all, I want to emphasize that we don’t proceed with surgeries at this time unless our staff feel confident and safe in the sterility of the procedures we perform in our hospital,” she said. “We take our role in caring for our community extremely seriously.”
But the nurses also said they felt left in the dark by hospital management about how it is  navigating the contamination issue, even in decisions that would affect the ability of operating room staff to perform daily operations. Several said that hospital management did not seek their input or suggestions for how to improve the problem, even though staff working in and around the OR saw areas where their on-the-floor experience might help. 
The lack of communication was something that the bargaining committee expressed to management. The committee asked for staff nurses to be more formally involved in responding to the contamination problem, and for the hospital to improve its reporting on the issue to include more detailed and up-to-date information.

The hospital’s reliance on traveling nurses, over its own staff, has remained a central point of contention in the contract negotiations. According to documents Northwestern Medical Center submitted to the Green Mountain Care Board this summer, the hospital employs 100 nurses on staff and 27 as contracted nurses. 
MacMillan said she often sees traveling nurses receive priority shifts, with staff nurses needing to take weekends or less desirable times. She added that in negotiations, the hospital’s lawyer often explains this situation as the result of the traveling nurses coming to the hospital under a contract, with a set of working conditions and pay that the hospital management is bound to. 
“Staff nurses don’t have that, so they are at the whim of whatever scheduling practices [or] the needs of the unit may be,” MacMillan said. She described a situation that flips the industry norm, where staff nurses fill a hospital schedule and travelers are drawn on to pinch-hit and fill remaining gaps.
“It’s backwards, especially for a little community hospital,” she said.

But the reliance on traveling nurses dampens morale for the nurses who do stay: “With travelers coming and going, you don’t really feel like you build a team,” MacMillan added.
She said she is grateful to work with many of the young and traveling nurses who come through the hospital, but she wishes that the system were better set up to help them root their careers here longer term.
She cited NMCs nursing pathway program, which financially supports employee nurse apprentices in earning their Registered Nurse licensure. “We would really like to see these wonderful young nurses who have been trained here, stay,” MacMillan said.
MacMillan sees better pay for staff nurses as the primary way to raise retention. The small community hospital, whose 2026 revenue was just set at $130.8 million by the Green Mountain Care Board, is dwarfed by UVM Medical Center, whose annual budget for this coming year was approved to be over $1.89 billion. Though the community hospital doesn’t need to compete with the state’s largest hospital, MacMillan said, the wage difference between what a Northwestern nurse is making and a UVM Medical Center nurse makes is enough to lure many Franklin County nurses to make the roughly half-hour drive down to Burlington.
“We just want to stay a little competitive with UVM, even if [Northwestern’s administration] can come close,” she said.
It could also make staying at Northwestern a more competitive alternative for many of the traveling nurses who come through the hospital: “We’ve had travelers who have said, ‘Hey, I would love to live here, but I can’t find housing, and I can’t afford the housing that’s around. Why would I take a pay cut when I [could otherwise] just keep traveling and see the country?’” MacMillan said. In its 2026 budget narrative to the Green Mountain Care Board, Northwestern reiterated that “it is not unusual for travelers to communicate that they would be open to exploring a permanent position at NMC if affordable housing was more widely available.” 
Northwestern Medical Center’s philosophy of neighbors taking care of neighbors really resonated with MacMillan, who had worked at the University of Vermont Medical Center for most of her 23-year career before she made the move to a hospital closer to home a little over two and a half years ago. 
She described the feeling of community that comes with recognizing local patients as they come into the ICU across the stages of a progressive illness. Even though no one wants to be in the hospital, she said, “there is some comfort (for patients) in knowing the nurse and seeing a familiar face.”
It’s something that may cost more upfront, but MacMillan and her colleagues on the bargaining committee see the investment in nursing staff as an opportunity to save costs in the long term — both for the costs it can save from paying for traveling nurses as well as for the effect good nursing can have in preventing deeper problems like bed sores, infections or falls.
“We applaud fiscal responsibility. We also need to recognize that people come to the hospital for nursing care,” MacMillan said.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Statewide test scores for reading and math have dropped significantly in Oklahoma public schools since the state returned to more rigorous scoring, according to results the state Department of Education released publicly on Monday.
In the 2024-25 school year, only 27% of third graders were classified as proficient or advanced in reading while 51% were the year before. A similar difference is evident in math testing results, with 33% of Oklahoma third graders hitting grade-level targets, despite 38% doing so in 2023-24.
State officials have warned the lower scores are not the result of worse academic performance, but rather a reflection of more rigorous expectations. 
“This year’s test results don’t mean that Oklahoma students are doing worse,” said Megan Oftedal, executive director of the state’s Office of Educational Quality and Accountability. “Our students are learning and working just as hard as before, but the bar for what’s considered ‘Proficient’ has been raised.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Oftedal will soon join the state Education Department as a member of a “turnaround team” advising newly appointed state Superintendent Lindel Fields.
The state lowered expectations in 2024 for how much knowledge students had to demonstrate on state reading and math tests to receive a score of “proficient,” which is defined as showing mastery of grade-level subject matter and readiness for the next grade. 
Those who fall below “proficient” are labeled either “basic,” which indicates a student has only partial mastery of concepts at his or her grade level, and “below basic,” which indicates a student has fallen even more significantly behind. Students who perform above a proficient level are considered “advanced.”
The state Education Department developed the lower scoring expectations with committees of Oklahoma teachers and then earned approval in July 2024 from the Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability, which oversees Oftedal’s agency. 
The Education Department, under state Superintendent Ryan Walters at the time, then released the 2024 test scores without announcing that a major change in scoring had taken place, leaving districts and families with the false impression that their students had made dramatic leaps in academic progress.
After news media, including Oklahoma Voice, uncovered the scoring change, the commission reversed its 2024 decision, opting to restore the stricter, nationally aligned scoring methods that Oklahoma used from 2017-2023. 
That means students needed to have a stronger performance in reading and math this year to be considered proficient. Statewide reading and math tests are administered each spring to grades 3-8.
With more rigorous expectations in place, the 2025 results give the appearance of a major dip in performance, just like the 2024 scores gave an artificial indication of growth.
Reading scores showed the most dramatic swing this year.
Along with the 27% of third graders who scored proficient or higher, only 24% of fourth graders, and 26% of fifth graders did so in reading, according to results the Education Department posted publicly on its website. A quarter of sixth graders, 22% of seventh graders and 21% of eighth graders made a proficient or advanced reading score.
Under last year’s scoring, no grade level had a reading proficiency rate below 39%.
Math results in 2025 classified 33% of third and fourth graders and 27% of fifth graders as scoring at grade level or higher. Only 24% of sixth graders, 25% of seventh graders and 17% of eighth graders in Oklahoma scored proficient or advanced in math.
That’s an across-the-board decline from 2024 math scores. However, 2024 data should be considered an “outlier,” according to guidance from the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability.
The agency advised that the 2025 results are more comparable to 2023, when 26% of all Oklahoma students scored proficient or above in reading and math.
Having higher testing expectations better identifies whether students are on track to be ready for college or a career by the time they graduate high school, Oftedal said. It also more closely aligns with scoring used in national testing.
“Scores may look lower, but what they show is more meaningful,” she said. “Raising expectations helps everyone — parents, teachers, and schools — see more clearly where students are thriving and where they may need extra support. Our students haven’t fallen behind; we’ve simply raised the bar to match their potential and prepare them for the future.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The state of Iowa’s general fund revenue for fiscal year 2025 is roughly $200 million less than predicted when state lawmakers were moving forward with the budget, according to a Legislative Services Agency report.
The nonpartisan LSA document found the state collected $8.8 billion in the fiscal year covering July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025. This is a drop of $780 million in revenue compared to the state’s $9.6 billion revenue in FY 2024 – an 8.1% decrease.
Part of this funding decrease was expected, as Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a law in 2024 speeding up previously approved income tax cuts. When state legislators reconvened for the 2025 legislative session, Republican leaders said they were expecting to draw from the $3.75 billion Taxpayer Relief Fund, as well as the state’s $2 billion budget surplus and $961 in reserve accounts to make up for the expected shortfall caused by the tax cuts.
The Revenue Estimating Conference predicted in March that Iowa would see a revenue of $9.020 billion in FY 2025, excluding lottery and other transfers. The updated total from the LSA is $198 million below that prediction.
State Auditor Rob Sand, who is running for Iowa governor, said in a statement Monday the LSA report shows Iowa Republicans’ “irresponsible budgeting practices” have led to a predicted financial crisis.
“I warned of a fiscal time bomb back in May, and now we are seeing it detonate before our very eyes,” Sand said in a statement.  “The decline in state revenues is even worse than anticipated, raising serious concerns about funding for services that Iowa’s families and communities depend on.”
He and other Democrats have criticized both the move to a single 3.8% income tax rate, as well as the state’s Education Savings Account program awarding public funding for private school tuition and associated costs.
Democrats have warned these GOP-backed initiatives will cause major issues as the state draws from its reserves. According to the LSA, the state’s Taxpayer Relief Fund contains $3.6 billion and the state retains a $1.6 billion surplus as of July.
Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said in a statement earlier in October that the LSA’s report shows “the governor’s five-year projections are looking pretty rosy compared to the state’s fiscal reality.” Earlier in 2025, Petersen had made a Freedom of Information Act request to the Iowa Department of Management requesting the release of the administration’s five-year financial plan, which showed the intention to transfer money from the Taxpayer Relief Fund from FY 2026 through 2030.
“Republican lawmakers planned to spend more than we take in for at least the next five years,” Petersen said. “Our reserves won’t last forever. Just how much, or for how long, are they willing to deplete our reserves to cover their budget malpractice?”
In addition to the confirmed lower revenue in FY 2025, the state is expected to bring in less money in future years. This is not only because of state tax law changes – Reynolds said in September some of the individual and corporate income tax law changes approved through the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will also result in a $437.5 million decrease for Iowa’s general fund revenues in fiscal year 2026, according to initial Iowa Department of Revenue projections. Struggles in the agricultural economy are also expected to have a negative impact on Iowa’s economy.
But in a social media post Thursday after the LSA report was released, Reynolds highlighted the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis report on GDP growth data, which found Iowa’s GDP grew by 3.7% in the second quarter of 2025, “ranking Iowa in the top 20” in the country.
“With $20B of new capital investment in the last 18 months, we’re continuing to drive growth and diversification for Iowa’s economy,” Reynolds wrote.
The REC is next scheduled to meet Oct. 16 at the Iowa State Capitol.

This summer, The Creative Campus hosted the Green Mountain Playwright Retreat. “I got 600 submissions from all over the world,"" said retreat director and Goddard graduate Erin Galligan Baldwin. ""It went viral.”

This story by Evan Witt was first published in the Hardwick Gazette on Sept. 30, 2025.
PLAINFIELD — The people trying to revitalize Goddard College’s former campus are counting on the arts. They say the new program is starting to gain traction, with summer events drawing crowds and attention.
“What’s going on here now is the dream come true,” said Kris Gruen, director of the nonprofit group The Creative Campus at Goddard. He praised developers Execusuite LLC for being, “open to the hopes and dreams of the local community.”
Gruen gave two examples of success from this summer: sold-out concerts and a retreat for playwrights that attracted international attention.
After closing in 2024, Goddard College was bought by Execusuite. Owner Mike Davidson asked the community of Plainfield to decide what should be done, resulting in the development of The Creative Campus. “It’s a nonprofit organization dedicated to cultivating a dynamic, intentional community where people of all ages come together to foster creative expression, live holistically, create new models of community living,” Gruen said.

The primary goal of The Creative Campus is to foster the creative arts, he said. Examples include concerts, plays, creative arts courses and retreats. “It’s really an invitation to people who want to bring their creative practice to a space that supports it, a space that has a community to engage around it,” Gruen said.
Another goal is to act as an economic driver for the town of Plainfield, filling the gap that was left by Goddard College. Many elements of Goddard College have been preserved through this new creative arts venue, including the Haybarn Theatre and the former college dorms.
This summer, Creative Campus hosted the Green Mountain Playwright Retreat, a four-day program run by playwright and Goddard graduate Erin Galligan Baldwin.

The retreat received submissions from playwrights in Vermont and beyond, resulting in a selective process of choosing which plays would be presented at the event, Baldwin said. “I got 600 submissions from all over the world when I posted it. It went viral.”
In addition to hosting playwrights, The Creative Campus presented plays in the Haybarn Theatre, which is well known in the community. “It’s been a theater space in Plainfield on the college campus since 1934,” Gruen said, “so it was one of the first things that got rejuvenated after the purchase of the campus last year.”
Nearby, Haybarn Restaurant and Lounge provides theater-goers and others somewhere to dine, including Vermont veggie burgers, avocado hummus and apple crisp. It was closed for remodeling until Oct. 1.
In addition, The Creative Campus rents out about 60 to 70 dorm-style rooms. Some are suites, but most are singles and double rooms, Gruen said.
The dorms provide a housing option for people coming from longer distances, giving them the ability to stay the night before or during an event.
The dorms, as well as other buildings at Goddard College, are in need of care. For example, some guests this summer were displeased when a bat got into the dormitories, Baldwin said.
“If you’re used to country living, it’s not a huge deal to have a critter. But I think in the future, if we’re catering to clientele from Boston or New York, we don’t want bats flying around,” she said.
As for the plans for developing housing on campus, Gruen said that Execusuite LLC is still in the planning stages. Davidson did not respond immediately to an email requesting comment.
Baldwin said she was happy to be back on campus where she graduated and back at the Haybarn Theatre, and excited for the future of the community as well.
“Central Vermont, and all of Vermont, has been through a lot with the flooding and with everything. I just thought this is a resurgence of an extremely important part of our state and part of our history and our culture here,” she said.

Laura Kelly to host public town halls in eight cities to gather input on new state budget in 2026 legislative session.,"Gov. Laura Kelly is hosting an eight-city tour of town halls dedicated to soliciting public input on how to  reshape the state government budget to better meet the needs of Kansans. The tour starts Oct. 9 in Salina and ends Nov. 12 in Wichita. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly plans to embark on an eight-city tour during October and November to explore with Kansans their state budget priorities ahead of next year’s legislative session.
Kelly, who is term limited and cannot seek reelection, said on Monday the town halls dedicated to formation of “The People’s Budget” would give folks an opportunity to express where they wanted lawmakers to earmark spending.
“Kansans should know and have a say in where their hard-earned taxpayer dollars are going,” Kelly said. “In the months ahead, it’s critical that we continue down the path of responsible budgeting to ensure Kansas does not return to the days of reckless fiscal mismanagement.”
She said her administration continued to be dedicated to creating and maintaining a financial foundation that could survive economic downturn.
In 2018, Kelly was elected in aftermath of aggressive state income tax cuts signed into law in 2012 and 2013 by Gov. Sam Brownback. The 2017 Legislature, in a bipartisan vote, wiped out much of Brownback’s tax agenda, which had been created as a mechanism to eventually eliminate the state income tax. Instead, the result was deep budget cuts, heavy borrowing and a sales tax hike.
During a special legislative session in 2024, lawmakers approved a $2 billion, five-year program of state tax reductions.
Kelly had cautioned the Legislature against income tax reductions that jeopardized the state’s financial well-being.
“My administration has been laser-focused on building a strong fiscal foundation for our state,” the governor said.
The first stop on the governor’s tour has been scheduled for 6 p.m. Oct. 9 at Salina South High School. She is to be joined by Adam Proffitt, the state budget director.
Other dates and locations: Hays, Bob & Pat Schmidt Community Center, Oct. 29; Garden City, Garden City High School, 6 p.m. Oct. 29; Kansas City, Kansas, West Wyandotte Library Auditorium, 6 p.m. Nov. 3; Leawood, Leawood Community Center, 6 p.m. Nov. 5; Emporia, Lyon County History Center, 6 p.m. Nov. 6; Pittsburg, Frisco Events Center, 6 p.m. Nov. 10; and Wichita, Nov. 12.
Kansans interested in attending the first-come, first-serve events should visit this form for additional details.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita legislator seeking the Republican Party’s nomination in 2026 for state insurance commissioner, offered a tongue-in-cheek response to the governor’s announcement.
“After seven years in office, Governor Kelly has announced she and Secretary Profitt are living out their inner Sonny and Cher and launching a statewide duet tour. I hope in addition to their vocal stylings, they offer real budget solutions,” Hawkins said.
He said the House and Senate appropriately set aside the governor’s budget recommendations during the 2025 legislative session and adopted a package of bills that spent $30 million less than Kelly proposed.
“While the golden oldies tour makes its rounds, you can rest assured that the beat will go on in the Legislature as we keep doing the hard work of rooting out waste and abuse in government spending,” Hawkins said.
In January, the Democratic governor submitted to the Legislature as required a budget that outlined investments in education, health care, infrastructure, public safety and other areas. The Legislature, led by Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson, a candidate for governor, built a separate budget plan designed to minimize Kelly’s influence on appropriations.
The governor’s office said the budget bill passed in April left the state with potential long-term problems. Legislative documents indicated the state could spend $300 million more than it collected in annually in taxes, which would jeopardize the state’s financial health.
Kelly’s statement said the budget tour was designed to gather feedback on “how to repair the damage caused by the Legislature’s reckless budget.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kelly-democrat-lenexa-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 18:56:55.785058

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The leader of an association of federal judges did not hesitate Monday when asked about her colleagues’ top concern. 
“I think every judge right now is concerned about their safety and the safety of their families,” said Judge Karen Schreier, speaking to the Sioux Falls Downtown Rotary Club at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance.
Schreier said judges across the country are facing “never-before-seen levels of threats” and intimidation, which she called “an attack on the rule of law itself.”
Schreier, who’s based at the federal courthouse in Sioux Falls, is the president of the 1,100-member Federal Judges Association. In May, she was appointed to a new national Judicial Security and Independence Task Force, created by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to address growing threats against federal judges and challenges to the judiciary’s independence. 










I think every judge right now is concerned about their safety and the safety of their families.


– U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier, president of Federal Judges Association


Schreier cited an incident earlier this year when the sister of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett was targeted with a bomb threat. The U.S. Marshals Service has logged 562 threats against federal judges so far this year. More than 100 threatening packages have been delivered to federal judges’ homes, Schreier said, “sending a not-so-subtle message that we know where you live.”
Schreier also recalled the 2020 killing of federal Judge Esther Salas’ son in New Jersey by a lawyer who had previously lost a case in Salas’ court. Some judges, Schreier said, have been “doxed” with their private information posted online, while others — including South Dakota’s chief federal judge, Roberto Lang — have been “swatted,” a hoax in which false reports draw armed police to someone’s home.
During an audience question-and-answer session, South Dakota NewsWatch co-founder and former journalist Jack Marsh asked Schreier about criticism of the judiciary from political leaders, specifically President Donald Trump. The president has harshly criticized and even called for the impeachment of judges who ruled against him.
Schreier made general comments but declined to address Trump specifically, saying her restraint reflects the judiciary’s obligation to stay above partisan conflict.
“If judges are to protect the rights and liberties of citizens and to act as an effective check on the other branches of government, they must be independent,” she said. “They need to be free to decide cases based on the law.”

(Photo by Catherine Scott/URI photo)A public medical school could generate nearly $1.5 billion for Rhode Island’s economy within its first decade and help shore up the state’s primary care doctors.
That’s the key takeaway of a roughly nine-month feasibility study commissioned by a special legislative commission.
The 104-page report released Monday afternoon is not the final product of the commission charged with investigating how or if a public medical school could bolster the state’s primary care workforce. The final set of recommendations is not due until Jan. 2, 2026. 
Legislators were curious to learn if a hypothetical medical school at the University of Rhode Island (URI) could counteract the state’s shrinking fleet of primary care doctors, many of whom are aging out of the workforce. Absent any pipelines for new medical talent, a deficit of around 100 primary doctors is projected by 2030, the report estimates. Other estimates have pegged the current shortage in excess of 300.
The report from Tripp Umbach, consultants based in Kansas City, Missouri, also cites 2024 data from the Rhode Island Health Care System Planning’s foundational report that about 44% of Rhode Island’s physician workforce are nearing retirement age.
Paul Umbach, the founder and president of Tripp Umbach, shared a tentative version of the report with the commission in June. The complete feasibility study envisions an inaugural class of 50 students in fall 2029, which would then ramp up to the full capacity of 100 students by 2033. The medical students would largely train within a community-based model that would see them gain experience in the state’s Federally Qualified Health Centers and community hospitals. 
“Rhode Island hospitals, community health centers, and regional partners in Massachusetts and Connecticut have the capacity and interest to host clinical clerkships and residencies,” the report reads. “URI can attract local students by offering B.S./M.D. pathways, early assurance programs, tuition incentives, and service-based loan repayment tied to in-state practice.”
The consultants now project the school would generate about $196 million a year in economic activity, would employ about 1,335 people, and contribute $4.5 million in state and local taxes. They said the economic benefits would come from the hiring of staff and faculty, student and faculty spending in the community, research growth, and the new companies that often start up from such research as well as small businesses that cater to a university community. 
Those economic benefits would not come gratis. The firm is recommending $175 million upfront from a public/private mix of “early philanthropic gifts, institutional contributions, and long-term public commitments.” That money would support finding the school’s dean, building out the faculty and staff and gaining accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. About $62.5 million of this seed funding would go toward upgrading, retrofitting or building facilities. Operating costs and expenses for IT and simulation are also bundled into this lump sum. 
State contributions would amount to about $20 million in an initial round of public funding, plus $22.5 million annually beginning in 2029 upon entry of the school’s first class. These funds would be separate from any existing appropriations to URI, the report notes, and the annual state support would largely cover medical education at the school. Expanding residency options for med students and offering incentives like loan repayment — perks, the report notes, which would help keep graduates in Rhode Island — would need separate appropriations.
The report adds, “While start-up deficits are anticipated for any new medical school, they are offset over time by tuition revenue, clinical partnerships, research growth, and operational efficiencies.”
The project timeline could be pushed back a year to accommodate any delays in the school’s launch — such as finding an appropriate dean, a process that would ideally need to be completed by 2026 — but the feasibility study recommends the school open “no later” than 2030. 
“While Tripp Umbach believes funding conditions will improve in future decades, projections for federal research support in the 2030s are uncertain,” the report reads. 
The per-student costs the state would need to absorb are relatively modest compared to other states, the report suggests: “[T]he U.S. average for annual state support per medical student is $275,000, with Connecticut being $189,565 and Massachusetts at $97,975; therefore, Rhode Island’s $52,250 per student request within the feasibility study is approximately half as much per student as in Massachusetts, almost four times less than in Connecticut, and nearly five times less than the U.S. average.”
The final draft of the feasibility study will inform the commission’s ultimate suggestions. The public still has a chance to comment on the report’s findings, during a public hearing scheduled for the panel’s next meeting on Thursday, Oct. 9, at 5 p.m. in the Senate Lounge of the Rhode Island State House.
The legislative panel was created through legislation passed in June 2024. The following month, its 21 members were appointed by former Senate President Dominick J. Ruggerio, who died in April.

(Photo courtesy of Department of Enterprise Services)A hammer-wielding 29-year-old Washington resident is facing multiple felony charges after allegedly breaking into the state Capitol building in Olympia Sunday night, setting fires and toppling two iconic busts outside the historic state reception room.
Gunnar McLean Schubert wreaked havoc for about 10 minutes before the Washington State Patrol arrested him without incident as he left the building, authorities said. He was booked into Thurston County jail and is facing charges of first-degree burglary, first-degree arson, and first-degree malicious mischief. 
“It did not seem to be at all politically motivated. It appears to have been a person experiencing a mental health challenge,” said Chris Loftis, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol.
Shortly after 10 p.m., Schubert, a native of Auburn and a former minor league baseball player, used a hammer to smash a first-floor window of the suite of offices shared by several House Democrats, authorities said.
He proceeded to knock over county flags positioned in one corner of the rotunda, and, using lighter fluid, set the Columbia County flag on fire, Washington Lt. Gov. Denny Heck said in an interview.
On the third floor, officials said he broke a glass door to get into the reception room, where he burned a piano bench and attempted to set the carpet on fire. He also tipped over state and national flags and burned them, Heck said. Outside, he knocked over a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. and a much larger one of George Washington. Both had been put back in place by midday Monday.

And some stanchions were thrown down the rotunda stairs, causing a few chips on the marble stairs, according to the Department of Enterprise Services, whose staff first notified law enforcement Sunday night.
“It’s terrible. It’s heartbreaking news,” Heck said of the damage in the state reception room.
The room is used for public tours, class visits, press conferences and bill signings by governors.
It contains “priceless, irreplaceable” items. The carpet, for example, is the original flooring from 1928 and described by the state as the “world’s largest single-loom carpet.”

Schubert played baseball at Gonzaga University in Spokane and was drafted by the Florida Marlins in 2018. His professional career lasted two seasons.
In recent days, Schubert appeared to post repeatedly to Instagram, voicing rambling frustrations with the government, though his political ideology is unclear from the posts. In separate posts, he posed with a gun, invoked a Democratic state lawmaker and wrote current events-themed poems as captions.
Heck said Schubert had dropped by his office three times in the last few months. In those visits, the suspect left notes and small gifts for Heck, although the veteran political leader said he doesn’t know the man.
“I take his family at their word that there are mental health considerations,” Heck said in an interview. “How is it not a political statement to enter the state Capitol building and do damage? He could have entered any of a thousand buildings in Thurston County. Secondly, we do know that he has an Instagram trail of having made strong statements.”
“The truth of the matter is, anytime this happens, whether it’s Paul Pelosi getting his head beat in or Steve Scalise being shot, they are, in all likelihood, both political statements and issues of mental health,” Heck added, referring to separate attacks over the past decade on U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s husband and Scalise, a congressman from Louisiana. 
“It’s not cleanly one or the other, I don’t think,” Heck said. “Hardly ever. It’s some combination, often.”
In a statement, House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, called the Capitol “more than just a building.”
“It is the people’s house, and it must always be a place where legislators, staff, and the public feel safe carrying out the important work of democracy,” she said. “While this act of destruction is disturbing, we will not be deterred. The people’s work will continue, and our commitment to transparency, safety, and service remains unwavering.”
Heck said this incident is another reminder of the “significant escalation in both violence-tinged political rhetoric and actual violence.”
Recent months have seen the killing of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband in their home and the shooting of Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife by the same gunman, and the assassination of Republican political activist Charlie Kirk. 
“We must all do our part in turning down the temperature,” Heck said in a statement. “Violent rhetoric, property destruction, and violence against individuals are a cancer on our democratic society.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/washington-state-capitol-vandalism-1024x532.jpg,,,2025-10-06 17:58:29.043940

Free.,Government shutdown enters day six with talks over health care at an impasse,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-enters-day-six-talks-over-health-care-impasse,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump sent mixed messages Monday about whether he would negotiate a deal with Democrats to extend the enhanced tax credits for people who get their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, one of the main issues that led to the government shutdown. Trump said “some very good things could happen with respect to health care” and that “if we made the right deal, I’d make a deal, sure,” before sharply criticizing the 2010 health care law, also called Obamacare. “That’s the problem with Obamacare. The subsidies are so much — billions and billions of dollars is being wasted,” Trump said. “And we could have much better health care than we have right now. And we’re talking to them. I’m not saying that’s going to happen.”Trump centered much of his 2016 campaign for the presidency around repealing and replacing the health care law, but Republicans were unable to do so with unified control of government during the first half of his first term.  After Democrats swept in the 2020 elections, they enhanced the tax credits for people who buy their health insurance through the ACA Marketplace in a coronavirus relief law. Those enhanced subsidies are set to expire at the end of December. Democratic leaders for weeks have called on Republicans to negotiate a bipartisan agreement to extend those enhanced tax credits ahead of open enrollment beginning on Nov. 1. That didn’t happen and Democrats have largely voted against advancing a stopgap spending bill written by Republicans that was needed to fund the government past the end of September. ‘On another planet’Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said during a floor speech shortly before Trump spoke from the Oval Office that the president and GOP leaders seem “to be on another planet.”“Instead of trying to solve this shutdown crisis, Donald Trump spent the weekend golfing and posting memes and deepfakes on the internet,” Schumer said. “He seems to think this shutdown is some big joke. He’s wrong.”Schumer released a statement following Trump’s press conference, saying the two sides aren’t negotiating, despite the president saying “we are speaking with the Democrats.” “For months, Democrats have been calling on Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans to come to the table and work with us to deliver lower costs and better healthcare for the American people,” Schumer wrote. “If President Trump and Republicans are finally ready to sit down and get something done on healthcare for American families, Democrats will be there — ready to make it happen.”Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said during a morning press conference he will only negotiate with Democrats on the enhanced ACA Marketplace tax credits after the shutdown ends. But Johnson did indicate he believes the expiring expansion likely needs a resolution before open enrollment begins next month.“They've been saying that some of the insurance companies will be sending out notices in early November. The last time I checked, it's Oct. 6. We have the entire month of October,” Johnson said. “We'll stay here around the clock to work through all these things, but we have to get government open again to do it.""Discussion about passing billsThe House has been in recess since mid-September and Johnson has refused to bring representatives back until after the Senate approves a bill to reopen the government. Johnson revealed during the press conference that he had a “fruitful conversation” a few days ago with Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., about the annual government funding process, which lawmakers were supposed to complete by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.Johnson said he gave Murray assurances that he would hold floor votes on the final bipartisan versions of the dozen full-year bills after the Democrats and Republicans in charge of each subcommittee worked out an agreement.“I'm ready to go,” Johnson said. “But we've got to open government up so that they can move to that next level, so that the conference committee can get that work done. That is small-d democracy at its best; you get Rs and Ds, everybody in the room, and they hash it out, and whatever that final product is, we will move through the process.”The House has passed three of the full-year government funding bills along party-line votes and the Senate has approved three with a broadly bipartisan vote. Congress’ failure to approve all of the bills on time, combined with its inability to approve a stopgap spending bill to keep funding on autopilot while lawmakers work out a final full-year agreement, is why a shutdown began.Dems say bipartisan talks needed to end shutdownMurray posted later in the day on social media that bipartisan talks between the congressional leaders are the best option to end the shutdown.“I’ll reiterate now what I told @SpeakerJohnson: the only path forward begins with him & @LeaderJohnThune talking with Leaders Schumer & Jeffries,” Murray wrote. “Premium hikes are going out THIS MONTH. We need a deal that reopens the government & stops premiums from doubling.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during an afternoon briefing before Trump spoke that he “is definitely committed to fixing and improving our health care system,” though she declined to say if he supports extending the enhanced ACA tax credits as they exist. Leavitt also opted not to fully answer questions about when the administration will begin laying off federal workers by the thousands, saying the White House budget office continues to consult with Cabinet secretaries to determine which workers may lose their jobs. “We’ll see how the vote goes tonight,” Leavitt said, referring to the Senate’s Monday evening vote on the stopgap spending bills. Rural air service, air traffic controllersTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said during a press conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey that the shutdown means there are only a few days left of funding for the Essential Air Service program, which provides federal “subsidies to airlines to service” rural communities. “That money runs out this Sunday, so there are many small communities across the country that will now no longer have the resources to make sure they have air service in their community,” Duffy said.  Alaska will be the most affected by that particular funding lapse, he said. Duffy said there has been a “slight” increase in the number of air traffic controllers calling out sick during the shutdown but added it hadn’t caused any safety challenges yet. That will all change if transportation officials feel the staffing isn’t adequate for the number of flights. “If we see there are issues in the tower that are affecting the controllers’ ability to effectively control the airspace, we’ll reduce the rate and you’ll see more delays or you might see a cancellation,” Duffy said. “I’m willing to do that before we’re willing to risk anyone’s life in the air.”Duffy, a former Republican congressman from Wisconsin, said he had spoken earlier in the day with air traffic controllers who were thinking about taking on jobs at ride-sharing companies to pay the bills, since they will not be paid until after the shutdown ends. He said the effects of the funding lapse, including air traffic controllers worrying how they’ll make ends meet, are problematic, especially if they’re distracted by it while on shift or exhausted from working other jobs.  “I don’t want them finding a second job to pay the bills,” Duffy said. “I want them to get paid for the work they’re doing today, keeping our planes in the air and our skies safe.”Duffy also reiterated the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, which screens people entering airports, is housed within the Department of Homeland Security, not DOT.  Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",,,,2025-10-06 17:58:29.043940

(Photo by Andrew Kennard/Wisconsin Examiner)The Trump administration has backed away from a threat to demand that states cooperate with federal immigration enforcement if they want access to federal funds to aid crime victims, according to Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul.
Wisconsin was one of 20 states and the District of Columbia that sued the administration in August over a demand that states join in federal immigration enforcement efforts if the wanted access to Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grants.
Fees, fines and penalties collected in federal court proceedings  are distributed under VOCA to states to use on victim services, including operating community-based organizations such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers and victim-witness offices within county district attorneys’ offices. 
The Wisconsin Department of Justice estimated the state would have lost more than $24 million in grant funds if the threat had been  carried out.
The U.S. Department of Justice abandoned the plan after the lawsuit was filed, Kaul said Monday.
“This is funding that helps make a difference for victims of crime,” Kaul said in a statement. “The Trump administration shouldn’t have tried to tie states’ access to this funding to their assistance with immigration enforcement.”

(Provided by MSU for the Daily Montanan)Montana’s flagship institutions of higher education are both celebrating continued growth reflected in fall enrollment numbers released last month. 
In Bozeman, Montana State University saw headcount numbers tick up slightly from last year, marking a second consecutive fall with more than 17,100 students enrolled. MSU is the largest school in a four-state region that includes Wyoming and both Dakotas. 
“It’s humbling that so many students have chosen to start their futures at Montana State University,” MSU’s new President Brock Tessman said in a statement. “Our mission is to open the door to higher education for as many students as we can and offer them a first-rate education in a wide range of disciplines. And we are committed to helping our students meet their educational and career goals and to providing excellent support and resources for them every step of the way.”
To the west, the University of Montana heralded a fifth-straight year of enrollment growth with 11,064 students this semester, fueled by strong growth at Missoula College and UM’s graduate school. 
“Students choose UM because they will succeed here, our Griz community will support them, and we will help them launch a meaningful career and lead a fulfilling life,” UM President Seth Bodnar said.
Missoula College, the two-year school embedded within UM, grew by 17% over fall 2024, according to UM’s census data. The graduate program counted a record 2,910 students, making it the largest graduate school in the state, while the Alexander Blewett III School of Law grew by 4% to 280 students.

The University of Montana was the state’s largest school until 2012, according to the Montana University System. UM saw 10 years of falling enrollment until the trend began to reverse in 2021. 
This fall’s headcount marks the first time UM has surpassed 11,000 students since 2017. 
Both of Montana’s largest universities welcomed large classes of first-time college students — MSU with 3,743 and UM with 3,621 — and both schools count Montanans as the majority of their students. 
Half of all MSU students are from Montana — 8,519 — while 69% of UM’s student body — 6,866 — are in-state residents.
Both schools also touted success in meeting the state’s workforce needs by bolstering offerings at their respective two-year colleges and through non-credit courses and training. 
Gallatin College MSU had an enrollment of 1,078, the second year the college has exceeded 1,000 students. 
“The growth we’re seeing this fall reflects the confidence students and families place in Montana State University,” said Robert Mokwa, MSU’s provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. “As the state’s land-grant university, our mission is to expand access to higher education, prepare graduates for Montana’s workforce needs and advance knowledge that benefits communities across the state.”
According to UM’s press release, the university served 10,387 individuals — not counted in enrollment figures — during the last year through noncredit courses and training, designed to help learners “re-skill, upskill or change careers.”
“In today’s rapidly changing labor market, everyone deserves access to education that meets their specific needs and is delivered on their timeline,” Bodnar said. “UM has made investments to bolster our ability to serve learners beyond the traditional 18- to 22-year-old college student. We are proud that more than 10,000 people have benefited from these courses during the past year, landing jobs in growing fields like health care, construction and technology.”
MSU provided the following figures from fall enrollment:

It brought in 3,743 new first-time college students, including 1,572 Montanans;
A record 15,142 undergraduate students and 2,023 graduate students;
A record 1,124 Hispanic and 153 Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students enrolled, as well as 848 Native American/Alaska Native students enrolled;
A record retention rate of 81.8%, which measures the number of students who return for a second fall; and
A 21% increase in students receiving veteran benefits, at 700. 

The university also acknowledged setting four-, five-, and six-year graduation rates last spring.

“Record headcounts would not be possible if we were not working day in and day out to keep students in school and on track to graduation,” said Steve Swinford, MSU’s vice president for student success. “That plays a direct role in our increases in graduation rates, and that is something we are immensely proud of at MSU.”
Additional highlights from UM’s fall census data include:

259 more graduate students this fall compared to last;
A record 77.2% retention rate, up nine points from 2018;
817 Native American students enrolled for fall semester, a number that has increased by more than 40% since 2018;
An increase of 592 UM students who are first in their family to attend college; and
An undergraduate headcount made up of 31% of students who are eligible for Pell Grants, awarded to those whose families earn significantly less income than the state’s median.

“Our No. 1 priority is to place student success at the center of all we do, and these record-breaking student success rates are a testament to the hard work and dedication of UM’s talented faculty and staff members,” Bodnar said. “Given the high number of first-generation college students on our campus, this work is truly changing the economic trajectory for thousands of Montana families.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/first-day-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 17:58:29.043940
,DC,2025-10-06 21:35:19+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration defends nationwide rapid deportations at appeals hearing,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-defends-nationwide-rapid-deportations-appeals-hearing,,"WASHINGTON — Judges on a federal appeals court panel seemed skeptical that the Trump administration's expanded use of a fast-track deportation procedure didn’t violate the due-process rights of immigrants during oral arguments Monday.The hearing before judges Patricia A. Millett, Neomi Rao and J. Michelle Childs of the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals comes after a lower court struck down the expedited removal policy used to bypass judicial review in the quick removals of migrants far from the southern border. The expanded policy is a pillar in the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign. “This is a critical tool of immigration enforcement,"" U.S. Department of Justice attorney Drew Ensign said. “This is not a small deal. The ability to conduct expedited removal is one of the executive’s most important tools for maintaining border control and not being overwhelmed.”For decades, presidential administrations have applied expedited removal to immigrants apprehended at the southern border who cannot prove they have remained in the country for more than two years. If they cannot produce that proof, those immigrants are then subject to deportation without appearing before an immigration judge.In January, the Trump administration expanded expedited removal to apply nationwide, rather than only within 100 miles of the southern border.Childs said the Trump administration can still use expedited removal, along with other enforcement tools, for its immigration policy.“So what are you losing, other than (applying expedited removal to) millions of other people, to go inward into the U.S.?” Childs asked.Former President Barack Obama appointed Millett, former President Joe Biden appointed Childs, and President Donald Trump appointed Rao in his first term.Policy lacks procedureArguing on behalf of the immigration advocacy group that brought the suit, Make the Road New York, attorney Anand Balakrishnan said the new policy “brings to bear against this new class of people an entire system of expedited removal that is not procedurally adequate.”The judges also questioned the legality of the Trump administration’s expanded use of expedited removal. Ensign argued that the Trump administration doesn’t believe the expansion violates due-process rights because those affected are not U.S. citizens.“It has been well-established that aliens who are not lawfully admitted into the country are only entitled to whatever procedures the political branches provide, and that the plaintiffs cannot rely on the due-process clause to impose additional procedural requirements,” Ensign said.Balakrishnan said that when the Trump administration expanded the use of the policy in January, there were no new procedures put in place, meaning immigrants wanting to challenge their removal under the new policy would have no way to do so.“The procedures that have been on the books, in some cases are not tailored for this radically new class to which it's being applied, and in other cases, are insufficient to deal with the unique challenges placed by them and the liberty interests of this new group,” Balakrishnan said.",,,,2025-10-06 17:58:29.043940

Ned Lamont's gearing up to run for a third term.,"Gov. Ned Lamont has been shy when asked by reporters whether or not he’s running for a third term. However, he has spent the summer highlighting his administration’s successes.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Mark Pazniokas to discuss his article, “It’s clear Lamont wants a 3rd term, less so what he would do,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Mark’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Mark. Governor Lamont has yet to declare he’s seeking a third term. So could you explain how you’ve been able to decipher from his recent moves that he is seeking a third term in office?
MP: Well, it’s a very sophisticated analysis, which goes, if he walks and talks like a candidate, I think we can assume he’s a candidate. To give a little bit more, he has stopped really being coy about whether he’s truly undecided. And if you look at his schedule, he is acting very much like a candidate, putting a nice gloss on the last session, as well as his previous almost seven years in office. But as I know you know, he doesn’t give us much of an idea of what his ambitions are for the third term. He wants to get there, but what does he want to do with it?
WSHU: So, tell us what his record is right now, and if he does declare for a third term, what do you think he would say he wants to do for a third term?
MP: Well, he has emphasized returning a certain degree of stability to the Connecticut state government, particularly its finances. It’s not the most exciting issue to run on, but it’s an important issue, and that has been his emphasis, really, since he took office. He had a horrible first year in office over a failed proposal to bring back highway tolls. But the thread that connects that failure to some of us is his successes is that he said Connecticut is not paying its bills, that Connecticut needs to have a balanced approach to spending, and that included the special transportation fund that, at that point, was headed for insolvency, so that’s what prompted that. But since then, he has been somewhat lucky. Let’s be honest, a significant amount of federal funds has been allocated to Connecticut and other states as a result of COVID-19 and the aid that has flowed from the federal government. On top of that, he has been a defender of the volatility cap, which preceded him, which was passed in 2017. And the real short version of that is, tax revenues that tend to be more volatile, you have to bank them. You have to either put them into the rainy day fund, and once that is full, it has to go to paying down Connecticut’s really horrific pension debt, unfunded pension liability, which has built up over a decade.
WSHU: And also, the stock market has done pretty well, and that’s what the volatility issue is all about. You know, when the stock market does well, we make a lot more revenue, and if we can hold on to some of that revenue for longer, it might help us out on a rainy day, correct?
MP: Connecticut’s income tax structure is very sensitive to how Wall Street is doing. In good times in Connecticut, the money just flows in. So, the governor’s approach to this has been to avoid what he calls the yo-yo effect: in good times, you spend a lot, and then two, three years later, you have to make cutbacks in those areas. So again, his mantra has been stability and certainty.
WSHU: And what he’s got to show for that is we have a better credit rating now.
MP: Yes, the credit rating has been upgraded several times since the governor took office, and that means Connecticut can borrow money at a lower rate. The other argument he makes on behalf of his approach is that Connecticut’s fixed cost, and I’m talking about contributions, the annually, actuarially required contributions to the pension fund, they actually get lower as the financial condition of the pension funds improves. So by the governor’s calculation, the state is paying maybe $700 even $800 million less a year, and that is money available to do other things, which is the argument that he makes to offset the complaints that Connecticut is being a little bit too tight with Its money in this era of huge surpluses, and that there are significant unmet needs in Connecticut. Nobody really disagrees with that general point, that there are, in fact, unmet needs in this state.
WSHU: Okay, now let’s talk about the opposition the way it’s lining up right now. Let’s start with the Republican side. Who do we have opposing Lamont, and what are their arguments?
MP: Well, they’re not making any arguments yet, but there are two of them there. One is a declared candidate, and that is state senator Ryan Fazio. He’s 35 years old. He represents Greenwich. He is considered a rising star in the party. And then the other one is Erin Stewart, the mayor of New Britain, who’s been an interesting politician, given that she is a Republican who has done quite well in a democratic city of New Britain. She created an exploratory committee in January, and she has raised about $350,000. The significance of that is to qualify for Connecticut’s system of public financing of campaigns. That $350,000 is a very important number that you have to raise through small-dollar contributions to qualify for public grants. And she is expected to become a declared candidate sometime after the municipal elections next month. And the two of them, you know, there is at this point a generational contrast with the governor, the governor is 71, he would be the oldest governor to seek re-election since Wilbur Cross in 1938. But beyond that, their campaigns really have not developed yet, which is not surprising. They are in the early stages of really putting together the infrastructure of a campaign to challenge an incumbent whose approval ratings have been pretty good. There’s a little bit of softness on the question of a third term. You know, people generally think two terms are plenty, but in the end, it’ll come down to a binary choice.
WSHU: Talking about challenges, he’s also got some challenges coming from his left flank. His fellow Democrat, progressive Democrat Josh Elliot, has declared that he’s running. What is that shaping up to be?
MP: Representative Elliot really had trouble gaining support for his campaign as measured by his fundraising. And he told me the other day that when they file later this week, he’ll show that he’s raised about $45,000. His argument is, and his reason for being, I think, is twofold. One, there’s dissatisfaction among liberals in the Democratic Party with the governor’s fiscal conservatism. There has been a push to get him to be more willing to spend money for things like Medicaid reimbursement rates, you know, which are still pretty low in Connecticut, and that can impact the ability of people to get health care at times. There are some people who would like to see him far more aggressive in dealing with President Trump and immigration policies.
And then there’s the matter of the governor’s veto of the most significant housing bill to be sent to his desk since he’s been elected governor, and he really did side with suburban opponents and Republicans who said that the bill as written was too much of an intrusion into local zoning, and that, you know, again, that is a source of significant conflict with the governor.
WSHU: Do you think he’ll be able to solve it before he’s likely to formally declare after the November municipal elections, from what you’ve been able to discern, right?
MP: He has been negotiating a revised version. He has been expressing optimism, House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, a key sponsor of that bill, also has been expressing optimism about having a version that perhaps the General Assembly could adopt in special session by the end of the month, we’ll see. You know, these are two men who tend to offer an optimistic view of how things are going, but that is something that they hope to get done, and that would potentially ease some of the tensions with the left. But at the end of the day, if there’s no realistic alternative to Ned Lamont, you know, some of those folks generally come home. As it were, we’ve seen that with labor in the past. You had a lot of anger at Governor Dannel Malloy over his budgets. But in the end, when you have a choice, a binary choice, between a Democrat and a Republican, you know, labor generally comes home. The question is, do you lose some of the enthusiasm that you want to see in generating voter turnout?
WSHU: However, I like the way you ended your article with the quote from Lamont saying, I like where we are.
MP: That’s a contrast with the federal government and President Trump. And that is the other factor here. Our governor, let’s be honest, he’s not the most exciting politician we’ve ever seen, but that is part of, I think, the appeal that he will be making, you know, “I am Mr. Steady. I am Mr. Stable,” at a time where there’s some value in that. So we’ll see.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1002_SR_LamontPortrait_021-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 17:58:29.043940

New Mexico’s MVD announced Thursday that it is joining other states in no longer granting commercial driver’s licenses or commercial learner’s permits to certain foreign-born drivers. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
New Mexico’s Motor Vehicle Division will no longer issue or renew commercial driver’s licenses or learner’s permits to certain foreign-born drivers, according to a recent news release.
The announcement last week came about a week after the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration issued emergency interim rules seeking to crack down on what it says are immigrants illegally, and unsafely, driving semi trailers on nationwide highways. The MVD says its change announced Thursday complies with those interim rules.
According to the MVD, the division will only issue commercial licenses or permits to foreign nationals who have valid, unexpired foreign passports that have an I-94 form documenting their most recent entrance into the United States. 
That is also true for those with certain employment-based, non-immigrant visas — namely, the H-2A, H-2B and E-2 visas — according to an updated form MVD published this month listing the documents required to receive a CDL. 
The change mirrors those that have occurred in other states, and it comes after federal Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy publicly threatened to withhold funding from New Mexico and two other states if they didn’t comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order requiring commercial truck drivers to be proficient in English.
Trump administration threatens to yank funds for New Mexico, California and Washington over truckers’ English proficiency

New Mexico, Washington and Florida were all targeted with the funding cut threat because Duffy accused all three states of playing a role in a fatal crash involving a foreign truck driver in Florida. In that case, a Florida driver, an immigrant from India who did not have permanent legal authority to be in the country, made an illegal U-turn on the Florida Turnpike, caused a crash that killed three people in another vehicle, according to local reports.
The driver had a commercial license from California and Washington, and had been pulled over for speeding in New Mexico prior to crashing in Florida, Duffy said in August.
The interim rules the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration published said five fatal crashes this year, including the one in Florida, involved “non-domiciled CDL holders,” which typically refers to foreign-born commercial truck drivers. 
New Mexico has issued 204 CDLs and commercial learner’s permits to “non-domiciled” people in the state. According to federal data, about 37,178 drivers have active CDLs in New Mexico.
After Duffy threatened to withhold $7 million in funding from New Mexico, a spokesperson for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told Source New Mexico that the state’s “thorough and federally compliant process for issuing CDLs” requires English proficiency.
“We believe that a full review of the incidents in question will demonstrate that New Mexico is in full compliance with federal law and that New Mexico State Police are effectively enforcing safety regulations on our roadways,” spokesperson Michael Coleman said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4779-scaled-e1759786292702-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-10-06 17:58:29.043940

Ambler Road, planned by the state of Alaska’s development bank and supported by state officials and Alaska’s congressional delegation, would link the Dalton Highway with a mineral-rich region of northwest Alaska, providing access to the mining of rare minerals needed for batteries and high-technology manufacturing.
“It’s an economic gold mine, so to speak. I signed this years ago, and Biden un-signed it for me,” Trump told reporters on Monday at the White House. 
Last year, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management concluded that the road would have a litany of negative impacts, and the Biden administration issued a record of decisions saying that the best route for the project was no route at all.
The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, Alaska’s state-owned investment bank and the road’s developer, sued the Biden administration, seeking a reversal.
U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, speaking at the White House on Monday, said the state of Alaska requested an appeal of that decision, and that under federal law, President Trump has the executive authority to make decisions on land use.
The appeal in question was filed by AIDEA under Section 1106 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980.
“This opens up a wealth of resources,” Burgum said, adding that the federal government will also take partial ownership of Trilogy Metals, one of several firms exploring for minerals in northwest Alaska.

Larson’s $800,000 in the quarter ending Sept. 30.","Connecticut’s first serious intra-party challenge to a congressional incumbent produced a burst of fundraising claims Monday, with challenger Luke Bronin reporting $1.18 million to Congressman John B. Larson’s $800,000 in the quarter ending Sept. 30.
Neither campaign released full reports that would disclose sources of their funds, the extent of their early spending or cash on hand. Those are due Oct. 15 in public filings to the Federal Election Commission.

But Bronin, who opened a challenge on July 30 for the Democratic nomination, used the release of the partial numbers to deliver a dig over “corporate PACs” at Larson, whose voting record has not drawn criticism yet from any of his challengers.
“We know that we’re never going to raise as much as a 27-year incumbent who gets most of his money from corporate PACs, but these first two months show that we’re going to have what we need to compete and make a powerful case for change,” Bronin said in a statement at 9 a.m. Monday
The Larson campaign responded at 2 p.m. with a statement ignoring the gibe over political action committees and publicizing that he had raised “over $1 million this cycle,” a reference to all fundraising since Jan. 1. The campaign clarified that its quarterly number was $800,000.

Larson’s previous two quarterly filings show he had raised $249,345 through June 30, including $200,055 from committees. Bronin, who showed himself to be a prodigious fundraiser in two mayoral campaigns, has said he will not raise money from corporate political action committees.
“I am grateful for the outpouring of support from across the First District,” Larson said in his statement. “At a time when President Trump and his allies are attacking our democracy, targeting immigrant families, and labeling me an agitator for standing up to them, this campaign is powered by people who know what’s at stake. They know we cannot allow Trump to dismantle our Constitution, privatize Social Security, or roll back the rights we have fought for over generations.”
Larson and Bronin are two of five Democrats in the race. Ruth Fortune, a Hartford school board member, filed papers July 3 and was quickly followed by Councilman Jack Perry of Southington. By the end of August, the field included Bronin and state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford. Fortune, Perry and Gilchrest did not release fundraising numbers.
In the 5th District, which has offered Connecticut’s most competitive congressional races in recent cycles, Republican challenger George Logan spent $2.9 million last year in his second unsuccessful challenge to Democrat Jahana Hayes, who spent $3.8 million.
With the U.S. House closely divided, the Hayes-Logan fight also attracted outside partisan money unlikely to be present in a Democratic primary: $1.4 million in support of Hayes and $6421,540 in support of Logan.

Neubauer, 68, has sat on the District II Court of Appeals for 18 years after being appointed to the seat in 2007. Prior to joining the bench, she was a private practice attorney at Milwaukee-based Foley and Lardner. 
She ran unsuccessfully for the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2019 and was last elected to a six-year term on the appeals court in 2020, winning 54% of the vote in the 12-county southeastern Wisconsin district that is based in Waukesha County. 
She is also the mother of Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine). 
As the judicial liberals have slowly gained control of the Supreme Court over the past five years, District II has become the most reliably conservative appellate district. Neubauer is the only liberal on the four judge panel. 
“In these trying and divided times, our courts must protect our democracy, our liberty, and our rights, by maintaining judicial independence and upholding the constitution and the rule of law. I have attempted to do that with every single decision,” Neubauer said. 
Last week, conservative District II Judge Maria Lazar announced she is  running for the Supreme Court in next year’s April election.

Kiewit originally said they were owed almost $25 million for extra work on the project, a figure the Port Authority disagreed with.
Port Authority Chairman Paul Whitescarver said the agreement hasn’t added any more to the total cost for State Pier — which has ballooned from the original estimation of $93 million to more than $300 million.
“It’s just a matter of maybe we use some of the interest that was in the escrow account while we’ve been waiting around to do this,” Whitescarver said. “Maybe there are other ways we can move funds around to make this meet that requirement that we’re going to provide Kiewit. It’s a positive outcome for everybody, the bottom line doesn’t change, and quite frankly, I think everybody is pleased with how it came out.”
Three state legislative Republicans, Sen. Minority Leader Stephen Harding, Sen. Heather Somers, and Sen. Henri Martin, have sent a letter to the authority asking them why they didn’t tell the public about the $11 million figure.
“Is this true? If so, when will this information be made public? There was no public discussion about this at your recent meeting other than a vote,” the Senators said. “If this $11 million payout news is true, what will the new total cost for taxpayers be with regard to the State Pier project? As you know, we have repeatedly expressed frustration regarding the lack of transparency at the Port Authority.”
Costs at the State Pier ballooned due to underwater issues and design changes. The pier was developed to be a hub to support offshore wind construction.
Whitescarver said he wants the pier to be an asset to the region.
“If we had not partnered with offshore wind and Orsted and Eversource, the pier would still be looking like it was before,” Whitescarver said. “And we have gained roughly 11 acres of storage or flat space where we can do a heck of a lot more than we could before. We could do lumber, we did lumber before, but now we’ve got 11 more acres, we can put lumber on the pier. I just wish people would open their minds and realize what a great advantage it is for southeastern Connecticut.”

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows is confident law enforcement will ultimately uncover why 250 official ballots were allegedly delivered to a Newburgh home in an Amazon package. She also said the incident underscored that Maine’s processes work and that the state’s elections are safe and secure.
“Even if the most enterprising criminal were able to fabricate Maine ballots or Maine absentee ballot envelopes or if that chain of custody were broken, our elections would remain free, safe and secure because of the checks and balances in absentee voting itself,” Bellows said at a news conference at the State House Monday afternoon. 
Monday also marked the first day of in-person absentee voting throughout the state for the November election. 
In order to vote absentee, lawfully registered Maine voters must specifically request a ballot, Bellows explained. Those requests are tracked in the central voter registration system. Additionally, the Secretary of State’s office uploads public files in the lead up to the election that list absentee ballot requests. 
Bellows outlined the various steps in Maine’s absentee voting process including how the ballots are returned in secure envelopes to clerks throughout the state. With that process in place, Bellows underscored her faith in the safety of Maine elections. 
At the same time, her office continues to work with law enforcement to investigate the Newburgh incident. In response to several questions from the press, Bellows repeatedly said she couldn’t provide specific details because the investigation is ongoing.
“Those checks and balances in our production and distribution of ballots have been in place for a long time,” Bellows said. “Clearly, there was an interruption in the process this time so we will certainly do an after-action to evaluate how we can safeguard against any bad actor who seeks to interrupt that chain of custody.”
Despite sharing that the town of Ellsworth reported that it was missing 250 ballots the same day that the conservative news website the Maine Wire reported a Newburgh woman discovered official Maine ballots inside an Amazon shipment, Bellows said Monday that the towns of Ellsworth and Newburgh have all the ballots they need. The woman who reportedly found the ballots has not spoken with other news outlets. 
Republican legislators have raised concern about the incident and sent a letter to the Trump administration asking the Federal Bureau of Investigation to open a probe into potential violations of federal law. 
One of the two questions on November’s statewide ballot would make a series of significant changes to Maine election laws, including requiring voters to show certain identification when voting and limiting absentee voting access.

(Photo courtesy of University of Northern Iowa)For Bill Henninger, retiring has given him the ability to wake up in the morning with plenty of options for how to fill his day. The former law enforcement officer and Cedar Falls resident said he gets to decide whether to head to the YMCA for a swim, take out one of his four bicycles for a ride or go grab a beer “with the fellas.”
However fun being retired may be, Henninger said he still found himself bored and without anything like a job driving him to go out and do things.. That’s where the Cedar Valley Men’s Shed came in.
Since joining the group, Henninger and other men looking for friends and chances to put their hands and minds to work have participated in trail cleanups, visited museums, built garden beds and other structures, discussed aging and other topics with University of Northern Iowa students and more.
“It just seemed like I needed something to get me involved in, where every Wednesday I know I need to be somewhere because I’m part of this group,” Henninger said.

Melinda Heinz, an assistant professor teaching gerontology at UNI, founded the Men’s Shed in Cedar Falls nearly one year ago and organizes the group’s activities, though she said she doesn’t add much to the activities and interactions taking place among members.
The goal behind Men’s Sheds, which has chapters across the U.S. and world, is to fight against social isolation among men, especially later in life, and help them form a strong social support network.
Her research into men’s health, relationships and Men’s Sheds in other areas made her realize the need for such a group in her own backyard. Now, Heinz said, she’s seeing around 10 men at the average meeting and hearing about its success in bringing people together, even outside of events.
“It’s kind of these organic relationships that started at the shed, but are growing from there,” Heinz said.
The group meets weekly, once a month on the UNI campus and the rest of the time traveling for volunteer work, guest discussions and other activities. Some guest speakers for the group have decided to join themselves, Heinz said, which is always welcomed.
Heinz first learned about Men’s Sheds when traveling with students in Ireland, later receiving a Fulbright scholarship to head back to the country and study the initiative further. Although the groups originally started in Australia, Ireland has more groups per capita than any other country in the world, according to a UNI news release.
When she’s asked about the shed and why it’s needed, Heinz said she tells people about how men’s social circles are often smaller than women’s, especially later in life. Many men’s identities stem from their work, she said, and retiring can both shrink their social circle and chip away at that part of themselves. Participating in the Men’s Shed could help ease the transition into retirement and provide them with increased support.
“Thinking about the Men’s Shed as a really important community resource is something that I really try to instill in people that I’m talking with,” Heinz said.
Anyone can form a shed, Heinz said, and more information on how to do so can be found online.
A tidbit shared by Heinz has stuck with Henninger, he said, that men form stronger bonds when “they are shoulder-to-shoulder, working on a project, and not just sitting around the table talking.” He’s found the truth of the statement within himself, and seen what a lack of these bonds can do to those who didn’t find them.
One friend of Henninger’s who retired several years ago struggles with his mental health, Henninger said, which he believes is at least in part due to the isolation that comes with not leaving the home and maintaining relationships.
“You give me something I’m supposed to do, and then I’m like a beagle in tall grass trying to find a fox. I’m going to go in head-first, as fast as I can,” Henninger said. “So I just noticed that with other guys that, you know, give us something to do, no matter how small it is, and it’s like, okay, now I gotta focus in life for an hour, or a week, or whatever it may be. So I think that’s why it’s important for men.”

They've been inciting violence,” Leavitt said.Mainstream local media reports and statements from local officials have contradicted that claim.​​""There is no need for military intervention in Oregon. There is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security,” Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said in a statement Sunday.Federal agents used tear gas and pepper balls on nonviolent protesters Saturday evening, according to local media reports.Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker also filed a legal challenge against the administration Monday morning. A federal judge set a hearing for Thursday. Illinois and Chicago sought a temporary restraining order to stop Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from ordering Texas and Illinois Guard troops to the country’s third-largest city.Trump teases Insurrection Act Trump on Monday afternoon raised the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807, a tool to expand the president’s legal authority for using military personnel for domestic law enforcement.Asked by a reporter in the Oval Office the conditions under which he would invoke the law, Trump said “if it was necessary,” and speculated that he could use it to defy courts or state officials.“So far it hasn’t been necessary,” he said. “But we have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I’d do that. If people were getting killed and courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I’d do that. I want to make sure that people aren’t killed. We have to make sure our cities are safe.”Court battle in Portland In Oregon, federal District Judge Karin Immergut broadened her order Sunday night barring the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard troops to Portland. The edict came after Trump and Hegseth defied a temporary restraining order that Immergut issued Saturday halting 200 Oregon National Guard troops from being sent there. Immergut was nominated by Trump in 2019 and confirmed by the U.S. Senate by voice vote.The administration maintains the Guard is needed to protect federal agents, as sustained small protests pop up outside an ICE facility 2 miles south of city hall. Kotek rebuffed Trump’s claims that the city is “on fire” and said local authorities are equipped to handle the demonstrations that lately range from a dozen or so people to roughly 100.Trump ordered 101 California National Guard troops to Portland overnight, without the knowledge of Kotek, she said Sunday. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat, confirmed that Trump had ordered up to 300 of his state’s National Guard troops to Oregon. Just before Immergut’s Sunday night emergency hearing, an Oregon assistant attorney general filed a memo with the court showing that Hegseth had ordered 400 Texas National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago.California joined Oregon and Portland in suing the administration.‘A domestic militarization’Pritzker said he has urged Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to “immediately withdraw his support for this decision and refuse to allow Texas National Guard members to be used in this way.”“Let me be clear, Donald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarize our nation’s cities,” Pritzker said at a press conference Monday afternoon.Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said the deployment “is unfair to National Guardsmen, it is unfair to local law enforcement, and it is certainly unfair to the law-abiding citizens of Illinois who do not want to be subject to military occupation.”Chicago is nearly a month into a federal immigration crackdown. Dozens of federal agents raided an apartment building in the city’s South Shore neighborhood on Sept. 30, ziptying adults and children, and detaining some U.S. citizens, according to multiple media reports. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security published a highly produced video of the raid on social media.Trump’s federalization and deployment of National Guard troops to mostly Democratic-run states has alarmed political and constitutional experts. Pat Eddington, senior fellow in homeland and civil liberties at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he agrees with Pritzker’s concerns.“I share his belief 100% that the use of the American military and all these massive employment of ICE and HSI and FBI and marshals and the rest for ostensible immigration enforcement and ostensible crime control, it's really designed to lay the groundwork to normalize a militarization, essentially a domestic militarization of Americans, civic life,” Eddington told States Newsroom in an interview in late September.On a Monday afternoon press call, Hima Shansi, the head of the American Civil Liberties Union’s national security program, said Trump’s use of military and federal police forces in recent months “raises serious constitutional concerns in terms of federalism, the separation of powers between the federal government and the states which generally exercise police power.”“What that means in real-people language is that, as the states have been saying, they are fully capable of doing their jobs as needed, and there is absolutely no reason for the president to assert federal power in the way that he is forcibly doing.”Starting in Los AngelesTrump federalized California National Guard troops and deployed U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in June in response to protests against aggressive immigration enforcement there. Newsom objected to the plan and sued to stop the deployment. A federal judge initially sided with the Democratic governor and blocked the deployment, but an appeals panel reversed the decision. The trial court ruled again in September that Trump had overstepped the line separating military forces from law enforcement. The administration has appealed.While that case in California was ongoing, Trump also ordered the District of Columbia National Guard to assist local police in the nation’s capital. Because the district is a federal territory, it is relatively clear that move was within the president’s legal authority, even if many Trump critics questioned its necessity. National Guard troops from several Republican states also deployed to the district in a more legally dubious move.Trump also ordered Tennessee National Guard troops to Memphis last month, with the approval of the state’s Republican governor.Ashley Murray reported from Washington, D.C.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to use a hub in Vermont to bolster its digital surveillance capabilities as the agency ramps up operations across the country at the direction of leaders in President Donald Trump’s administration.
According to federal contracting records, which were first reported by the technology magazine Wired, ICE plans to hire at least a dozen contracted workers for the effort at its National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center, which is located in an unassuming business park in Williston. In addition, the agency would hire at least 16 contracted workers at a similar intelligence-gathering facility in Santa Ana, Calif. 
The Vermont center is off Industrial Avenue, located a short drive from Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport. It is largely unmarked from the outside and, according to Wired, handles investigations from across the eastern part of the country.
Workers there already generate leads for ICE’s Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, according to agency documents, compiling information field agents can then use to locate people ICE is targeting for deportation and other enforcement.

Draft plans published last week state, however, that ICE has had “limited success” using social media platforms and other information that’s available on the open web — which includes sites accessible to the public via search engines — for enforcement. The plans refer to an existing contractor though do not provide any specifics about it.
Under the latest plans, a contractor would use sites such as Facebook, Instagram and X — and could, in addition, use powerful online commercial, law enforcement and federal government databases — to generate leads about “individuals who pose a danger to national security, risk public safety or otherwise meet ICE enforcement priorities.” 
Details collected could include people’s social media posts and the locations tagged in them, according to the plans. The contractor could also be asked to find information about targeted people’s “associates,” including family members and coworkers, for the purpose of determining someone’s whereabouts, the plans from last week state.
The documents are a Request for Information, meaning the government is looking for details on the feasibility of its plan but is not yet actively soliciting contractors. Work on the plan could begin in May 2026, per the records. 
ICE’s media relations office did not immediately respond to a request for comment or additional information about its plans for contracted work at the Industrial Avenue office.
That location is just one of several ICE facilities in Vermont. They include another one close by in Williston, next to the Maple Tree Place shopping center, called its Law Enforcement Support Center. That office is ICE’s national hub for coordinating with other law enforcement agencies and also houses the infrastructure for a major tip line. 
ICE also has a field office in St. Albans where it holds mandatory meetings with people it is monitoring and, in at least one recent high-profile case, held someone the agency had previously arrested overnight.
The plans are not the first time ICE has sought contracts to bolster its surveillance operations. Earlier this year, for instance, the agency inked an agreement with Palantir Technologies, the firm co-founded by the billionaire Peter Thiel, to build software aimed at streamlining the process of identifying and deporting people the agency is targeting. The plan has faced sharp criticism from privacy and immigrant rights advocates.
James Duff Lyall, head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont, said in an emailed statement Monday that the plans for the Williston office warranted greater scrutiny to ensure they would not undermine people’s privacy.
“Any increase in ICE presence or activity must be scrutinized, given the agency’s long history of abuse, lack of accountability, and disregard for our constitutional rights,” Lyall said. “That includes its reported expansion of digital surveillance efforts, a project which will be staffed in our own backyard and will involve surveilling the online activity of large swaths of the general public.”

 What happened?

A Waukesha County judge on Friday ordered the Wisconsin Elections Commission to determine whether any noncitizens are registered to vote and to stop accepting voter registrations without verifying that the applicant is a U.S. citizen.
 What’s the dispute?

A Pewaukee resident, represented by conservative attorneys, filed a lawsuit last year seeking to require the election commission to verify citizenship of registered voters and applicants. The suit also sought to force the Wisconsin Department of Transportation to compare its citizenship information against voter rolls.
The election commission opposed the initial request, saying that no state law called for requiring documented proof of citizenship. It also argued that the DOT has no obligation to match citizenship data with voter records.
Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Michael Maxwell rejected the commission’s argument, saying that the agency is failing in its duty to ensure that only lawful voters make it to the voter roll. He cited several statutes that he said made clear that only citizens could cast a ballot.
Maxwell didn’t specify how the election commission and local clerks should verify citizenship of new registrants, or how the commission should check for noncitizens on the voter rolls. He only called for the parties to figure out a plan, whether that be through matching the DOT’s citizenship data or using “other lawfully available means.” He called for that process to be substantially completed before the next statewide election, which is February.
Currently, applicants for voter registration in Wisconsin and most other states must attest, under penalty of perjury, that they are U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote, but they are not required to present proof of citizenship.
The issue of noncitizen voting has been hotly debated in recent years, though no widespread instances have been found. Republicans have used the concern to call for citizenship proof checks of all voters, even as data shows that such measures risk disenfranchising some U.S. citizens.
Republicans praised the decision, with state Rep. Amanda Nedweski calling it a “great win for election integrity.”
Democrats and the respondents in the case were largely mum.
Election commission spokesperson Emilee Miklas didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Riley Vetterkind, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which represents the commission and Department of Transportation, declined to say whether the agencies would appeal the decision.
 Who are the parties? 

The current plaintiffs, Pewaukee resident Ardis Cerny and Waukesha resident Annette Kuglitsch, sued the election commission, Department of Transportation, and officials in both agencies. They have argued that the election commission is violating their voting rights by not checking for noncitizens already registered to vote and seeking to vote.
Maxwell agreed, saying they “have a clear legal right to not have their votes diluted by a non-citizen casting an unlawful ballot.”
 What happens now? 

It’s unclear how the commission would verify the citizenship of all of Wisconsin’s registered voters by February. Bryna Godar, a staff attorney at the University of Wisconsin Law School’s State Democracy Research Initiative, said the decision will “definitely be appealed” and that the lower-court decision could be stayed while the appeal goes through the courts.
If the case reaches the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the liberal majority could overturn the order of the conservative-leaning Waukesha County Circuit Court.

Robert Craven is ceding his position as chairman of the powerful House Committee on Judiciary and intends to leave politics altogether after his term ends next year.
Rep. Robert Craven bows out of Rhode Island Attorney General race

Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, said in a statement issued Monday afternoon his decision to step aside was in the best interest of his family. He has led the 15-member panel responsible for shaping the state’s penal code and judicial system since the start of the 2019 legislative session.
“Through seven years as chair, I was privileged to shepherd issues like women’s reproductive health, gun safety and the environment that matter deeply to Rhode Islanders,” he said in a statement. “While I will continue to serve the people of North Kingstown through the end of my term, I will not seek re-election.”
Craven, 69, launched his long-planned campaign for attorney general of Rhode Island on Sept. 29, but ended his run on Thursday, Oct. 2, amid renewed scrutiny of domestic assault charges from two decades ago.
The charges have since been expunged, but Craven in his statement Monday alluded to how the focus on his past has personally affected him.
“Many people have reached out to me over the past few days,” he said. “Some I know from my work as a representative, others are colleagues in the law, friends, and some are strangers who are on their own journey of hope and redemption. I am grateful for their support and understanding as I continue on my own personal journey.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi did not immediately comment on Craven’s decision.
Craven, who works as an attorney in his private practice in North Kingstown, was first elected to represent House District 32 in 2012.

Steve Daines recently opined that he believes the drug mifepristone is not safe, while providing nothing but a debunked study.On Sept. 23, the Helena Independent Record published an opinion piece by Montana’s Republican Sen. Steve Daines,  “The abortion pill is harmful to women.” 
Mifepristone, nicknamed “the abortion pill,” is the medicine that Daines is attacking. In the United States and globally, mifepristone is widely used, particularly for medication abortions. Its use has increased steadily through the years, though access and usage statistics differ by country and region. Mifepristone is also used for other medical conditions, like managing miscarriages and treating Cushing’s syndrome. Mifepristone has been approved for use in nearly 100 countries as of mid-2023.
On several points Daines is wrong and giving incorrect information about the drug. First, he states, “In 2000, the FDA required three in-person doctor appointments for mifepristone. Today none are required. Pills can be dispensed by mail and sold at drugstores lie Walgreens and CVS without any medical oversight.” This is blatantly not true. Mifepristone cannot be purchased without a prescription because it is a restricted medication under the FDA’s Mifepristone REMS Program, requiring a prescription from a certified healthcare provider or a certified pharmacy to dispense. Although telemedicine and mail-order options are available in some states, a valid prescription is still necessary to obtain the medication safely and legally from these certified providers or pharmacies. 
Daines cites a study created by the Ethics and Public Policy Center as the basis of his criticism of the use of the drug. The study’s authors, Jamie Bryan Hall, EPPC’s director of data analysis, and Ryan Anderson, the organization’s president, are not health experts, and neither seems to have a record of publishing scientific research through peer review. Their methods deviated wildly from what is standard in the world of health research, and so, predictably, did their conclusions: In sharp contrast to dozens of trials conducted around the globe over decades, the EPPC report determined that mifepristone is a danger to women. 
The study lacks basic transparency about how that assessment was made. The authors relied on data from an insurance database that, according to the report, included more than 800,000 mifepristone abortions from 2017 to 2023. But the authors don’t actually say which database they used, so there’s no way for anybody to try to re-create their analysis to see if they receive the same results. The report also took some peculiar methodological steps to arrive at its conclusions.
The authors counted episodes in which a surgical procedure was required to complete the abortion after mifepristone—patients require additional treatment in about 1-in-20 cases, so the FDA considers this a recognized outcome rather than an adverse effect. They counted “other life-threatening adverse events,” including heart problems and mental-health concerns, that women in the study experienced in the weeks after the abortion—which may have had nothing to do with mifepristone. The authors did not effectively distinguish between the outcomes of abortions and of miscarriages treated with mifepristone, or between normal amounts of post-abortion bleeding and severe hemorrhage.
In short, the report is not a study in the traditional sense and not conclusive proof of anything. Daines is following the lead of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in using pseudo-scientific studies and their bogus conclusions to further a political agenda. Once again, the so called “smaller government” Republican Senator wants to have the government intrude into women’s personal moral and medical decisions, to create a situation where, as he puts it, “abortion is unthinkable.” He also states that he will “continue to work with the administration to protect women and fight for the most vulnerable in our society.” If you’re pre-natal, he’s your protector. If you’re pre-school, you’re on your own.
Sen. Daines, please explain to us how interfering in the very personal medical and moral decisions that women may have to make protects them? From whom are you protecting them? Big Pharma? Or themselves? 
Meanwhile, Daines regularly votes against any legislation that would bring expanded aid or relief to people who are struggling to survive on incomes below the poverty level or expand medical insurance or coverage. He has consistently voted against legislation like the Women’s Health Protection Act, and for tax breaks for Big Pharma and other corporations who benefit from our current dysfunctional health system. So much for being a “champion of the poor and oppressed, women and children.”

The latest report on disciplinary action involving Vermont State Police troopers reveals one officer facing a sexual harassment investigation has resigned. 
The twice-yearly report released Thursday from the Vermont Department of Public Safety and the State Police Advisory Commission covers the period July 1–Dec. 31, 2024.
The State Police Advisory Commission, according to its website, provides “advice and counsel” to the public safety commissioner on misconduct allegations that lead to internal investigations against Vermont State Police members.
In total, the report lists four incidents of alleged misconduct, with three of them leading to “unfounded” determinations.
The identities of the troopers, as well as identifying details of the incidents, are withheld because internal affairs investigations are confidential by law.
The reports provide only brief descriptions about the nature of each incident and alleged violation, leading to complaints that not much can be learned from them.
There are times when the identities of troopers involved in alleged misconduct do become public, particularly when criminal charges are filed. 
One incident covered by the latest report involved an allegation that a state police officer violated the sexual harassment policy. 
“The member resigned before the completed investigation could be reviewed and adjudicated by the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety,” the report added.
Two other incidents listed in the report involved state police internal reviews of shootings to determine whether the officers involved complied with use-of-force policies. In both instances, the cases followed separate reviews by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office and the relevant state’s attorney’s offices.
According to the report, the actions by the state police members were “determined to meet use of force policy standards.” 
The fourth incident, which the report stated was determined to be “unfounded,” involved an allegation that a state trooper had violated an out-of-state fish and wildlife regulation.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-06 20:44:43+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT faith leaders, advocates press lawmakers to protect immigrants",Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/06/ct-rally-immigrant-safety/,"Faith leaders and immigrant advocates held a rally Monday outside the Capitol, urging CT lawmakers to prioritize immigrant safety.","As state legislators inside the Capitol in Hartford discussed the possibility of a special session on Monday, faith leaders and immigrant advocates rallied outside the building,  urging the lawmakers to prioritize immigrant safety.
The large crowd had marched from the federal courthouse to the Capitol for their rally, with signs that read “Hands Off Our Neighbors” and “Gov. Lamont: Immigrant Protections Can’t Wait” and chanting “No hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!”
In recent months, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, often wearing masks, have detained people across Connecticut, at federal courthouses, carwashes, and from their vehicles.
Many of the speakers at Monday’s rally were faith leaders in Connecticut. Reverend Josh Pawelek of the Unitarian Universalist Society East in Manchester, said that he, along with many advocates at the rally, had worked hard to put protections for immigrants into an updated version of the TRUST Act when lawmakers were in session earlier this year.
“It was infuriating when the bill that we wanted got out of the Judiciary Committee and then just got watered down. And so many of the good things that were in that bill — the things that immigrants needed to be safe in our state — went away in that strange way that laws get made in Connecticut,” Pawelek said. 
Pawelek urged those gathered to scan a QR code distributed on flyers through the crowd that would link them to a page to write to lawmakers.
Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, also spoke at the rally. In his district, an August raid by masked ICE agents took place at a Newington car wash. Lesser said the state has the ability to better protect immigrants, but, “we need strong laws that apply equally to anyone who is depriving the civil rights of anyone in this state. Connecticut can play an important role, but we have a choice to make. And I’m hoping we do so soon.”
After the rally ended, Lesser said there are two schools of thought among lawmakers inside the Capitol: “One that Connecticut should take a more confrontational approach, and one that we should keep our heads down.” While Lesser said he understands why some lawmakers favor a more passive approach, “I just don’t think that’s going to work, I don’t think that’s how you stop a bully.”
Constanza Segovia, one of the leaders of Hartford Deportation Defense, also spoke at Monday’s rally. She updated the crowd on the case of Victor Sanchez, an activist with Make the Road and HDD, who was detained  in September when he arrived to federal court for a routine check-in.
“I have amazing news to share with you all,” Segovia said, announcing that Sanchez had been released from detention. But that news was tempered by the stipulation that Sanchez was given just 30 days to leave the country. 
Segovia said her group planned to keep fighting for Sanchez to be able to stay in the U.S. She also read some words in both Spanish and English from Sanchez, who said he was blessed to be a member of the community.  
“When I was in detention, I talked to people who didn’t have anything — no documents, prepared in packets, no communities or organizations rallying in support. The reason I am here today is because of all of my community support and the organizing of my community. That people united will never be defeated.” 
Segovia told those gathered that lawmakers should act on several concerns the immigrant community has: “We need to protect our personal information from the federal government. Am I right? We need to protect our communities and make sure that our tax dollars are not being spent to assist immigration enforcement in Connecticut.” 
Segovia also said that funding should be directed so that no one, regardless of immigration status, loses Medicaid coverage or access to food assistance programs.
Judiciary Committee Co-chair Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said in an interview that lawmakers would continue to look for ways to support immigrants in Connecticut, if given the opportunity during a special session, which must be called by Gov. Ned Lamont. “We’ll continue to try and do what we can to make sure people feel safe in our state, despite the threatening and frankly harassment coming from the federal government,” he said.
In September, the judicial branch issued a new policy to ban federal agents from making immigration related arrests inside of Connecticut courthouses without a judicial warrant or signed order. The policy also bans mask-wearing inside of courthouses, unless the mask is medically necessary and has received prior authorization from a judicial authority.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4934-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 16:59:46.927655

Aerospace engineering is a challenge for anyone—and as a first-generation college student, Maria faced additional hurdles. With strength, hard work and the support of community, Maria persevered. Now, she’s carving out a career as an aerospace engineer. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Protons to planes: Maria Tye turns a love of chemistry into a career i[...]","Maria was in high school when she first heard the words “chemical engineering.” She remembers that she did really well in chemistry class that year… so well, that her teacher suggested she think about studying chemical engineering in college. “It sounded fun and challenging and like something that would be economically sound,” Maria remembers. She was good at math and knew she wanted to build a stable future. “We went through some tough times when I was a kid and I wanted things to be different.” 
Maria’s now working as a project engineer at Amphenol Aerospace, a company that develops electrical connectors for aerospace vehicles. Her work focuses mainly on the commercial side. She’s been part of projects tied to the growing industry of electric aircraft.
“Every day is different,” she says. “As a chemical engineer, we end up in a variety of positions. The skills are transferable because of the depth of the studies. You depend on your team members. You learn a lot about networking. It transfers quite a bit into the workplace.”
Staying grounded with the support of family and the outdoors
Maria’s path to engineering started far from aerospace. Maria is the second youngest in a family of seven kids. When she was little, her family lived in Texas. She was only 5 years old when her family lost most of their belongings in a fire. That’s when they decided to relocate to Vermont. It took a few years for the family to get back on their feet; Maria was in eighth grade when her parents proudly bought their first house in South Burlington.
“Mom started working again when my youngest sibling started school. We had state support and lots of help,” she says. 
“My parents still have this massive table that they got as a donation from someone to help them get on their feet. Everyone still gathers around it, but we don’t fit sitting down anymore,” she laughs. Along with her siblings and their partners, there are 11 nieces and nephews. “There’s always a ton of people around.”
Maria was quiet and studious as a child; she received extensive support from her teachers. In middle school, she struggled with homework until a teacher challenged her. “She told me I could get into a higher math class early if I could get my homework done. That motivated me.”
Books and libraries were a constant. “I’ve always been a big bookworm. I read all the time and I loved the library.” 
She also found joy outdoors, with summers spent working for the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps. “I worked and did four weeks living out in the woods, then did seven weeks the next summer because I liked it so much. I like hiking a lot. I wish I did more of it as an adult,” she laughs. 
Finding her way with the help of VSAC
College was not a given for Maria. Neither of her parents had gone—her mom didn’t finish high school—and while her parents encouraged her, they were anxious about costs. “They had no clue. They didn’t know a credit score was involved,” she says. 
That’s where VSAC came in. Through VSAC’s Talent Search and GEAR UP career and college readiness programs, she connected with Outreach Counselors Matt “Beagle” Bourgault and Nancy Schwartz. “They helped with college tours and with understanding the requirements of the paperwork. I still have a professional email because Beagle let me know ‘Tinkerbell’ wasn’t the best email to have on my college applications,” she laughs.
She learned to make her own appointments, gather information, and advocate for herself. “VSAC helped me with the grant programs and timelines, and the “how” of looking at colleges. They’d meet me in the library and go over things, checking on everything, and asking me about my aspirations. They were there to help students like me who needed the extra help. And, they helped me look at what degrees could get me where I wanted to be.”
When it came time to choose, Clarkson University rose to the top. “It was the only college I could find that had chemical engineering. It was a good engineering school. I had a gut feeling in my research, so I applied and was so excited when I was accepted.”
Financing Clarkson, however, was a constant challenge. “My parents’ credit score wasn’t good enough to help me get the loans I needed. We didn’t realize that would be an issue. I almost didn’t finish college because of it.” 
Her grandparents helped her first semester, then a friend’s parent stepped in and cosigned a loan for her. “I ran track and field with this friend, and their parent stepped in to help me. It was really a miracle and it got me through until my uncle could help. It was a real motivator for me too, I was determined to do good enough that I didn’t fail them.”
A few years after graduating, she paid off that loan. “Getting that loan was so hard…I almost couldn’t see a way to finish college that one year until I got that help. It’s amazing to think I’ve actually paid the loan off.”
Learning to lean on her peers
College pushed Maria academically and socially. “It forced me to be social. I was more of an independent, older-than-my-years kind of person in high school. Clarkson broadened my horizons.”
She leaned on peers to get through the difficult program. “You can’t survive that degree at Clarkson without leaning on your peers. You learn networking and teamwork.”
But she also struggled. “I had some struggles with mental health that I really had to work through. It was close—I was close to thinking I might not graduate.”
She joined Alpha Phi Omega, a co-ed fraternity focused on community service, and also worked a few on campus jobs. Over the summer, she took a job in manufacturing. “I did a lot of sheet metal work—finishing and minor operations–on industrial kitchen appliances. I wanted to DO the hard stuff. A lot of people don’t have an eye into manufacturing, and I think it’s really helped me.”
Graduation was a family affair. “My parents and mi abuela were there, and my uncle was there. I showed them around campus. It was surreal.”
Building a career
Maria’s first job after Clarkson was as an operator in circuit board etching at an aerospace manufacturer. She stayed in aerospace, but moved into environmental engineering, then product engineering and operations program management.
Eventually she landed at Amphenol Aerospace, where she works today. “I bridge the gap between various disciplines and focus on new products. Every day is different.” 
Outside of work, Maria’s personal life has also taken flight with her partner Gerald, whom she’s been with for 12 years. They met at Clarkson, and he also works in the aerospace industry, but on the computer engineering side.
Looking back, moving forward
Reflecting on her journey, Maria is clear: VSAC made the difference. “I wouldn’t have made it without them. Having that person who has faith in you, it was everything. I wouldn’t have understood all the details, gotten to see the colleges, or what the environment would be like. And the value of meeting other students in similar positions was huge. There were a lot of other first-gen students I met through VSAC. All of us did remarkable things to get where we did.”
Maria is proud of where she is today. She’s in a stable, challenging career that excites her, with the tools to support herself and her health. “I work a decent job and can afford the medical support and the counseling. It’s still a work in progress, but supporting myself in that way has been fantastic. And my job? Every day is unique and fun and interesting. I’m proud of where I’ve gotten. And I know I didn’t get here alone.”

Uthmeier’s lengthy letter of support is the latest turn of legal events involving […],"Florida Attorney General and Orange County Sheriff John Mina in Orlando on April 14, 2025. (Screenshot from video from James Uthmeier's X account)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier led 21 states in a brief filed with the U.S. Supreme Court Monday supporting a Tallahassee mother who claimed her rights were violated when a local middle school created a secret plan supporting her child switching genders.
Uthmeier’s lengthy letter of support is the latest turn of legal events involving January Littlejohn, now a banner for parental rights in GOP Circles, and her then-13-year-old child who attended a gender-support meeting at Deerlake Middle School in 2020 that school staff allegedly intentionally kept secret from Littlejohn. They followed the policy laid out in the district’s LGBTQ+ guide dissuading teachers from “outing” students to their parents.
“Parental rights have taken on new focus as an ever-growing number of public-school officials are placing it upon themselves to make life-altering decisions for children in place of, or in direct conflict with, parents’ convictions,” Uthmeier wrote in the friend of the court brief, joined by 21 other states.
“That unfortunate phenomenon is front and center in this case,” he continued, criticizing school officials for hiding the “social transition” from the Littlejohns. “This sort of intervention is highly destructive and can lead to permanent damage to the child’s mental and physical health.”
Now a prominent speaker for the right-wing Moms for Liberty organization and the inspiration for Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law, Littlejohn in 2021 took her case against Leon County Schools to state and federal courts, although she was rejected at every turn.
In March of this year, a three-judge federal appeals panel ruled against her because the district’s actions, though Littlejohn disagreed with them, did not “shock the conscience.” This legal precedent determines whether egregious misconduct violated a person’s rights. Littlejohn attempted in July to have the court rehear her case, but it quietly dismissed it.
“Defendants did not force the Littlejohns’ child to do anything at all. And perhaps most importantly, defendants did not act with intent to injure,” Judge Robin Rosenbaum of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit wrote in the March opinion. “To the contrary, they sought to help the child.”
January Littlejohn holds a sign reading, “It’s time to take about detransition.” (Via January Littlejohn’s Facebook, Sep. 22, 2025)
Littlejohn’s outrage quickly sparked statewide attention. The GOP-dominated Legislature responded by ushering in the 2022 “Don’t Say Gay” law, which banned teachers from discussing sexuality with students and allowed parents to sue school districts over curriculum they deemed inappropriate.
In March, Littlejohn was First Lady Melania Trump’s special guest at President Donald Trump’s joint session to Congress. Trump lauded her as a “courageous advocate” for parental rights, and claimed cases like hers are why he signed a January executive order blocking funds for schools promoting “gender ideology.”
Similar cases have cropped up nationwide. The U.S. Supreme Court is considering a nearly-identical case out of Massachusetts, in which an 11-year-old’s parents were allegedly kept in the dark when the school helped the child socially transition. Tammy Fournier, a Wisconsin mother who successfully sued when her 12-year-old’s school “refused” to refer to the child as female, filed her own letter in support of Littlejohn on Monday.
Other supporters who have filed briefs supporting Littlejohn include 10 conservative organizations and a transgender psychologist who has warned against helping minors transition.
What happened?
Littlejohn’s 13-year-old child, born female, asked to be referred to by a male name with they/them pronouns ahead of the 2020-2021 school year. Littlejohn told the child’s teacher that the school could use the nickname “J,” but she didn’t want staff using different pronouns for her child.
According to emails obtained by The Tallahassee Democrat, Littlejohn told the teacher that, “If she wants to go by the name (redacted) with her teachers, I won’t stop her.” Littlejohn added that they did not use the male name at home.
The school later called a meeting with the school counselor, staff, and the child to create a Student Support Plan to help socially transition the child. Per district law, the school did not tell the Littlejohns about the plan, nor did they release the details in the following months.
This came from Leon County’s LGBTQ+ guide warning staff against telling parents if their child was not heterosexual, because “[o]uting a student, especially to parents, can be very dangerous to the student’s health and well-being.”
The Littlejohns sued in federal court, which case was promptly dismissed, and then in a federal appeals court, hoping to receive financial damages and ban the LGBTQ+ guide. The three-judge panel sided against the parents in March and refused to hear the case again in July.
On Sep. 3, the Littlejohns filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court questioning whether a court can deny relief for a violation of a “fundamental right” if the infringement did not “shock the conscience.” The case bounces off of the Massachusetts case, which asks the Supreme Court to decide whether a public school “violates parents’ fundamental constitutional right” when it secretly helps “transition” their child to a new gender.
The letter of support submitted by Uthmeier was co-signed by the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Texas. They were joined by Arizona’s Speaker of the House and Senate President.

WINDSOR — Three Vermont school districts in the Upper Valley say they are willing to become one.
The Mountain Views Supervisory Union, Hartford School District and Windsor Southeast Supervisory Union presented a letter to a state task force on Sept. 29 indicating they are open to being combined into one educational unit.
Merging “will be a practical and effective path to meeting the state’s goals while protecting our communities and ensuring the long-term sustainability of our schools,” read letter read, which was signed by members of all three boards.
The school redistricting task force formed in July following the passage of Act 73, an education reform bill. The 11-member group includes state Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, and Jay Badams, a recently-retired SAU 70 superintendent who lives in Strafford.

The group is charged with redrawing Vermont’s school districts so each has between 4,000 and 8,000 students. Together, the three districts would have about 3,700 students, which is close to the minimum target size of 4,000, said Keri Bristow, chair of the Mountain Views school board. 
Members of the three school boards held a special meeting Sept. 18 to discuss the possibility of partnering in the face of the impending changes.
State Rep. Elizabeth Burrows, D-West Windsor, who also serves on the Windsor Southeast Supervisory Union School Board, reached out to the other boards to invite them to the meeting. Windsor Southeast includes students from Windsor, West Windsor, Hartland and Weathersfield.
Burrows called the situation an “informal meeting with an informal outcome” in a Friday email. She said the meeting “simply asked whether it was a good idea in principle to talk about working together.”
While the task force works on creating three options for school district maps by Dec. 1, the local boards wanted to get involved in the conversation.
“I personally don’t believe that any of the three parties agree with Act 73, but if we are left with no choice after the maps are drawn, we wanted to show our willingness to work together,” Hartford School board member Jeremy Warren said in an email.
Warren helped to draft the letter along with Davis McGraw of Windsor Southeast and Bristow and Carin Park of Mountain Views.
Personally, Warren said he is not a fan of Act 73 and “won’t be shy” about saying it. His preference would be to not have “other people’s voices in the town of Hartford,” but said it seems inevitable.
Bristow, of Mountain Views, attended a meeting of the state task force last Monday and read the Upper Valley boards’ letter to the group. The three districts would make good partners because they “have similar educational goals, share a Career and Technical Center (the Hartford Area Career and Technical Center), and are geographically aligned,” according to the letter.
The districts have common curriculum priorities, especially in math and literacy, Bristow added in a Thursday interview. A key goal in all three districts is to have students graduate “career and college ready.”
The Mountain Views Supervisory Union includes Woodstock, Barnard, Bridgewater and Pomfret in the Upper Valley, as well as three other Vermont towns.
“We just feel that we are natural partners, even though we are rivals on our sports teams,” Bristow said.
The districts already pull from some of the same student populations, Bristow noted. For example, some students in Hartland and Weathersfield, which are part of Windsor Southeast and offer choice for high school, choose to attend Woodstock or Hartford high schools. Bristow said in a future district she would like Woodstock to host a “regional hub school,” which is one of the benefits of this possible partnership.
She said it seems like a reasonable choice for the supervisory unions and district to come together and center around Woodstock because Mountain Views Supervisory Union has already invested millions of dollars in planning, permitting and design for a new middle-high school and it would take minimal changes to accommodate a larger student population.
Voters in Woodstock rejected a controversial $99 million bond to construct the new middle and high school building in 2024. The supervisory union will likely try to put together a new bond for next March, Bristow said.
The proposed union of the three districts aligns closely with a proposal presented at a Monday meeting of the school redistricting task force. At the meeting, the group discussed a map that would create 14 school districts based around Vermont’s Career and Technical Centers. It was the first time the committee reviewed a proposed map.
The proposed map creates a cluster around the Hartford Area Career and Technical Center, which includes the three school districts and Norwich, which is part of the Dresden Interstate School District.
Hartford’s Warren said the tech center map was “maybe a glimmer of hope personally for me because I think that was at least one map that made a little more sense” than other options that have been thrown around.
Still, some of the many questions that remain in the redistricting process include what will happen to programs that cross borders or to Vermont’s interstate school districts such as Rivendell Interstate School District, which is comprised of the towns of Orford, Fairlee, West Fairlee and Vershire, or Dresden School District, which oversees schools in Hanover and Norwich.
“We have other questions: what do we do with our neighboring towns across the river that also utilize our career and technical center?” Warren asked. “We definitely want to serve those people as well because they’re part of our neighborhood.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/  Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE – A federal judge in Nashville ruled that there is a “realistic likelihood” that the government behaved vindictively in bringing human smuggling charges against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador before being brought to Tennessee in June to face criminal charges.
The 16-page ruling by U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw on Friday opens the door for Abrego’s attorneys to seek documents and testimony from Trump administration officials about their public remarks in the case and the basis of their decision to bring criminal charges. 
Crenshaw noted that the government has repeatedly been thwarted in its months-long efforts to deport Abrego in one of the earliest – and highest profile – tests of the Trump administration’s mass deportation tactics.
“This has created a significant burden on and embarrassment to the Executive Branch, that must now expend additional time, resources, and international goodwill to remove Abrego to El Salvador or elsewhere,” he wrote.
Prosecutors: no ‘ill will’ in Tennessee criminal prosecution of Kilmar Abrego Garcia

Abrego, as he is identified in the Tennessee case, illegally entered the United States as a teen and worked as an apprentice sheet metal worker in Maryland. The 30-year-old married father was deported in March despite a standing stay of deportation issued in 2019 by an immigration judge. A federal prosecutor who admitted Abrego’s deportation was in error was fired after his statements and has since filed a claim of retaliation. 
Abrego currently faces potential deportation to the African country of Eswatini, government officials have told his attorneys. He is due to return to a Maryland court in that case on Friday.
In granting Abrego’s request to proceed with allegations the government behaved improperly, Crenshaw highlighted the timeline of official actions leading up to Abrego’s criminal charges in Tennessee as evidence of “potential unreasonableness of the prosecution.”
Abrego was deported on March 15 after a routine Maryland traffic stop. Nine days later, attorneys for Abrego successfully filed suit in a Maryland federal court challenging the deportation in a decision the government appealed. The Supreme Court concurred with the decision. 
Crenshaw noted that within “mere days” of the Supreme Court decision, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reopened an investigation into a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, which resulted in neither a ticket nor an arrest at the time.
The government brought charges against Abrego less than a month after it started its reopened investigation — a remarkably swift investigation. A grand jury returned a two-count indictment a month later and Abrego was returned to Nashville to face charges. He has since been released pending trial and remains in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia attorneys seek to dismiss Tennessee case as ‘vindictive prosecution’

On the day of his indictment, Homeland Security Secretary Pam Bondi and others “celebrated the criminal charges against him” and said he would be found guilty, sentenced and deported again to El Salvador, Crenshaw wrote.
“Most tellingly,” the judge wrote, Homeland Security Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche revealed that the government started investigating Abrego after a judge in Maryland questioned the government’s decision, found that it had no right to deport him and accused the government of wrongdoing.
“Deputy Attorney General Blanche’s remarkable statements could directly establish the motivations for Abrego’s criminal charges stem from his exercise of constitutional and statutory rights to bring suit against the (federal government), rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct,” Crenshaw wrote.
Prosecutors have denied that the government has acted with any “ill will” in the case.”
Crenshaw’s order contains no final conclusions on whether the case against Abrego should be dismissed due to vindictive prosecution, but instead greenlights a request by Abrego’s attorneys to proceed with collecting evidence to present at an evidentiary hearing. No date for the hearing has been set.

(Photo via Google Earth)A southwest Iowa nursing home cited for more than two dozen regulatory violations this year has been added to the federal government’s list of the nation’s worst care facilities.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has added the Garden View Care Center in Shenandoah to its list of Special-Focus Facilities.
In February 2025, state inspectors cited Garden View for 15 federal violations, including failure to meet professional standards, overall quality of care, insufficient nursing staff, a lack of competent nursing staff, infection-control issues and the use of unnecessary drugs.
Inspectors reported that on Feb. 12, 2025, the home, which had 37 residents, had no nurse on duty in the afternoon, and no one on staff certified to provide CPR if needed. A worker explained that a nurse from a temp agency had reported for work at 6 p.m. on Feb. 11, and remained on duty until roughly 2 p.m. Feb. 12, when she was told to go to the hotel where she was staying and get a few hours of sleep before reporting back for work at around 5 p.m.
The nurse’s departure allegedly left the home without a nurse in the building for three hours, despite the presence of several high-risk residents, including individuals who were on dialysis or needed airway suctioning or had COVID-19. “The administrator told staff he is a nurse but not currently licensed,” the inspectors wrote in their report.
State records indicate no fines or penalties were imposed as a result of the inspectors’ findings.
In April 2025, state inspectors returned and cited the home for 11 additional violations related to abuse-and-neglect policies, resident discharges, pharmacy services, medication errors, food quality and infection control. Again, no fines or penalties were imposed.
In the fall of 2021, CMS added Garden View to its special-focus eligibility list after the home was cited for 23 regulatory violations and fined $306,335 by the federal government. According to inspectors’ reports, the staff had withheld one woman’s dinner, with one worker telling a colleague the woman had no right to a meal because of how big she was. Another employee allegedly reported seeing a coworker pull a woman out of a room and drag her backward across the floor into another room while cursing at the resident.
In 2024, the state proposed, but held in suspension, $47,500 in fines against the home for inadequate staffing and the physical and verbal abuse of residents.
According to state inspectors, the home’s director of nursing informed them she was being pressured by management to cut staff due to budget constraints, adding that she felt doing so was “unsafe.”
Between October 2022 and July 2024, CMS imposed $241,479 in federal fines against the facility. Garden View is currently owned by a for-profit, limited liability company called Greenside Healthcare Properties, according to CMS.
Current CMS list includes some errors 
At any given time, no more than two nursing homes per state appear on CMS’ list of federally designated Special-Focus Facilities, although the list also includes hundreds of other nursing homes — typically, 10 per state — where ongoing quality-of-care violations have made them eligible for that status.
Once a home is designated a Special-Focus Facility, it receives additional oversight and assistance from the government that’s intended to improve resident care. The other homes that are merely deemed eligible do not receive that assistance. They appear on the list, some for as long as 10 years, and then drop off without ever receiving the federal help.
In addition to Garden View, the other Iowa care facility currently designated a Special-Focus Facility is Pine Acres Rehabilitation and Care Center in West Des Moines.
However, CMS’ latest Special-Focus Facilities list, published by the agency on Sept. 24, 2025, appears to include several errors. Garden View, for example, is listed not only as one of Iowa’s two special-focus facilities, but also as one of Iowa’s 10 care facilities that are eligible for the status without actually being enrolled in the program.
Although CMS did not respond Monday to inquiries about discrepancies in its list, possibly due to the federal government shutdown, it appears the list of Iowa facilities with “eligible” status has not been revised or updated since July.
The data from CMS suggests Garden View has taken the place of Aspire of Gowrie in the list of special-focus facilities. The Gowrie home had been in the special-focus program for at least 22 months without graduating before it closed on July 23, 2025.
As for the Iowa facilities whose quality-of-care issues make them eligible for special-focus status, the two most recently added homes are The Ivy at Davenport, located in Scott County, and Parkview Manor in Reinbeck. Both were added to the list in July, although the new list suggests they made their debut on the list in late September.
And while The Ivy at Davenport has been on the list continuously only since July, that’s because the home was inexplicably dropped from the list, for one month, in June. In May, the home had logged its 20th straight month on the eligibility list. So while the current list suggests The Ivy has been eligible for special-focus status for only one month, it has actually been eligible for the better part of two years.
The other Iowa homes on the eligibility list, and the corrected number of consecutive months they’ve appeared on the list, are:
— Greater Southside Health and Rehabilitation Center in Des Moines, 38 months.
— Harmony West Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in West Des Moines, 23 months.
— Harvest Acres Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Keota, eight months.
— Clarion Wellness and Rehabilitation Center, seven months.
— Caring Acres Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Anita, five months.
— Pioneer Valley Living and Rehabilitation Center, Sergeant Bluff, four months.
— Aspire of Washington, four months.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Gardebn-View-Care-Center.jpg,,,2025-10-06 16:59:46.927655

The office is asking for patient medical records, incident reports, “adverse event documentation” and communications about patient care, according to court records. Also requested through a subpoena were operational and clinical protocols, equipment patient records, contractual arrangements and documentation of compliance. 
“Despite the Missouri attorney general’s blatant attempts to overturn the will of the people, all patients expect and have the right for their medical records to be private,” leadership with Planned Parenthood Great Plains, Planned Parenthood Great Rivers and the ACLU of Missouri said in a joint statement. “Politicians have no place in the exam room with patients and their medical providers, and that’s why we will keep fighting for patients and their rights.”
The attorney general’s office, newly under the leadership of Catherine Hanaway, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. 
The Missouri Attorney General’s Office also subpoenaed two former Planned Parenthood Great Rivers board members, one physician contracted by Planned Parenthood Great Rivers and the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, who was handed a subpoena during recess of a court hearing related to abortion access on Sept. 10.
“This is nothing more than an attempt to harass (Planned Parenthood) and should not be permitted by the court,” attorneys for the clinics wrote in a court filing asking Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang to throw out the subpoenas. 
Last November, Missourians voted to codify the right to reproductive health care, including abortion up to the point of fetal viability, in the state constitution. A day later, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state in an effort to take down several abortion regulations that remain part of state statute, arguing that those regulations are now unconstitutional because they burden abortion patients and providers. 
Missouri secretary of state submits second attempt at abortion ban ballot language

That lawsuit is set to go to trial in January. Until then, Zhang temporarily enjoined — or struck down — some of the regulations, allowing Planned Parenthood to begin offering procedural abortions again. 
Planned Parenthood is also awaiting a decision from Zhang after asking her to enjoin even more state regulations that the clinic argues are preventing clinics from prescribing mifepristone and misoprostol, which are used in medication abortions. As of Monday, Missourians could not access medication abortion from an in-state provider because of these regulations.
Planned Parenthood is currently offering procedural abortions at its clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis. 
 A separate battle for patient records

Last month, the Missouri Court of Appeals gave the green light for the attorney general’s office to subpoena patient health information in a separate case involving the Washington University Transgender Center. But it has to be done under more stringent parameters, the court ruled. 
The attorney general’s office initially requested “all electronic health records of (the center’s) clients” and a list of all the center’s patients. The higher court is now requiring that only the minimum required health information be turned over.
The appeals court reversed a ruling last year in which a district judge said the center did not have to turn over patient information protected by the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA.
In that case,  the attorney general’s office argued that it qualifies as a “health oversight agency,” and as such should be privy to patient information protected by HIPPA.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8172-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-06 16:59:46.927655

(Capitol News Illinois photo by Hannah Meisel)CHICAGO — Illinois and Chicago filed a federal lawsuit Monday to block the Trump administration’s planned deployment of National Guard troops to the state — a move Gov. JB Pritzker called an “invasion.”
Trump pushed forward with the plan to activate hundreds of National Guard soldiers, including some from Texas, despite monthslong opposition from state and local leaders, as well as objections from civic and business groups in the city.
“We must now start calling this what it is: Trump’s Invasion,” Pritzker said in a statement Sunday night. “It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state’s military troops.”
Read more: Over Pritzker’s objections, Trump sending 300 National Guardsmen to Chicago, governor says
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asked President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy troops to Illinois to protect federal immigration officers and facilities. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in Broadview, a near-west suburb of Chicago, has been the site of several clashes between ICE agents and demonstrators in recent weeks.
But Pritzker, who said Saturday that he refused the Trump administration’s “ultimatum” to activate the National Guard himself, has insisted there is no emergency necessitating guardsmen on the ground. He also warned that White House officials would use any conflict between immigration agents and civilians as a “pretext” for military occupation.
“It will cause only more unrest, including harming social fabric and community relations and increasing the mistrust of police,” the lawsuit said.
The suit, filed in the Northern District of Illinois, names Trump, Noem and Hegseth as defendants.
 Texas National Guard also activated

Illinois filed its lawsuit hours after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced he will send 400 guardsmen to cities around the country, including Chicago, and after a federal judge in Oregon blocked National Guard deployments to Portland.
The order is “effective immediately for an initial period of 60 days” and subject to extension, according to the memo, signed by Hegseth. It comes a day after Pritzker confirmed Trump’s intention to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard.
“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” the lawsuit reads. “To guard against this, foundational principles of American law limit the president’s authority to involve the military in domestic affairs. Those bedrock principles are in peril.”


The opening paragraph of Illinois’ lawsuit against the federal government argues that the “foundational principles of American law” that limit the president’s powers to involve the military in domestic affairs are at risk. (Capitol News Illinois illustration with highlight added)

The promised deployment comes as ICE has ramped up activity in Chicago and its suburbs as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has so far resulted in more than 800 arrests according to the Department of Homeland Security.
There have also been two shootings since the clashes began. On Saturday, the governor called the administration’s National Guard activation a “manufactured performance” and not about protecting public safety.
Though the Trump administration insists ICE is targeting undocumented immigrants who have criminal backgrounds, reports have mounted of agents arresting those with no history of illegal activity, detaining children along with their parents and even handcuffing U.S. citizens and children with zip ties. Immigrant and civil rights groups have alleged ICE is arresting people without warrants in violation of a federal consent decree.
The lawsuit also alleges ICE activity in Chicago and its suburbs has already subjected Illinois “to serious and irreparable harm.”

“It also creates economic harm, depressing business activities and tourism that not only hurt Illinoisians but also hurt Illinois’s tax revenue,” the complaint said.
That argument echoes one made by a group of Chicago business and civic groups over the weekend.
“National Guard troops on our streets, like those reportedly being ordered here by the federal government, have the potential to sow fear and chaos, threatening our businesses’ bottom lines and our reputation,” the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago and the Civic Federation said in a joint statement Saturday.
Read the lawsuit here.
 Order violates states’ rights

Attorney General Kwame Raoul argues the troop deployment violates Illinois’ rights as sovereign state to carry about its own law enforcement, as well as 1878 Posee Comitatus Act that bans the military from participating in domestic law enforcement.
The lawsuit also claims the Trump administration failed to meet any criteria that could allow the president to federalize the National Guard. The president can federalize the National Guard to stop a foreign invasion, when the president can’t execute the laws of the country or to stop a rebellion.
Raoul and state leaders have argued for weeks that Trump would use protests in Broadview as a “flimsy pretext” to claim a rebellion.

Several protestors have been arrested near the facility in recent weeks on charges of assaulting officers. Federal agents have sprayed tear gas and fired nonlethal ammunition into crowds that have gathered there.
Over the weekend, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot a woman on the city’s Southwest Side in a confrontation with protesters. Prosecutors eventually charged the woman and another protestor with attempting to “assault, impede, and interfere with the work of federal agents in Chicago.” According to the Chicago Sun-Times, agents fired “defensive shots” when they saw the woman was allegedly “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” and she was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment before she was charged.
Further, the lawsuit argues the Trump administration has entirely manufactured any public safety crisis in Illinois that would require military intervention. It cites a 2013 social media post by Trump, two years before he announced his candidacy for president, that suggested the military should be deployed to Chicago. It lists several other derogatory comments Trump made about the city, state and their leaders over the years, including as president.


Illinois’ lawsuit against the federal government includes several posts that President Donald Trump has made about the city over a period of at least 12 years. (Screenshots from Illinois’ lawsuit against the federal government)

The lawsuit argues that animosity culminated last week with Trump claiming during a speech to military generals that there was an “invasion from within” and suggesting cities like Chicago should be used as “training grounds” for the military.
How soldiers will be deployed 
The lawsuit includes new details about how federal officials communicated with state leaders and gave Pritzker an ultimatum.
DHS sent a memo to the Illinois National Guard on Sept. 28 stating troops “would integrate with federal law enforcement operations, serving in direct support of federal facility protection, access control, and crowd control.”
On Saturday morning, Illinois National Guard Adjutant General Rodney Boyd received a formal email from the Defense Department National Guard Bureau saying Trump asked for at least 300 soldiers, and if Boyd did not activate them within two hours, Hegseth would federalize them. Boyd responded that Pritzker declined to activate the guard. Defense officials sent a new memo late Saturday saying the guard was federalized.
Illinois National Guard leaders received another memo on Sunday informing them soldiers from Texas would be sent to Chicago beginning Monday.

Abbott, a Republican and ardent Trump supporter, has been a frequent foil of Pritzker, bussing thousands of asylum-seeking migrants from the border to Chicago in 2023 and 2024 and criticizing the Illinois governor for welcoming Texas Democratic legislators who fled their state this summer amid a partisan redistricting fight. He said in a social media post that Pritzker “can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let the Texas Guard do it.”
Prior to this year, the last time a president federalized a state’s National Guard without a request from a state’s governor was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent federal troops to protect civil rights protesters in Alabama without the cooperation of segregationist Gov. George Wallace.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Some West Virginia Medicaid recipients will lose their health care when new federal work requirements go into effect in 2027, lawmakers were told Monday.
“I do anticipate that we will see some of our enrollment go down for the community engagement,” Cindy Beane, commissioner for the West Virginia Bureau for Medical Services, told the Legislature’s Joint Standing Committee on Finance. She used a term she said referred to new federal work requirements. “I don’t know that everyone will be able to comply, or will comply with that. So I do anticipate some people coming off its rolls.”
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in July, will cut the federal Medicaid program by nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years.  The changes in the bill are projected to make approximately 60,000 West Virginians lose their health care coverage over the next decade, according to KFF. 
Beane said the bill has more than 20 new provisions in it that will affect Medicaid. Some of those provisions the state already complies with, she said. For instance, the state already checks Social Security data to make sure that the program is not paying for the care of dead people, she said. 
 
Beginning in January 2027, new working requirements will go into effect for approximately 160,000 West Virginians who are part of the expanded Medicaid program through the Affordable Care Act. 
 
Under the legislation, expanded Medicaid recipients ages 19 through 64 — with some exceptions — must work or participate in certain qualifying activities for at least 80 hours per month. States will be required to verify that those applying for coverage meet the work requirements for at least one or more consecutive months and that enrolled individuals meet requirements for one or more months between the twice-yearly eligibility redeterminations.
Beane said 60% of the state’s affected Medicaid recipients have an earned income, but it’s not clear how many of them work at least 80 hours each month. About 20,000 to 40,000 people on expanded Medicaid are “engaged with the workforce” and will need to engage in order to stay enrolled, she said. 
Beane said the state is preparing now to enact the work requirements. The federal government has made it clear there will not be extensions to the January 2027 deadline, she said.
“The bill does say there’s a possibility for [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] to waive the timeline if you’re not ready,” Beane said. “CMS has made it very clear. I’ve had multiple meetings with CMS, and I’ve also talked to the current director about this, with regards to how quickly states are having to get this done, that basically there is no good faith waiver. They will be anticipating that you will be ready next January.”
Beane said the state enlisted the help of West Virginia University Health Affairs to help with project management and systems requirements for the work requirements. 
Alex Mayer, secretary of the state Department of Human Services, and Janie Cole, commissioner of the state Bureau for Family Assistance, are working to determine the staffing levels they’ll need to take on the twice-yearly redeterminations, she said.
“I think what we’re going to try to do as much as possible with regards to work requirements and anything is make it as ex-parte, which is no touch, as possible,” Beane said. “[We’ll] see if there’s some technologies we can employ to where it’s not staff intensive. But I do think there will be increased demands.”
Beane said the department does not have an estimate for how much the system upgrades and staffing changes will cost the state to prepare for work requirements but “there will be a cost.”
A federal report found that it cost the state of Georgia $54.2 million in less than five years to administer the country’s only Medicaid program with work rules, more than twice what it spent to provide health care to enrollees.
She added that her biggest concern with staffing levels is making sure that the state’s payment error rate doesn’t increase. Another provision of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will require states to pay money as a penalty for Medicaid payment error rates that exceed 3%. A high payment error rate could cost the state potentially millions of dollars, she said. 
West Virginia’s payment error rate has been high as 15%, but was down to 3.43% during its last audit. Errors could be anything from a worker mistyping a number to missing documentation, she said. 
“I feel like this is a particular part of the bill that the state needs to pay a lot of attention to,” Beane said. “Because like it said it could just be one country worker stressed and entering something wrong or something like that can really affect your [payment error rate measurement].”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a case that could reverse or solidify state laws across the country that ban a controversial counseling practice for LGBTQ+ youth.
The case challenges a 2019 Colorado law that bans “conversion therapy” for children and teens. Conversion therapy is a catchall term for efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation. The therapy has been widely discredited by medical groups.
More than half of states — including some led by Republicans — have banned or restricted the practice for children and teens since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a left-leaning nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
In recent years, however, Republicans in several states have worked to reverse bans, with some success. A poll in June by Data for Progress, a liberal think tank, found that although less than half of Republican voters, 43%, support or strongly support conversion therapy, more than half — 56% — said the Supreme Court ought to allow states to ban it.
A decision in the Colorado case, expected next year, could have far-reaching ramifications for dozens of other states.
“I think we’re all really worried about the implications,” said Cliff Rosky, a professor of law at the University of Utah. Rosky helped draft Utah’s 2023 law prohibiting licensed professionals from practicing conversion therapy on LGBTQ+ youth. That measure unanimously passed the Republican-controlled legislature.
“We certainly hope the court will uphold the right of states to regulate the behavior of therapists that it licenses and protect children from a lethal public health threat,” he told Stateline.
The impact on other states’ laws would depend on the scope of the high court’s ruling. But most of those laws are similar to Colorado’s, Rosky said.
“Certainly, a broad ruling against Colorado’s law would jeopardize the constitutionality of all the other laws.”
Conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ people, long discredited, could make a comeback

In Chiles v. Salazar, a licensed counselor in Colorado Springs, Kaley Chiles, sued state officials in 2022 over a law that bars licensed mental health professionals from conducting conversion therapy on clients under 18. She argues the law violates her First Amendment right to free speech and interferes with her ability to practice counseling in a way that aligns with her religious convictions. Chiles is represented by conservative religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom.
“The government has no business censoring private conversations between clients and counselors,” Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, said in a news release when the group filed its opening brief in June. “Colorado’s law harms these young people by depriving them of caring and compassionate conversations with a counselor who helps them pursue the goals they desire.”
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, said in an August news conference that the law doesn’t prohibit a provider from sharing information or viewpoints with a patient, and that therapists are still allowed to talk with patients about conversion practices offered by religious groups.
But he called conversion therapy a “substandard, discredited practice.” Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
“This practice has been used in the past to try to force patients to change their sexual orientation or their gender identity,” Weiser said. “The science, however, says that this practice is harmful. It doesn’t work.
“Regardless of how it’s performed, there can be real harms from this practice. And those harms can include depression, self-hatred, loss of faith, even suicide.”
The key question in the case is whether Colorado’s law regulates professional standards of conduct and speech, or whether it attempts to regulate the right to free speech, said Marie-Amélie George, a legal historian who has published extensively on LGBTQ+ rights and is a professor of law at Wake Forest University School of Law.
“What is really interesting about these laws is that most licensed health professionals don’t offer conversion therapy because professional associations across the board have condemned it as extremely harmful,” George told Stateline. After the mainstream mental health community disavowed efforts to change people’s sexual orientation by the late 1980s, conversion therapy “became primarily the province of religious and lay ministers,” she said.
State laws like Colorado’s don’t restrict clergy and lay ministers from engaging in conversion therapy, she said. They address only the small subset of state-licensed mental health professionals who wish to use it.
In August, attorneys general in 20 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief supporting Colorado’s law. They argue the First Amendment doesn’t shield mental health practices from regulation when the state deems them dangerous or ineffective, and that states have a long and established history of regulating professional standards of care.










The decision in this case will probably affect all of the conversion therapy bans in this country.


– Marie-Amélie George, Wake Forest University School of Law professor


Colorado isn’t the only recent battleground over conversion therapy, as conservative majorities in the courts, state legislatures and at the federal level have opened the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate the practice.
Earlier this year, Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a bill canceling Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned conversion therapy for minors. Beshear promptly vetoed the bill, but the legislature overrode his veto in March.
In April, a coalition of Republican attorneys general from 11 states, led by Iowa and South Carolina, appealed a January decision by a U.S. district court judge to uphold a 2023 Michigan law that’s similar to Colorado’s. It prohibits mental health professionals from trying to alter a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity. The case began when Catholic Charities of three Michigan counties filed a lawsuit targeting Michigan’s law in 2024 on behalf of a licensed therapist.
In July, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 ban on conversion therapy for minors. Republican lawmakers in Michigan introduced a bill in July to repeal their state’s ban, while Missouri’s Republican attorney general sued to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
From the mid-1990s until the mid-2010s, LGBTQ+ rights advocates won a lot of cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, said George, the Wake Forest professor.
“But in the years since, the Supreme Court has been more hostile to LGBTQ+ rights claims,” she said. “I think, with the political environment of the court, it will be interesting to see what they do given how they have treated other LGBTQ+ rights cases in recent years.
“States are extremely similar in the laws they have enacted, so the decision in this case will probably affect all of the conversion therapy bans in this country.”

(Photo provided by S.C. State Ports Authority)CHARLESTON — The state agency that owns and operates the Port of Charleston has tapped former top sales executive Micah Mallace to take the helm of South Carolina’s largest economic driver.
The agency’s board of directors on Monday, named Mallace, who spent 11 years with the S.C. State Ports Authority before leaving in late 2022 to become president of warehouse and trucking firm Harbor Logistics, the authority’s new president and CEO.
The board, during a special meeting, unanimously approved a five-year contract that will pay $525,000 per year to Mallace, who previously was the authority’s chief commercial officer. His first day will be Oct. 13 – less than two months after previous CEO Barbara Melvin unexpectedly resigned from the job.
Imports spur stellar August for SC Ports, but tariff troubles await

“What we do and how we operate influences global trade and the worldwide economy,” Bill Stern, the authority’s board chairman, said in a statement. “Micah Mallace understands that significance and responsibility. He has the vision, experience and nuts-and-bolts knowledge to navigate the many facets of today’s maritime industry.”
Industry experience
Mallace, 41, a Charleston native and graduate of the College of Charleston, was an overwhelming top pick among government and industry leaders for the port’s CEO role.
The leadership role attracted widespread interest “but the board and government leaders rapidly coalesced behind Mallace,” the authority said in a news release.
“I care deeply about serving the employees, serving the community that depends on the port and, of course, I care deeply about serving the state,” Mallace said. “I don’t take any of that lightly, and certainly that will require a lot of hard work.”
His time with Charleston-based Harbor Logistics kept Mallace in touch with the authority’s operations and he said that private-sector experience “will come in handy in this role.”
“I’m fortunate that I’ve worked closely with the port over the last three years – I’ve been a customer of the port and I’ve also been a partner in pursuing growth projects” he said. “I will need some time to get up to speed and will be assessing both the challenges as well as where there’s wind in our sails.”
SC Ports still sees a future in barges, but rail yard getting first focus

Mallace said the authority’s board reached out to him “as they were thinking through various candidates” and looking for Melvin’s replacement.
“I met with all of the board members to share my understanding of the challenges and my understanding of the opportunities and kind of what I saw as where the port should go next,” he said.
Mallace succeeds interim CEO Phil Padgett, who was thrust into the role following the sudden resignation in August of Melvin, who held the title for about three years.
Padgett will remain the agency’s chief financial officer and vice president of administration.
“I can think of no better person to lead SC Ports and know he will bring the necessary vision to grow as a top 10 container port,” Padgett said of Mallace.
Legislators applauded the selection, with Rep. Bruce Bannister, R-Greenville and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, calling Mallace “an outstanding choice.”
“Micah’s experience and qualifications firmly align with our port’s mission and he will be an invaluable asset as we move forward in the highly competitive maritime industry,” added House Speaker Murrell Smith, R-Sumter.
An unexpected resignation
Mallace’s appointment gives the authority an opportunity to quickly gain traction in the wake of an unexpected leadership void.
SC ports director Melvin abruptly resigns, citing ‘personal reasons’

No specific reason has been given for Melvin’s surprise resignation, which was announced two days after the board held a previously unscheduled and unannounced closed-door meeting that lasted for about an hour. Melvin said the resignation was due to “personal and professional reasons.”
The resignation followed a period in which Gov. Henry McMaster appointed new members to the authority’s board to address what he termed concerns about how the agency was being run. McMaster declined to elaborate when asked by the SC Gazette late last month.
Reportedly, the governor’s concerns included a Supreme Court decision in February 2024 that gave members of a local dockworkers union the right to operate cranes and other heavy-lift equipment at the port – jobs that previously were limited to non-union authority employees. The authority’s fight with the union – which McMaster vowed to fight “to the gates of hell” –  delayed the port’s new $1 billion Leatherman Terminal from becoming fully operational for two years.
Also, state legislators say they were not kept informed about cost overruns and construction delays at a rail yard the authority is building, where cargo containers can be moved between trucks and trains. The cost of that mostly state-funded project has nearly doubled to $690 million.
Melvin, who made $585,000 in salary and bonuses in the most recent fiscal year, will get a nearly $1 million severance package that includes salary continuation and contributions to her state retirement account.
Charleston’s port – the state’s largest economic driver with an $87 billion annual economic impact – finished the last budget year that ended June 30, handling a little more than 1.4 million containers of all sizes. That’s up 2.3% from the previous 12-month period.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/micah-mallace-1-1024x579.jpg,,,2025-10-06 16:59:46.927655

A Massachusetts District Court judge last week dismissed a case against Rida Kori, a former Burlington school board member who was charged with drug trafficking last year.
Kori, 25, was arrested in Holyoke, Massachusetts, during a traffic stop in September 2024 and was charged with trafficking roughly 86 grams of suspected heroin and fentanyl, according to previous court records.
But last week, a Massachusetts District Court Judge William P. Hadley dismissed the case after Kori’s attorney filed a motion to suppress evidence.

The attorney, Kedar Ismail, argued that police searched Kori’s car without a warrant and without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, and he asked the judge to suppress the evidence in the case as “fruits of the poisonous tree,” according to a court transcript. 
In a phone interview, Ismail called the traffic stop “pretextual,” and in court transcripts said the officers involved in the traffic stop were “using what they needed in order to fit their narrative to get the reasonable suspicion, to get the probable cause.”
Prosecutors during a court hearing in August pushed back, and said officers with the Massachusetts State Police had made previous surveillance observations of Kori in a “high-crime area,” according to court transcripts.
Members of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration in Springfield, Massachusetts, were alerted to Kori when they spotted his vehicle during a separate narcotics investigation in Enfield, Connecticut, in July 2024, according to a previous affidavit written by Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael DeCaro.
Investigators later tracked Kori’s vehicle via electronic surveillance and noted several trips into Massachusetts and Connecticut, the affidavit read.
Ismail did not dispute that drugs were found in Kori’s car, but told the judge during court hearings that the search was “an egregious violation of his Fourth Amendment right and his Article 14 protections.”
A Burlington High School graduate, Kori ran unopposed for the Ward 1 seat on the school board on Town Meeting Day in 2024. He attended Central Connecticut State to play Division 1 soccer, and previously worked as an assistant varsity soccer coach at Burlington High School.
He submitted his resignation shortly after his arrest last year. Kori, in an email, referred comment to his attorney but said the court “dropped my case and I was vindicated.”

Gretchen Whitmer in her official capacity to end the state’s policy of denying worker’s compensation to undocumented immigrants who are injured while working. 
In a press conference held in advance of oral arguments to the Michigan Supreme Court, which will begin on Wednesday, Anna Hill Galendez, a managing attorney at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, said the issues in this case involve basic fairness and worker well-being.
“The reality is, many employers gladly hire workers who don’t have work permits because they can pay them less and get away with more cutting corners on health and safety protections and when workers are inevitably injured, workers compensation insurance companies know they can deny wage loss benefits without challenge,” Galendez said.
Lawyers from the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center and others involved in the lawsuit against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer held a press conference in advance of oral arguments beginning. Oct. 6, 2025 | Screenshot
John Philo, the executive and legal director of the Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice, noted that this issue has already been addressed in Ohio and Minnesota, where in both states undocumented workers have been guaranteed access to worker’s compensation. The Sugar Law Center is representing the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center alongside FarmSTAND, a legal advocacy organization focused on issues of corporate agriculture.
“Going to work should not mean having to gamble your health, your livelihood or the ability to care for your family,” Galendez added.
However, this case, first filed in 2021 in the Court of Claims, has become about more than just immigrant rights, argued lawyer David Muraskin, managing director for litigation at FarmSTAND. The Court of Appeals, overturning a decision from the Court of Claims, ruled in May 2024 that the argument was not timely — thus making Whitmer subject to immunity — because the claim was filed more than one year after the governor’s policy went into effect.
“That would mean that when the governor has a policy of any unconstitutional conduct, including this one, the fact that she got away with it for a year would keep anyone from ever going to court,” Muraskin said. 
Phil Mayor, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Michigan, which has filed an amicus brief in the case, shared a similar portrayal of the issue.
“It’s an issue about whether Michiganders, and I mean all Michiganders, can go to court to stop the government from breaking the law, or whether, as the governor would have it, if they’ve gotten away with breaking the law for a year, they can just keep doing it indefinitely,” Mayor said.
The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center and its lawyers are aiming to have this case sent back to the Court of Claims by the Supreme Court. Muraskin also noted, however, “she [Gov. Whitmer] could tomorrow choose to stop enforcing this policy and follow the law, and that would resolve this case entirely.”
A request for comment from Whitmer’s office has yet to be returned.

Pat Harrigan (R-N.C.) for more than $75,000 over his claims that she was fired for comments about the death of Charlie Kirk.
Bridget Sullivan filed a libel lawsuit against Harrigan in Forsyth Superior Court Friday, alleging Harrigan spread falsehoods about her when he posted from his congressional X account that she was “FIRED for celebrating Charlie Kirk’s assassination.”
Sullivan posted the song lyrics, “He had it coming, he had it coming,” on Sept. 11, the day after Kirk was fatally shot, alongside a comment that “this audio is all I have to say about that.”
The following day, Harrigan called for her firing on X, reposting screenshots of her Wake Forest biography alongside her Instagram post. He added that he contacted the university about her comments.
“If a staff member is openly celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk, it crosses every line of decency and professionalism,” Harrigan wrote. “No university should tolerate an employee glorifying political violence. Anything less than firing her is an endorsement of it.”
According to the lawsuit, both Sullivan and the university received threats and other “derogatory comments” after this, requiring additional police protection on campus.
On Sept. 16, he made a follow-up post announcing she was fired. The post received more than 23,000 likes and 874,000 views, according to the lawsuit, and was cited by The Charlotte Observer and Raleigh News and Observer in reporting that she was fired. His X account reposted the latter headline.
A spokesperson for Harrigan did not respond to a request for comment.

Sullivan denied in the lawsuit that she was fired, and that instead, she and Wake Forest “mutually agreed that it would be best to part ways” on Sept. 14.
“Wake Forest did not fire or terminate [Sullivan]. Upon information and belief, no Wake Forest representative issued such a statement to [Harrigan], to the school at large, to the press, or to the public,” the complaint reads. “Such a statement was and is false.”
Wake Forest University did not respond to a request to confirm that.
In the wake of Kirk’s death, conservative activists and lawmakers have sought action against employees for universities, hospitals, and government agencies over insensitive comments made online. UNC Chapel Hill suspended a professor over alleged ties to a group that did so on Sept. 30, only to reinstate him when no connection was found.

The DOH will discuss its swim voucher program and the state’s implementation efforts with members of the Senate Health Policy Committee Tuesday.
Rep. Kim Kendall, R-St. Augustine. (Photo/Florida House of Representatives)
The presentation on the swim voucher program comes as St. Augustine Republican Rep. Kim Kendall has filed legislation to open the program to more children. Kendall filed HB 85 Monday. The bill revises eligibility for the program allowing children up to age seven to qualify for the swim vouchers.
Passed by the Legislature in 2024 and initially appropriated $500,000, the program was established for children living in families earning 200% of the federal poverty level or less —$64,300 for a family of four. The Legislature doubled the funding for the program in the fiscal year 2025-26 to $1 million and made the vouchers a priority for children with autism and in active-duty military families.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show:

Drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages one to four;
It is the second-leading cause of death for children ages five through 14;
More than 4,000 unintentional deaths annually are attributed to drowning.

The CDC advises that greater access to swimming lessons is key in curbing the rise in drowning deaths.

“We’re trying to understand the scope,” NMED Deputy Cabinet Secretary John Rhoderick told legislators during a presentation to the Radioactive & Hazardous Materials Committee. “Contamination is three-dimensional, you’ve got to know how long, how wide and how deep it is.”
This Tuesday, state officials are planning to present some of those findings, including more information about potential pollution from decades of coal waste disposal.
The San Juan Generating Station operated for nearly 50 years, fed by two nearby coal mines, including the La Plata mine and the San Juan Mine. The power plant, along with the neighboring Four Corners Generating Station, in 2014 were considered one of the largest single sources of pollution in the U.S.. The San Juan Generating Station permanently closed in 2022 and has been under demolition since August 2024.
In 2023, lawmakers passed House Bill 142, which directed the New Mexico Environment and Energy Minerals and Natural Resources departments to monitor and enforce cleanup of the area for at least two years. NMED is in charge of the station site, while EMNRD is tasked with the mining area cleanup.
While there is no agenda or preview released, a news release said the  environment department will present data collected during its recent groundwater investigation — which will inform future remediation — during a hybrid open house on Tuesday in Fruitland.
“One of the Environment Department’s top priorities is making sure New Mexicans are informed of the work we’re doing in their backyard,” said Justin Ball, NMED’s Groundwater Quality Bureau chief in a statement to Source NM. That’s why we’re holding this meeting — to show the public the same data we’re using to make key cleanup decisions at the San Juan Generating Station site.”
Numerous operators have owned the station throughout its lifespan, but it was last owned by New Mexico’s largest electricity provider, Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM).
In a July letter, environment officials requested PNM officials produce a plan to reduce pollution, writing that multiple potential sources of groundwater and soil contamination already existed in quantities violating state laws.
“Known contaminants of concern, based on historic monitoring, include nitrate, sulfate, arsenic, selenium, uranium, boron, and volatile organic compounds,” the letter stated. The letter required the plan to be produced to environment officials by the end of September.
PNM requested an extension, NMED spokesperson Drew Goretzka told Source via text message, and the plan will now be due to state officials on Nov. 26.
The public will “hopefully” hear more about the exact nature of any contamination and further cleanup plans at the meeting, said Mike Eisenfeld, energy and climate program manager with local environment group San Juan Citizens Alliance.
Area conservation groups had previously focused on reducing the annual emissions of 12 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, he said, but the concern has shifted to soil and water cleanup. Eisenfeld said he wants to avoid a “culture of abandonment”  for the generating station, and pointed to taxpayers being on the hook for cleaning up private uranium and oil and gas operations.
Any information about the status of groundwater pollution, and how the state will require cleanup will be useful, he said.
“The state agencies have tried to be responsive,” Eisenfeld told Source NM Monday. “But it’s really difficult when you’re just a citizen just trying to sort out who’s responsible for legacy cleanup.”

Norton I State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/shns/senate-president-says-federal-government-working-against-us/,"During an interview televised Sunday morning, Spilka echoed comments made earlier in the year by House Speaker Ron Mariano, who said Massachusetts had ""lost our federal partner.""","THE STATE CAN’T make up for all of the federal government spending cuts that are occurring, according to Massachusetts Senate President Karen Spilka, who also said she’s not looking to raise taxes as part of any response.
During an interview televised Sunday morning, Spilka echoed comments made earlier in the year by House Speaker Ron Mariano, who said Massachusetts had “lost our federal partner.”
“I believe that Trump and the Congressional Republicans are working against us and the Legislature and the residents of Massachusetts,” Spilka said. 
While Republicans believe the One Big Beautiful Bill that was passed in July will unleash economic growth and responsibly rein in government spending, many Democrats say that less support from the federal level for social safety net programs will just push inevitable costs and responsibilities down to the states. 
The Ashland Democrat said Beacon Hill had mobilized quickly and “gotten some great bills done to protect Massachusetts residents, defend Massachusetts values,” but two of the three actions she cited — a student cellphone ban and data privacy legislation — have only cleared the Senate and await action in the House.
She said “we will continue doing bills” and predicted action on legislation to help veterans. She also pointed to a major new law this session to further protect access to reproductive health care and gender identity care.
The Democrats who run the Legislature have been steadily criticizing the across-the-board shifts in federal policies since Trump took office, but have had less to say about how the state plans to respond to forecasts that the ranks of the insured here are about to surge and that families will lose access to food benefits.
“I’m not talking about new taxes right now,” Spilka told Jon Keller of WBZ-TV, who asked if new taxes may be part of the response to threatened public programs and services. “We are not going to have enough funding. We have a good rainy day fund, we’re not going to have enough to cover everything.”
Asked about recent chatter about altering the limit on local property tax increases, Spilka said, “Nobody has spoken to me directly about that as a possibility. For right now, I am not looking at tax increases.”
Bills that provide local “residential assistance to our elders, our vulnerable residents” are a focus, she said. 
The Senate on Sept. 25 passed legislation (S 2619) featuring right-to-know provisions about personal data that is being collected and the ability for people to opt out of having their data used for targeted advertising or being sold to other companies. In addition to enhanced protections for data belonging to minors, the bill give the attorney general enforcement powers and features data protections around health care information, face scans and fingerprints, geolocation, and information about a person’s religion, ethnicity or immigration status.
“I think they need some guidance by the state,” Spilka said, referring to technology companies that she said “are mining tons and tons of your personal information.” 
The state last week released the latest round of MCAS scores and the lackluster standardized test results show students have not rebounded from pandemic-related learning loss. Spilka said Massachusetts is “number one in education in the country” and while she said the results illustrate that enhanced efforts are required, she didn’t offer specifics other than to recommend “what is evidence-based, what works with our kids.”
“We still have some work to do, clearly,” Spilka said. “I think we need to really focus, zone in on the different grades and where the kids are at, starting early, not waiting until high school. I think literacy is a big thing, mathematics.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09-18_Spilka_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-06 15:57:13.796238

(Screenshot of the meeting's livestream)The federal government shutdown, which enters its second week, is not yet impacting Oklahoma highway projects, but could prove problematic if Congress is unable to reach a long-term funding agreement, Oklahoma’s top transportation official said.
Tim Gatz, who heads the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, said the federal government is still processing his agency’s bills as the shutdown enters its second week. But as the 2026 federal fiscal year gets further along, his agency would have to “very carefully consider” which projects they can do and which they cannot if they don’t have federal participation.
But he also said it would still be problematic if Congress only passes a short-term funding resolution because it wouldn’t provide the Oklahoma Department of Transportation access to one full year’s worth of federal funding.
The federal government remained closed Monday after the Republican-controlled Congress was unable to reach agreement on either of two separate government funding bills by the start of the Oct. 1 federal fiscal year. A Republican proposal would keep the government open until Nov. 21. Democrats, meanwhile, have a separate plan that would permanently restore federal health subsidies.
Gatz said states are also waiting to hear what Congress plans to do when the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act expires at the end of the 2026 federal budget year. The measure, which became law in November 2021, appropriates nearly $1.2 trillion for transportation and infrastructure projects nationwide, including nearly $350 billion for federal highway programs.
Gatz said Congress is currently working on a new highway funding bill with the aim of sustaining current funding levels, but it’s going to be challenging because the Highway Trust Fund, which pays for transportation projects using excise taxes, only covers around 50% or 60% of all expenditures. The rest of the Act’s costs were deposited into the trust by Congress. 
Gatz said it’s not yet known if that 2021 investment will be a sustainable trend.
“I call that to your attention because we are trying to project our federal funding availability with some uncertainty,” Gatz told the members of his governing board Monday during their monthly meeting.
He said it has already been a challenging year. Oklahoma lawmakers have had to provide an extra $200 million in one-time funding in budget years 2024 and 2025 to “help shield” the Department of Transportation.
The agency has been grappling with an “inflationary trend” that began in 2020 impacting heavy highway construction. An analysis of construction costs show they have increased over 63% since 2020, Gatz said.
The fiscal constraints have forced the state Transportation Department this year to delay some projects that it had planned to do as part of its eight-year work plan, Gatz said. That 2026 through 2033 work plan is planned based on critical infrastructure needs and projected federal and state funding.
“Those projects are still a priority, and they are still projects that need to be done,” Gatz said. “It’s just going to take us a bit longer to get to those projects.”
The latest eight-year work plan, approved unanimously by the Department of Transportation’s governing board Monday, contains over $7.08 billion in total investment in 1,266 individual projects. It prioritizes 460 individual bridges that need rehabilitation or replacement, 675 miles of improvements to two-lane highways with deficient shoulders, and planned pavement improvements to 2,810 lane miles, officials said.
“The needs are just outpacing our ability to get there with the improvements,” Gatz said. “We’ll carry those discussions into the legislative session to make sure the Legislature understands what’s going on.”
He said the state’s highway system is the largest publicly owned asset, valued at over $100 billion. It needs about $27 billion in investments to bring it to an acceptable standard.

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)A controversial proposed natural gas pipeline in North Carolina could be unnecessary, according to an environmental assessment of the Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate project by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Running into Rockingham County, the pipeline has been the subject of controversy since it was proposed in 2018. North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality denied a water quality permit for the project in 2020, NC Newsline previously reported.
FERC staff found that the approval of an amendment to the Southgate project would not constitute a major federal action that significantly affects environmental quality, according to the document released on Friday.
But another natural gas project, the Williams Companies’ expansion of their Transco pipelines — the Southeast Supply Enhancement project — is also undergoing a permitting process at the moment. The two companies have sparred over access to the area and the need for both pipelines.
The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality is conducting a clean water permit review of the Transco project through Nov. 10, and FERC is expected to release an environmental assessment in early November.
FERC’s environmental analysis found that the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project could remove the need for Southgate, according to the document.
A representative for the Southgate project did not immediately respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.
“We conclude the Transco System Alternative would be technically and economically feasible and practical,” FERC staff wrote in the analysis.
FERC staff also claimed the SSE project’s benefits outweigh those of Southgate by negating the need for a second pipeline to provide resources to customers.
“We conclude that the Transco System Alternative would provide an environmental advantage over the proposed Amendment Project because the SSE Project could supply both its own customers and Mountain Valley’s customers with a single pipeline instead of two separate and similar pipelines, thereby significantly reducing environmental effects,” the analysis read.
Environmentalists and local residents have voiced concerns over the possibility of two high-pressure, large diameter pipelines in the same area.
Crystal Cavalier-Keck, co-founder of 7 Directions of Service, an organization focused on environmental justice and indigenous rights, emphasized the pipeline’s harmful effects on people in the area.
“MVP’s proposed extension of its pipeline into North Carolina — MVP Southgate — is now within half a mile of another dangerous proposed pipeline, Transco SSEP, and the burden on our communities will only be compounded,” Cavalier-Keck said in a statement.
Opponents of Southgate argue that the company should be required to submit a new application for the project rather than an amendment, since the changes deviate significantly from the original proposal.
FERC’s environmental assessment follows MVP’s amendment request to change the route, pipe diameter, and capacity of the pipeline, extending it from Pittsylvania County, Virginia into North Carolina.
“Southgate necessitates a full application, not an insufficient amendment request and environmental assessment,” Jessica Sims, Virginia field coordinator at Appalachian Voices, said in a statement. “Southgate’s developers inflicted harm on all communities within the path of their violation-riddled Mountain Valley Pipeline mainline, and should not be granted more permission to extend that harm into North Carolina.”

A patchwork of pilots, well-meaning grants, and isolated bright spots. What we don’t have is a statewide blueprint.","THIS FALL’S KINDERGARTEN class was born during the first wave of the pandemic. Five years later, we still haven’t stabilized their future. 
The data are clear: learning loss isn’t just lingering; in some cases, it’s worsening. The state’s press release announcing the recent MCAS results didn’t call it a “crisis,” but it should have. The severity of the problem isn’t a question, but whether we have the courage to act remains unknown. 
Student outcomes in math and reading remain well below 2019 levels across all student groups. Only 13 of more than 350 Massachusetts districts have returned to pre-pandemic performance. 
For the fourth straight year, 10th-grade scores in both math and English language arts dropped. Third-grade results are also distressing: reading remains 14 points lower than in 2019, with no improvement in the last four years, resulting in more than half (58 percent) of our children failing to read at grade level. 
These are not just numbers. These are the human consequences of policy decisions. In a state that prides itself on high-quality public education, we are graduating students with fewer skills and diminished economic mobility. 
So, what’s our strategy? A patchwork of pilots, well-meaning grants, and isolated bright spots. What we don’t have is a statewide blueprint. 
Southern states like Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Tennessee do. Even with less per pupil funding and higher child poverty rates, these states have significantly outpaced growth in comparison to Massachusetts, especially for the most vulnerable students. In 2024, on average, low-income fourth-graders in Mississippi and Louisiana outperformed low-income fourth-graders in Massachusetts on reading and math.  
This success is not accidental; it came from deliberate policy choices. In Massachusetts, we can learn from these outcomes and establish key pillars for a blueprint of our own. Here are four. 
1. Build Educator Capacity at Scale 
Make the message clear: If you want better outcomes for kids, give every teacher the tools to get them there. Mississippi’s policy leaders invested in equipping all teachers to excel in teaching reading and math – before entering the classroom and while on the job. They trained 20,000 K–3 teachers in the science of reading, backed by state-funded literacy coaches who visited schools weekly. Tennessee built a summer training program that reached over 60 percent of K–3 teachers, free of charge.  
2. Align Assessment and Accountability 
Rather than run from data, drive transparency and focus. Louisiana publicly reports how often teacher prep programs produce effective educators and ties renewal to those results. Tennessee links district funding and interventions to student achievement, with clear academic goals and public dashboards. Poor results became impossible to ignore and possible to fix. 
3. Build Instructional Infrastructure and Align Incentives 
Align incentives and build ecosystems around evidence-based teaching. Louisiana created a vetted list of high-quality curricula and aligned teacher prep, professional development, and funding around it. Tennessee made sure families had access to reading strategies that matched classroom instruction. They set clear goals, and then ensured vendors, universities, and parents all rowed in the same direction. 
4. Hold a High Bar and Stick with It 
Raise expectations for all students and stick with them, even when it’s hard. Mississippi kept its third-grade reading retention policy despite backlash. Today, its students lead the nation in reading gains by fourth grade. Alabama set a statewide goal that all students master foundational math by grade five, and backed it with free, high-quality summer math programs for all struggling students. In 2022, it was the only state to improve math scores on NAEP post-pandemic. These states invested in all the key stakeholders to stay the course. 
It’s not too late for Massachusetts. We have more resources than our southern peers and a legacy of educational excellence. What we lack is a statewide strategy. But a new window has opened. 
We have strong leadership at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Commissioner Pedro Martinez previously led ambitious academic improvement efforts in Chicago — one of the most complex school systems in the country — and knows what it takes to move from fragmentation to focus. 
The Healey administration’s Literacy Launch initiative is a promising down payment on improving reading instruction. But without a plan to ensure full statewide adoption of high-quality curricula and evidence-based teaching practices, it won’t reach the scale needed on the time horizon students deserve. 
For the first time in over two decades, Massachusetts is revisiting its graduation requirements. To thrive in our state, students need to read deeply, write clearly, think critically, and master the math and problem-solving skills that power our innovation economy. These standards are our compass, and the difference between students charting a future and finding a dead end. 
We can’t afford another year of decline. The stakes are too high. A patchwork won’t save us. A blueprint might. But only if we build it now.

“It started off with vandalistic origins, but over the last half century it has grown into one of the most legitimized and profitable art forms,” said an organizer of a $12,000 weekend spray-painting project.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Most municipalities try to curb graffiti. So why is Brattleboro commissioning it?.","BRATTLEBORO — Stone Arch Properties owner Mike Cota woke Monday to see two of his downtown buildings colored by more than 200 cans of spray paint. 
Cota knows he asked for it. Literally.
“A year ago, I thought, ‘Even with all the mediocre graffiti that’s down here, a lot of people love coming to take pictures,’” he said. “It’d be a shame to get rid of it, so what if we did something to improve it?”
That’s why Cota teamed with the nearby Brattleboro Museum & Art Center and Brandon-based Juniper Creative Arts to host a weekend “Graffiti Jam” that drew 15 professional “aerosol artists” from as far away as Slovakia.
Vermont’s largest city of Burlington recently made news when someone spray-painted over part of a $10,000 Main Street mural elementary students created near their school. In contrast, the Brattleboro event aimed to show graffiti has its good side.
“It started off with vandalistic origins, but over the last half century it has grown into one of the most legitimized and profitable art forms around the globe,” said Will Kasso Condry, an organizer.

Condry first spray-painted at age 7, then studied fine art and illustration at The College of New Jersey. As a co-founder of the Juniper collective with wife Jennifer Herrera Condry and daughter Alexa Herrera Condry, he has created more than 40 murals in public buildings throughout Vermont. He has won the Vermont Prize for visual art in 2022, the Herb Lockwood Prize in the Arts this summer and, with his family, the Vermont Arts Council’s Arthur Williams Award for Meritorious Service to the Arts last month.
Condry, who works with spray paint imported from Europe, understands why property owners can feel angry when someone targets them with a cheap can.
“It’s ignorant to think that you can stop all graffiti that is being done without sanction — that’s been going on since antiquity,” he said. “Graffiti culture was started by Black and brown children in inner city Philadelphia and New York, but nowadays, a lot of it springing up around Vermont is more than likely done by young white males. You control it through proper education and mentoring.”
And so the event aimed to teach a steady crowd of spectators the difference between “tagging” (a hit-and-run spray-painting of one’s name) and investing time and talent into an authorized “production” mural.

“Some people continue to see graffiti through the lens of vandalism,” Jennifer Condry said. “One of our goals with this event is to reinforce the message that graffiti is a respected global art movement that beautifies neglected spaces and builds community. We’re trying to show an evolution and elevation of style.”
The jam received a $12,000 grant from the Vermont Community Foundation’s arts and social cohesion fund — as well as one complaint from a resident who feared it would encourage vandalism elsewhere.
“This is public art in a graffiti style being done at the behest of the property owner,” Danny Lichtenfeld, the museum’s director, said in reply.
The result can be seen on Arch Street, just opposite Main Street’s Latchis Theatre and Hotel, where organizers found an eager apprentice in 14-year-old area eighth grader Eko Harmon-Fee.
“We’re not telling kids, ‘Just because you see us out here, go do it in the back of your school,’” Will Condry said. “We say, ‘Take the time to understand this is an art form like any other that requires training and education.’ Introduced the right way, this is the future of public art.”

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday updated its adult and child immunization schedules to to recommend COVID-19 shots for people 65 and older after they consult with their health care providers.
The CDC also is recommending in its updated immunization schedules that toddlers receive the chickenpox vaccines as a standalone immunization rather than in combination with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) shot.
The CDC announced what it called the return to “individual-based decision-making to COVID-19 vaccinations” in a press release on its website Monday morning.
The immunization schedules adopt recent recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which has been overhauled by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who fired  all 17 former members of the vaccine panel earlier this year and replaced them with his own appointees.
RFK Jr. fired everyone on a key vaccine panel. Here’s who he replaced them with.

“Informed consent is back,” said Acting Director of the CDC and Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O’Neill. “CDC’s 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today,” he continued.
“I commend the doctors and public health experts of ACIP for educating Americans about important vaccine safety signals. I also thank President Trump for his leadership in making sure we protect children from unintended side effects during routine immunization.”
According to the CDC press release, individual-based decision-making “means that the clinical decision to vaccinate should be based on patient characteristics that, unlike age, are difficult to incorporate in recommendations, including risk factors for the underlying disease as well as characteristics of the vaccine itself and the best available evidence of who might benefit from vaccination.
“Individual-based-decision-making,” the release continues,” allows for immunization coverage through all payment mechanisms including entitlement programs such as the Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program, and the Vaccines for Children Program, as well as insurance plans regulated by the Affordable Care Act.”

Vaccines greatly reduce rates of death and disease around the world. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Practitioners, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, American Pharmacists Association, National Academy of Medicine, and World Health Organization endorse the use of vaccines.
The health insurance trade group AHIP issued a statement last month saying health plans would continue to cover all ACIP-recommended vaccinations, including updated formulations of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, with no cost-sharing for patients through the end of 2026.
Health insurance group says vaccines in Florida still a covered benefit

The Florida Board of Pharmacy met briefly last month to affirm that Florida patients don’t need a prescription from their physician before receiving a vaccine. That’s because Florida law authorizes certain pharmacists who work in collaboration with physicians to administer vaccines.
Chickenpox
Meanwhile, the “new recommendation of standalone chickenpox vaccination for toddlers through age three follows evidence presented to ACIP by the CDC Immunization Safety Office’s that healthy 12–23 months old toddlers have increased risk of febrile seizure” from the combined chickenpox-MMR vaccine compared to those given immunization for chickenpox separately.
“The combination vaccine doubles the risk of febrile seizures without conferring additional protection from varicella compared to standalone vaccination,” the CDC statement says. Febrile seizures are brought on by high fevers.

She will consider an order to release Abrego Garcia as part of his habeas corpus petition, which challenges his detention at a U.S.immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. If the Trump administration is making no effort to remove Abrego Garcia, Xinis said the issue then becomes indefinite detainment of an individual, which runs against a Supreme Court ruling that found immigrants can’t be detained longer than six months if they are not in the process of being removed.Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant whom the Trump administration mistakenly deported to his home country and to a notorious mega-prison before returning him to the United States to face criminal charges, has thrown the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown into the spotlight.

The African country has aided the Trump administration in accepting third-country removals.Department of Justice attorney Jonathan D. Guynn during Monday’s hearing confirmed such a removal is planned at some point by the administration.Xinis pressed DOJ attorneys on exactly what steps the federal government has taken to send Abrego Garcia to Eswatini.Guynn said the federal government has not formally started a plan of removal, but said he could not confirm if removal plans were in motion. He argued that there are no imminent plans by the federal government to remove Abrego Garcia and the DOJ is trying to show that by keeping him in ICE custody.“The government feels like it's in the damned if it does, damned if it doesn't, situation,” Guynn said. “The government has been trying to respond … about concerns that Mr. Abrego Garcia will be rapidly removed from the United States, notwithstanding his habeas case, and ongoing immigration proceedings, and so in an abundance of caution... the United States is not imminently planning to remove Mr. Abrego Garcia.” Previously the Trump administration planned to deport Abrego Garcia to either Uganda or Eswatini. DOJ attorneys also asked for a temporary stay in the habeas corpus petition because of the government shutdown. Xinis denied the stay. She pointed to the DOJ's own shutdown contingency plan, which allows for litigation concerning habeas petitions to continue. Protests in support of Abrego GarciaAbout an hour before Monday’s hearing, the immigrant advocacy group CASA led a rally in front of the courthouse to continue its show of support for Abrego Garcia.About 100 people led chants shouting, “We are Kilmar!” “No More” and “When we fight, we win!” and held signs in support of Abrego Garcia and criticizing the Trump administration.

Religious leaders said prayers and a few other people spoke, such as Krystal Oriadha, who serves as vice chair of the Prince George’s County Council. Oriadha’s father was born in Kenya and immigrated to the U.S., where he met her mother in college.“I understand the story of immigration, and it’s one that has been such a story of pride in my life because it’s filled of sacrifice, yes and struggles, but pride and love for your family and hard work,” she said. “It is what every immigrant stands for, not the propaganda that this administration is propping up calling hardworking, loving families criminals, demonizing them. So let’s be careful and mindful of the propaganda that they’re spilling today.”Tennessee chargesThe federal judge in Abrego Garcia’s criminal trial in Tennessee, in which he is accused of human smuggling of immigrants, on Friday granted Abrego Garcia an evidentiary hearing. It will determine if those charges from the Trump administration are an illegal retaliation after Abrego Garcia successfully brought a suit challenging his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. Separately, an immigration judge last week denied Abrego Garcia’s request to reopen his asylum case. Abrego Garcia first came to the U.S. without legal authorization as a teenager in 2011. He tried to open an asylum case in 2019, but was denied because he did not apply within his first year in the U.S., which is the legal deadline for such claims.The Friday decision from that immigration judge ends one of the efforts for Abrego Garcia’s lawyers to keep him in the U.S., due to his protections from deportation to El Salvador. A separate immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia those protections from El Salvador in 2019, finding that Abrego Garcia would likely face violence if returned to his home country. At the time, the federal government didn’t search for a third country to remove Abrego Garcia. Six-month limitMonday’s hearing focused on the time frame of Abrego Garcia’s detainment and whether it conflicted with a 2001 Supreme Court case, in which justices ruled immigrants who are not in the process of removal cannot be kept in ICE detention for more than six months. Xinis questioned the reason for Abrego Garcia’s detention since late August if the Trump administration had no evidence of its plans to remove the longtime Maryland man. Another DOJ attorney, Bridget K. O’Hickey, said the federal government has not formalized a removal plan for Abrego Garcia, adding that she didn’t know if there were any plans in the process. Xinis called a short break in the middle of Monday’s hearing to give the DOJ attorneys time to make any calls to get information if the Trump administration was removing him. DOJ attorney Ernesto H. Molina said he was unable to reach anyone, pointing to the possible furlough of federal workers.

“It just is remarkable to me that you're saying you can't find a soul who can give you, in this case, any additional information,” Xinis said. “That suggests there is none.” One of Abrego Garcia’s lawyers in the Maryland case, Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, argued that if the Trump administration wanted to remove Abrego Garcia, they would send him to Costa Rica, which has already agreed to accept Abrego Garicia as a refugee.

Xinis asked why Abrego Garcia hasn’t been removed to Costa Rica. “We've received no communications, and I can't even wrap my brain to think of a constitutionally permissible reason why they would be fighting over whether to send them across the Atlantic Ocean when they can, this afternoon, send him to Costa Rica,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.Xinis asked the DOJ attorneys if there has been any effort to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, but Molina and O’Hickey said they have not been informed of those efforts.Human smuggling chargesAttorneys for Abrego Garcia’s criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration was trying to force him to plead guilty to  human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty and was ordered released by the federal judge in Tennessee to await his trial there in January on charges he took part in a long-running conspiracy to smuggle immigrants without legal status across the United States.

In late August, after Abrego Garcia was released from U.S. Marshals Service custody in Tennessee, immigration officials informed him he had to appear in Baltimore before the ICE field office for a check-in appointment. During that appointment, Abrego Garcia was detained. Xinis has previously ordered the Trump administration cannot remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. while his habeas petition continues, and that he must be kept within 200 miles of the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland. Last month, the Trump administration transferred Abrego Garcia from a facility in Virginia to an ICE detention facility 189 miles away in Pennsylvania. William J.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Energy savings for nearly 1 million households and jobs for hundreds of thousands of union laborers are in jeopardy under the abrupt cancellation of federal solar energy funds, according to a lawsuit filed Monday against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and its administrator, Lee Zeldin.
The 47-page complaint submitted in the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island centers on the ramifications of the yanked Solar for All grants for solar panel installation companies, labor unions, homeowners and nonprofit advocates.
“If Defendants’ unlawful termination of the Solar for All program is allowed to stand, nearly one million low-income households will lose access to affordable, resilient solar in communities in all states and territories, and hundreds of thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs will be lost, especially in the low-income and disadvantaged communities Congress intended these funds to benefit,” the complaint states.
The lawsuit, filed by attorneys with the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, the Southern Environmental Law Center, Lawyers for Good Government and the Conservation Law Foundation, comes more than two months after the EPA abruptly ended the Solar for All program. Originally included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act approved under the Biden administration, the $7 billion program aimed to help low- and moderate-income homeowners and renters access the benefits of solar panels — often too expensive or unfeasible otherwise — while advancing renewable energy use and creating jobs.
Funding was distributed in 2024 to state and local governments, nonprofits and tribal organizations nationwide, including a $49.3 million award to Rhode Island through the state’s Office of Energy Resources. 
Rhode Island had spent $89,000 of its share — on employee costs for administration preparation — when the money was clawed back, Christopher Kearns, acting energy commissioner, said in an email Monday.
But development work was well underway, with the state agency in tandem with labor leaders and nonprofit partners intent on maximizing the benefits of its federal windfall. The five-year program was projected to help 900,000 households nationwide save $350 million annually on their energy bills while creating 200,000 new jobs and workforce training programs, according to estimates from the Biden administration.
RI AFL-CIO leads the charge
The Rhode Island AFL-CIO, which represents 80,000 union workers in Rhode Island, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Union leaders helped Rhode Island plan and submit its application to the EPA seeking funding through the program, simultaneously creating and boosting workforce training and apprenticeship programs to prepare for the frenzy of new solar panel installations.
“Because of the requirement for prevailing wages and utilization of apprentices, the hope was that this would end up going to union contractors because we already pay prevailing wages and we always have professional apprenticeships in place,” Patrick Crowley, RI AFL-CIO president, said in an interview Monday. 
Meanwhile, the Rhode Island Center for Justice, a nonprofit public interest law firm, increased its staff by 20% — from eight to 10 attorneys — to focus on the state regulations governing solar energy and utilities in preparation for the federal grant, said Jennifer Wood, the center’s executive director. 
The Center for Justice is also named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with a Georgia homeowner who had already applied for a free solar installation, and several businesses and nonprofits involved in solar panel installation, financing and education.
None of the plaintiffs were direct recipients of the Solar for All grants, but all stood to benefit from the funds awarded — and are now “significantly harmed” by the funding termination, the lawsuit states.
“By not having this program, it’s a lost opportunity for hundreds of jobs,” Crowley said. 
Kearns, with Rhode Island’s Office of Energy Resources, declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Access issues 
Wood lamented the time and resources spent training two new attorneys on the complexities of state utility proceedings that govern the incentives for and implementation of solar energy in Rhode Island. More consequential, though, was the loss for low-income Rhode Island residents already struggling to afford rising energy bills and unlikely to reap benefits of solar energy without the federal aid.
“There are a lot of questions around solar, how it gets implemented, how the infrastructure works, but for our clients, the question is, can they even get access to it at all?” Wood said. “Not getting funding from Solar for All means our low-income customers may not be able to break into the benefits of solar power. That’s why it’s such a devastating blow.”










“Not getting funding from Solar for All means our low-income customers may not be able to break into the benefits of solar power. That’s why it’s such a devastating blow.”

The Trump administration’s opposition to renewable energy was clear on the campaign trail, and cemented as soon as he took office: halting offshore wind projects, yanking electric vehicle incentives, and freezing access to federal grants and loans for energy efficiency programs and solar panels, among others. 
Federal budget cuts signed into law on July 4 canceled $16 billion of clean energy and emissions reductions incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, a move affirmed by an appeals court in D.C. on Oct. 1. But the federal budget cuts only applied to funds not already committed to specific projects or recipients – suggesting the Solar for All funding was preserved, according to the lawsuit.
It alleges that Zeldin ignored the congressional directive and its “unambiguous text” when he announced in a social media video on Aug. 7 that the EPA was canceling the Solar for All program — violating the Administrative Procedures Act as well as constitutional protections for legislative authority.
The move drew swift condemnation from Democrats in Congress, including Rhode Island U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Gov. Dan McKee also denounced the news, accusing the Trump administration of “trying to undermine programs that support Rhode Island families” in a statement on Aug. 12.
“Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy,” Amy R. Romero, chief legal counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, said in a statement Monday. “The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, along with its colleagues, has brought suit against the federal government to enforce the law enacted by Congress and ensure Rhode Islanders receive what Congress intended.”
The complaint asks a federal judge to force the federal administration to restore funding for the program, and declare its termination unlawful.
A spokesperson for the EPA declined to comment in an emailed response on Monday.
The case was assigned to District Judge Mary S. McElroy.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-06 18:35:37+00:00,CT Mirror,Kosta Diamantis trial starts with prosecutors outlining alleged bribes,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/06/kosta-diamantis-trial-begins/,"In opening arguments, an attorney laid out the case against Diamantis, including the variety of locations where he allegedly accepted bribes.","The alleged bribes to Konstantinos Diamantis, head of Connecticut’s school construction office at the time, were delivered to him in a variety of locations, according to prosecutors.
The cash payments were allegedly dropped off at Diamantis’ house in Farmington. They were exchanged in the bathroom of the Capitol Grille in Hartford. And they were passed along to him in a Dunkin’ Donuts across from the government office building where he worked.
During opening arguments of his criminal trial in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, federal prosecutors painted Diamantis, a former state deputy budget director, as someone who was eager to profit off of his public position and “begged, pleaded and threatened” school contractors to pay him bribes.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Francis spent nearly half an hour during the opening day of the high-profile criminal trial laying out the case against Diamantis and previewing some of the evidence and testimony that jurors will see during the weekslong trial.
Diamantis was officially charged last year with more than 22 federal counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators, following a multiyear investigation. 
The federal prosecutors told the jurors that they would prove that Diamantis solicited bribes from construction firms in return for him exerting his control over the state’s multibillion dollars school building program, which he oversaw for more than six years.

And they quickly followed up those arguments by providing a preview of several text messages, emails and voicemails in which Diamantis and the school construction contractors discussed how much was expected to be paid.
“Just so you both (know). I’m very good at what I do and always do what I say,” Diamantis wrote in one of those text messages. “And I always usually work at 5 percent of total. Just FYI.” 
Diamantis, who was fired from his job as state deputy budget director in 2021, sat silently at the defense table taking notes, as prosecutors laid out the case against him. 
Meanwhile, Diamantis’ defense attorney, Norm Pattis, declined to deliver his own opening arguments to the jury. 
The first witness that prosecutors called to the witness stand quickly put the criminal allegations into perspective.
John Duffy, the former vice president of Acranom Masonry, repeatedly admitted to the jury that he and his boss Sal Monarca paid bribes to Diamantis. And in return, Duffy said, Diamantis secured work for Acranom on the state-funded school projects.
Prosecutors walked Duffy, who is Diamantis’ former brother-in-law, through a set of text messages and emails that allegedly showed Diamantis using his influence to ensure Acranom won a multimillion contract for the masonry work on the Weaver High School project in Hartford. 
“Please make sure vote tonight goes for us. Talk to your guy,” Duffy wrote to Diamantis in one exchange.
In response Diamantis wrote: “I already did.”
“Thanks bro,” Duffy replied. “U should be president.”

Duffy’s text messages also showed how Diamantis continued to hound the executives from Acranom for more money in return for his continued assistance on Connecticut school projects. 
“He’s all about full time consultation and annual fee,” Duffy wrote at one point referring to Diamantis. 
“We paid him 35k,” Monarca, the owner of Acranom masonry, replied.
Duffy, who already pleaded guilty to bribery last year, calmly testified about his dealings with Diamantis during the trial Monday.
But prosecutors also forced Duffy to admit that he initially lied when he was first questioned by federal investigators about the alleged bribery. 
Duffy told the jurors that he only acknowledged the alleged bribery after being confronted with the mountain of text messages that were obtained by prosecutors.
“I saw a number of texts that proved what really happened,” Duffy told the jury. 
Prosecutors claim that Duffy was not the only person who sought to cover up their actions. 
During the opening arguments, Francis also told the jury that they would get to listen to several recorded interviews in which Diamantis allegedly lied to investigators about accepting money from Acranom and another contractor, Construction Advocacy Professionals. 
They also highlighted a text message in which Diamantis instructed Duffy to delete their written conversations. 
“Erase this shit,” he wrote.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1006_SR_KostaTrialDay1_130-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 14:58:21.067469

(Photo by Jose Luis Pelaez Inc./Getty Images)Iowa schools recently kicked off October National Farm to School Month by serving at least two locally grown food items for breakfast, lunch, or snacks. On Oct. 8, school students will tackle the ambitious goal of achieving 1 million crunches of locally grown apples during the Great Apple Crunch.
But a different type of crunch time challenge is threatening to take a bite out of both student nutrition and the bottom line of small local farmers during the 2025-26 school year.
“As much as I love local food, it’s more expensive,” says Kaitlyn Scheuermann, Waukee Community Schools registered dietician nutritionist. “We need to pay farmers fair value, but when you buy a local apple for 60 cents, it means you only have about $3.65 left to buy protein and milk. The school lunch program runs on a shoestring budget, and food and labor costs are up.”
That’s why after six months of cutbacks and cancellations, it seemed like a huge win when U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently announced with great fanfare up to $18 million in revamped Farm to School funding for fiscal year 2026. The grants range from $100,000 to $500,000, and are the largest total annual amount in the program’s history.
But at Pleasant Grove Homestead near Fremont, Ashley and Zach Wenke aren’t so sure that their local produce and egg business would benefit. Based on her experience, Scheuermann has reservations about the revised grant criteria.
“The Patrick Leahy Farm to School grants have been around for several years, and our school has participated,” Scheuermann says. “Although the grant amounts are larger, no more than 10 percent of the grant budget can be allocated to buy food. The $18 million will be competitively awarded across the entire U.S.”
If the revised grant restores only a limited menu of options for farmers and schools to participate, it’s unlikely to advance the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) goals for children and families. Is it simply window dressing for shrinking federal support for local foods?
Grant helps prepare the seedbed
Since 2013, the Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grants Program has awarded $100 million to help schools build infrastructure and capacity, including planting school gardens, buying kitchen equipment, food safety training for farmers, and ag education.
Between 2013 and 2024, Iowans received $1.6 million to undertake 21 of these projects. Then in March 2025, the grant was canceled, and funding for fiscal year 2025 was pulled midstream.
“The larger grants may attract more partnerships, bigger collaborations,” Scheuermann says. “But the size may discourage others. Smaller schools may need to partner with others, like ISU Extension, or nearby schools. Matching funds also are required.”
But the Patrick Leahy Farm to School grant is only a single fiber of a federal patchwork of programs stitched together to create local partnerships between farmers, schools, food banks, and child care centers.

Two other programs launched during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide federal dollars to schools, child care facilities and food banks were canceled at the same time: the Local Food for Schools (LFS) Cooperative Agreement Program and the Local Food Purchase Assistance (LFPA) Cooperative Agreement Program. Both focused on targeted purchases from producers and facilitated local food partnerships.W
Due to these cancellations, Iowa schools and child care facilities lost a total of $8.3 million in promised grants over the next three years; food banks and pantries would have received another $3 million.
Scheuermann says Waukee Schools also participated in LFS, and worked closely with Farm Table Delivery, a nonprofit hub in Harlan that aggregated local foods. “Without this grant, it adds another layer of complexity to work directly with producers,” she says.
Laying the groundwork for a local foods farm
The Wenkes first applied for LFS and LFPA in 2021. By the time they found out the grant funds were canceled in 2025, they had ordered and paid for 350 birds and planted vegetables in their high tunnels. “Many don’t appreciate how far ahead growers have to be thinking, planning, and purchasing,” Ashley Wenke said.
The grants, which had helped them scale up production over the past few years, were built into their business plan. “It was a way to project a predictable income and stay as close to home as possible with our products,” Wenke said.
Most of their eggs and 55 types of their garden produce were distributed to food pantries and schools through the Grinnell Farm to Table Hub. They also delivered 200 pounds of cherry tomatoes per week to Iowa City’s Field to Family nonprofit food hub and market.
After the grant cancellations, the Wenkes added a farmers market to their schedule. “The markets are time consuming, and when weather isn’t good, sales can be disappointing,” she said. They also sold some of their hens.
The Choose Iowa Food Purchasing Program passed by the Iowa Legislature earlier this year was one step in the right direction. The Wenkes participate in this state program created to help food banks buy local foods. However, the total state appropriation is only $200,000. “Our farm alone had $50,000 in income from the two federal grant programs that were canceled,” Wenke said.
Food banks report rising needs
Emily Shearer has worked at Food Bank of Iowa for nine years, and as a food purchaser, she’s witnessed firsthand the positive impact of the LFPA on the food pantries in 55 of the 99 counties served.
“It’s often cost prohibitive to buy local foods, but LFPA provided options to buy cheese, lettuce, ground pork and beef, and other items,” she says. “It’s not true that people don’t want to eat healthy. It’s more expensive.”
Food Bank of Iowa distributed 27.3 million pounds of food in fiscal year 2025, an 8% increase over 2024. “We’ll still invest in local foods, but it may not be as consistent,” she says. “We’re having to do more with less.”
Although LFS and LPFA were launched to ease COVID supply chain shortages, Shearer says new sources of food insecurity are emerging.
“We’re distributing more than at the height of COVID, due to a combination of increasing food costs and a lot of jobs that don’t pay well,” she says. “The need is record and rising. We’ve never seen it at this level. We have to make sure people know food pantries can help.”
Scheuermann echoes this concern. “An estimated 2.4 million people will lose their SNAP benefits,” she says. “That means their children will lose their automatic eligibility to free-and-reduced school meals.”
This raises the question: If MAHA wants kids to eat healthier, why is the government cutting school, child care, and food bank funding? How does pulling out the rug from farmers producing fresh, healthy foods advance MAHA goals?
Local food is healthier, tastes better, supports our neighbors, and builds community. An accessible network of local food producers also builds resilience into our food supply to safeguard against the risks of climate change, trade wars, and future pandemics.
Crunch time challenge for local food supply chain
At the Food Bank of Iowa, Shearer witnessed the federal grants creating positive change. “It was great meeting growers and learning there’s a robust local foods landscape out here, contrary to the stereotype of Iowa farms. A lot of people worked for years to grow their farms and build regional food hubs. Continuing this momentum will be a challenge.”
Local food producers are hard to replace markets and carve new distribution channels. “It’s a lot of work to find a home for your products, and it’s more unpredictable now,” Wenke says. “We’re more cautious to sign any future agreements that leave us unprotected if cancelled. But we’re the type of people who figure things out. We want to keep doing this, and we’re too far into it to back out now.”

(File photo by Getty Images)The State Law Enforcement Division is investigating a fire that erupted over the weekend at the Edisto Island home of a circuit court judge and her husband, a former state senator.
Three people were injured in the fire that consumed the home belonging to Judge Diane Goodstein and former Democratic Sen. Arnold Goodstein on Saturday. All three people were taken to the Medical University of South Carolina, two by ambulance and one in an air evacuation, said Capt. KC Campbell, spokesperson for Colleton County Fire-Rescue.

Campbell declined to say who was injured because of patient privacy laws or even who was in the house at the time. Information about their condition as of Monday morning was not available. Nor was any information about the cause of the fire. SLED’s investigation is ongoing, and the state’s law enforcement agency will provide more information as it becomes available, said spokeswoman Renée Wunderlich.
Diane Goodstein, 69, a circuit court judge since 1998, recently signed off on an order blocking the release of voters’ information to the federal Department of Justice as part of a lawsuit over privacy concerns. The state Supreme Court overturned Goodstein’s order, saying she acted too quickly. The case was moved to a different court, since the agency involved is not located in Goodstein’s circuit, which spans Calhoun, Orangeburg and Dorchester counties.
The three-story house’s location on a barrier island complicated firefighting efforts, according to St. Paul’s Fire District, which helps respond to emergencies in small Lowcountry communities. The water supply near the island is limited, and the area is difficult to maneuver. People inside the house jumped out of windows and into the backyard, where kayakers brought them to the waiting ambulances, according to the department’s Saturday statement.

The Goodsteins bought the house and the surrounding 1.3 acres of marsh for $700,000 in 2019, according to county property records.
John Kittredge, chief justice of the state Supreme Court, was aware of the incident and requested additional security for Goodstein, according to a Saturday statement. The state’s highest court declined to comment further until the investigation is complete, asking people to respect “the privacy of the Goodstein family during this difficult time,” according to a Monday news release.
Diane and Arnold Goodstein have two adult children, Arnold Goodstein II and Eva Goodstein, according to Diane Goodstein’s judicial biography. Arnold Goodstein, 81, represented Charleston and Georgetown counties in the Senate from 1975 to 1980, following a two-term stint in the House, according to his legislative biography.
Although no information about the cause of the fire has been made publicly available, Ashley Creech, president of the South Carolina Association for Justice, called the idea of a judge facing threats or attacks for ruling a certain way “deeply concerning.”
“As a society and as a state, we must reject hostility and intimidation in all forms,” Creech said.

(Photo courtesy of Ben Ackman/Jersey City Times)June’s legislative primaries were the most expensive in state history, the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission announced Monday.
Assembly candidates and outside spending groups backing their bids poured nearly $30.7 million into the races, eclipsing the previous spending record reached in 2015, when candidates and outside groups spent $18.3 million on primaries after adjustments for inflation.
All 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot this year.  State Senate seats are not up for grabs until 2027.
Commission officials credited contribution limits that rose dramatically under a 2023 law for the increase.
The Elections Transparency Act doubled the maximum donation to candidates to $5,200, from $2,600, and the commission raised those limits to $5,500 under a provision of the act that requires the state to account for inflation every two years.
The surge of Assembly candidacies this year also contributed to higher spending totals, the commission said. This year, 209 individuals filed to run for Assembly, the most since 252 people ran in 1977.
Though seven of those candidates were knocked off the ballot as a result of challenges to their nominating petitions, the 202 that ran this year still far outnumbered candidates in recent Assembly cycles. Assembly races between 2015 and 2023 averaged 177 candidacies, the commission said.
Each of the 10 most expensive Assembly primaries was contested on at least one side.
District spending peaked at nearly $2.8 million in the 19th District, where Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) and Assemblywoman Yvonne Lopez (D-Middlesex) faced a long-shot challenge from social worker Michelle Burwell.
Candidates and outside groups spent more than $2.5 million in the 32nd District. There, an insurgent slate led by Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla (D) and former New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency chief of staff Katie Brennan (D) beat out county-backed challengers and incumbent Assemblywoman Jessica Ramirez (D-Hudson).
Together, the state’s 10 most expensive Assembly primaries accounted for just over half of all spending on the lower-chamber races, or just under $16 million.
Outside spending on legislative primaries also reached a new peak. Independent expenditure groups put about $2.7 million into this year’s Assembly primaries, eclipsing the $2.3 million record reached in 2021’s primaries, which included primaries for both legislative chambers.
New Jersey holds Assembly elections in every odd-numbered year. Senators serve a four-year term or a two-year term for elections held at the start of the decade. Senators elected in 2027 will serve for four years, and those elected in 2031 will serve for two.

(Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator) An LSU student arrested last week for protesting at a presidential search committee meeting said police became hostile toward her once they learned she is transgender. The questionable treatment she alleges continued once she was taken to jail, where she said guards didn’t know where she should be kept.    
Gabriela Juárez, 20, was arrested after she refused to cede the microphone after reaching the three-minute limit for public comment at Wednesday’s meeting. Six other student protestors tried to block the police car taking Juárez away and were also arrested. All are members of the LSU chapter of Students for a Democratic Society, who claim Gov. Jeff Landry – not campus leaders, faculty or students – is secretly steering the process to hire the university’s next president.  
While the other six students were charged with misdemeanors and released from the campus police station, Juárez was charged with interference with educational process, which is a felony, and misdemeanor resisting arrest. 
In an interview Thursday, Juárez said LSU Police officers began treating her differently when they discovered she is transgender. They initially referred to Juárez as “she” or “her,” she said. But when she told police her legal name, which is different from the one she uses, they began treating her with more hostility and referred to her as “he” or “him,” Juárez said. 
LSU spokesman Todd Woodward, who also represents the campus police department, declined to comment on Juarez’s allegations. 
When Juárez was taken to East Baton Rouge Parish Prison, she said correctional officers conducted a strip search on her. While she was still unclothed, she said they discussed whether she should be kept with the men or the women at the jail. 
“They said to the officer, ‘I have someone here who is bottom parts male but up top fully female,’” Juárez said in an interview. “And so they had no idea what to do with me.” 
Juárez said she was given a women’s uniform and put into a cell by herself, with officers telling her they were concerned she would be sexually assaulted otherwise. Despite her women’s uniform, Juárez said other officers interrogated her about her gender and loudly referred to her as a man. 
Juárez also said she was not given the opportunity for a phone call after her arrest. Other student members were able to get her release without getting in contact with her, she said. 
The East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s office has not yet responded to a request for comment. 
Juárez must appear in court for her charges Jan. 5, though she said she believes the charges will be dropped before then. Until her court date, she has been banned from entering the LSU Foundation building, where the LSU Presidential Search Committee holds its meetings. 
The other six students were told they would receive their court summonses in the mail within the next two weeks. 
Chaotic meeting
Fifteen angry students sprung from their seats the moment LSU Police officers grabbed Juárez at Wednesday’s committee meeting. 
She and six other members of Students for a Democratic Society made public comments at the meeting, many dressing down the 20 members of the search committee that they characterized as illegitimate. Several wore white T-shirts with the slogan “No MAGA President.” 
Some made profane comments — Juárez alleged the only criteria for serving on the committee was to “be a millionaire and suck off the governor” — though most kept their language clean until the police stepped in. 
“Don’t f—ing touch me,” Juárez shouted as the first LSU Police officer grabbed her arm. 
“Am I being detained?” she shouted as two officers dragged her out of the room. 
After Juárez was taken from the room, the chaos continued. Several students in her organization remained behind to protest Juárez’s removal. 

“Shame on you,” they shouted, until another police officer escorted them out of the room. The students cursed at the police as they left. 
Outside the LSU Foundation building, Juárez was searched, handcuffed and placed in the back of an LSU Police cruiser. Her friends watched, shouted and recorded video on their phones as she was arrested. 
Police officers warned their peers — and several nearby reporters — to stay 25 feet away from them, referencing a state law approved last year that prohibits the public from getting within that distance of a working officer after being told to stay back. The law is currently blocked from being enforced while it’s challenged in court. 
The six students who blocked the police cruiser were handcuffed and led to the sidewalk, where they sat in the sun until more cars arrived to take them away. They were charged with simple obstruction of a highway and resisting an officer with force.

Juárez was held in jail until other students posted $1,000 bail on her behalf after midnight Thursday.  An LSU Police report lists her victims as the campus police department, the public and the university. 
Juárez said she believes she was targeted for her activism. She has been at the forefront of the Students for a Democratic Society’s campus protests against Israel, Landry, President Donald Trump and the LSU administration. 
The Louisiana Republican Party called on LSU to discipline Juárez for her comments criticizing ultra-conservative activist Charlie Kirk in the wake of his shooting death last month. Juárez shared an Instagram story that referred to Kirk as a “world famous fascist” with the caption “rejoice.” 
“In a moment where they are actively cultivating a panic around the presence of Latinos and the presence of trans people, and especially transgender women … I do believe that that – combined with the fact that I have a high profile on campus – led to them wanting to make an example out of me, and wanting to intimidate me specifically, and to use me as a show of force to scare other students into being silent,” Juárez said.
Charges rare for public comment violations
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard, who asked police to remove Juárez, said that while she was out of line, he didn’t think she should be criminally charged. 
“I don’t want any student to be barred with a mistake she made,” Ballard said. “I hope that cooler heads prevail.”
Juárez said she believes she was the only one taken to the parish prison because she was the only non-white person in the group and a transgender woman. 
“LSU PD wants to pretend like this wasn’t targeted because it would be blatantly corrupt if it was. But it was and it is,” Juárez said. 
In a comment passed through the university’s spokesman, LSU Police Chief Marshall Walters said Juárez was taken to prison “because of her level of physically resisting the arrest.” 
While it’s not uncommon for members of the public to exceed their allotted time for speaking – or even to angrily interject outside of public comment periods – it’s rare for those incidents to lead to arrests. 
Since 2018, there have only been three reported incidents of arrests in Louisiana for speaking out of turn at public meetings. In two of those cases, charges were ultimately dropped.  
“It’s important for public bodies to control the meeting and make sure when it’s orderly as long as those rules are being applied to everyone in a fair manner,” said attorney Scott Sternberg, who specializes in First Amendment cases. “We see all the time people being cut off and asked to sit down or even asked to leave if they are disorderly.” 

“Being arrested for speaking at a public meeting is very, very strange, and there must have been some other aggravating factor,” Sternberg added. 
Juárez’s charge for interfering with an educational process is also unusual, Sternberg said. According to the law, the charge is applicable when the violator, while on school grounds, “willfully impedes the staff or faculty of such institution in the lawful performance of their duties” or if they “willfully refuse” to leave school property when requested to do so if the person is disrupting the operations of the institution. 
Juárez and the other arrested students said they heard police officers discussing using ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot, to determine what charges the students should face.
Woodward declined to comment on this assertion.

(Photo by John Oldham/Arkansas National Guard)More than 100 Arkansas National Guards members traveled to the nation’s southern border this weekend to support U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. 
The 13-month deployment supports a federal requirement and is a routine rotation to replace National Guard units currently serving along the southern border, according to a news release. 
A departure ceremony was held Sunday morning for nearly 120 troops and four UH-72 Lakota aircraft from 1st Battalion,114th Security and Support Aviation Regiment, 77th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade. The helicopter unit, which includes pilots, crew chiefs, mechanics, flight operations personnel, fuelers and battalion staff, was mobilized for a Title 10 federal active duty deployment and is expected to return in November 2026. 
Brig. Gen. Chad Bridges, Arkansas’ adjutant general, said he is “immensely proud” of the guardsmen “as they answer the call to serve our state and nation.” 
“As Governor Sanders has often highlighted, their unwavering dedication, exceptional skills, and profound professionalism are a true testament to the strength and commitment of Arkansas,” Bridges said in the release. “They embody the very best of our state as they undertake this critical mission.”
Arkansas National Guard deploying 40 members to assist Texas at southern U.S. border

The 1-114th has subordinate units in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and Puerto Rico. The Arkansas guard crews will deploy with roughly 170 troops and more than a dozen other UH-72s from Bravo Company, 1-114th, from Texas and Oklahoma, and Charlie Company, 1-114th, from Mississippi and Louisiana, according to the release.
After traveling to a mobilization station in Fort Hood, Texas, the troops will disperse to various locations along the border with Mexico. 
The Arkansas National Guard has been to southern border states numerous times on federal missions, according to the release. Most recently the 875th Engineer Battalion in Jonesboro deployed 50 troops in 2022 and 2023 to Texas for one year to perform command and control of subordinate military companies on Title 10 orders. 
Arkansas governors have also deployed guardsmen to the southern border. In 2021, then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson ordered 13 guard members to Texas to provide vehicle maintenance support to the Texas National Guard for 90 days, according to the release. 
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders ordered 80 guard members to Texas for 40 days in 2023 to perform lookout and observation post duties. In 2024, Sanders sent 40 troops to support the Texas National Guard for 60 days.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)A bitter regulatory battle that divided state government and fractured the Democratic-Farmer-Labor coalition came to an end Friday when utility regulators voted unanimously to approve the sale of northern Minnesota’s largest public electric utility.
After the $6.2 billion deal closes later this year, a subsidiary of asset management giant BlackRock will own 60% of Allete, the parent company of Minnesota Power. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will own the rest.
Allete’s management hailed the decision, saying that the new owners’ capital would help the company invest billions in new energy infrastructure to meet its obligations under Minnesota’s 2040 carbon-free power law. BlackRock and the Canadian pension board have said they would invest nearly $5 billion in Minnesota Power’s sprawling system over the next several years.
The decision “positions Allete well to meet the significant infrastructure demands of the clean-energy transition without compromising the high-quality service and commitments to reliability and affordability that define our company,” Allete chair, president and CEO Bethany Owen said in a statement.
The PUC’s decision also garnered support from Minnesota labor unions and some nonprofits that advocate for lower greenhouse gas emissions.
At a commission hearing on Sept. 25, Kevin Pranis, regional marketing manager for the Laborers’ International Union of North America, downplayed what he called “exaggerated fears” about the world’s largest asset manager owning a relatively small electric utility. He said the merger would be a good thing for Minnesota Power’s customers, including the large mining and industrial companies that argued it would undermine their economic competitiveness.
“We have only one interest in this proceeding…ensuring Minnesota Power continues to function as an independent utility,” he said. “We chased down every angle to make sure we’re not making a mistake that will hurt us and our reputation with our members.”
In a statement Friday, Allen Gleckner, chief policy officer of St. Paul-based clean energy group Fresh Energy, also nodded to public apprehension around the deal while calling it a win for the environment.
“Fresh Energy only decided to get involved in this proceeding after a thorough examination of the record and extensive conversations with stakeholders both for and against the sale,” he said. “We determined that the sale of Minnesota Power would significantly mitigate risk to the transition to clean energy in Minnesota.”
Fresh Energy and the Clean Grid Alliance registered their support for the proposed merger after the Minnesota Department of Commerce extracted commitments from Allete and the prospective buyers to freeze rates for one year, safeguard the independence of its 14-member board of directors and meet service quality standards while protecting lower-income ratepayers. Following the July 11 settlement, the department threw its support behind the deal, splitting with the Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who remained staunchly opposed.
The merger is “consistent with private equity playbook,” assistant attorney general Peter Scholtz said at the Sept. 25 hearing. The partners aim to “put in as little of their own capital as possible…then sell for a profit,” he added.
The Office of Attorney General remained unpersuaded by a Sept. 24 agreement that secured additional commitments from Minnesota Power and its future owners. Those included $50 million in bill credits paid to Minnesota Power customers by 2032; $20 million in monthly bill discounts for eligible low-income customers; fines of $250,000 per violation of the agreed-upon service standards; and, a cap on Minnesota Power’s profit margin — which is set by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission — through 2030.
Scholtz noted that while Allete’s future owners agreed to cap their profits for five years, they would not agree to cap their return on investment, which opponents of the deal said could encourage it to overbuild expensive infrastructure. The agreement also calls into question the independence of Allete’s future board of directors and leaves open the possibility that BlackRock and CPPIB will sell Allete to another “financial buyer” in the coming years, he said.
Ratepayer groups and corporate watchdogs were likewise unmoved by the agreement, calling its ratepayer protections insufficient.
“While figures like $50 million may sound like a lot, the very temporary protections, programs, and funding tacked onto this deal cannot offset the billions of dollars of profit the new owners intend to reap from northern Minnesota households and businesses,” said Hudson Kingston, legal director for rural advocacy group CURE, in a statement that called the deal a “lose-lose for northern Minnesota.”
In a fact sheet published after the commission’s vote, Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota cited expert witness estimates that BlackRock and CPPIB are overpaying for Allete by as much as $1.5 billion. Ratepayers will eventually be on the hook for this “windfall for Allete shareholders,” it said.
CUB hinted that BlackRock and CPPIB were not being forthcoming about their plans to extract value from Allete and Minnesota Power, noting the parties’ extensive use of trade secret designations and redactions during the merger proceeding. At the Sept. 25 meeting, the Public Utilities Commission denied a motion by the Office of the Attorney General to remove trade secret designations from some filings.
And CUB questioned the buyers’ true commitment to Minnesota’s carbon-free power transition. BlackRock has extensive fossil-fuel investments, is a frequent opponent of climate-related motions by other shareholders in those companies and withdrew from a global climate finance coalition that subsequently suspended its activities, CUB said.
Despite those concerns, CUB Executive Director Annie Levenson-Falk struck a conciliatory tone in a statement following the commission’s vote.
“Though we disagree with the commission’s decision, we genuinely hope they are correct in their assessment,” she said.
With the Allete proceeding behind it, BlackRock is gearing up for future — and perhaps bigger — fights before state utility commissions. The Financial Times reported last month that BlackRock is eyeing a $38 billion deal for AES, a utility group and energy developer with operations on four continents.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P1230519-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 14:58:21.067469

Wingate issued July 20. The order paused the enforcement of a state law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools.","The leader of the Senate committee that oversees U.S. courts is asking a federal judge in Mississippi to explain whether his office used artificial intelligence to write a flawed order in a recent case.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, sent a letter to U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate on Monday that questioned whether the judge or his clerks used AI to write an order. He also asked why the order in question had been removed from the public docket and whether the judge planned to restore the original order to the docket.
The letter stems from an error-laden temporary restraining order Wingate issued July 20, which paused the enforcement of a state law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools.

After the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office raised concerns about mistakes in the order — which included naming defendants and plaintiffs that weren’t parties to the case, misquoting state law and referencing a case that doesn’t exist — the judge replaced the order with a corrected version, wiping the original from the public docket. 
Wingate denied the state’s request to restore the original order with errors to the public docket and refused to explain the errors, chalking them up to “clerical” mistakes. But attorneys have questioned whether artificial intelligence was used to prepare it. It’s hard to know for certain, experts say, but the original order did contain errors that are “hallmarks” of AI usage.
“These do not appear to be simple slips of the pen or mechanical oversights, but substantive errors that undermine confidence in the Court’s deliberative process,” Grassley wrote. 
The state attorney general’s office has since appealed Wingate’s orders prohibiting the state from enforcing the DEI laws to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judges from the appellate court could also ask Wingate to explain the errors in the order. 
Wingate did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Grassley’s letter. 
Grassley’s letter, which cited reporting from Mississippi Today, is a general oversight inquiry and not a subpoena. He has given Wingate until Oct. 13 to respond to his questions.
With a U.S. senator weighing in on Wingate’s recent case, the Mississippi judge may now be at the center of how the federal judiciary polices itself over AI usage. 
The legal profession has seen a rise in AI use in recent years, with people relying on software or processes that attempt to replicate aspects of human work. These are trained on vast amounts of data to accomplish tasks such as researching court cases and citing them in legal briefs.  
But these systems are not perfect and can “hallucinate,” or provide false information. 
It’s increasingly common for judges to sanction lawyers for suspected artificial intelligence usage. Attorneys have a professional and ethical responsibility to make truthful statements in court and in legal filings, but there’s little accountability when the roles are reversed. 
Grassley, though, wrote that federal judges should also be held to the “highest standards of integrity, candor, and factual accuracy.”

The Supreme Court is expected to settle Trump's birthright citizenship challenge. (Photo by Leah Millis-Pool/Getty Images)A federal appeals court in Boston upheld a New Hampshire judge’s move to block President Donald Trump from eliminating birthright citizenship Friday, ruling in favor of a New Hampshire Indonesian organization and others. 
The ruling came as the same court, the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals, issued an exhaustive opinion against the Trump administration’s birthright citizenship actions in a separate lawsuit. Its decision in that case, Doe v. Trump, formed the basis for the ruling in the New Hampshire case.
In both rulings, the court rejected an attempt by the Trump administration to reinterpret the 14th Amendment and use that reinterpretation to deny automatic U.S. citizenship to the children of parents who are undocumented. 
Instead, the court pointed to centuries of judicial precedent that reads the 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, as guaranteeing that right to citizenship based on birth — in particular, the 1898 case of U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark.
“Our nation’s history of efforts to restrict birthright citizenship — from Dred Scott in the decade before the Civil War to the attempted justification for the enforcement of the Chinese Exclusion Act in Wong Kim Ark — has not been a proud one,” the court wrote in its Doe decision. 
“… The ‘lessons of history’ thus give us every reason to be wary of now blessing this most recent effort to break with our established tradition of recognizing birthright citizenship and to make citizenship depend on the actions of one’s parents rather than — in all but the rarest of circumstances — the simple fact of being born in the United States.”
The rulings keep in place a February freeze by a New Hampshire court of the Trump administration’s reinterpretation. They also bring the matter one step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is expected to ultimately settle it. 
But Friday’s opinion addressed only the first question of the lawsuit: whether the current preliminary injunction against Trump’s birthright citizenship order was proper. The underlying legal matter will still need to be worked through in the New Hampshire District Court — even if the U.S. Department of Justice appeals the Friday opinion. 
New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support is one of three plaintiffs in the New Hampshire-based lawsuit, NHICS v. Trump, along with the League of United Latin American Citizens and Make the Road New York. That lawsuit was filed by state and national branches of the American Civil Liberties Union.
The lawsuits seek to challenge a Jan. 20 executive order from Trump titled “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” in which the president directed his departments to adopt a new interpretation of the 14th Amendment that eliminated the birthright citizenship right. The order argues that the amendment was not meant to grant automatic citizenship to anyone born in the country regardless of the immigration status of their parents, and that the federal government should not consider those people citizens.
In the legal complaint, the New Hampshire organization wrote that some of its members are undocumented and are expecting children, meaning they would be affected by the executive order. For instance, “Gail” and “Thomas” — whose names are pseudonyms created by attorneys in the case — are undocumented people who worried in February that the child they were expecting would not receive government benefits or a birth certificate. 
The lawsuit was brought against Trump, the heads of the Department of Homeland Security, State Department, Department of Agriculture, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the departments themselves. 
But in its ruling Friday, the 1st Circuit Court decided that it could not apply an injunction to Trump — or his departments — directly, and that it was “an abuse of discretion” for New Hampshire District Court Judge Joseph Laplante to have done so. Instead, the appeals court narrowed the injunction to the leaders of the federal agencies.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trumproberts-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 14:58:21.067469

“It’s great training ground for a governor’s run. Of course, on the state level, you can’t just win with Democrat numbers. You have to have Republicans and independents,” Holscher said. “Kansans want commonsense solutions. That’s what it’s all about. I’m going to listen to people. I’m going to collaborate and work together with peers. I’m going to listen to the experts in terms of health care and issues like that.”



Voters of Kansas have a history of moving between Republican and Democratic governors. It began in 1965 with Republican William Avery, who was followed by Democrat Robert Docking, Republican Robert Bennett, Democrat John Carlin, Republican Mike Hayden, Democrat Joan Finney and Republican Bill Graves. From 2003 to 2011, Democrats Kathleen Sebelius and Mark Parkinson held the office. Republicans Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer were in change from 2011 to 2019, at which point Kelly was elected to back-to-back terms as governor. She leaves office in January 2027.
“I wouldn’t have entered this race if there weren’t a path to victory for me,” Holscher said during a Kansas Reflector podcast interview.
She’s competing in the August 2026 primary against state Sen. Ethan Corson, D-Fairway, and Lawrence resident Marty Tuley.
 
Statehouse experience
Holscher, 56, said her nine years in the Legislature and a demonstrated ability to work across the aisle to pass legislation made her a viable candidate for governor.
She said she was among a group of House members who worked to adopt a bill in 2017 to expand eligibility for Medicaid. It wasn’t implemented because the House fell a few votes shy of overcoming Brownback’s veto.
She was a founder of the Women’s Bipartisan Caucus in the Legislature that formulated a plan to repeal the Brownback administration’s 2012 decision to slash state income taxes without sufficient resources to sustain funding for core programs in education, transportation and social services. The tax law was largely reversed in 2017 on a bipartisan vote after budget shortfalls made the tax policy unsustainable.
“We’ve had a lot of things happen every year since ending the experiment,” Holscher said. “Though, of course, the Brownback allies, the MAGA extremists, they have wanted to restart the Brownback experiment or some version of it. This is the concern.”
Holscher said Kansas was at a “crisis point” at the Capitol because two-thirds Republican supermajorities in the House and Senate continued to move damaging legislation to Kelly’s desk. The governor has relied on her veto authority, but she has been overridden many times.
In the future, Holscher said the presence of a Democratic governor and shrinking of the GOP’s numerical advantage in the House were important to balancing state policy.
“I’m not only committed to winning my race in terms of the governor’s race. I’m committed to flipping a few of those House seats. We just have to change the makeup of this Legislature,” she said.
 
‘That’s cheating’
She opposed the effort by Republicans in the Legislature to call a special session in November to consider new boundaries of the four congressional districts in a bid to undermine reelection of U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat serving the 3rd District in the Kansas City area. It would be done at behest of President Donald Trump, who has been anxious about the GOP’s potential loss of the U.S. House next year. The new Kansas map would divide Johnson County voters among two or three congressional districts.
“A lot of people are very concerned about this in Johnson County,” Holscher said. “It’s a scheme that is aimed to dilute the votes of hundreds of thousands of Kansans. There’s no reason to redistrict mid-decade except to rig the system in one party’s favor over another. Frankly, that’s not democracy. That’s cheating.”
Holscher was born on a farm at Slater, Missouri, as the granddaughter of tenant farmers. Her father worked in concrete construction, while her mother was employed at the local school as a bus driver and custodian.
She earned a degree at the University of Missouri to become a first-generation college graduate. Eventually, she moved to Johnson County to start a family. She worked in marketing before entering the Legislature.
In the statehouse, Holscher has been an advocate of funding K-12 public schools and an opponent of shifting millions of tax dollars to private schools.
“I’m a product of public schools. That’s what helped me rise out of poverty. I’m just so grateful to my teachers, the teachers my kids had who have had a profound impact on them. Our public schools hold together our communities,” she said.
She said private school vouchers were marketed as “school choice” and a way to assist lower-income kids enroll in better schools. In reality, she said, “it’s just a transfer of wealth” because seven of 10 vouchers go to families in which children already attend private school.
Holscher has been a supporter of abortion rights in the Legislature. She opposed the proposed 2022 amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have made it easier to restrict reproductive health services in Kansas. The amendment failed by a margin of 59% to 41%. At stake was a Kansas Supreme Court decision that says the state constitution offered Kansans a fundamental right to bodily autonomy, which included the decision to end a pregnancy.
“We settled that essentially with the amendment in 2022,” Holscher said. “Some of the extremists in the Legislature want to keep bringing that topic back. The public overwhelmingly said they wanted to protect access to reproductive health care.”
Holscher said as governor she would work to moderate the cost of living in Kansas, including essentials such as child care, health care and housing.
“My focus is on just making sure that, you know, we are working to make life more affordable for Kansans,” she said. “I come from, essentially, a background that struggled. I can understand those situations.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/P9250016-e1759773246218-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-06 14:58:21.067469

FPL’s originally proposed base rate hike in February would have allowed it to collect $9.8 billion in revenue over the next four years — […],"Solar farm via Florida Power & Light, 2022.The Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) began the first phase of technical hearings in Tallahassee Monday for Florida Power & Light’s (FPL) proposed rate hike for its approximately 12 million customers.
FPL’s originally proposed base rate hike in February would have allowed it to collect $9.8 billion in revenue over the next four years — the highest in U.S. history. Since then, that has been negotiated down by approximately $2.9 billion — still far too high, energy advocates argue.
In her opening statement, Ali Wessling, attorney for the Office of Public Counsel (OPC), said the PSC’s statutory obligation is to regulate utilities such as FPL for the protection of the public welfare, which in this case means customers — not the corporation itself.
“Based on their filing in this case, they would have you believe that it is their welfare that we are here to protect,” she said, adding that over the course of the hearings, the OPC will provide expert testimony that many of FPL’s requests “would in fact cause harm to the welfare of FPL’s customers, and thus result in unfair, unjust, unreasonable, and thus unaffordable rates.”
In its filing for a base rate increase with the PSC in February, the company requested a return on equity (ROE) of 11.9%, several points higher than the industry standard of 9.68%, with a third of the proposed first-year increase going strictly to profits, according to the OPC.
However, just days before FPL was scheduled to begin hearings before the PSC on that proposal in August, the investor-owned utility announced an agreement with a group of key stakeholder groups, including the Florida Retail Federation, Walmart, and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE). The company reduced its proposed  rate increase to $6.903 billion with a 10.95% ROE.
FPL has claimed that its latest version of a four-year plan would benefit customers through “rate stability and predictability.” That FPL is asking permission to raise its base rates in every year of the four-year plan contradicts that claim, Wessling said.
“Rate stability protects FPL’s welfare, not the customers with FPL’s welfare,” she said, adding that “bill stability” would certainly not be guaranteed in the four-year plan because of problems like storms and fuel prices.
The OPC says it intends to demonstrate that FPL’s rates should not increase by more than $35.2 million through 2027. It claims the proposed deal would increase FPL’s revenues by $6.753 billion through 2029, which it asserted in a filing with the PSC in August as “unconscionable.”
The first witness was FPL President CEO Armando Pimentel. He testified that the proposed base rate increase would result in an average increase on the total bill for “typical” 1,000-kWh residential customers of “roughly 2.5% a year.”
Along with the Office of Public Counsel, other organizations represented during the hearing include Floridians Against Increased Rates (FAIR), Florida Energy for Innovation Association, Federal Executive Agencies (FAE), Florida Rising, the  League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida (LULAC), and Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida.

Susan Collins attends the ribbon cutting at the newly renovated American Red Cross facility in Portland, Maine on October. 6, 2025. (Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)At an event celebrating the renovation of the American Red Cross facility in Portland on Monday, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins criticized congressional Democrats over their refusal to support Republicans’ plan to keep the government running without lowering health care costs.
Collins and independent U.S. Sen Angus King appeared at the ribbon cutting hours before returning to Washington, D.C., where they are expected to hold a fifth vote on the House-passed Republican bill that would keep the government open until Nov. 21 as well as on Democrats’ counterproposal that aims to provide funding through October while restoring and permanently extending certain federal health funding and subsidies.
As the vast majority of both parties appeared entrenched in their positions, neither bills are expected to pass, prolonging the shutdown that began on Oct. 1.
“The consequences are going to be felt by federal employees who will start missing their paychecks starting at the end of this week, and by federal employees who are forced to work despite the fact that they’re not going to be paid,”  Collins said. “And that’s just not right.”
Both Collins and King voted in support of the GOP proposal, as well as U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who was the only House Democrat to back the Republican bill. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree and other Democrats have continued to call for negotiations over the short term funding deal, arguing that the upcoming expiration of health care tax credits and other cuts need to be urgently addressed.
Sharing concern about health costs, Maine delegation split over shutdown strategy

Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidies lower the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Of the 61,000 Maine people who enroll through CoverME.gov, the state’s online marketplace, 85% rely on premium tax credits to reduce their monthly costs.
Collins on Monday reiterated her support for extending the credits, but she said she does not agree with that being part of the continuing resolution. Such a proposal is not “clean stopgap funding,” she said, which is what Republicans are proposing “to ensure that there is not a disruption of services, nor of paychecks to federal employees.”
“I do think we need an extension, but we also need some reforms, such as a cap on how much income you can earn, and that is totally feasible to do right after we finish keeping government open,” Collins said. “But we should not have issues that are very complicated that split the Senate attached to the continuing resolution, because all that’s going to do is prolong the shutdown.”
Last month, the Maine Bureau of Insurance announced steep increases in 2026 health insurance premiums for more than 100,000 Maine people. 
By late October, Maine households insured by the state-based health insurance marketplace will begin to receive notices of premium increases that are expected to average $286 per month when combined with insurer-submitted 2026 rate increases. The Mills administration has warned that nearly 9,500 consumers — 18% of those receiving assistance — will lose all premium support if the enhanced credits expire, leading to average increases of more than $900 per month.
Collins frets over threat of mass layoffs
Meanwhile, the White House has threatened mass layoffs if an agreement is not reached soon, which some Democrats have characterized as a “mafia-style threat” and an unprecedented continuation of the Trump administration’s slashing of the federal government. 
Typically during a shutdown, some federal employees are categorized as exempt, meaning they work throughout the funding lapse. Others are furloughed. All receive back pay once Congress funds the government, under a 2019 law. 
Collins on Monday voiced concern that White House budget director Russ Vought “may take a look at that so-called nonessential list and lay off federal employees who are in fact doing very essential work.”
Collins, who chairs the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, said she’s made it “very clear to [the Office of Management and Budget] that I do not think that those layoffs are fair, and that will end up with the agencies not having sufficient personnel to do the mission of the agency.”
Asked what she’s doing to end the shutdown, Collins said she’s been talking with her colleagues and outlined a proposal to restart the government, which included working to get a commitment from Republican leaders to get a negotiated version of the bipartisan appropriations bills passed by the Senate in August to a full vote. 
“That was something that Democrats were particularly concerned about. So there’s no reason why this can’t be worked out,” she said. 
Whether such a deal would be honored by the White House remains to be seen. Democrats are growing increasingly frustrated with the Trump administration’s unilateral actions on spending, arguing it has significantly eroded Congress’ constitutional power of the purse.
Since Trump resumed office, his administration has rescinded and withheld numerous congressionally appropriated funds.
Last week, Collins said the Government Accountability Office should sue the Trump administration over its efforts to freeze or unilaterally cancel spending approved by Congress. The GAO has cited the Trump administration for illegally impounding funding for electric vehicle charging, museums and libraries, Head Start, energy efficiency upgrades in K-12 schools, funding for medical research at the National Institutes of Health and funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Washtenaw Intermediate School District Grants & Special Projects Coordinator Sarah Hierman said the significant influx of $800 million in one-time federal funding during the pandemic via the American Rescue Plan provided more flexibility for schools to work with families who were facing challenges associated with housing instability. In this case, the intermediate school district was able to pay for a hotel stay for the child and their parent, allowing them to take the test the next morning.
While the scenario illustrated just one of the barriers students experiencing homelessness have in accessing their education, Hierman said it also showed how more flexible funding offered an immediate solution to the student’s dilemma.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We do not need our kids who are unstably housed also falling behind in school, because education is a means to something different for them,” Hierman said.
Although much remains uncertain about the ongoing funding for federal programs with the current government shutdown, both the U.S. Senate and House appropriations committees have passed bills that maintain funding for students experiencing homelessness, rejecting the Trump administration’s proposal to do away with dedicated federal funding in favor of consolidating funding for homeless students with 17 other programs in a single K-12 block grant.
While the $128 million in dedicated federal funding for homeless students provided via the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act is a far cry from the pandemic-era funding schools received, the fact that Congress maintained the dedicated funding is an acknowledgement of the challenges those students face, said Barbara Duffield, executive director of SchoolHouse Connection, a national nonprofit advocating for working to overcome homelessness through education.

“I think it shows that across the political spectrum, there is an understanding that without this specific federal program, children and youth who are homeless would not be able to access schools at all. This is the door opener,” Duffield said. “So, it’s broad recognition that homelessness creates unique barriers for very basic school access and school stability, and a desire to keep this in place moving forward.”
Signed into federal law in 1987, the McKinney-Vento Act defines homelessness at the federal level and ensures that schools identify and support eligible students, offering assistance with everything from transportation to school supplies. It also requires that school districts have homeless liaisons who provide referrals to social services for health care, food and housing assistance. 
McKinney-Vento protections ensure that students are able to enroll in school even when they lack records required due to frequent moves. It also allows those students to continue to attend the same school, even when their homelessness forces them to move out of the district.
More than 35,000 Michigan students identified as experiencing homelessness in 2023-24, according to state data. Nearly 70% of students who experienced homelessness in the state were chronically absent, meaning they missed 10% or more of all school days.
State
Impacting outcomes
When federal funding to schools for identifying and serving homeless students increased during the pandemic, a summary of national outcomes showed chronic absenteeism went down and graduation rates went up. The study showed graduation rates improved among homeless students, who also had better outcomes on math and science assessments.
“That’s a pretty important finding there — that if you actually are providing additional support for children we know are at high risk, that you can have an impact on all these different educational outcomes,” said Jennifer Erb Downward, director of Housing Stability Programs and Policy Initiatives with the University of Michigan’s Poverty Solutions Initiative.
The significant influx of $800 million in one-time funding during the pandemic via American Rescue Plan dollars helped increase the number of districts receiving dedicated homeless education funds from 21% to 62%, according to data from UM’s Poverty Solutions and SchoolHouse Connection.
Beyond that, Erb Downward said school districts that previously only received a small amount of funding via McKinney-Vento saw increased dedicated funding, bringing to light more awareness about how widespread and underreported the issue is.
“The first thing that we really saw and heard from people working directly in the schools with families and working with identified students experiencing homelessness, was that funding raised awareness about the issue,” she said. “There are a lot of people who said they didn’t know previously about McKinney-Vento or the protections that students had.”
In Newaygo and Oceana counties, the increase in one-time funding allowed schools more flexibility in how those funds were spent, said Katherine Mater, the McKinney-Vento coordinator for both counties.
That meant families experiencing financial hardships during that time — even temporarily — were eligible to receive funding to stay in a hotel if they had been evicted or had a financial emergency.
“Those COVID-19 dollars had a little more flexibility in allowing us to put them in a hotel for a short period of time and then help get them connected with local resources to help them get out of that and find a long-term solution,” Mater said. “That was a really great benefit that we noticed, and since then, it has been a hardship to kind of revert back and not have that resource.”
A stable place
While federal funding for the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act accounts for less than 1% of the Department of Education’s budget, its impact is immense, Erb Downward said. 
The inherent difficulties that come with housing stability have led to 48% of homeless students being chronically absent, compared to 27% of all other U.S. students, according to data collected by SchoolHouse Connection and Poverty Solutions. 

School often provides a safe haven for those students, Erb Downward said, fulfilling a variety of their basic needs throughout the course of the day.
“I think when you don’t have a stable place to live, school really becomes that stable place where you’re going to see people who care about you,” she said. “You know that you’ll have access to food. You know you’ll have a place to be that is safe.”
In Washtenaw County, as is the case across the state, the most prevalent circumstances students experiencing homelessness face involves “doubling-up,” or a shared living arrangement, accounting for 72.7% of Michigan’s homeless student population, according to state data.
While that is also the most common scenario in Newaygo and Oceana counties, Mater said the county’s rural backdrop means some families are without a home entirely, living in a camper, their car or a tent.
To help those students and their families, Mater said school liaisons look to fill in the gaps of their most practical needs, with popular items including gas cards, hygiene products and some small car repairs. Some school districts in Newaygo County were able to use American Rescue Plan funds to start food and clothing pantries, while the county has partnered with a local laundry mat to help McKinney-Vento families.
Ultimately, the work of liaisons involves removing any barriers to education for students, Mater said.
“If you think about it in a more broad term, it’s really what helps the student be able to get to school, attend school and be successful within their day at school,” she said.

(Photo by Delaney Nolan/TheLens)Tulane University terminated an academic director this summer after the syllabus she’d helped create for an infectious disease class was rejected by a newly hired instructor because it included an academic article about a polio outbreak in Gaza.
Some say that the incident is yet another glimpse of the tense climate experienced on local and national campuses by people who support Palestine.
The situation also raises questions about free speech on the nation’s campuses. “It is important that faculty members and other instructors are able to select and teach pedagogically relevant material in class, even when that material is potentially upsetting or controversial for students,” said Graham Piro, a fellow with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit civil liberties group that defends free speech on college campuses.
In the current climate, some institutions are feeling pressured to violate student and faculty First Amendment rights to avoid federal investigations, Piro said. But FIRE encourages them to withstand those pressures. “We urge departments and universities to stand by scholars when they come under fire for the material they teach, or for their statements outside the classroom on matters of public concern,” he said. “Universities must remember their legal obligations under the First Amendment.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Though at first the matter seemed headed for a mere warning, Tulane ended up terminating Samia Rahman, academic programs director for the university’s pre-college program, on July 28. Along with the termination, Tulane altered the course’s syllabus, removing the article, a Harvard School of Public Health discussion about the resurgence of polio in Gaza.
Earlier this year, in anticipation of this summer’s Tulane’s pre-college courses – short classes taken by high school students during the summer – Rahman, who’d worked for the Pre-College Program for more than a year, had developed the syllabus for the course, “Infectious Disease: Epidemics and Public Health,” in collaboration with at least two faculty members from Tulane’s School of Public Health.
In the class, students examined “the factors leading to outbreaks of disease and the impact that infectious diseases have on our society,” according to Tulane’s online course summary. On the third day of the five-day course, students would learn how armed conflict can contribute to the outbreak of epidemics.
The students were slated to read and discuss the article, “Polio in Gaza: Experts explain the outbreak and the public health response.”
The brief article, comprised of excerpts from a panel discussion about polio vaccination efforts by American, British, and Israeli health and humanitarian experts, was originally published by the Harvard School of Public Health.
To Rahman, 38, the article wasn’t controversial. “For me, there’s an assumption I make that if … you work in medicine or if you work in health,” you’d be interested in an article about stepped-up polio vaccinations in a war zone, she said.
Since the article had also been approved by Tulane public health faculty, Rahman was taken aback when Atara Jaffe, hired as a temporary instructor, refused to teach it, she said.
Harvard academic director Mary Bassett, a contributor to the Harvard public health piece, was also surprised to hear of Jaffe’s discomfort with the article. “I just really don’t understand what would make the person uneasy about it, except that it referenced the situation in Gaza,” Bassett said.
To Bassett, the article seemed relevant to a public health course about epidemics. The situation, she said, is a marked and teachable example of how war leads to epidemics: before 2024, Gaza had not seen a polio case for decades, she said. The disease has grave, lifelong risks such as paralysis, but is also “entirely vaccine-preventable,” she said, noting that polio only reappeared after the conflict began, and primarily threatens unvaccinated infants exposed through contaminated water and sanitary systems damaged by war.
Discomfort with reference to ceasefire
Shortly before Tulane’s pre-college summer programming began, both Jaffe and another instructor who’d been hired to teach the infectious disease course said in a virtual meeting with Rahman and a co-manager that they were uncomfortable leading the in-class discussion for the article about polio in Gaza.
Though Rahman explained they would strictly be addressing public health, not politics, Rahman says Jaffe told her she felt the article was blaming Israel because it referred to the need for a ceasefire. Jaffe and the other instructor asked to instead teach an article about post-COVID mental health on that day of class.
Jaffe declined to speak with The Lens when reached for comment.
It’s unclear why the article’s mention of a ceasefire was objectionable. Even in May and June, as world policymakers squabbled over Israel’s blockade of aid and food intended for Gaza, a ceasefire was discussed as a neutral solution. Many of the world’s leading public health organizations, including Doctors Without Borders, MedGlobal, and the World Health Organization, had called for a ceasefire by the end of last year. Israel’s actions in Gaza have been widely characterized by experts, humanitarian organizations, and a UN inquiry as genocide, though the article did not use that word.
Within the Tulane School of Public Health, Rahman and her colleagues listened to the instructors’ complaint and offered them the choice to assign one of two articles as homework: the article about polio or another about a cholera epidemic in Sudan exacerbated by civil war. Ultimately, the instructors were given the option to assign either article as homework, or lead a discussion.
But in the meantime, Jaffe found two TikToks Rahman had made. After watching videos, she would file an equal opportunity complaint.

Federal pressure on schools
Rahman’s termination comes during a time when many U.S. universities feel under fire, as the Trump administration targets diversity-equity initiatives and programs it characterizes as antisemitic or “race-exclusionary.” Bassett’s employer, Harvard, is said to be in stalled discussions over a $500 million settlement after the Trump administration froze billions in federal funds designated for the university. The Trump administration has also pushed to deport non-citizen students who express support for Palestine.
In March, Tulane was one of 60 schools named by the Trump administration as being under investigation by the Department of Education for alleged antisemitic discrimination. Many institutions are pushing back on what they say is the coercive use of public funds to assert more federal control over universities. In April, a letter opposing the Trump administration’s punitive actions against universities garnered 400 signatures from university and college presidents and educational leaders.
The Trump administration has particularly targeted universities that saw pro-Palestine protests. Last April, a high-profile, pro-Palestine encampment on Tulane’s campus was forcibly dismantled by officers from the New Orleans Police Department and Louisiana State Police in SWAT gear, who arrested 14 protesters. Tulane suspended seven students from the camp.
Rahman’s termination came the month after Tulane dropped its controversial academic charges, from a separate incident, against seven students who participated in an off-campus protest held after ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security detained Palestinian student activist Mahmoud Khalil.
Because Rahman continued to make social media posts about her opposition to Israel’s assault on Gaza throughout Tulane’s investigation, she wonders whether she was terminated because of her political beliefs.
‘Forever chemicals’ found in nearly all Southeast Louisiana drinking water samples

Tulane is still facing a Title VI investigation over allegations of antisemitism, opened in December 2023 with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights after a student filed a complaint following an on-campus protest where someone tried to set fire to an Israeli flag, which then led to a physical altercation. Title VI investigations pursue discrimination complaints based on race, color, or national origin within programs that receive federal assistance.
The following year, in July 2024, an attorney with Most & Associates filed another Title VI complaint against Tulane, this time on behalf of students alleging a pattern of anti-Palestinian discrimination.
The complaint was filed on behalf of Tulane Arabic Club, Tulane Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and four SDS members. It describes multiple cases of alleged discrimination by Tulane faculty: in one incident, a chemistry professor referred to Palestinians as terrorists in front of her class, which included a Palestinian student. The student reported the remarks, but Tulane “refused to investigate it as an incident of anti-Palestinian racism.”
Faculty have also forced students to remove their keffiyeh scarves – cultural symbols of Palestine – and called campus police on an individual wearing a keffiyeh, calling it a “terrorist scarf,” according to the Most & Associates complaint.
Tulane has made no statements and taken no public action to resolve those matters.
In response to queries, Tulane spokesman Michael Strecker provided a statement about anti-discrimination trainings and programming at the university.
“We have mandatory training for employees that is designed to prevent discrimination – including antisemitism and Islamophobia – based on shared ancestry,” Strecker wrote. “We also have related and ongoing educational efforts, partnerships and programming, including our annual Islamophobia Awareness Week and Antisemitism Awareness Week.”
TikToks lead to complaint
Rahman, who holds a master’s in education from Columbia University and has worked in education for over a decade, occasionally posts about current events on social media. This summer, after Jaffe objected to the syllabus, Rahman posted two videos on TikTok, critiquing the objections without naming either instructor.
Rahman acknowledges that the social media posts, which have been viewed by The Lens, showed “a lack of good leadership judgment.”
In one video, she tells viewers: “I don’t know if I should feel sorry for Zionists, if I should feel angry, if I should feel sad, because they are so brainwashed that they cannot look at a neutral article talking about public health concerns and not get triggered that Israel is getting blamed.” She later deleted the videos.
But Jaffe found the videos and opened an equal opportunity case against Rahman, alleging that Rahman “discriminated against and harassed Atara Jaffe based on her religion, national origin and shared ancestry, unreasonably interfering with or limiting participation, and creating a hostile work environment,” per a Tulane Human Resources document. Rahman does not know Jaffe’s religion, but says she had the impression Jaffe was a white American, and that Jaffe later mentioned she was from South Africa. Jaffe has earned degrees in both California and Cape Town, South Africa, and is currently on staff with Tulane’s Psychology Department.
After hearing about the complaint from her supervisor and a human resources representative, Rahman offered to apologize. Jaffe instead chose to pursue the complaint. The other instructor didn’t join the complaint. Rahman later gave a statement to an equal opportunity investigator at Tulane.
Almost two months later, the Tulane Equal Opportunity and Resolution Management office notified Rahman that an investigation had determined that she’d violated the university’s “religion and shared ancestry” discrimination policy but was cleared of the alleged discrimination based on “national origin.”
Tulane terminated Rahman soon afterward.

The polio article was meanwhile dropped from the syllabus. Tulane’s spokesperson did not respond to questions about who made that decision, but Shanna Harper, Tulane’s director of summer programs, informed Rahman by text that given the investigation, “the University has recommended pulling” the article.
Rahman is disturbed by what she sees as academic censorship.
“Removing this material sends a chilling message to students and faculty about whose suffering is acceptable to examine in an academic context and whose is not,” she wrote in an email to Robin Forman, Tulane’s senior vice president for academic affairs and provost.
Tulane’s spokesman did not give details to The Lens about why the university had pulled the article from the syllabus.
Importance of polio article
In fairly antiseptic terms, the Harvard School of Public Health article focuses on how conditions in Gaza created a “perfect storm” for the return of polio, and the logistical difficulties of administering polio vaccines there.
“We had a target of vaccinating 640,000 children, or 90% of all children under 10 in the region,” said Sam Rose, the senior deputy director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) Affairs in Gaza, as he described the planned response to a confirmed case of polio in a 10-month-old, partially paralyzed infant.
“I’ve been on the ground for these campaigns, which took place during agreed-upon pauses in fighting,” Rose said. “However, these pauses did not cover the entire geographical area. In addition, northern Gaza has been cut off since October of last year [2023], making the campaign challenging in that region.”
It’s impossible to talk about the resurgence of the disease without talking about the destruction of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure, including water and sanitation systems, said Bassett, who directs the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard School of Public Health. That widespread damage can swiftly affect public-health outcomes, she said, noting that, before the bombing began, Gaza had “a much higher vaccination coverage rate than we had in New York state.”
Within the article, the word “ceasefire” does appear twice – both in comments made by Israeli health workers.
First, Guy Shalev, the Israeli executive director of Physicians for Human Rights Israel, is quoted as saying, “Even as we continue to hope for a ceasefire, the social determinants of health and infrastructure in Gaza are still issues.”
Later in the piece, Bassett also quotes an Israeli pediatrician, who says that, to stop polio, “the prescription is ceasefire, vaccines, and good public health conditions.”
Bassett, an academic director, was surprised that Rahman’s TikTok posts about the article’s critics led to her termination.
While criticizing Zionism publicly may have been reckless, Bassett said, “I was surprised that you’d lose your job over it.”

Large institutional investors, defined as those owning over 100 homes (which includes private equity firms), own 3 percent of the single-family rental stock nationwide according to Brookings. This share is higher in some local markets — in the 20 Metropolitan Statistical Areas where these investors are most present, they own 12.4 percent — but they still own far less than 20 percent nationwide. The Urban Institute similarly finds they own just 3.8 percent of nationwide single-family rental stock.
Considering purchases rather than holdings, investors (those buying non-primary residences) bought nearly 27 percent of all homes sold in the first quarter of 2025. However, most of these purchases are likely by small investors (those who own less than 5 properties), as they own 85 percent of all investor-owned residential properties. Research by John Burns Research and Consulting found institutional investors are buying less than 2 percent of all homes.

The facility has become a focal point of protest since ICE officials expanded their immigration enforcement in Chicagoland. (Capitol News Illinois photo by Andrew Adams)CHICAGO — After weeks of threatening to do so, President Donald Trump is taking command of 300 Illinois National Guard troops and sending them to Chicago over Gov. JB Pritzker’s objections, the governor announced Saturday.
“This morning, the Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said in a statement. “It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.”
The promised deployment comes as federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, activity has ramped up in Chicago and its suburbs as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has so far resulted in more than 800 arrests according to the Department of Homeland Security.
There have also been two shootings, including one Saturday on the city’s Southwest Side.
Though the Trump administration insists ICE is targeting undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds, reports have mounted of agents arresting those with no history of illegal activity, detaining children along with their parents and even handcuffing U.S. citizens. Immigrant and civil rights groups have alleged ICE is arresting people without warrants in violation of a federal consent decree.
The wave of raids and arrests has spurred large protests in recent weeks, especially outside of an ICE processing center in Broadview, a suburb eight miles west of Chicago. The demonstrations have spurred clashes between immigration agents and activists, leading to the arrests of several protestors last weekend on charges of resisting and assaulting officers. Agents have sprayed chemical agents and fired nonlethal rounds into the crowds outside the facility.

On Monday, Pritzker announced DHS was seeking 100 Illinois National Guard troops to protect ICE facilities and immigration agents in Illinois, warning the Trump administration would use any confrontation resulting from its Chicago-area immigration crackdown as a “pretext” for a military deployment.
On Saturday, the governor called the administration’s National Guard activation a ”manufactured performance” and not about protecting public safety.
“I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,“ Pritzker said, pointing to the Illinois State Police’s announcement this week that it had joined forces with Broadview Police and the Cook County Sheriff’s Office to form a “Unified Command” to coordinate law enforcement activity outside the ICE facility.
One of ISP’s first acts in Broadview was designating demonstration areas, also known as “free speech zones.” Pritzker on Saturday said the combined efforts of state and local law enforcement protected “people’s ability to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights.”
The Unified Command reported the arrests of at least five protesters on Friday, and five more on Saturday night, as of 8 p.m. The area was quiet Saturday afternoon with only about a dozen protesters gathered, at times outnumbered by members of the media.

“I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump’s acts of aggression against our people,” the governor said in his statement.
But shortly before Pritzker’s announcement about the National Guard deployment Saturday, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot a woman in an altercation between immigration agents and protesters on Chicago’s Southwest Side.
According to reporting from the Chicago Sun-Times, the woman was alleged to have been driving one of 10 cars that “rammed” and “boxed in” nearly three dozen immigration agents in the city’s Brighton Park neighborhood. Agents fired “defensive shots” when they saw the woman was allegedly “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” according to the paper. She was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. The woman was one of two people charged by federal prosecutors in the Northern District of Illinois with using their vehicles to “assault, impede, and interfere with the work of federal agents in Chicago.”
Trump and Pritzker have spent weeks trading barbs over the president’s threats to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, with the governor alleging Trump’s apparent backing off from the idea last month was a sign of dementia.
The governor has already vowed legal action against the Trump administration if and when the president activated the National Guard. After the president sent 1,400 National Guard troops to Los Angeles this summer — the first time since the 1960s that the feds deployed the National Guard without a governor’s consent — a federal judge last month ruled the move violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters. But the ruling only applies to California.
The National Guard’s presence in Los Angeles has dwindled to roughly 250, but there are still a couple thousand troops on assignment in Washington, D.C., where the federal government has more power over law enforcement. Since their August deployment to the nation’s capital, guardsmen have been reportedly picking up garbage, as they are only authorized to assist with arrests if asked by local law enforcement.
Trump has also threatened to federalize the National Guard in Portland, Oregon, though troops had not yet been sent as of Saturday evening. Tennessee’s Republican governor has welcomed the president’s recent suggestion that he’d deploy guardsmen to Memphis, but that has also yet to happen.
Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, Washington, D.C. and Shelby County, Tennessee, where Memphis is situated, have all adopted so-called “sanctuary city” policies wherein local law enforcement are barred from assisting in federal immigration enforcement. Trump has targeted cities and states that have adopted such laws, and last week a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled the administration cannot withhold emergency funding from Illinois and other states based on those states’ refusal to participate in immigration enforcement.
But this week, Attorney General Kwame Raoul said he learned of another attempt by the White House to divert disaster relief funding from Illinois with four days remaining in the fiscal year “without any notice or explanation.”
Meanwhile, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem visited Illinois again on Friday. Noem has traveled to the Chicago area and Springfield several times this year, including last month when she oversaw an early morning raid in Elgin, where at least one U.S. citizen was arrested.
“Secretary Noem should no longer be able to step foot inside the State of Illinois without any form of public accountability,” Pritzker said in a statement.
On Friday, Noem appeared with Gregory Bovino, commander-at-large of the U.S. Border Patrol, at the Broadview ICE facility with a camera crew, according to Chicago’s ABC 7.
Late Friday, Pritzker also said he’s making state resources available to people affected by a Sept. 30 raid on a South Shore apartment building.
In Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood, masked federal agents deployed a chemical irritant outside of a grocery store as people and cars lined up to block their advancement, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.
State Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado, D-Chicago, condemned the action, which happened around the corner from an elementary school in her district. Chicago Ald. Jessie Fuentes also alleges she was handcuffed by immigration agents while questioning them at a Humboldt Park medical center.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)After little debate Monday morning but with Democrats voting against, the Utah Legislative Redistricting Committee voted to pick map C — a congressional map that the Utah GOP last week encouraged Republicans to support. 
The map now goes to the full Republican-controlled Legislature to consider during a special session later Monday morning. 
Lawmakers are expected to approve the map and send it to 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson to consider in Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process, after Gibson determined the state’s 2021 congressional map was the product of an unconstitutional process. She ruled the Legislature overstepped when it repealed and replaced a voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that sought to create an independent redistricting process.

Map C would mix rural and urban parts of Utah, split three cities (Millcreek, North Salt Lake and Pleasant Grove) and split three counties (Davis, Salt Lake and Utah). The state’s Democratic stronghold and capital city of Salt Lake City would remain whole, while Salt Lake County (the state’s most populated county) would be split once. 
Monday marked Utah lawmakers’ deadline to vote on and submit a map to the court for consideration. It’s the same deadline for plaintiffs in the state’s redistricting lawsuit that successfully challenged lawmakers’ override of Proposition 4 to submit their own proposed congressional map. 
Under the 2021 congressional map, Salt Lake County was split four times — which led to a lawsuit from nonpartisan groups including the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Salt Lake County voters challenging it as “blatant gerrymandering,” along with claims that lawmakers’ unconstitutionally repealed and replaced Proposition 4. 
Map C would be more competitive for Democrats compared to the 2021 map — but would still result in four congressional districts that would lean in favor of the deep red state’s dominant party, the GOP.
Gibson is expected to ultimately pick a replacement map — either the Legislature’s preferred map or the plaintiffs’ — by her deadline of Nov. 10 in order for it to be put in place in time for the 2026 elections. 
Utah Republican, Democratic party leaders spar over picking preferred congressional map

However, one of the Legislative Redistricting Committee’s co-chairs, Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, told reporters if Gibson rejects map C and picks a map not drawn by lawmakers and instead drawn by plaintiffs, the Legislature will likely fight that decision in court as they continue to appeal Gibson’s earlier ruling before the Utah Supreme Court and potentially the U.S. Supreme Court. 
“To be in compliance, to me, with code and the Constitution, the judge only has one option,” Sandall said, though he added she could “either accept this map or come back to the Legislature and say you failed … and you’ve got to develop a map that takes that into account. To me, it’s the Legislature’s responsibility, constitutionally, to do this.” 
The Legislative Redistricting Committee’s only two Democrats — Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, and Rep. Doug Owens, D-Millcreek — didn’t debate against map C during Monday’s committee hearing and cast their no votes without comment. Owens told Utah News Dispatch after the meeting that Democrats already made their case against the committee’s slate of five proposed maps and in favor of Democrats’ preferred map during two committee hearings last month.

“There was nothing new to say,” Owens said, though he and Escamilla told reporters they don’t believe map C adheres to Proposition 4’s standards because it was drawn using a statistical method that Democrats say unfairly benefits the dominant party, in this case Republicans.
Owens also said if the Republican Party’s preference of map C was taken into account during the legislative committee’s selection process, “that’s improper for the Legislature to take partisan outcome into consideration.”

Owens, however, added there has been “no evidence” that lawmakers were “swayed” by the party’s preference, “but I think it’s telling that the Republican Party itself publicly was pushing for that map because it was clearly the most damaging to Democrats.” 
When asked whether the Republican Party’s support of map C influenced the Legislative Redistricting Committee’s selection, Sandall indicated he wasn’t aware of the party’s preference. 
“Did the Republican party do that? Because quite honestly I’ve been shielded by all of that,” Sandall said. 
The committee’s House co-chair, Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, said it didn’t. 
“I mean, we can’t control what happens in public comment, but I haven’t read that email. I’ve been asked that question over the past couple of days, but no,” she said, adding that while the party is “entitled to sharing their opinion, that didn’t come into consideration at all.”

State lawmakers returned to Raleigh in late September for a brief stay, and in the aftermath of a horrific killing that had occurred just weeks before on a Charlotte commuter train, legislative leaders made criminal justice and their stated intention of “getting tough on crime” the central focus. Among the law changes sent to Gov. Stein for his review were provisions that would make it easier to hold people accused of crimes without bail pending trial and jumpstart the state’s death penalty law.
Despite its rapid approval, not everyone on Jones Street was convinced that the “get tough” approach is the answer, and one of those people was State Rep. Carolyn Logan of Mecklenburg County, who told Newsline that she believes the state needs a more creative and comprehensive approach to making her community safer.

(Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)TEKAMAH, Neb. — Within the farm hills of northern Burt County, overgrown grasses and weeds cover some of the headstones at the Tekamah Rural Seventh Day Adventist Cemetery, in contrast to the fresh flowers and gifts scattered amongst the graves.
The cemetery hasn’t been mowed since May, and it has lasting damage from severe rain and wind storms earlier this summer. Prior to this year, visitors say their local cemetery board had cared for the grounds for decades.
Tekamah Rural Seventh Day Adventist Cemetery. (Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)
Now, the only treatment it’s received in months has come from a few visitors who live nearby, neighbors who have been pleading with their local cemetery board to take care of it.
A group of these residents contend that the Tekamah Cemetery District has been favoring the region’s main cemetery — Tekamah Cemetery — at the expense of three rural cemeteries also within the district. After months of lodging complaints and no progress, they may have found a solution in the idea of creating a new rural cemetery board.
The dispute began early this summer, when Victor Jensen and several other members of the area’s Seventh Day Adventist Church noticed their cemetery wasn’t being cared for anymore. Prior to this year, Jensen said he believed the district had ensured the cemetery was mowed a minimum of three times per year, mostly during warmer months.
This led him and others to take notice of other rural cemeteries lagging in care. Most were not being regularly mowed, and at Arizona Community Cemetery in western Burt County, Jensen said maintenance workers tore out some of the cemetery fencing and left it in a pile on the grounds.
At its latest meeting Sept. 18, board members clarified that crews got around to mowing Arizona Cemetery the week before the meeting, but did not specify when the other cemeteries had last been mowed. Tekamah Cemetery District Clerk John Chamberlain said the board would not comment further until its next meeting Oct. 8.
In comparison to the others, Tekamah Cemetery is pristine. Geographically larger than the others, the cemetery covers a hillside overlooking a fountain and a neighborhood of nice homes, with an even layer of grass all the way through.

“When you see the scale of it, it’s so one-sided,” said another church member Lisa Anderson.
When residents questioned the Tekamah Cemetery District about this, Jensen said board members offered several defenses. Jensen said the frequent rainfall this year had proved challenging, for example.
At the meeting, board member Ron Tobin said the reason why the church’s cemetery hadn’t been cared for is because the board decided earlier this year that they couldn’t because the land is privately owned by the church. It was unclear at the meeting whether the decision was made independently or with input from others.
Meeting attendees pushed back on the argument, countering that while the ground is private, the cemetery itself is public. Anderson said many of the church cemetery’s visitors pay taxes into the district to care for all cemeteries in the region and don’t realize that their money isn’t helping their cemetery anymore.
At the Sept. 18 meeting, the board voted on its annual budget covering the care for all cemeteries, approving just over $154,000 in general fund spending through the year, with a cash reserve of roughly $296,000. This is by far the largest budget of five cemetery districts in Burt County. The others list general fund spending ranging from $10,000 to $31,000 for fiscal year 2024-25.
This difference left some meeting attendees suspicious, especially because the district’s budgets aren’t itemized, so there’s no way to know how the funds are being spent.
“I would just like to see (work being) done at the level that Tekamah is,” said one attendee Greg Brummond. “There’s gotta be some carryover with $150,000. It can’t cost that much to do that.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
One of the three workers who maintains the cemeteries was present at the meeting and said mowing is a lot more time-consuming and expensive than attendees think. The last time Arizona Community Cemetery was mowed, he said it took four hours to finish, and it costs about $50 per hour to mow.
Anderson came to the meeting with her own research that painted a different picture. She estimated maintaining the three rural cemeteries in the district — including mowing, grave repairs, trash disposal and other treatment — would altogether cost about $16,000 per year.

Based on these estimates, Anderson and others proposed the idea of forming a new cemetery board within the district to care for the three rural cemeteries. The new board would syphon off a portion of the funding allocated to the original Tekamah Cemetery District.
Though some board members had reservations about the idea being proposed so suddenly, they ultimately voted unanimously to approve the $154,000 budget with a stipulation that up to $16,170 of those funds could be allocated to the rural board. This is contingent on Anderson and others properly establishing the new board.
“I guess we’re going to find out how much it actually costs,” Anderson said.
How the new board would work is still a bit murky — multiple board members called it “a head-scratcher” at the meeting. But the process is already underway, as Anderson said they’ve already figured out who will serve.
Anderson said the rural board will have five members, one representing each of the four townships within the district, plus Jensen, who will serve at-large. Anderson herself will not be a board member, but she will assist with operations, she said.

Anderson is now in the process of filing the paperwork to establish the board, she said. It’s uncertain yet when the new board’s first meeting would be, as Anderson said cemetery board work typically slows during colder months, but she said this unique situation might require more meetings ahead of next spring.
Jensen said the outcome of the Sept. 18 meeting was better than he expected, after months of no movement from the board. He said their group first reached out to the State Auditor’s Office for help, but were turned away. Had the idea for the rural board not worked, he said their next step was likely suing in district court.
“I just want it to be fair,” Anderson said.

The North Carolina General Assembly was back in Raleigh in late September to enact legislation that leaders say will quote “get tough on crime” by limiting access to bail and pre-trial release for more criminal defendants and jump-starting the state’s long un-used death penalty.
Shortly after lawmakers departed the capital, Newsline caught up with an attorney who has studied this kind of legislation and its impact on crime in several states — the Chief Counsel of the Justice System Reform team at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, Jake Sussman. And sadly, Sussman says there’s no evidence that lawmakers’ “get tough” approach will make a meaningful difference. To do that, he says, lawmakers will finally need to muster the courage to engage with complex and expensive policy solutions like fixing the state’s desperately underfunded mental health system.

This story was originally reported by Kate Sosin of The 19th News.
Five years ago, the United Nations concluded that conversion therapy could amount to torture and recommended it be banned. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will consider a case that could greenlight it for LGBTQ+ youth across the nation.
It is the first of three blockbuster LGBTQ+ cases on its docket this term, as the court’s October-to-October annual cycle is known. Chiles v. Salazar, brought by Christian counselor Kaley Chiles, seeks to overturn Colorado’s ban on conversion therapy, a pseudoscientific practice in which providers attempt to change a youth’s sexual orientation or gender identity, often through extremely harsh methods.
Conversation therapy is condemned by every major medical association in the country, including the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Medical Association.

It has historically involved acts of physical, psychological and sexual abuse against minors — electric shock, masturbation reconditioning, starvation, chemically induced nausea and hypnosis, among others.
Nearly 700,000 adults are survivors of conversion therapy, according to the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law, which submitted an amicus brief encouraging the court to find Colorado ban on the practice constitutional.
In a statement, Ilan Meyer, distinguished senior scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute, said that research shows conversion therapy “is ineffective at changing a person’s sexual orientation and gender identity and is associated with significant harm, which is why major professional organizations have overwhelmingly rejected the practice.”
Twenty-three states and Washington, D.C., have conversion therapy bans on the books. An additional four states and Puerto Rico have made efforts to limit the practice. The majority of those laws still allow therapists to discuss sexual orientation and gender identity with youth, but practitioners are not allowed to promise that they can help kids change their gender identity or sexual orientation — nor are they allowed to pressure them into doing so.
Tuesday’s hearing could change all of that. While the case focuses on Colorado’s ban, which was enacted in 2019, its outcome could have major implications for conversion therapy bans across the country.
Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the country’s largest LGBTQ+ rights organization, said in a statement that while the organization urges the court to affirm the constitutionality of Colorado’s ban, the expectations are low given the court’s conservative majority.

“In recent years, we have seen decisions out of our highest court that have rolled back our rights and cleared a pathway for discriminatory legislation that targets LGBTQ+ people and other marginalized communities,” Robinson said. “From access to critical health care to inclusivity in our schools, this shift is nothing short of alarming — and now the safety of our children is once again up for debate.” 
The case comes down, in part, to an argument over free speech. Chiles argues that her right to practice conversion therapy is protected under the First Amendment. The Trump administration has weighed in to support Chiles, along with 19 state attorneys general.
But opponents argue that conversion therapy should be classified as conduct,not speech. Federal appellate courts in the Ninth and Tenth Circuits ruled that Chiles’ practice amounted to conduct, while the Eleventh Circuit concluded it was protected speech. The Supreme Court will make the final call.
The Supreme Court will hear two other major LGBTQ+ cases this fall — BPJ v. West Virginia and Hecox v. Little. Both involve challenges to statewide bans, in Virginia and Idaho, respectively, on transgender participation in sports.
The court is expected to issue its opinion on the cases in the spring or summer.

North Carolina is now into the second year of Hurricane Helene recovery and as we discussed in a special edition of News & Views last week, while there have been many encouraging and inspiring aspects to this story, the hard truth is that we have a very long way to go. And as Newsline learned recently in a conversation with policy analyst Alex Campbell of the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center, the main reason for the slow pace of the recovery is funding – or more precisely, the lack of it from both the federal and state governments. Indeed, Campbell believes unless elected officials do something soon to inject billions of additional dollars, western North Carolina is in for many more tough years.

(Photo: Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg)Jack Daniel’s is terminating a decades-long program that provided the company’s corn byproduct “slop” to local cattle farmers at low or no cost, allowing the farmers to inexpensively feed their cattle.
The “Cow Feeder Program” will end on March 31 as the company transitions to a new partnership with Ohio-based Three Rivers Energy, which will instead convert the waste into renewable fuel and fertilizer.
The change has left farmers in and around Moore County reeling, searching for ways they might continue to earn a living through raising cattle. 
Livestock makes up 89% of Moore County’s farm earnings, according to the most recent U.S. Census of Agriculture.
Danny Anderson, a 56-year-old cattle farmer, said his family has fed their animals the byproduct from Jack Daniel’s for decades. The so-called “slop” is primarily water mixed with leftover distillers’ grain.
“I can remember when I was probably eight or nine years old, going with my grandfather to get it … back then we hauled it in old milk cans,” Anderson said.
When Anderson took over the operation of the 207-acre farm, he used a 1,000-gallon tank to retrieve the feed. He eventually upsized to a truck with a 4,000-gallon tank, paying less than $9 for each load.
He partnered with another Middle Tennessee cattleman, bulking up around 300 to 500 of his business partner’s cows while separately building his own herd of 130 cows. They all ate slop, supplemented with hay, salt and minerals. 
“You’re talking about feeding 200, 250 head of cattle on $8 a day. There’s nothing else out there that compares,” Anderson said.
But Anderson will not be able to feed cows for his business partner after the program ends next year. The cost just won’t be feasible for either of them, he said.
He had been hauling about 185,000 gallons of slop each month. Starting in October, the company will reduce his allotment to 144,000 gallons. In January, it will shrink to 43,200 gallons before cutting off entirely at the end of March.










I think Jack Daniel’s here in little old Lynchburg is getting a bad rep for it, because the people that run Jack Daniel’s here had to come out and tell the farmers, ‘Hey, look, this is over.


– Danny Anderson, Moore County farmer


Anderson has already sold 50 head of his own cattle, and plans to keep a herd of 50 cows and try to feed them on a mix of grass, hay, and occasional feed mix during winter months. Moore County’s rough hillside land isn’t much good for anything but cattle farming, he said. 
“That slop made it to where you could take a piece of land that wasn’t very valuable, and you could feed that slop, and you could make money doing it,” Anderson said.
Jack Daniel’s new partnership with Three Rivers Energy contractually requires the distiller to deliver between 350,000 and 500,000 gallons of spent distiller’s grain each day — the company’s entire current volume. 
“This decision follows years of careful consideration and was communicated with advance notice, starting with our initial announcement back in March 2022,” a Jack Daniel’s representative stated in an email to Tennessee Lookout. The partnership with Three Rivers Energy “allows us to achieve key environmental standards and secure the future of our brand, ensuring our continued ability to market and sell Jack Daniel’s globally.”
“We understand this change is significant, and we remain dedicated to our neighbors as we all adapt to this new era,” the representative stated.
Anderson adds that the decision to stop the program was made by Brown-Forman, Jack Daniel’s corporate owner. 
“I think Jack Daniel’s here in little old Lynchburg is getting a bad rep for it, because the people that run Jack Daniel’s here had to come out and tell the farmers, ‘Hey, look, this is over,’” Anderson said.
What happens now?
The University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture held a meeting last week to discuss potential paths forward for farmers who had relied on the “slop” as their primary feed source. 
UTIA Livestock Marketing Specialist Andrew Griffith said while not all of the cattle in the Moore County area are eating slop, “the biggest percentage of them are.”
In the short term, Griffith said feed produced by a feed company is probably going to be the best bet for farmers, “mainly to be able to determine if it’s worthwhile for them to keep feeding cattle.”
“This way they won’t have some large investment … for infrastructure change,” he said.
Farmers can also continue to feed hay, and some may create their own feed blends of commodity crops like corn or soybean meal. 
The economic viability of cattle farming is measured in the “cost of gain,” or the cost of feed for each pound of weight gained by the animal, Griffith said. It’s not simple to determine how much more it might cost a cattle farmer to feed their animals with purchased feed versus the slop, because the costs of retrieving the slop includes time, gas, equipment and other variables. Griffith, however, said it’s likely going to be more costly for farmers to feed alternative rations instead of the byproduct that was largely free to them.
Griffith said the change shows how important flexibility is in the agriculture business.
“Things can change, and if we’re not flexible or adaptable, that’s when we get left behind and lose out,” he said. “And certainly, in this case, there are going to be some people that don’t want to adapt, and maybe rightfully so. Maybe it’s best for them to not raise cattle anymore. But at the same time, if it’s your only business and you want to stay in it, you do have to have some flexibility and adaptability to stay in the business.”
Ripple effects and national context
Anderson said he expects the end of the program to have a “trickle-down effect on everything.”
Local livestock sale barns may struggle from less business when herds like his shrink, he said. He’s looking at cutting some of his insurance policies on hay barns, tractors and the feed trucks that will now sit idle. And he won’t be spending as much on fuel once the slop dries up; he currently puts about $400 in his big feed trucks every 21 days.
And while the demand for beef is strong, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported a 1% drop in cattle and calves on feed for the U.S. slaughter market in September. 
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in September that the USDA is working on a plan to bolster the country’s beef herd, which is at its lowest inventory since 1951. But those plans focus on risk-mitigation tools and opening more working lands, and will not include payments to beef producers.
Griffith said while inventory is low, farmers today produce more beef per cow than they did even a decade ago. 
“We have larger carcasses, larger frames, so we don’t need as many, but we do have a low cattle inventory relative to consumer demand for beef, and that’s why prices are so high,” he said.

“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Matt Meyer said. “This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts.”
WILMINGTON, Del. (Oct. 6, 2025) — Energy policy took center stage early Monday as Dave Stevenson, director of the Caesar Rodney Institute’s Energy Policy Center, joined A Better Delaware Chair M. Jane Brady for the latest installment of a weekly  public webcast, “A Better Discussion.”  At the 8 a.m. session, Stevenson urged Delaware lawmakers to embrace small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) and roll back state carbon-pricing mandates, which he says have driven up electricity costs and risked grid reliability heading into winter.
But while Stevenson and Brady see nuclear energy as part of Delaware’s long-term solution, Governor Matt Meyer and environmental advocates are taking a more cautious — or opposing — stance.
In announcing the creation of Delaware’s Nuclear Energy Feasibility Task Force in September, Meyer said the effort is about exploring all possible options to address rising costs.

“Delaware families and businesses are facing rising energy costs,” Meyer said. “We owe it to them to explore every possible solution to provide reliable, affordable, and clean energy.”

He added that nuclear deserves review, but not without scrutiny.

“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Meyer said. “This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts before any decisions are made.”

Not all advocates agree the study is worthwhile. In its 2025 Legislative Recap, published in July, the Delaware Chapter of the Sierra Club reaffirmed its opposition to nuclear power as part of the state’s future energy mix.
The group instead urged lawmakers to:


Prioritize renewables such as solar and wind paired with battery storage;


Invest in energy efficiency and demand reduction, the most cost-effective strategies;


Avoid “costly, slow, and risky” nuclear projects that could leave waste and safety burdens; and


Focus on regional grid improvements and renewable integration rather than new nuclear feasibility studies.


The Sierra Club summarized its position by saying that while Governor Meyer believes nuclear “deserves careful study,” the organization sees it as “a distraction from cleaner, faster, and safer solutions.”
Stevenson’s Case for Nuclear
Stevenson said Delaware’s decarbonization mandates — not PJM’s market design — are “the root of reliability and cost problems.” He warned that “we could be looking at a blackout this winter” and claimed the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) adds “about 2 cents per kilowatt-hour for coal and 1 cent for natural gas,” making local generation uncompetitive.
He said Delaware now imports roughly 60 percent of its electricity.
Brady noted that the General Assembly’s new task force will consider small modular nuclear reactors as one potential future energy source. Stevenson said three units could supply Delaware’s entire power needs — “two at the Indian River site and one at Edgemoor.”
“These modern reactors are smaller, safer, and can operate with almost no evacuation zone beyond the plant fence line,” Stevenson said.
Cost, Jobs, and Timeline
Stevenson compared energy costs at about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour for natural gas, 8 cents and falling for nuclear, and 18 to 20 cents for offshore wind, noting that offshore wind “runs a little over a third of the time” and has a lifespan of about 20 years compared with 80 for nuclear.
He said federal tax incentives and grants could make Delaware an early mover.“With acreage and transmission already at Indian River, you could colocate a data center and use the power on-site,” he said.
Citing University of Tennessee research on a similar project near Oak Ridge, Stevenson said Delaware could generate $3.5 billion in economic impact and 1,800 direct jobs by constructing three SMRs.

Recycling Nuclear Fuel
Stevenson also discussed advances in reprocessing, saying that 95 percent of spent nuclear fuel can now be recycled, turning a waste challenge into a potential $40 billion-per-year national industry.
He said draft federal legislation could allow states to bid for temporary storage and recycling facilities, potentially creating high-wage jobs tied to the next generation of nuclear technology.
Policy Path Forward
Both Brady and Stevenson agreed Delaware should avoid repeating past decisions to close plants before replacements were ready.“If we act quickly, we could become a net exporter of energy,” Brady said. “Stable, low-cost power could attract businesses and data centers to Delaware.”
Stevenson added that combining SMRs with ending the state’s carbon tax “would restore reliability, lower rates, and position Delaware for growth.”

What Is a Small Modular Reactor?
Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are compact nuclear plants built in factories and shipped for installation. Their design allows for passive safety systems, shorter build times, and smaller sites — often on the grounds of retired fossil-fuel plants that already have grid connections.
Supporters say SMRs offer 24/7 carbon-free energy to balance intermittent wind and solar. Opponents point to high upfront costs, long permitting times, and uncertainties over long-term waste storage.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/transmission-electric-lines.jpg,,,2025-10-06 10:58:49.957631

The nation’s highest court is considering three redistricting cases, including a Mississippi case, that could significantly alter the Voting Rights Act, a federal law stemming from the Civil Rights era that Black Mississippians have used for decades to prevent discrimination at the ballot box.
Attorney General Lynn Fitch last month appealed a ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Sharion Aycock of Mississippi. The ruling concluded that state lawmakers must redraw the state Supreme Court districts because they weaken Black voting strength. 
That ruling, which forbids the state from using those maps in future Mississippi Supreme Court elections, is pending before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the appellate court has paused all proceedings in the appeal until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on its redistricting cases.
The litigation over the Mississippi Supreme Court includes a group of Black voters and candidates who in 2022 sued state officials, alleging that Black candidates face unfair difficulties getting elected to the state’s high court.
However, while the U.S. Supreme Court considers other cases that could impact the Mississippi Supreme Court cases, Aycock’s lower court in the meantime can proceed with determining how and when lawmakers will need to change the state districts.
One of those three cases the nation’s highest court is considering is another Mississippi case involving state legislative districts. 
A federal three-judge panel last year ordered lawmakers to redraw their districts in three areas of the state to give Black voters a fairer shot at electing candidates of their choice. Special elections for these races are currently underway, with the general election scheduled for November. 
Fitch’s office also appealed this ruling and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to sharply curtail the federal Voting Rights Act by declaring private voters cannot sue to prevent discrimination at the ballot box. 
If the U.S. Supreme Court rules in Mississippi’s favor, it would mean only the Department of Justice could sue to enforce the Voting Rights Act. 
In both of the Mississippi redistricting lawsuits, private citizens — not the federal government — filed the lawsuit. So if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in Mississippi’s favor, it could prevent individual voters from filing future redistricting cases. 
Another case pending before the U.S. Supreme Court that could limit redistricting cases is Louisiana v. Callais, a suit over Louisiana’s congressional districts. The central question in the case is whether factoring race into the drawing of congressional districts violates the U.S. Constitution.
The U.S. Supreme Court will hold an oral argument in the Callais case on Oct. 15.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06101021/HB-1020-appeal1.jpg,,,2025-10-06 10:58:49.957631

The state is appealing a federal judge’s September order. The order prohibits the state from enforcing a new law that moves the election-year filing deadline for ballot-question petitions from May to February. That would shrink the circulation window by three months and, according to the judge, violate petitioners’ First Amendment rights. 
The law enforcing the earlier deadline started as legislation last winter from state House Speaker Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids, who is one of several Republican candidates for governor next year.
The filing deadline dictates the amount of time petitioners have for gathering signatures to put a question on the statewide ballot. Petitioners need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to propose a law, which is known as an initiative, and the same number of signatures to put a bill passed by legislators on hold for consideration by voters, which is known as a referendum. The number of signatures required to propose a state constitutional amendment is 35,017.
Dakotans for Health, which has worked on numerous ballot-question campaigns, is represented in its lawsuit by attorney Jim Leach, of Rapid City. The state is represented by Assistant Attorney General Grant Flynn.
The litigation is part of a broader struggle over citizen lawmaking. Numerous Republican legislative efforts to restrict ballot questions in recent years have come in response to voter approval of measures that raised the minimum wage, expanded Medicaid eligibility and legalized medical marijuana, among others.

Jared Golden in the June 9, 2026 primary. (Photo courtesy of campaign)Maine State Auditor Matt Dunlap on Monday officially announced his run as a Democrat for Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, which will bring him head to head with incumbent U.S. Rep. Jared Golden in a primary next June.
Dunlap said he’s running because he has a passion for helping people and heard from 2nd District residents that “we can do a lot better than what we’re doing.” 
Had Dunlap been in Congress the past few weeks, he told Maine Morning Star he would have joined Democrats in rejecting a Republican stopgap spending proposal that after repeated votes  failed to secure enough votes in the Senate, leading to the current government shutdown. 
The debate largely hinges on health care tax credits that most Republicans would like to see end, while Democrats have sought to extend them to prevent skyrocketing health care costs for thousands of Mainers and millions of Americans. 
Golden, a Democrat who often breaks with his party on votes, was the sole House Democrat to back Republican’s short term spending deal. Dunlap has criticized Golden for shirking his party in his votes on a variety of issues and not being willing to stand up for Mainers against President Donald Trump on issues such as health care. 
“This is something that’s a matter of real survival for folks,” Dunlap said, adding that the health care discussion is “a fight worth picking.”
However, Golden said after his vote that he opposed cuts to Medicaid and would like to see certain health care tax credits extended, but the shutdown hurts Americans, the economy and “the irony is it has only handed more power to the president.”
Dunlap also said former Gov. Paul LePage, the likely Republican nominee for the 2nd District, would make matters even worse by going along with cuts to Medicaid as well as Trump’s tariff policies, aspects of which Golden has also supported. 
A resident of Old Town, Dunlap is currently the Maine State Auditor and previously served as Secretary of State for seven years. While he knows he will have to focus on winning support from Democratic voters in his primary run against Golden, he said his message that “we can do better” is meant for everyone. 
Golden is in his fourth term representing District 2, a rural district that comprises the geographic majority of the state north of Augusta. Second District voters have routinely split tickets, reelecting Golden while going for Trump each time he’s run for president. 
In addition to health care costs, Dunlap underscored the importance of election integrity and preserving democracy. He said it’s a topic he knows well from his work as Secretary of State handling Maine’s elections, which he described as some of the strongest in the country. 
Dunlap made a national name for himself during Trump’s first term when serving on the president’s voter fraud commission. 
Dunlap refused to hand over sensitive Maine voter information that the commission requested (which current Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows cited when defending her decision to do the same). He also won a lawsuit against the group after its Republican leadership intentionally excluded him from deliberations. And, after it was disbanded, Dunlap publicly accused the commission of being set up to validate Trump’s voter fraud claims.

Hidden beneath these remote valleys lies one of the world’s largest known graphite deposits. Over millions of years, carbon deep within the earth was subjected to immense heat and pressure, forming crystalline sheets black and soft as pencil lead. Canadian company Graphite One plans to mine the valuable material for batteries and strategic minerals — despite many residents’ objections, and so far, without the federally required tribal consultation with the nearby communities of Teller, Brevig Mission, and Mary’s Igloo.
The area slated for development drains into Imuruk Basin, an estuary fed by four rivers that create one of the continent’s most biodiverse ecosystems. This vital hunting and fishing area is essential to residents’ food security and the traditions that tie them to the land. As Lucy Oquilluk, president of Mary’s Igloo Traditional Council, told the federal government, sidelining her community denied it “the opportunity to have our voice heard on issues that directly impact our communities and ways of life.”
After President Trump invoked emergency powers to produce critical minerals this spring, the federal government fast-tracked the mine’s permitting. Three of the four local tribes have vehemently opposed the project, and say the public review process has been short-changed. (The fourth, Nome Eskimo Community, has not joined the opposition, and did not respond to an interview request.)
In June, Graphite One became the first Alaskan mine — and among the first in the country — to qualify for FAST-41, a process that expedites federal approval of critical infrastructure. This hastens environmental reviews to as little as 30 days. The complex choreography of federal permits — spanning the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Fish and Wildlife Service — is now moving with unprecedented speed.
The company, which did not respond to requests for comment, envisions carving a sprawling operation into the Kigluaik: To access the remote site, it will need to use 30 miles of public road and lay 17 miles of new road, cutting across salmon streams and archaeological sites. It plans to truck the ore year-round over public roads to a temporary holding facility in Nome until a deep-water port can be built. From there, the material will make its way to Ohio, where the company plans to build a processing facility on a brownfield once used by the Department of Defense.
Graphite supply is vital to both the battery industry and national defense, and China dominates the global market. Company CEO Anthony Huston said the site “is the perfect home for the second link in our strategy to build a 100-percent U.S.-based advanced graphite supply chain.” Yet the company plans to rely on a Chinese manufacturer, Hunan Chenyu Fuji New Energy Technology Co., for design, construction, and operations — underscoring how even “domestic” supply chains remain tied to global networks and exposed to geopolitical risks.
On the strength of its promises to reduce reliance on overseas sources, the venture has received significant subsidies. In 2019, Republican Governor Mike Dunleavy nominated it as a high-priority infrastructure project, streamlining permitting. Four years later, Graphite One secured pivotal support from the U.S. Department of Defense. With funds from the Inflation Reduction Act, the company received a $37.5 million grant to expedite its feasibility study. Framed as a national security measure under the Defense Production Act, the funding aimed to develop domestic supplies of critical minerals. The resulting analysis estimated the mine could generate $43 billion in revenue for the Canadian company. In 2023, Graphite One received an additional $4.7 million from the Defense Department to develop a foam fire suppressant. Earlier this month, the company received $570 million from the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the official credit agency of the federal government.
This kind of governmental support has helped fuel a surge in mining across Alaska, where state officials are encouraging rapid development. Dunleavy recently decreed that if a state agency misses a permitting deadline, the project gains automatic approval — raising concerns of a regulatory free-for-all. Earlier this month, for example, the state approved a United States Antimony Corporation operation near Fairbanks, just three months after the company acquired the mine, saying it met permitting exemptions under state law.
In Graphite One’s case, fast-tracking has pushed tribal input to the margins. In September 2023, the tribal governments of three Inupiaq communities sent letters to the U.S. Department of Defense, protesting the fact they had not been consulted as legally required before the agency funded the project’s feasibility study. It did not respond until the White House intervened. “After the fact doesn’t count,” said Austin Ahmasuk, a Nome Eskimo Community tribal member.
During a Zoom meeting more than a year later, the department finally acknowledged the oversight, but the tribes report they never received the promised meeting notes or any follow up. The feasibility study the company produced with that federal funding explicitly tries to exclude tribes as “cooperating agencies,” limiting their ability to influence project planning and environmental assessments. (The U.S. Army Corps told Grist this was incorrect, and that relevant tribal entities have been invited into the FAST-41 process.) All of this “violates free, prior, and informed consent,” Ahmasuk said, referring to a requirement under the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, or UNDRIP, that tribes be consulted and involved in any decisions affecting their lands.
A similar pattern is emerging with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It initially estimated an environmental review would take over two years, but after a 2023 Supreme Court decision narrowed the definition of “waters of the United States,” the agency reduced the review’s scope, despite the company’s plans to expand the size of the mine, and accelerated its timeline. Tribes have insisted on the required consultation before this permit is issued, and while the Corps has agreed in principle, Graphite One submitted an application in August, while a meeting has not yet been confirmed. These expedited reviews, said Hal Shepherd, a consultant who works with tribes on water policy, turn consultation from a meaningful process into a bureaucratic checkbox. “Even if consultation does take place, the tribes are in an uphill battle to have any meaningful input for this project,” Shepherd said.
Such consultation is more than a courtesy — it is a legal and ethical requirement. Multiple federal laws and statutes require agencies to engage with tribes on projects that affect their lands. Yet across the country, critical mineral projects are pressing ahead with minimal input from the Indigenous peoples whose lands and resources they affect. In Nevada, the Thacker Pass lithium mine moved forward in February without free, prior, and informed consent. In Minnesota, tribes report being sidelined as the Department of Defense funds mineral projects, while in Arizona, a transfer of federal lands to a copper mining company was just greenlit despite a lawsuit from the Apache Stronghold.
Canada also has moved to require meaningful Indigenous consultation. Although Canadian regulations generally don’t extend to operations abroad, British Columbia, where Graphite One is based, became the first jurisdiction in Canada to enshrine Indigenous rights under UNDRIP in 2019. In 2021, Canada’s Parliament followed, requiring federal laws to align with the U.N. declaration.
Amid these broader Indigenous rights debates, Alaska Native communities are voicing their concerns: Tribal leaders from around the Kigluaik Mountains gathered September 20 to oppose Graphite One. They discussed its “irreversible damage,” the potential violence against women that often accompanies the arrival of a large workforce in remote locations, and the generational impacts to the landscape. Tribal leaders also brought up the Trump administration’s executive order eliminating federal diversity and anti-discrimination policies, which they worry will undermine potential job opportunities at the mine for community members.
Although some Nome residents support the mine for its potential economic benefits, others are upset that the Bering Straits Native Corporation, a regional for-profit entity where many tribal members are enrolled as shareholders, invested $2 million in the project without a shareholder vote. “The tribe has the treaty responsibility and the right to government-to-government consultation,” said Nome Eskimo Community tribal member Addy Ahmasuk, who is Austin’s daughter. “But the corporation has taken up a lot of power as the owner of the subsurface rights.” When corporate interests exploit divisions within Native communities, she said, sovereignty debates can turn into conflicts over profit rather than a community’s well-being.
These divisions are compounded by accelerated reviews, which Austin Ahmasuk worries means environmental risks will be overlooked. “Even now, at the exploration stage, there’s a very noticeable change in the landscape,” he said, including the construction of roads, which he said will likely damage cultural sites. “You simply cannot avoid the archeological history. You essentially stumble across it everywhere,” he said.
On a recent afternoon, he tried to imagine what his hometown would look like once the mine was built. The company plans to build a facility almost as large as the town itself to store its ore. The public road the trucks would rumble down crosses numerous salmon streams, where families go to put away fish for the winter. “This mine needs so much infrastructure,” he said. “That’s a significant change to the community.” New sections of road risk disturbing wildlife habitat and may prevent access to hunting grounds and fishing sites generations have depended on. Without these lands, he said, families risk losing their main sources of food. Oversight of the mine, he added, will fall largely on the community “to even understand potential violations,” noting that state and federal regulators are rarely present in the region, and in his experience, provide only minimal monitoring. “People who really care about this area, we feel sort of hopeless,” he said.
Addy Ahmasuk, meanwhile, fears the toxic tailing ponds mining creates will pollute Imuruk Basin, which sustains the surrounding communities. Graphite One plans to mill and burn the ore to concentrate it prior to shipping, releasing graphite into the wind near a lagoon many families depend on for potable water, especially communities like Teller that lack running water. “Graphite dust makes water undrinkable,” she said. The ground naturally contains sulfides that, when disturbed by mining, will create a significant risk of acid drainage that will require long-term management. “Pretty much every mine that’s mining in sulfide material has some sort of water quality impact,” said Dave Chambers, founder of The Center for Science in Public Participation. The nonprofit provides technical support on mining and has been following the project closely.
He notes faster permitting has historically led to mining projects that go awry, pointing to the Rock Creek Mine, an open-pit gold mine near Nome that benefited from accelerated oversight. “Not only did the mine not even open because their engineering was so sloppy, but they killed a couple people,” Chambers said. “That’s a really good example of what happens when you try to grease the skids and get a project through as fast as possible.”
For Addy Ahmasuk, the lesson isn’t just to slow down, it’s to rethink what activism can look like. This land is central to her tribe’s creation myths. She’s launched a grassroots organization, Sacred Kigluait, aimed at restoring and sharing the stories that colonization and boarding schools sought to erase. In doing so, she hopes to protect more than just the land under threat from Graphite One — she’s fighting for the living traditions rooted in it. “The center point isn’t stopping a mine,” she said. “The center point is coming together to remember our creation stories and start telling them again.”

(Campaign photo)Former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath has launched a campaign for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat, her second U.S. Senate bid after losing to longtime Republican incumbent Sen. Mitch McConnell in 2020. 
McGrath in a social media post Monday morning featured a video of her walking up to a lone chair while saying, “This isn’t just a chair. It’s an open seat.” McConnell, 83, the Senate’s longest-ever party leader, set off what promises to be a fierce fight for his seat when he announced in February that he would not seek an eighth term.

McGrath is joining three Democrats already vying for the open U.S. Senate seat.
McGrath wrote in her social media post that “democracy was under siege” and “cowards in Washington are bowing to Donald Trump.” 
“Kentuckians deserve someone battle-tested and ready to fight for them on day one. I’ve spent my life stepping up when the mission was tough and the stakes were high, first as a Marine and now for Kentucky. I’m ready to complete the mission,” McGrath wrote in her post launching the campaign. 
McGrath said in her video that Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat “will decide the balance of power in the Senate.” 
The veteran fighter pilot spent more than $90 million as the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate challenging McConnell in 2020, losing by over 400,000 votes. She previously ran for Congress in 2018 to represent Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District covering Central Kentucky, losing to Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr by 3 percentage points in a significantly closer election. 
Barr is now among the candidates in the Republican primary also seeking the U.S. Senate seat, along with former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and Lexington businessman Nate Morris.
In response to a Lexington Herald-Leader article published last month reporting that McGrath was considering launching a campaign, Barr wrote in a post on X: “Bring it on, Amy. This will be fun. I beat you once, and I’ll beat you again.”
Other Democrats who have announced for the Senate seat are former Secret Service agent Logan Forsythe, former CIA officer Joel Willett and Kentucky House Democratic Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/am_25-2-1024x683-1.jpeg.webp,,,2025-10-06 09:56:13.990205

Evergy and the Kansas Department of Commerce are exploring the idea of building a Natrium plant in Kansas. (TerraPower)TOPEKA — Increasing energy demands and the need to stabilize aging infrastructure are pushing countries around the world to consider building the next-generation of nuclear power plants, which many are calling a nuclear renaissance.
Kansas may join the revival. The Kansas Department of Commerce and the state’s largest electric company recently announced a memorandum of understanding with TerraPower to determine whether the company’s Natrium nuclear power plant might be appropriate for Kansas.
Kansas Reflector sat down with Andrew Richards, TerraPower’s vice president of government affairs, to discuss how the Natrium nuclear power plant differs from Evergy’s Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station that went online in 1985.

Andrew Richards, TerraPower vice president of government affairs (Submitted)

How do older nuclear power plants, like Wolf Creek, operate?
The Wolf Creek power plant is a pressurized water reactor, operating at a very high pressure in a container and using water as its coolant, Richards said.
“The fuel rods are enriched uranium, radioactive,” he said. “They lower into the water, the water boils, the boiling water creates steam. That steam spins a turbine to create electricity. The water also acts as a coolant.”
How does TerraPower’s nuclear power plant operate?
The Natrium reactor uses liquid sodium rather than water as a coolant, Richards said. With a boiling point of 800 degrees Celsius, or 1472 degrees Fahrenheit, the liquid offers less chance of boiling off in case of an accident, he said.
The reactor operates at atmospheric pressure, meaning it works in a lower pressure environment than traditional nuclear reactors, Richards said.
“At a very high level, the coolant is probably the biggest safety case for our reactor,” he said.
Additionally, the fuel is substantially different, he said.
Reactors like Wolf Creek use low-enriched uranium, which is enriched up to 5%, Richards said. Uranium enrichment is a process of increasing the amount of a specific isotope, U-235, that is in the uranium, according to the World Nuclear Association.
The Natrium reactor uses uranium enriched up to 20%, called Halo, Richards said.
“That means it’s more efficient and we don’t need as much of it, which essentially creates less spent nuclear fuel or nuclear waste,” he said.
Another difference is layout of the facility, which is split into two separate sections, a concept unique to TerraPower’s plant, Richards said.
In a smaller area, about 170 square feet out of the total development of 738 square feet, is a “nuclear island” where the reactor sits, he said. That area is the only part of the project that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversees for licensing, and it’s built using nuclear-rated cement and with other safety precautions.
A separate area, referred to as an “energy island,” houses molten salt energy storage tanks, which are large tanks where the heat from the reactor is stored, Richards said. That heat is then used to turn the turbine to create electricity.
A unique design used by TerraPower for its Natrium nuclear power plant is to separate the reactor area from the area where energy is stored, as shown in this graphic. (TerraPower)
Can the Natrium ramp up and down to easily respond to energy demands?
Richards said the Natrium provides a base of 345 megawatts of energy but the salt storage tanks allow it to ramp up to 500 megawatts for up to about 5.5 hours.
For comparison, the two natural gas plants Evergy is planning to build will each add 710 megawatts of power to the company’s generation portfolio and have an expected life of 40 years. Generally, 1 megawatts will power 1,000 homes, so the addition of 1,420 megawatts will power about 1.4 million homes.
Where else are you developing Natrium nuclear reactors?
The first Natrium is under construction in Wyoming, Richards said. The company also is talking to other countries, including the United Kingdom and South Korea, where Richards said many of the company’s investors are from.
Richards said it’s important for TerraPower, a company founded 18 years ago by Bill Gates, to get the Wyoming plant online. Many people don’t understand how real the project is because a lot of projections have been made about nuclear energy, he said.
“There’s a lot of nuclear companies and there’s a lot of promises being made. For TerraPower, we’re under construction. We’re moving ahead as fast as possible for a Wyoming reactor,” he said. “We anticipate it coming online by 2030 so we’re less talk and we’re more action. We’re eager to show the world that, yes, we can do this.”
Cost for nuclear energy has been considered prohibitive, and the Wyoming Natrium plant is estimated to cost $4 billion. How do you foresee a project of that cost working in a regulated utility environment like Kansas?
“The MOU we just announced allows us to begin having those conversations with Evergy,” Richards said. “It’s still very early days in terms of pricing or how it would work in Evergy service territory.”
However, Richards said Wyoming offers one option for managing costs.
“The Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program created by Congress in 2020 allowed us to do the project in Wyoming,” he said. “It’s a 50-50 partnership with the U.S. government and TerraPower. Each Congress has appropriated a substantial amount of money to push this plant forward, and it’s not just the plant that we’re building. It’s the entire Natrium supply chain — that means the supplying, the reactor vessel, the fuel, the licensing, the workforce.”
Does the current administration, which has been pushing for more coal power, support nuclear energy?
“I think the administration has been very supportive of the nuclear industry,” Richards said. “President Trump in May signed four civil nuclear executive orders that work to amplify and accelerate the industry. We’ve seen a lot of support under this administration and bipartisanly from Congress for our project.”
What are the benefits of nuclear energy?
Nuclear energy is emission-free, Richards said. The concern about the nuclear waste generated is something that his company acknowledges and is part of the plan for the future.
“Nuclear offers baseload energy — clean, viable base load energy — 24/7,” he said. “I believe Evergy and the Southwest Power Pool are estimating about 134% energy increase by 2034.
What about concerns about nuclear waste?
It’s understood that waste is part of the plan and will have to be addressed, Richards said.
“There are 94 operating reactors in the United States, in 34 states,” he said. “What our plant does is no different than what is done today. We will have spent nuclear fuel, it will be removed from the reactor, put into a pool to cool down. Once it’s cooled down, it will be put into a cement cask and will remain on site until the federal government has a final repository. It’s safe. It’s secure. It is no threat to anyone.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TFF-foundation-complete-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 09:56:13.990205

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal district judge said Kilmar Abrego Garcia can proceed with his claim that human smuggling charges filed against him in Tennessee were done in retaliation for successfully challenging his deportation in another court and should be dismissed.
U.S. District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr. of the Middle District of Tennessee ruled Friday that Abrego Garcia had shown a “reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness” in the filing of the human smuggling charges.
Those charges were filed this summer, more than two years after the traffic stop they were based on — and just days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration in Abrego Garcia’s deportation.
Abrego Garcia said the Tennessee charges were only filed to punish him for exercising his right to challenge his deportation in court, pointing to statements by Trump administration officials that “celebrated the criminal charges against him.”
Those included social media posts by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that called Abrego Garcia a gang member and human trafficker — he has not been convicted of any criminal charges in the U.S. — and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s statement in a press conference that “Abrego would be found guilty, sentenced, and ‘returned to his home country of El Salvador.’”
“While many of the statements made by the Executive Official Defendants about Abrego raise cause for concern, one stands out amongst the rest,” Crenshaw wrote in his 16-page ruling, citing televised remarks by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blache, the Justice Department official overseeing the acting U.S. attorney in Tennessee.
Abrego Garcia transferred to Pennsylvania facility, against lawyers’ wishes

Crenshaw wrote that Blache “told the public on television on the day of Abrego’s arrest that the government started ‘investigating’ Abrego after ‘a judge in Maryland . . . questioned’ the government’s decision to deport Abrego, found that it ‘had no right to deport him,’ and ‘accus[ed] [the government] of doing something wrong.”
“Deputy Attorney General Blanche’s remarkable statements could directly establish that the motivations for Abrego’s criminal charges stem from his exercise of his constitutional and statutory rights to bring suit against the Executive Official Defendants, rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct,” Crenshaw wrote.
Abrego Garcia is entitled to discovery and a hearing on his claim, Crenshaw said, and he ordered attorneys for both sides back in his court Oct. 10 for a status hearing in the case to discuss the scope of discovery.
Abrego Garcia is a native of El Salvador who said he came to the U.S. illegally as a teenager in 2011 to escape gang violence at home. He was arrested on immigration charges but in 2019 was granted “withholding of removal” status by an immigration judge because of the danger he would face from gangs if returned to El Salvador.
The withholding status allowed Abrego Garcia to stay and work in Maryland, where he was married and raising a family. Despite that status, Abrego Garcia was pulled over in a traffic stop by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in March and deported to El Salvador — a deportation the administration later acknowledged was a mistake.
Abrego Garcia’s wife quickly filed suit seeking his return from CECOT, the terrorism confinement center in El Salvador where he was held with hundreds of other U.S. deportees. Trump administration officials said he was out of their jurisdiction in CECOT, while Salvadoran officials said the decision on his placement belonged to the U.S., not them.










Deputy Attorney General Blanche’s remarkable statements could directly establish that the motivations for Abrego’s criminal charges stem from his exercise of his constitutional and statutory rights to bring suit against the Executive Official Defendants, rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct.


– U.S. District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr.


Ultimately, the courts made the decision for them, ordering Abrego Garcia’s return. The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously on April 10 that the administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return.
Just days after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the Department of Homeland Security reopened an investigation into a Nov. 30, 2022, traffic stop in Putnam County, Tennessee, when Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding with a car full of passengers.
Tennessee Highway Patrol officers who stopped him at the time did not charge him and “sent him on his way,” Crenshaw wrote. They referred the stop to Homeland Security Investigations, which took no action on it until March 12, 2025 — three days before Abrego Garcia was pulled over in Maryland — when the Tennessee case was officially closed.
The case was reopened in April, shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, and by May 21 a grand jury in the Middle District of Tennessee had indicted Abrego Garcia on the human smuggling charges. Only then was he returned from El Salvador and arrested on June 6.
“HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] reopened that investigation, after closing it the month prior, only 24 days after Abrego filed his civil suit, 13 days after he obtained relief in the District Court, and a mere seven days after he prevailed against the Executive Official Defendants on appeal at the Supreme Court,” Crenshaw wrote. “All of this stands in stark contrast to the 832 days the HSI investigation into Abrego remained pending, without referral to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Middle District of Tennessee for prosecution.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Crenshaw noted that in 15 years of criminal cases stemming from traffic stops throughout the entire 6th U.S. Circuit, only Abrego Garcia faced charges “filed significantly — 903 days — after the date of the traffic stop. This supports his contention that there may be an improper motive for his prosecution.”
Friday’s ruling comes just days after it was revealed that an immigration judge in Maryland had denied Abrego Garcia’s request to reopen his asylum case.
It also came two days after the federal government shutdown — which led Justice Department attorneys to request a delay in Abrego Garcia’s case in Maryland, where his immigration status is at issue, because they were furloughed in the shutdown and cannot appear.
Abrego Garcia’s attorneys opposed that motion, arguing that the case should proceed during the shutdown, and that their client, currently held in a detention center in Pennsylvania, should be released to home detention. A status hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday morning in Greenbelt.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abregogarciaaug25-1024x735.jpg,,,2025-10-06 09:56:13.990205

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Michael Leary







IN SOME WAYS, health care providers in the more far-flung regions of Massachusetts are running into the same problems as everyone else, like the primary care crisis, specialist staffing shortages, and coverage fears from looming Medicaid cuts. Adding in narrow roadways, a dispersed and aging population, and fierce New England hill town weather only makes the access math harder. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talks with Michael Leary, director of media relations for Berkshire Health Systems. The system has three hospitals, including the 298-bed Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield as the county’s primary hospital. Two critical access hospitals – Fairview Hospital in Great Barrington and North Adams Regional Hospital – anchor the southern and northern edges of the county. 
They dive into what makes Berkshire County such a complicated puzzle of health care access, even with the re-opening of the North Adams hospital after a decade of closure.  
“I vividly remember the day” the hospital closed, said Leary, a North Adams resident for over 30 years. A good friend worked as his communications counterpart at North Adams Regional, which at the time was managed by the separate Northern Berkshire Healthcare. 
Leary said his friend called on a Tuesday morning, “and said, ‘You know, I just wanna let you know North Adams Regional is closing.’ And I said, ‘When?’ And he said, ‘Friday,’ which was a shock to everybody.” 
The hospital was not financially sustainable because it did not qualify for critical access hospital status, which comes with dedicated federal Medicaid and Medicare funding. At the time, Leary noted, federal legislation said that if the center was within a certain number of minutes or miles from an acute care hospital, it did not qualify. North Adams “fell right into the narrow edges of that” with Berkshire Medical Center and a hospital in Bennington, Vermont. 
Through finagling by US Rep. Richard Neal, the language was changed to include a carve out for hospitals accessible by just a two-way road like North Adams. With the designation in hand, the facility re-opened a decade after closing. 
But access issues persist, Leary said. “Transportation is always an issue in the Berkshires due to the wide geography,” he said, “and the fact that we are limited with the type of rural main roads that we have here in the county.”  
And the dispersed population makes maintaining infrastructure like maternity units difficult. The North Adams hospital had a full maternity unit before its closure, but on re-opening as a critical access site it didn’t have the expected numbers that would make a maternity unit sustainable, Leary said. People looking for more than an OB/GYN have to travel to Pittsfield or further. 
The other open question is the impacts of federal funding cuts to Medicaid programing, which would not take effect until after the 2026 midterms. Berkshire Medical Center and Fairview Hospital will receive part of a $17 million allocation – with the specific hospital-by-hospital amount not yet released – from $122 million in state funding announced in September to shore up acute care hospitals. 
Berkshire Medical Systems has not publicly announced plans to pursue some of the $50 billion rural health fund included as part of the Trump tax law signed in July. 
“We are keeping a very close eye on [the Medicaid cuts] and whatever impact it would have here on the Berkshires,” Leary said. “We are very fortunate to have had a very good sustainable financial model for a number of years now. We consider ourselves to be a very good financial performer.

After decades of population decline following deindustrialization, waves of immigration from Muslim-majority countries have helped revitalize this Michigan community. Today, crime rates in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods are significantly lower than in other parts of the city. Small businesses line the streets, families walk to school and the community has regained much of the vitality it had lost.
This might seem unexpected to those who follow recent political rhetoric around immigration and crime. In April, when a Michigan lawmaker characterized immigrants as “violent gangbangers, perverts, scammers and all sorts of other criminals,” he was speaking to widely held but unsupported concerns following a surge in immigration. So, what does the evidence actually show?
Consider what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) own data tells us. According to ICE’s September 2025 records from Michigan, the overwhelming majority of those detained, 86%, are classified as having “No ICE Threat Level,” with no prior criminal convictions. Decades of research have actually found that people who are undocumented are more than 30% less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. 
What we’re seeing in Hamtramck reflects a broader trend documented across the country, where immigrant communities often contribute to neighborhood stability rather than undermining it. In fact, of the top 10 Michigan cities with the highest proportion of foreign-born residents, the majority had lower than average property crime and violent crime given both their size and poverty levels.

Why would this be? Laurence Benenson, policy liaison at the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force — a group primarily composed of police officers — observes that immigration is highly self-selective; the people willing to uproot their lives are typically motivated, law-abiding individuals, not criminals looking to exploit the system. This explains why crime rates often drop as immigrants move into an area. 
Yet media coverage tells a dramatically altered story. Between 2022 and 2024, Fox News aired nearly 1,000 segments on “migrant crime,” with coverage jumping 880% in early 2024. These broadcasts increased even as violent crime declined nationwide and research continued to confirm lower crime rates among immigrants. At the same time, claims that the U.S. is under invasion by transnational Latin American gangs, such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, have been used to justify the use of the Alien Enemies Act, enabling deportations without due process. 
But Maya Barak, who teaches criminology at the University of Michigan-Dearborn and specifically studied transnational Latin American gangs like MS-13, says these groups tend to be concentrated on the coasts and aren’t considered a significant public safety threat in Michigan. She adds that most gang violence is between and among rivals and tends not to extend into the community, where they don’t have a foothold. 
Under the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign, with H.R.1 transforming ICE into the highest-funded domestic enforcement agency, arrests have increased 150% in Michigan. Raids can now proceed at schools, churches and hospitals. Six Michigan cities and counties have signed potentially costly 287(g) agreements, deputizing local law enforcement for immigration duties and paving the way for mass deportation. 
This enforcement environment undermines public safety. According to Barak, it pushes people underground out of fear, endangering community trust and limiting law enforcement. Current policies are terrorizing immigrant communities, preventing them from contacting emergency services, which are often intertwined with local police, discouraging life-saving calls. Washtenaw County Sheriff Alyshia Dyer says federal immigration enforcement demands divert local resources from urgent public safety issues like human trafficking.
Behind these public debates is a human reality. One of the largest polls of asylum seekers in the U.S. shows that nearly 70% of immigrants come to the U.S. seeking a better future for their children, with about 6 in 10 Central American immigrants fleeing crime. These aren’t profiles of violent criminals — they’re profiles of people escaping crime, seeking the same opportunities and security that have drawn people to America for generations.

This story by Marion Umpleby was first published in the Valley News on Oct. 1, 2025.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — When collaborators Michelle Ollie and James Sturm set out to start a school for cartooning in the early 2000s, they were met with incredulity. 
Cartooning was still considered a lightweight art form, at least in the eyes of the general public, and a school devoted to the craft, in rural Vermont no less, seemed like a far-fetched endeavor.
“People were like, ‘Oh, you’re making a clown college?’” Sturm said in a recent interview. “It was such a reach for the public imagination.”  
But despite the raised eyebrows, the Center for Cartoon Studies, now in its 20th year, has grown into a hub for burgeoning talent and seasoned cartoonists alike. School alumni include Tillie Walden, whose autobiographical graphic novel “Spinning” earned her a Will Eisner Award, and drag queen Sasha Velour, whose art has appeared on the cover of The New Yorker.
In honor of the milestone, an exhibition is opening in the school’s Colodny building that features cartoons and mock-ups from the center’s early days. The show’s opening reception is set for the end of this week as part of White River Junction’s First Friday festivities. 

As CCS has continued to advance over the years, so has the state of cartooning. Back in the early 2000s, notions of what cartooning could look like were still evolving, and Sturm felt like he could “wrap my head around” their place in the zeitgeist. 
Now bookstore shelves are lined with comic books whose subject matter range from cookbooks to personal memoirs to political manifestos. 
The digital age has also given rise to a culture that communicates through the rapid exchange of symbols and visual imagery, be it with emojis, memes or Instagram posts. 
“Cartoons have been doing that forever,” said Sturm, who turns 60 this month.
Cartooning has also gotten a lot more queer, and so has CCS. In the school’s early days, classes were mainly male, now CCS has so many women and non-binary students that Sturm said he’s surprised “we don’t have a target on our back from the Trump administration.” 
Over the years, the center’s faculty has also grown, too. The school currently has around eight faculty members, many of whom are alumni at the school, in addition to dozens of visiting cartoonists who teach classes over the course of the year. 
“I used to wear 50 hats, now I wear about four,” Sturm said.
One of those hats is director of the school’s Applied Cartooning Lab, which works with national organizations to create educational cartoons about topics such as health care, civic engagement and mental health. A couple years ago, the Lab published “Health and Wealth,” a comic book in which an eclectic cast of animals break down the complexities of the U.S. health care system. The guide, which was a collaboration with students at Harvard College, was distributed to all 535 members of the U.S. Congress.

While CCS has continued to develop work with some of the industry’s most notable cartoonists, with only three facilities concentrated in downtown White River Junction and about two dozen students in the full-time programs, in many ways it remains a humble operation. 
“We punch way above our weight class,” Sturm said.
In addition to the MFA program, CCS also offers one-year and two-year certificates as well as fellowships and summer courses. Tuition for the MFA program for this academic year is $29,750 before scholarships and aid.
CCS’ small scale works for Sturm and Ollie. For one, it makes it easier to enact administrative and curricular changes quickly, but it also helps foster a tight-knit community among students and staff. 
The school’s small operation also feels fitting given that cartooning, by nature, is a medium that can pack a punch even in the tiny margins of a sheet of notebook paper or the back of a napkin. 
CCS is currently in the process of further consolidating the campus. In November, the school plans to start renovations on the town’s historic telegraph building to accommodate classrooms, a production lab, archives and offices.
The completion of the project, slated for next fall, would mean bidding goodbye to the Colodny building on South Main Street, which the school has used since it opened. A historic building that was once a department store, the Colodny’s basement flooded five years ago and as the school turns 20, it’s time to make a change.

Newsom should know better than to let L.A. set state policy on housing.","Guest Commentary written by

Marc Vukcevich
Marc Vukcevich is the director of state policy at Streets For All, a pro-transit and smart land use organization.


Gov. Gavin Newsom has a decision to make.
On his desk is Senate Bill 79 by state Sen. Scott Wiener, legislation that meets the moment on California’s climate, housing and transportation needs by allowing the construction of more homes near transit and existing job centers — exactly where California needs them most. 
Signing it should be an easy call, especially after how heavily amended the bill was in the legislature. But there’s pressure to block it, and much of that pressure is coming from Los Angeles.
L.A. is in no position to set the state’s housing policy. Newsom should know that.
The city hit a 10-year low in housing permits last year, all while rents soar and homelessness persists. New York City, a city about twice as large as L.A. and also experiencing a housing crisis, is on track to build 50,000 units this year. Meanwhile, L.A. had permitted 3,100 as of July.
The housing that does get approved isn’t thanks to local leadership, either. Much of it is the result of state mandates like California’s density bonus law and the legalization of accessory dwelling units. 
Without Sacramento’s intervention, Los Angeles would be building next to nothing.
Yet some of L.A.’s most powerful voices are asking the governor to pull the plug on SB 79. Mayor Karen Bass, Councilmember Traci Park and City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto have emerged as the city’s three chief NIMBYs.
In addition to gutting her own flagship affordable housing policy, ED 1, Bass has used her influence to secure an exemption from SB 9 in the Palisades, shielding one of the city’s wealthiest enclaves from modest duplex reforms. That compromise might be understandable — sensitive hillsides and fire zones aren’t the best places for new housing. But if we’re going to restrict growth there, then we have to make up for it elsewhere — especially in the urban, transit-rich parts of L.A. where new homes make the most sense.
Instead, Bass now argues that SB 79 somehow undermines a “pro-housing city like Los Angeles.” If L.A. were truly pro-housing, its permitting record wouldn’t be scraping the bottom.
Park and Feldstein Soto, in addition to campaigning against housing, have worked to block the Venice Dell affordable housing project on city-owned land — an already city council-approved project designed to house Angelenos most in need. 
Rather than championing urgently needed homes, they’ve thrown up obstacles and delays time and time again.
The truth is clear: Los Angeles has failed to lead on housing, and when it has moved at all, it’s only because state law forced its hand. Giving L.A. a veto over state policy would doom California to more of the same — rising costs, worsening displacement and endless obstruction.
Newsom has pledged bold leadership on housing. Now is the moment to show it. SB 79 is not about punishing cities; it’s about ensuring that homes get built where they make the most sense — in urban, transit-rich areas where people can thrive without long commutes or car dependence.
The governor shouldn’t take housing advice from Los Angeles. He should sign SB 79, lead the state forward and send a clear message: California’s future won’t be held back by NIMBY politics.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/020422-ELLIS-ACT-BUILDINGS-BG-CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

Here’s why Los Angeles is the frontline,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/10/measure-ula-howard-jarvis-ballot-mansion/,A low-tax advocacy group seems intent on making the Los Angeles “mansion tax” the face of their statewide tax-capping ballot measure campaign.,"In summary
A low-tax advocacy group seems intent on making the Los Angeles “mansion tax” the face of their statewide tax-capping ballot measure campaign.


In 2022, the Los Angeles electorate voted to slap the sale of mansions and other high-value real estate deals across the city with a hefty tax. 
Locals have been debating Measure ULA ever since. Supporters call it a vital lifeline for the city’s unhoused and housing insecure who stand to benefit from the hundreds of millions of dollars the initiative has already raked in. Critics call it an economic own-goal that has choked off new apartment construction in a city where new housing is in excruciatingly short supply.
That debate is about to go statewide.
The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, a low tax advocacy group, is currently gathering signatures to put a measure on California’s November 2026 ballot. A central part of their pitch: No more Measure ULAs. 
The proposed constitutional amendment takes aim at two types of taxation common across California:

Transfer taxes on the sale of real estate. The measure would cap rates at a little more than one-twentieth of one percent of the value of the property. Los Angeles’ highest rate is one hundred-times higher.


Local tax measures put on the ballot by voter-backed campaigns (as opposed those put there by city councils) that are earmarked for a particular purpose. The tax-capping proposal would raise the electoral support needed to pass these types of “special” tax measures to two-thirds, up from a simple majority of more than 50%. 

Municipal governments across the state stand to lose billions of dollars (with taxpayers standing to save just as much) if the measure ultimately succeeds. Voter-proposed tax hikes have been approved by simple majorities in cities and counties across California. Transfer tax hikes have also been a popular funding source for certain local governments. 
Measure ULA, which 58% of Los Angeles voters backed in 2022, happens to be both. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and its political allies appear happy to make it the face of the statewide campaign.
Putting a lid on both citizen-initiated tax measures and high transfer taxes “is something that we have always had as a priority,” said Rob Lapsely, president of the California Business Roundtable, a coalition that has yet to take a formal position on the measure but which backed an earlier version. “The question was, ‘can we actually find the right opportunity?’” 
“And then suddenly, along came Measure ULA.”
The fight over the “mansion tax”
The City of Los Angeles’ measure was sold to voters as a “mansion tax,” because it sticks new, elevated transfer fee rates on only the highest value sales: 4% on properties between $5 million and $10 million and 5.5% for those above that. Those numbers have inched up with inflation. All sales below those thresholds are taxed at roughly half of one percent.
Since going into effect in 2023, the measure has raised some $830 million for affordable housing construction, subsidies for cash-strapped renters and legal assistance for tenants facing eviction. It is by far the largest single contributor to the city’s overall homelessness spending.
But ULA has its critics. Not just a tax on mansions, the high rates apply to commercial, industrial and multifamily residential projects too, including land sales for new apartment developments. Apartment construction has indeed slowed to a crawl across the city in recent years and developers and researchers have laid at least some of the blame on the city’s high transfer taxes which they argue has driven new construction down further than in surrounding cities. One report by researchers at UCLA and the Rand Institute estimated that the measure has resulted in 1,910 fewer apartments per year, including 168 fewer affordable units. Another study by researchers at Harvard, UC Irvine and UC San Diego, found that property tax collections fell steeply as a result of the dramatic slow down in sales, off-setting an estimated 63% of the collect transfer tax revenue, if not significantly more. 
Backers of the mansion tax have taken issue with the UCLA study in particular. They also note that the program is currently accepting applications for its first major distribution of funds, with plans to push nearly $400 million out the door, which could ultimately ramp up affordable housing development across the city.
But there’s growing concern, both in Los Angeles and among Democrats in Sacramento, that ULA as it currently exists has become a political vulnerability — and one that could fuel the campaign behind the statewide tax busting measure.
“Measure ULA is the tail wagging the dog,” said Mott Smith, a developer and board member of the California Infill Builders Association who co-authored another study that found a chilling effect on the housing market. “Anyone with assets in Los Angeles is like, ‘please where can I send my check to Howard Jarvis?’”

In the final days of the California Legislative session, Mayor Karen Bass and former Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg tried to hammer a grand bargain into state law. Senate Bill 423 would have exempted certain new residential developments from the tax, offering a reprieve to many multifamily housing developers. It would have also given the city more flexibility to renegotiate affordability requirements on housing projects funded by the measure, addressing concerns by some developers and financiers that ULA cash comes with too many strings attached to be of use. 
The bill would have also exempted homes destroyed in the recent wildfires. 
But there was a catch: The ULA tweak would only go into effect if the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association pulls its ballot measure or it fails to qualify for the ballot.
All of that ultimately proved too complicated, contentious and of questionable legality to ram through the Legislature in the final days of the session. Long Beach Sen. Lena Gonzalez and Inglewood Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, both Democrats, vowed to pick it up again in January.

But that may be too late to neuter the anti-tax campaign. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association is already gathering signatures and raising funds. 
“This was an attempt to cut us off early in the process, but since we’re moving forward I think the attempt to leverage this is not going to prevail,” Jon Coupal, the association’s president. “Their opportunity to ambush us is now over.”
That’s given local government groups billions of reasons to worry. Along with making it more challenging to raise revenue in the future, cities with existing high transfer taxes would see them slashed. Parcel taxes currently on the books that were approved by majorities of less than two-thirds would be similarly nixed. 
Cities would lose between $2 billion and $3 billion each year if the measure becomes law, according to an analysis commissioned by the League of California Cities, a lobbying group. That includes hundreds of millions of dollars in foregone funding dedicated for new housing and homelessness services in Los Angeles and Santa Monica. But it also includes hundreds of millions more for cities that don’t use these transfer dollars for new, specific purposes and projects, but simply to top up their budgets.
The City of Berkeley, for example, stands to lose between $33 million and $63 million, according to the League’s analysis. That’s the equivalent of between 15-30% of the town’s general fund.

California’s favorite fight
Californians have been having some version of this fight for nearly half a century. 
In 1978, voters passed Proposition 13, which capped property taxes and put strict limits on local and state governments’ ability to raise revenue. Defending, rolling back and revising those limits in court battles and subsequent state ballot measure campaigns is now a storied California political tradition.  
The latest chapter begins in 2017 when the California Supreme Court ruled in a case against the southern California city of Upland that citizen-initiated special tax measures only need to get more than 50% of the vote to pass. Up until that point it was presumed that the required threshold was the much more electorally formidable two-thirds. 
Since then cities and counties have passed two dozen of these measures by margins of less than two-thirds. That includes taxes on parcels, sales and gross receipts that have been used to fund local schools, parks, street repairs and housing and that have been put on the ballot by homeless advocates, environmentalists and organized labor groups. It also includes Measure ULA.
And since then, business groups have been clambering to close the “Upland loophole.”
“This is now the vehicle for unions and others to be able to try and pass new taxes on targeted business sectors using a majority vote,” said Lapsely. “That only hurts job growth.”
Over that same period some cities have also turned to transfer taxes as a new source of revenue. It’s a fiscal avenue only available to a select number of cities. Under state law, most municipalities max out their  transfer taxes at 55 cents for every $1,000 in sale value. But for “charter cities” — local governments with their own municipal constitution — there is no upper limit. Twenty-six have taken advantage of that fiscal opportunity.
They include Santa Monica, which passed its own version of a high-value transfer tax (Measure GS) in 2022, and Los Angeles. Voters in cities across the San Francisco Bay Area have voted to make more modest or incremental hikes over the last 10 years. 
Electoral hurdles to come
The transfer tax trend has particularly irked landlords and real estate developers. 
Last year, they joined forces with anti-tax advocates and other business groups to rein in both types of bothersome taxation with a ballot measure. The California Supreme Court took the unusual step of striking it from the 2024 ballot, ruling that it proposed too “substantial” a change to state government to be enacted by a mere ballot measure. 
This year’s version is much more carefully targeted making it less likely to hit this same constitutional snag. 
But even if the signature gathering effort is successful, the Howard Jarvis campaign has its work cut out for it — even for a conservative-coded measure in reliably blue California. In late 2023, the Legislature floated its own head-spinning ballot measure that would require future initiatives that want to hike the threshold needed to pass other measures (see: the business-backed measure) to meet that same higher threshold (in this case, two-thirds) before becoming law. 
That effort to hoist the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Association on its own petard is already slated for the November 2026 election. If it passes, it would apply to any other measures also on the ballot.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/040425_Palm-springs-House_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

Thousands of Californians could return to homelessness as the feds reportedly plan to disinvest from permanent housing.


The latest blow in a seemingly endless barrage of bad news for the California agencies tasked with fighting homelessness looms: President Donald Trump’s administration is expected to deeply cut federal funding for permanent housing. 
The news has sent counties throughout California into a panic. The state is bracing to lose hundreds of millions of dollars for permanent housing, which is the one thing experts agree on as the most effective way to solve homelessness.
Across the state, homeless service providers and local leaders are convening emergency meetings to figure out just how bad the cuts are going to be and what to do about them. Some are scrambling to move money around or even re-label their programs to save hard-won housing. Others have already started helping fewer people in anticipation of the cuts.
But they agree on one thing: If these cuts go through, thousands of California’s most vulnerable residents likely will be evicted from their subsidized housing, and may end up back on the street. 
It would likely reverse recent progress made in fixing the state’s severe homelessness problem. 
“I don’t know what they think is going to happen with all these people,” said Maryn Pitt, chair of the Stanislaus County Continuum of Care, which manages the county’s federal homelessness funds. “We’re just going to turn them out and they’ll just disappear? I have no idea, but it seems rather inhumane.”
Her county has 17 permanent housing projects funded with money at risk from federal cuts.
Already reeling from upcoming state cuts to homeless funding, California’s homelessness agencies have been bracing for federal cuts for months, without knowing exactly what to expect. Now, some of those cuts have come into sharper focus. The Trump administration intends to redirect a significant chunk of money away from permanent housing and into temporary housing — while also adding requirements for people to qualify for that temporary aid, according to reporting from Politico, which cited internal HUD documents and interviews with anonymous HUD employees. 
If that happens, only 30% of federal homelessness funds would be available for permanent housing — down from the current rate of 87%. Nationwide, that means the money available for permanent housing will shrink from $3.3 billion down to about $1.1 billion, Politico reported.
That would be a major strategy shift. For years, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has prioritized permanent housing over temporary housing and shelter. Permanent housing is designed to end someone’s homelessness for good, while temporary housing and shelter is a Band-Aid solution: It gets people off the street, but only for a limited time. 
“Losing that much permanent housing will have an impact for generations to come.”Gita O’Neill, interim CEO, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority
When CalMatters asked the agency to comment on the reported funding cuts it responded with an automatically generated email: “The Radical Left has shut down the government. As a result, HUD’s Office of Public Affairs is operating in a limited capacity, which impacts our ability to promptly engage with the mainstream media.”
The federal government is expected to issue a “notice of funding opportunity” this fall for its continuum of care program, the country’s main source of federal homelessness funding, laying out how much money is available, what it can be used for and what rules apply. That’s where the feds are expected to give official notice of the permanent housing cuts.
Los Angeles County, which has the largest homeless population in California, has $217 million at stake. More than 80% of that goes toward keeping people in permanent housing, said Jessica Reed, associate director of continuum of care planning for the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. If the projected cuts go through, more than 8,000 units of housing would be at risk, she said. 
It would be “absolutely devastating,” Reed said.
People living in subsidized permanent housing tend to be among California’s most vulnerable, including those who have chronic disabilities and were homeless for years before moving indoors. Many live on meager disability benefits. If their housing subsidies dry up, there’s no way they’ll be able to pay their rent, Reed said. 
Those renters also often have criminal records, poor credit and a history of evictions — making it almost impossible for them to compete for housing on the open market, even if they could afford rent, Pitt said.
Santa Cruz County’s latest continuum of care allocation was about $7.7 million — of which about 82% is for permanent housing, said Robert Ratner, director of Housing for Health for the county. About 290 people live in those units.
If the spending cap takes effect, Santa Cruz County likely would try to shift some state money to cover the housing no longer eligible for federal funds, Ratner said. 
“We’re going to end up having to close most of these programs, because there’s not enough state money,” he said. “There’s no way the math works.”
To prepare, Santa Cruz County has already started winding down some services. 
“We’re helping far fewer people,” Ratner said.
Typically, Santa Cruz County helps between 40 and 60 households move from homelessness into housing each month. If the permanent housing cuts take effect, Ratner expects that to eventually drop by as much as three-quarters. 
To make matters worse, when awarding homelessness grants, the feds plan to deduct points for organizations that have used “racial preferences” or recognized transgender people, according to Politico. The Trump administration already has attempted to impose similar restrictions on other homelessness grants, prompting multiple lawsuits.
Ratner worries those new rules could mean Santa Cruz County isn’t eligible for any money.
Other counties are making similar dire predictions.
Santa Clara County estimates at least 1,000 households would be at risk of homelessness if the feds cap funding for permanent housing at 30%, said Kathryn Kaminski, director of the county’s Office of Supportive Housing. 
Sacramento County, which dedicated about 86% of its $40 million in federal continuum of care funding to permanent housing in 2024, worries the cuts could displace residents, slow housing placements and force service providers to lay off staff. 
The scariest part is that this funding change signals the federal administration is turning its back on the long-standing belief that permanent housing solves homelessness, said Gita O’Neill, interim CEO of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. And the feds are making that shift suddenly, giving service providers no time to wind down their programs.
“Which is going to be devastating across the country, no matter where you are,” O’Neill said. “Losing that much permanent housing will have an impact for generations to come.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102524_Unhoused-Voting_FG_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

Every house weatherized means more dollars in the local economy, less carbon in the atmosphere wreaking havoc and healthier, more comfortable living for Vermonters.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Marisa D. Keller: Weatherization for a more affordable and sustainable Vermont.","This commentary is by Marisa D. Keller, of Montpelier. Keller is a former weatherization technician, a communications professional, a climate justice volunteer and a part-time staffer with 350Vermont.


On a hot day this summer, I sweated in an attic with a small crew of 350Vermont volunteers, packing an older couple’s possessions into boxes and carrying them down two flights of stairs to a storage container. Our work that day would allow the home to be weatherized (insulated and air-sealed) after two years on a waiting list for a weatherization assistance program that saves households an average of $1,000 a year on energy bills. But the benefits of weatherization go far beyond one household’s savings.
Vermont faces a housing crisis, an affordability crisis and a climate crisis. At the same time, our federal government is canceling grants for low-income solar projects, flood resilience for farms, and local food in schools, while fossil-fuel billionaires are pouring money into opposing clean energy solutions that would help us switch to less costly sources of heat and electricity. 
In this time of crises, we need commonsense solutions that address the big-picture problems while also making people’s lives easier right away. That’s why 350Vermont is working on weatherization. We are a nonprofit with a mission of climate justice — a world in which everyone has access to clean, affordable energy and safe and healthy communities. 
This year our volunteer network is working to support weatherization initiatives across the state, from clearing out attics for the Weatherization Assistance Program to building insulating window inserts for WindowDressers to doing outreach about the many weatherization resources available to Vermonters.
Why weatherization?
Weatherization makes a home more energy efficient by improving insulation and reducing air leaks, while also increasing the health and resilience of our communities and even mitigating the injustices of our world. 
Weatherizing a house brings obvious benefits to the individuals or families living there. It can save a household hundreds of dollars a year in energy costs. It reduces drafts and makes a home warmer in winter and cooler in summer. It can also reduce mold and pests, making the home a healthier place to live.
The benefits of weatherization also ripple out to the community. A third of Vermont households who got help weatherizing their homes last year had previously received fuel assistance from the state because they could not afford to heat their homes. In addition to helping families in need, weatherization makes our communities healthier: Burning less oil, gas and wood reduces air pollution that causes asthma, cancer and heart disease. Less dependence on fossil fuels makes us less vulnerable to global-supply-chain disruptions and price hikes. It also keeps more of our energy dollars in the local economy. And the less energy we need, the better we can supply it for ourselves with clean sources like solar, wind, and thermal energy.
When we take an even broader view, we can see weatherization as a way of fighting climate change and the economic injustices that drive it. The U.S. gives the fossil fuel industry an estimated $757 billion per year in direct and indirect subsidies, which enriches some of the world’s richest and most destructive companies and undermines clean energy solutions. When we buy less oil and gas, we take power back for ourselves and our communities. 
We also make the world a little less unjust: The negative effects of extracting and burning fossil fuels are disproportionately borne by low-income communities, indigenous people and people of color — both in the U.S. and abroad. 
Dramatically reducing the amount of fuel we burn by 2030 is the best way to prevent climate devastation and secure a safe, equitable future for ourselves and our children. Every house weatherized means more dollars in the local economy, less carbon in the atmosphere wreaking havoc and healthier, more comfortable living for Vermonters.

Former U.S. Sen. and Gov. Evan Bayh announced the news in a post to X, followed by a news release.
“I’m proud to announce that my son, Beau, filed his candidacy for Indiana Secretary of State today. A 7th generation Hoosier, Marine Corps infantry Captain, Harvard graduate, and attorney, Beau will bring new leadership to an office that desperately needs it,” he wrote.
Beau Bayh, 29, has been attending key political events and considering a run against Republican Diego Morales.
“Right now, the Secretary of State’s office shows exactly what’s gone wrong,” Beau Bayh said. “Instead of serving Hoosiers, that office has been used to cut backroom deals, with our tax dollars funding perks for politicians and their insider friends. Hoosiers work hard for our money, and it’s being wasted. There’s no accountability. We deserve a Secretary of State who works for the people.”
His plan for the office includes:


Ensuring accountability for every tax dollar by calling out corruption, wasteful spending, and government abuse wherever it exists.


Opposing excessive taxes that are crushing working families.


Overseeing fair and secure elections.


Supporting the thousands of new businesses that create jobs and fuel our economy.


“I know what we’re up against. The secretary of state has a pretty good thing going for himself and his buddies,” Beau Bayh said in his launch video. “They won’t give that up easily. But I’m a Marine and we don’t run from a fight. And we’re all sick of self-serving politicians dividing us for their own benefit. Enough already.”
Morales has been a lightning rod for controversy in his first term, which began in 2023. He has been criticized for excessive travel, giving no-bid contracts to political donors, hiring his brother-in-law and giving massive bonuses to employees.
Democrat Blythe Potter is also running. She served in the U.S. Army Reserves and is a small business owner.
Morales challengers line up as criticism over international trips mounts

Republican Knox County Clerk Dave Shelton ran against Morales in the 2022 convention but fell short in the final tally. He announced he will run again in April days before Morales posted about his intention to run for reelection. Fellow Republican Jamie Reitenour is also challenging Morales.
Libertarian Laura Shillings will seek her party’s nomination.
The party nominees will be chosen at conventions in the summer of 2026 by party insiders and then will face off in the fall.
While in the Marine Corps, Beau Bayh rose to the rank of captain and graduated from the Scout Sniper Unit Leader’s Course.
Following his honorable discharge in 2023, he earned a law degree from Harvard University and served as a judicial law clerk in Bloomington for Judge David F. Hamilton on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
In August, Beau Bayh was on the SnydeReport podcast and talked about his interest in public service. He also has a twin, Nick.
“Growing up in a family, with my granddad as well, being surrounded by public service, that was always something that was interesting to me,” Beau Bayh said on the podcast. “I had been given all these great opportunities…to whom much is given much is expected and we all have an obligation to give back.”
He follows in the footsteps of his father, who served Indiana in multiple offices for more than 20 years. Evan Bayh’s first office was also Indiana Secretary of State in 1986. Before that, his grandfather, Birch Bayh, also served in the U.S. Senate for almost 20 years.

The new method that was green lit last week would require applicants to accrue 240 hours of supervised legal practice under a qualified attorney, complete law school-required coursework, and a written performance exam administered by the Utah State Bar.

Applications for the new model open on Jan. 1, 2026.
“We are pleased to offer an alternate path for licensure,” Utah State Bar Executive Director Elizabeth Wright said in a statement. “We were keenly aware that one size doesn’t fit all, and providing an option equips those who excel outside of a traditional exam with practical skills for a successful career in the legal profession.”
States like Oregon and Washington have already implemented the alternative, and multiple other states are exploring similar approaches to licensure. Citing evolving needs of both the profession and the public, the Utah State Bar said the new method is meant to complement the existing bar exam format, a two-day test that Utah administers twice a year. 
The Utah Supreme Court’s approval came after a Bar Admissions Working Group explored alternatives to the traditional bar exam “in response to growing national and local calls for a licensure model that better reflects real-world skills, reduces economic barriers, and supports workforce readiness,” according to the release. 



Let us know what you think...


 


The group was composed of 15 members from the state’s legal community, including judges, practitioners and academics. The method is also backed by research that demonstrates skill-based assessments can be more effective than a standard test alone.
The group emphasized the pathway doesn’t lower the current licensure standards, but modifies how competence is demonstrated.
“This is not about making it easier to become a lawyer,” Utah Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice, and working group chair, John Pearce said in a statement. “It’s about making it smarter. This option gives graduates a financially viable way to begin practicing law without months of unpaid studying and the potential of thousands of dollars in prep costs. The Utah Supreme Court is convinced that this path will produce attorneys who are better prepared to immediately practice law.”

Alabama isn’t alone in seeing rising insurance costs. According to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research organization, insurance premiums could more than double for 11 to more than 24 million Americans enrolled in Obamacare.
Experts cite several reasons for the increases, including health care worker shortages, rising drug costs driven in part by tariffs, and the possibility that enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans will expire at the end of the year, possibly affecting people’s abilities to buy health insurance. 
The ACA subsidies are at the center of negotiations amid the federal government shutdown. Democrats in Congress want to extend the funding for the subsidies through the continuing resolution (CR) needed to keep the government funded. Republicans, who control both chambers, claim the extension is partisan and does not have a place in their funding bill.
Provider shortages 
Amanda Williams, the former president of the Medical Association of the State of Alabama (MASA), said in an interview that the cost of practicing medicine has gone up. She said recruiting providers to Alabama is difficult, which contributes to the rising costs. She said the nation’s aging population contributes to an increasing demand for care, but there are not enough providers to meet it, which drives prices up. 
“Nurses is the same kind of problem. So then it makes it more and more expensive to try to get travel nurses to come in,” Williams said. “That can be a big burden for hospitals.”
In addition to recruitment struggles, malpractice rates are also increasing, she said. 
“When we have such a shortage and we have people leaving the state, then it’s more of a burden on all of the other providers,” she said. “You’re reducing access to care. When you reduce access to care, you lead to more hospital visits, more ER visits, when it may have been something that could have been addressed in office, but we don’t have enough physicians. So there’s not enough offices, and then there’s sometimes redundant tests ordered when that happens.”

Drug costs and tariffs

Matthew McGough, an expert in private insurance at KFF, also said pharmaceutical prices and tariffs are also driving costs up. Some increasingly popular medications, like GLP-1s, are causing drug plan premiums to rise because there are many people who qualify for the diabetes and weight loss medication, he said. 
According to ClinCalc DrugStats, a data resource that is managed by pharmacist Sean Kane, almost 5.4 million Americans were prescribed semaglutide, one of four major GLP-1 medications, in 2023. It was the 19th most prescribed medication at almost 26 million prescriptions. It was also one of the most expensive. The average drug cost was $1,322 per prescription with an average out-of-pocket cost of $53 per prescription, according to ClinCalc. 
“Because they are so high cost and so many people could be eligible for them, for weight loss or other conditions, then it can drive up premiums for everyone,” McGough said.
McGough said that a lot of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment are manufactured overseas. Sweeping tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump in April also impact health costs, McGough said. While manufacturers have increased domestic production, he said, it is not easy or quick to alter the production line.
“Companies have been increasing their domestic manufacturing of drugs, and that may be one way that they’re trying to get around these tariffs or gain favor with the administration,” he said. “Because everything’s sort of happening on a country-to-country basis, it’s hard to know what can be done to get around them.”
Trump also announced a 100% tariff on pharmaceuticals Thursday, on top of 25% tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported from Europe announced in July.  

ACA subsidies

Americans nationwide, especially the elderly and those in rural areas, will see increased costs for their health care if Congress does not extend enhanced subsidies by the end of the year. According to Cover Alabama, a nonpartisan advocacy group, and Alabama Arise, which works on issues related to poverty, a couple in their early 60s who make $82,000 a year will see premiums for a benchmark plan jump from around $7,000 to more than $27,000 annually without the subsidies. 
These federal subsidies, enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, have been critical in keeping health insurance accessible for Alabama families, according to the advocacy groups. 
“Without congressional action, families will face impossible choices between paying for health insurance or putting food on the table,” said Debbie Smith, Cover Alabama campaign director at Alabama Arise. “These are small business owners, older adults and working families who can’t absorb a hike in premiums. Congress has the power to prevent this crisis.”
The expiring subsidies could also create a generally sicker, uninsured population if people currently enrolled in the Affordable Care Act can no longer afford their premiums after the tax credits expire, McGough said.
“If these tax credits were to go away, enrollment is expected to decline,” McGough said in an interview. “A lot of people who have joined the marketplaces over the past few years may decide that they can assume the risk of no longer having health insurance and become uninsured, leaving a sicker, higher cost pool of people that insurers have to cover, thus driving health care costs.”

How can I save money?

Williams and McGough said that a complex issue like rising health costs has an equally complex solution that is completely out of their hands. Even with the rise of costs, however, Williams said the most practical way to say money is to invest in preventative care.
“The best medicine is preventative medicine,” Williams said. “So the more we can keep people well, the better off we’re going to be from a cost perspective. Even though sometimes that means we spend more money up front to make sure people are getting appropriately screened, and vaccines and all the things they need to stay healthy, making sure people are doing their wellness checks. Those kinds of things aren’t free, but can save a whole lot of money in the long run.”
Beyond eating healthy and exercising regularly, Williams also encouraged preventative screening for various cancers, getting vaccinated and getting routine bloodwork.
“If somebody’s blood pressure is getting elevated and they don’t know it, that can lead to strokes and heart attacks and all kinds of really awful things,” she said. “If we caught that sooner, we could have addressed it and it wouldn’t have been a problem.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/waitingforcare2025-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

If you're using a big share and it's more cost-effective, then that's going to need to be the target,"" said a co-author of the study. (Photo: Bureau of Reclamation Flickr, CC BY-SA 2.0)The most cost-effective and quickest way to conserve the Colorado River’s shrinking water supply amid persistent drought and rapid population growth is changing how states handle the largest use of water on the river: agriculture.
Agriculture uses about 80% of the river’s water, but the good news is that paying farmers not to use water allotted to them has proved to be remarkably cost-effective. 
That’s according to a comprehensive study examining 462 federally funded Colorado River conservation and supply projects using available spending data from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. 
The study, published in the Journal of the American Water Resources Association last week, was conducted by UC Riverside’s School of Public Policy in partnership with the Utah Rivers Council.
The water projects examined – ranging from large-scale infrastructure such as reservoirs and wastewater treatment plants to agricultural water use – totaled about $1 billion in federal funding between 2004 and 2024.
“How much water is actually being saved for every dollar we are spending?” asks Mehdi Nemati, an assistant professor of public policy, co-author of the study. “If we want to be more efficient or gain more water saved per dollar spent, then answering this question matters.”
“The big message is not all water savings are equal. Some projects saved water at a fraction of the cost of others,” he continued. 
Agricultural conservation programs conserved water for as low as $69.89 per acre-foot. On average, agricultural conservation programs cost about $417 per acre-foot, while local supply projects —such as reservoirs, wells, and wastewater treatment facilities—cost more than $2,400 per acre-foot on average. (An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover one acre of land to a depth of one foot, or about 325,851 gallons.)
“Spending money to conserve water within the agriculture sector seems to be one of the most cost-effective ways. There’s also a lot of room to improve and save more water in this sector,” Nemati said. “About 80% of the water goes to agriculture. If you’re using a big share and it’s more cost-effective, then that’s going to need to be the target.”
Historically, farmers have been reluctant to lower their water use out of fear the government might take their water permanently. But the study found that agricultural conservation programs, particularly those that provided financial incentives to promote behavioral changes among farmers, were successful at delivering water savings at a relatively low cost.
The most common type of agricultural conservation program was paying farmers who rely on the Colorado River to reduce their water use on crops during certain non-critical periods, saving an average of 747 acre-feet per year at a cost of about $140 per acre-foot.
Paying farmers to temporarily leave their fields empty – particularly for water-intensive crops like alfalfa – produced an average annual water saving of 17,500 acre-feet per year at an average cost of about $193 per acre-foot, according to the study.
“Grass, alfalfa, corn pasture, these are all water intensive crops. That’s where we get our most savings per dollar, and there is huge room for savings. I would say these are low hanging fruit,” Nemati said.
Other programs studied paid farmers to replace flood irrigation with precision methods such as drip or sprinkler systems, which demonstrated substantial efficiency improvements while maintaining agricultural productivity.
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spent about 30% of water conservation funding between 2004 and 2024 on agricultural projects.
Agricultural conservation projects had an average lifespan of about three years, meaning once those short-term projects end water savings are expected to gradually decline. 
Water-intensive crops are where the savings are
Much of the funding used to pay farmers to conserve Colorado River water was provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which helped double agricultural water conservation from 1.5 million acre-feet of water to over 3 million acre-feet of water, according to the study.
Water recycling and treatment facilities also proved to be a cost-effective way to conserve substantial amounts of water in the long-term, despite higher initial construction costs. Water recycling and treatment facilities had an average lifetime cost of $385 per acre-feet with an average annual water savings of about 18,600 acre-feet.
Despite the large potential for water savings through water reuse projects, only about 7% of the bureau’s water conservation funding was spent on reuse projects. California got the lion’s share of that funding, about 80%. Upper Basin states received only 4% of reuse funding, while Tribal areas received no funding. 
There’s a lot of room for improvement in water recycling across states that rely on the Colorado River. One recent study found that Upper Basin states – Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico – recycled less than 5% of their water, as compared to Lower Basin states – California, Arizona and Nevada– which recycled more than 30% of their water.
The study also revealed a major disparity in federal funding for water conservation projects between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin states.
Between 2004 and 2024, Upper Basin states only received about 6% of overall water conservation spending by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, while about 75% was directed to the Lower Basin, and about 19% was designated for Tribal areas, some of which extend across both regions.
Nevada received nearly $6 million for 28 water conservation projects for an average annual savings of roughly 1,500 acre-feet at a cost of about $3,800 per acre-foot. 
It’s a stark contrast to Upper Basin states like Colorado, which received about $610,000 in federal funding for 47 water conservation projects for an average annual savings of about 2,100 acre-feet at a cost of about $285 per acre-foot. 
It’s an example of how federal dollars could be more efficiently used to conserve water across the Colorado River Basin by rethinking funding priorities.
“In some areas in Nevada there has been tremendous investment in the urban side and efficiency gains in the urban side. But if you’re looking at the lowest dollar per acre feet, water-intensive crops are the areas we want to target,” Nemati said.
“There are areas in the Upper Basin that could save water for a fraction of money being used in Nevada or southern California,” he said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/52627025695_ab463b4dc5_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

Now, Californians and Hawaiians alike can search through every word uttered in public hearings, every dollar given to a politician, every bill introduced and every vote taken in their state legislatures.


CalMatters’ innovative Digital Democracy project is now bringing government transparency to other states, starting with Hawaiʻi. On Sept. 21,  Digital Democracy Hawaiʻi launched in partnership with the Honolulu Civil Beat.
Now, just like Californians, Hawaiians have the power to search through every word uttered in public hearings, every dollar given to a politician, every bill introduced, every vote taken and more in Hawaiʻi’s Legislature. In California, having that level of transparency and data has powered dozens of CalMatters stories.
“We believe the eyes of everyday citizens on the public process will encourage legislators to make better, more thoughtful decisions based on what the people want, not what legislative leaders, lobbyists or other powerful interest groups tell them to do,” wrote Civil Beat Executive Editor-in-Chief Amy Pyle and Ideas Editor Patti Epler about the launch.
CalMatters’ key Digital Democracy funders, the Knight Foundation and Arnold Ventures, are making it possible for CalMatters to bring Digital Democracy to other states.
Already, Digital Democracy Hawaiʻi has triggered the Hawaiʻi State Ethics Commission to fix its state campaign finance data.
A CalMatters Digital Democracy engineer found that a third of the data entries from the state’s campaign finance data were duplicates. After further investigation and contacting the ethics commission, the public data on the commission’s website has been fixed. Colleagues at Civil Beat said that we’ve “helped the entire citizenry” before launch.
And the impact of Digital Democracy California continues to grow.
Most recently, the data behind Digital Democracy powered our personalized My Legislator newsletter, which told Californians what their California state legislators said, voted on, introduced and more every single week. My Legislator ran a beta version for four weeks and is returning in January when the state legislature reconvenes.
People used the newsletter as:

An impetus to contact their legislators, asking about why they voted (and didn’t) on specific legislation.

Credit cards, debit cards, cash, checks, wires or sending money to others using a P2P (person-to-person) payment app are examples of the many ways consumers can pay for everyday transactions. To help protect their money from scammers, it’s important for people to understand that how they pay matters, especially when buying something from someone they don’t know or trust.
Here are some examples of common scams impacting payment types:
Checks:
Although declining in usage, many people still regularly use checks, particularly for business transactions. Check fraud can happen in various ways, such as writing bad checks, stealing and altering someone else’s check, forging a check, or depositing the same check twice (once through a mobile app and again at a branch).

Here’s What You Can Do: Never make checks out to “cash.”  Use permanent ink and write the amount in numbers and words. Don’t leave a check book unattended and always send a check directly from the post office or through secured mailboxes; don’t leave them for pickup in your mailbox at home. When possible, opt for electronic payment methods instead of checks.

Person-to-Person Payments:
Person-to-person payments through services like Zelle® can be quick and convenient ways to send money to others you know and trust (e.g., friends and family or your dogwalker). Don’t use Zelle to buy things online, especially through social media marketplaces or messaging apps. If you send money for something that turns out to be a scam, it’s very unlikely you’ll be able to get it back.

Here’s What You Can Do: If you are purchasing goods or merchandise, including things like concert tickets, a credit or debit card that offers purchase protection may be a better option. If at any time you feel pressured, the deal seems too good to be true, or you otherwise suspect it’s a scam, don’t proceed with the purchase.

Credit and Debit Cards:
When you pay with a credit or debit card, you are not responsible for unauthorized charges if your card is lost, stolen or fraudulently used, as long as you report unauthorized charges promptly. Use your card’s security features to help keep it safe.

Here’s What You Can Do: Two-factor authentication can help block anyone who gets your banking information from using it, and setting up credit monitoring helps you know if your card is used fraudulently. Keep your card safe. If you misplace it or think it is lost or stolen, contact your bank immediately, and lock your card from additional charges.

Scammers may try to get you to send a payment to them to pay for something (like concert tickets) that you then never receive. Credit and debit cards may offer some protections that can help you get your money back for purchases you make if you don’t receive what you paid for. If you pay with a credit card, your bank will likely reimburse you for your payment if you don’t receive the goods. If you paid with a debit card, your bank will try to get your money back from the scammer’s bank, but if the scammer has disappeared with your money, they won’t be able to get the funds back, and your bank is not required to reimburse you.

Here’s What You Can Do: Watch out for sellers who require forms of payment that do not provide purchase protection. Before you pay, always ask yourself: “Am I sure this is not a scam?” Always remember: If you’re unsure, walk away.

Wire Transfers:
Wire transfers are convenient and secure, and they work like cash. Only send a wire when you know the details of the recipient and never feel pressured or urged to send one. Wire transfers are a target for scammers because they are often used for high dollar transactions—like homes or cars—and once sent, they cannot be reversed. Scammers can impersonate companies, banks, and government agencies to quickly receive your hard-earned money, move it to another account and disappear. 

Here’s What You Can Do: Never provide your bank account details to unfamiliar or suspicious individuals and avoid wiring money to people or businesses you are unfamiliar with, especially if prompted by suspicious phone calls or emails. 

In a world of growing payment options, it’s important that people make informed choices about how to pay for purchases, especially when buying from a person or business you aren’t familiar with, to help keep their money safe.

“Self-deport” is how our leaders describe people without legal status choosing to leave the country. It implies they did so freely, with no coercion.
And it’s nonsense, as the hell that descended on two Alabama immigrants shows.

University of Alabama graduate student Alireza Doroudi went to Iran after Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him in March. Giovanna Hernandez-Martinez went to Mexico after Leeds police sent her to ICE this summer
But let’s not pretend either choice was voluntary. Officials kept Doroudi, who had no criminal record, locked in a jail in Louisiana. There, his mental health, hearing and vision deteriorated. The Trump administration eventually acknowledged that it had no evidence for the charge against him.
Yet the judge overseeing the matter, Maithe Gonzalez, refused to release Doroudi on bond. Gonzalez inexplicably and cruelly ordered another hearing in his case. Again, the Trump administration said it could not back the charge against Doroudi.
Doroudi decided to go back to Iran. This was not a choice. It was a rational reaction to a dadaesque application of the rule of law, in which procedure counts more than justice.
Hernandez-Martinez also lacked a criminal record. Far from being a threat to the public, she was improving this state by mentoring youth looking to go to college. But her family told al.com that after being held for weeks, she went to Mexico due in part to a lack of health care in the place where she had been detained.
Hernandez-Martinez came to the United States as a child, just under the cutoff for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which otherwise might have protected her.
“I am struggling to accept that I have left behind my family,” she wrote in a Facebook post last week. “My rock. My friends, loved ones, my community. I am grieving a life I lived since I was 7 years old.”
Only the most crazed racist could see either person as a threat. Doroudi was studying mechanical engineering at the University of Alabama. Hernandez-Martinez earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Jacksonville State University.
And yet our government forced them behind bars. They languished there for weeks on the thinnest pretexts. They “chose” to leave the country in the same way that a mugging victim “chooses” to give their wallet to a gunman.
Doroudi and Hernandez-Martinez were not the problem. The law is.
Alabamians who smirk and shrug at these injustices like to tell us that you have to immigrate “the right way.” There will be no problem, they tell us, if you just follow the law.
So I went to the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services website on Tuesday to search the wait times for immigrant visas.
For an I-140 — an immigrant petition for alien workers — the wait was over a year for those classified as unskilled workers.
For an I-130 — a petition for permanent residency for a spouse or a child considered an “alien relative” — the site said 80% of cases would be processed in 97.5 months.
That’s a little over eight years. Forcing people to wait a decade to live with their children? It’s a legal process that discourages people from using the legal process.
And that doesn’t account for processing fees, legal expenses, or the ambushes ICE sets for people trying to follow legal paths to residency. The government makes it next-to-impossible for the vast majority of people who want to immigrate to do so “the right way.”
Nearly all of us have ancestors who came to the United States to find a better life. I guarantee that the government forced few if any of your forebears to live outside the law, or to submit to official thuggery.
Those of you who claim to care about legal processes but have zero interest in making legal immigration feasible should tell us which immigrants deserve legal protections and which do not.
Because it looks to me that the laws governing who gets to be in the country are little more than tools to harm people at the margins for the pleasure of the sadistic or the narrow-minded.
How else do you explain how a woman mentoring Alabama teenagers got thrown in a jail cell? What cynical, violent sophistry can sucker you into believing that makes Alabama a better place?
What kind of soulless automaton thinks an expired visa warrants six weeks in detention and slow torture from neglect?
Our immigration system has cost us two Alabamians who were doing a lot of good. And if you think those cases exemplify law and justice, I’ve got another Orwellian word for you: doublethink.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

Alabama College Application Week runs through Friday and will allow high school seniors to apply to certain colleges and universities at no charge.
The Alabama State Department of Education said in a news release Wednesday the initiative started over a decade ago to increase the number of students, especially those who would be first generation and low-income students, enrolling in postsecondary education.

“During this event, local high schools will be hosting special college application celebrations with students submitting applications to colleges nationwide,” Monica P. Mack, the coordinator of the Alabama College Application Campaign (ALCAC) said in the statement. “Last year, more than 300 Alabama schools participated and nearly 30,000 students applied to colleges nationwide.”
Chandra Scott, executive director for Alabama Possible, a nonprofit organization that works to “break down barriers to prosperity in Alabama through education, collaboration, and advocacy,” said in a statement Friday the initiative benefits the entire state.
“In Alabama, it’s common for public universities to charge $30–$50 per application fee. When a student applies to multiple colleges—say, 5 or 6—the total fees can quickly climb into the hundreds of dollars, which may discourage some from casting a wide enough net in their college search,” she said. “When more students apply, more students enroll and ultimately, more Alabamians are equipped with the education and skills our state needs for long-term prosperity.”
Jim Purcell, executive director of the Alabama Commission on Higher Education, said in a statement Friday the week allows for equal opportunities in postsecondary education.
“Application fees can be a real barrier for many students and families as they consider their postsecondary options. [Alabama College Application Week] is an important initiative that helps remove that barrier and encourages more students to take that critical first step toward their educational goals,” he said. “By waiving application fees, institutions send a strong message that college is accessible and that every student should have the opportunity to apply without financial hesitation.”
The Cash for College FAFSA initiative, Alabama College Application Campaign and Decision Day were combined into a single campaign, Alabama Goes to College, to help more K-12 students apply for college and complete their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) application.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-06 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Breaking down the problem with sewer overflows in Connecticut,John Moritz and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/06/connecticut-river-untreated-sewage/,CT's combined wastewater systems discharged more than 1.2 billion gallons of wastewater overflows in 2024. Here's what to know.,"A stinky situation in Massachusetts is starting to irritate the senses of politicians in Hartford.
In recent months, Connecticut lawmakers have pointed fingers at their northern neighbor — and each other — over the issue of sewer systems overflowing into the Connecticut River, which runs through the middle of both states on its way to Long Island Sound.
Fed up with complaints from constituents about raw sewage floating down the river, Reps. Tami Zawistowski, R-East Granby, and Devin Carney, R-Lyme, wrote to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last month asking it to intervene to improve water quality monitoring, discharge alerts and the outdated infrastructure responsible for sending millions of gallons of “contaminated water” into the river.
Those comments drew a rebuke from Democrats, who accused their colleagues of painting an inaccurate picture of the problem. 
Overflows are usually triggered by heavy rains that overwhelm outdated sewer and wastewater infrastructure, they noted. The resulting discharge, while it may contain some untreated sewage, is mostly made up of rain.
“As residents of this district know all too well, the Connecticut River has a history of becoming unsafe for swimming and fishing, particularly after significant rainstorms,” Rep. John Santanella, D-Enfield, said in a press release. “That is a longstanding fact. But what is not true are the exaggerated claims suggesting that millions of gallons of raw sewage are being dumped into the river during these weather events.”
If you’re wondering what causes sewer overflows, and whether you should be worried about their impact on water quality, here’s what to know.
Why are sewer pipes overflowing?
When the first municipal wastewater systems were developed during the 1800s, they collected everything from household sewage and industrial waste to rainwater into a single network of pipes which then deposited that untreated mix into the nearest river or other body of water.
The next century saw the development of treatment plants to clean wastewater prior to discharge. These combined sewer systems, however, still may become overwhelmed during large storms, necessitating additional overflow pipes to prevent the mixture of sewage and rain from backing up and flooding local homes and businesses.
Historically, Connecticut had as many as 13 combined sewer systems that would occasionally spill over into local waterways.
In 1987, the state established the Clean Water Fund within the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to assist municipalities with wastewater projects. Since then, the state has invested more than $5.3 billion to reduce the number of combined systems down to four: Hartford, which discharges into the Connecticut River, and Norwich, Bridgeport and New Haven, which release into local rivers and the Sound.
Additionally, the mostly-separated wastewater systems in Waterbury and Norwalk have a small number of locations from which overflows still occur.
The remaining combined systems are required to submit plans to DEEP outlining what steps they are taking to reduce overflows. The biggest of those projects currently underway involves digging a four-mile-long tunnel in South Hartford capable of holding 41 million gallons of storm-related overflows. Afterwards, that wastewater will be slowly released from the tunnel into the city’s sewage treatment facility.
The tunnel project is expected to be completed next year at a cost of over $500 million. 
How often do they overflow?
Connecticut’s combined wastewater systems discharged more than 1.2 billion gallons of wastewater overflows in 2024, according to data collected by DEEP. 
The state’s largest source of overflows is the combined system in Hartford, which released 796.8 million gallons of wastewater into the Connecticut River last year. That was more than the entire volume of overflows reported by three systems in Massachusetts that also discharge wastewater into the river: Chicopee, Holyoke and Springfield.
Local critics, however, have pointed to ongoing improvement efforts, such as the Hartford tunnel project, to argue that Connecticut is taking a more proactive approach toward minimizing overflows. 
“I feel a little more confident doing more finger pointing now because Connecticut is ahead of Massachusetts,” Zawistowski said.
Will Healey, a spokesman for DEEP, called overflows a “state, regional, and national issue,” and said the agency is working closely with its counterparts in Massachusetts as well as the EPA’s regional offices in Boston to reduce their impact along the Connecticut River.
In western Massachusetts, officials currently have $15.2 million invested in sewer separation projects and upgrades to water treatment facilities, according to Fabienne Alexis, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Environmental Protection.
“Through municipal partnerships and billions of dollars in investments, we are working to update aging infrastructure, construct underground storage, and expand nature-based solutions to mitigate stormwater impacts,” Alexis said. “These projects are expensive and proposed federal funding cuts unfortunately threaten long-awaited progress to eliminate combined sewer overflows.” 
Should I be concerned?
While most of the discharge from overflows is made up of rain, officials do caution that the presence of untreated sewage and other pollutants raises serious environmental and public health concerns.
“You do not want to go in the water when there’s combined sewer overflows happening because there’s untreated, or partially treated sewage going in,” said Bill Lucey, the Soundkeeper for the environmental nonprofit Save the Sound.
In addition to the risks for humans, Lucey said that the overflows from combined systems can lead to harmful algae blooms or an excess of nitrogen and other nutrients in Long Island Sound.
For years, he said, the group has been pushing lawmakers to approve funding for an electronic alert system that will notify swimmers, fishermen and boaters whenever an overflow has impacted water quality within a specific area. Similar systems already exist in New York and Massachusetts.
DEEP currently publishes information about sewer overflows on its website as well as the social media platform X.
Zawistowski said the overarching concern from her constituents has to do with visible amounts of sewage floating down the river, and occasionally washing up in areas such as the Windsor Locks Canal State Park.
“It’s been a problem for years, but its being paid attention to now,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tunnel-boring-machine-crane-lowering-into-tunnel-1024x576.png,,,2025-10-06 07:57:30.276618

The trial, which is expected continue through much of October, is the culmination of a nearly four-year investigation into Diamantis, a former Democratic lawmaker who climbed to the highest levels of the state government before he became the target of the federal criminal probe in late 2021.
The 16 jurors and alternates, who were chosen Friday, are expected to hear from a host of witnesses involved in Connecticut’s construction industry, as well as several current and former government officials.
As the jurors learned last week, they may also hear testimony from Connecticut’s sitting Democratic governor, Ned Lamont.
During his first term, Lamont promoted Diamantis to the position of deputy director of the state’s Office of Policy and Management.
But Lamont later fired Diamantis from that job in October 2021, after investigators subpoenaed the state for a long list of records related to Diamantis and several public building projects he oversaw.  
[The Kosta Diamantis timeline: What you need to know]
Federal prosecutors officially charged Diamantis last year with 22 federal counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators, and they alleged that he set up a pay-to-play scheme within Connecticut’s school construction office.
The indictment filed in the case alleged that several construction officials provided cash and checks, as well as a job and tuition money for Diamantis’ daughters, in return for him steering lucrative contracts to their companies. 
As the investigation advanced in recent years, Diamantis repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and he insisted that he saved state and local taxpayers millions of dollars while overseeing the school construction program for more than six years.
Diamantis’ attorney, Norm Pattis, said last week that his client also intends to take the witness stand during trial to testify in his own defense.
If he does, that testimony could open Diamantis up to cross examination from federal prosecutors, who have spent years sweeping up evidence from banks, the state government, school construction companies, local school officials and Diamantis’ own cell phone.
In court records, the U.S. Attorney’s office has cited numerous text messages in which Diamantis allegedly demanded money from contractors and threatened to boot them from the construction projects if they didn’t pay up.
“Bottom line, have him give you 40 for Monday or he is out,” Diamantis wrote in one such message. 
Three construction officials who pleaded guilty to bribing Diamantis last year are also expected take the witness stand during the early days of the trial. 
Prosecutors are expected to portray Diamantis as a powerful, and vindictive, state official who had unfettered control over billions of dollars in state grants that were awarded to school projects all over the state.
And they will attempt to prove that he used his authority to manipulate local officials and other construction firms into hiring the companies that were secretly paying him and his daughter. 
Prosecutors intend to put several local municipal officials on the stand who will testify that Diamantis pressured and coerced them into hiring his preferred contractors.
It’s unclear what Diamantis’ strategy will be during the trial, but Pattis, Diamantis’ attorney, announced on the eve of the trial that he intended to place Lamont on the witness stand as part of that defense.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0228_SR_FederalCourtKosta_064-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 07:57:30.276618

Still, the university is at a difficult crossroads. Enrollment is down nearly 20% over the past six years across all of the university’s campuses. State and federal cuts are adding to financial pressure, and more tuition hikes could be on the way.
The WSU Board of Regents held a meeting in mid-September in which they discussed enrollment trends, costs of attending the Pullman-based university and heard new President Elizabeth Cantwell’s plans to turn the school around.
“This is the beginning of what we are calling redesigning the WSU system for the future,” Cantwell told the regents on Sept. 18. “This process will take about a year.”
On the flagship Pullman campus, total enrollment dropped from 20,976 students in the fall of 2019 to 16,248 this fall, the school said. That’s a loss of more than 4,700 students.
Including its branch campuses in Spokane, the Tri-Cities, Vancouver and Everett, WSU total enrollment has fallen from 31,607 in fall 2019 to just 25,477 this year, a drop of 6,000 students.
The rate of decline has slowed. This fall, WSU’s Pullman campus is down only about 200 students from last fall, the school said.
By contrast, the rival University of Washington has seen modest enrollment increases in recent years.
Further tuition hikes looming
Meanwhile, if the regents vote on Nov. 13 to increase tuition and fees for the 2026-27 school year, it would mark a decade of yearly increases since the state government reduced funding for higher education in 2015.
Washington State University students already face the highest mandatory costs among the state’s public institutions.
Resident undergraduates at WSU can expect to pay $13,888 for the upcoming school year in tuition and fees, according to figures provided to the regents.
The University of Washington still has the highest tuition in the state, but WSU’s mandatory fees put its total expected costs for resident students up by $486, said Leslie Brunelli, an executive vice president for finance and administration.
The proposed tuition increase does not have a set figure yet, as the maximum increase allowed will be set later by the Washington State Office of Financial Management. 
WSU officials expect the increase to be more than 3.3%. Taking the full amount would bring tuition, not counting fees, to at least $12,060 for the 2026-27 academic year.
Further complicating the issue is a 1.5% cut in state funding, or $9.9 million, compared to the 2023-25 budget. A multibillion-dollar state budget shortfall prompted the Washington Legislature to make spending cuts to a number of public institutions.
Last budgeting cycle, the state provided 66 cents of every dollar WSU needed, Brunelli told the regents. Now the state is only providing 56 cents on every dollar.
“We have a bigger gap to fill in,” Brunelli said.
Charting a new course
WSU’s new president told regents she is taking steps to deal with complex issues of enrollment, declining federal research grants and huge challenges to athletics.
Cantwell, who was hired in February to replace Kirk Schulz, also wants to change WSU’s identity. It is time for the university to shed the underdog mentality that has haunted it for years, she said.
“We are really looking at modernizing that 19th-century land-grant mission to meet 21st-century needs,” Cantwell told the regents.
Recruiting new students is one solution, but those students must remain in school.
Provost T. Chris Riley-Tillman said that for the past few years, around 20% of WSU students drop out before their second year.
Bolstering student support services, job placement programs and removing barriers to degree changes are some of the ways Cantwell hopes to ensure those arriving at WSU graduate.
One bright spot is that the number of new first-year students enrolled through WSU’s online arm, WSU Global, grew by 11% last year. Cantwell sees an opportunity for more growth there.
Research has been a key part of Cantwell’s career. She is a former Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory staff member, senior vice president of research at the University of Arizona and president of Utah State University.
By 2035, Cantwell wants to see WSU research output double.
She also wants to burnish WSU’s image, she said, because the success of the university and its students, alumni and faculty depends “on our collective identity.”
The Cougars’ brand must be celebrated and promoted, whether it is a laboratory breakthrough, athletic success, or post-graduate accomplishment, she said. 
Jolt from Pac-12 shakeup 
One key component of that image is athletics. Washington State was long a member of the prestigious Pac-12 Conference. But the Cougars and Oregon State were left behind when 10 of the Pac-12 members jumped to other conferences.
Washington State and Oregon State have succeeded in luring other schools to rebuild the Pac-12, but it is no longer considered a top-tier conference. That sharply reduces the television dollars coming to athletics.
Cantwell said major challenges ahead include raising money to pay top athletes, so they are not lured away by richer programs. 
In addition, the athletics department is nearly $100 million in the red from past decisions to improve athletic facilities and other costs.
Cantwell said the athletics budget will be closely monitored to ensure the department is hitting goals while the university looks for other ways to raise money.
“We really need and will focus on cultivating a nationally competitive and character-driven athletics program,” Cantwell said.
Washington State also needs to burnish its image in western Washington, she said.
“We want to elevate WSU’s visibility in the greater Puget Sound region,” she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/washington-state-university-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 07:57:30.276618

(From Lake County Solid Waste Management District)Indiana is finalizing a new vision to manage Hoosier waste — from food, construction, technology, textiles and more — and boost the economy.
The project, spearheaded by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and British contractor Eunomia, will replace a 20-year plan that has been in force for more than three decades.
That plan “was centered on disposal and basic waste handling,” IDEM Commissioner Clint Woods said in a late August news release. “Today, we need a forward-looking plan that reflects 35 years of innovation, shifting markets, and evolving environmental priorities. … Building a circular economy can strengthen Indiana’s economic future.”
IDEM won about $600,000 from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the updates, according to the transcript of a 2023 meeting.
The plan may consider recycling requirements, commercial food waste diversion requirements and a per-ton surcharge on landfilled or incinerated waste, according to a late July meeting. That’s alongside the infrastructure investments, public education and more intended to advance the state’s goal of recycling 50% of its waste.
The final product is expected by the end of 2025. It will “act as a blueprint” for the state, solid waste management districts, industry and more, IDEM spokesman Barry Sneed said.

Local units of government can use the resulting guidelines, templates and pass-through dollars to revisit their own antiquated plans. IDEM also hopes to uplift recyclers and manufacturers using recycled goods.
“You know, 1991 was the last (plan). Think about all that’s changed,” Natalie Rodriguez, an agency spokeswoman, said at September open house. “Think about all the electronics that are now in the waste stream, and the fact that we can recycle some of that as well … It’s a commodity!”
Landfill gates lead to a lofty goal
Indiana made its first foray into solid waste regulations in 1953, when the General Assembly authorized county commissioners to establish dumps and adopt garbage-related ordinances “for the protection of public health.”
Some were burn dumps. Lawmakers enacted an air pollution law in 1961, according to an IDEM history, but federal Clean Air Act amendments four years later spurred more changes. The state banned the open burning of waste in 1969, the same year cities and towns gained the power to manage their own waste facilities.
Indiana didn’t issue its first modern landfill permit until 1974, per IDEM, or its first waste management plan until 1980. The latter was a prerequisite for continued EPA funding.
That year, Indiana had about 150 permitted landfills. Almost half of them had filled up and closed down within a decade, leaving 79 in 1990.
“Gates continue to lock on landfills … Yet we still throw away tons of recyclable materials every single day,” then-Gov. Evan Bayh wrote in the introduction to the 1991 plan, which sought to “avert a garbage crisis.”
It was one result of a sweeping law that mandated county solid waste management districts and set a 50% recycling goal for 2001.
But two decades past that deadline, the state is recycling somewhere between 9% and 15% of waste — and has just 34 landfills open, according to contractor Eunomia and a 2021 IDEM study. Districts are optional, too.

Those remaining “keep pretty attuned” to IDEM’s activities, said Carla Striegel-Winner, who leads the Dubois County Solid Waste Management District and is on the board for the Association of Indiana Solid Waste Management Districts. They go to the agency for grants, technical expertise and more — but “currently, that plan is not something that we would even think about on a day-to-day basis.”
“With it being a new plan, that could easily change,” Striegel-Winner said. 
“I see it being more the big picture,” she continued, and “as being sort of the glue that could kind of pull us together.”
Contractor’s strategy
Eunomia’s contract — worth up to $300,000 — began last October and lasts a year. At July’s online meeting, the consultant unveiled a short list of proposals that could help Indiana reach that 50% goal:

Requiring commercial food waste generators like grocery stores or restaurants to divert the surplus from landfill to alternatives like composting or donation.
Investing in sorting and processing infrastructure to increase facility capacity or improve how much material they can recover.
Investing in collection pathways, like adding drop-off sites and curbside recycling options, or hosting community collection events.
Educating Hoosiers on recycling practices and to raise awareness.
Requiring that Hoosiers separate recyclable materials from trash.
Setting interim targets for the state as it works toward the 50% goal.
Adding a per-ton surcharge to landfilled or incinerated waste.

IDEM’s Sneed noted the plan will “provide data and insight to help inform decisions” but said that any recommendations for new legislation, regulations or actions — including fees — would “be up to the appropriate rule-making bodies.”
The proposals were developed methodically.
Contractors gathered data and conducted research on Indiana’s waste management systems to create a “baseline” model of the status quo and a “business-as-usual” view of the future.
They focused on the methods and materials that would make the biggest difference. Indiana’s economy is losing out on more than $400 million annually when valuable materials like metal, plastic, paper and more are trashed instead of recovered, according to the presentation.
“By prioritizing these materials for the model, we can focus on where we can feasibly have the greatest potential impact,” Project Coordinator Iris Liu said.

The consultants also conducted surveys and interviews with stakeholders, like solid waste management districts and recyclers. IDEM staff held open houses around the state to hear from more.
They compiled a long list of ideas, then narrowed them down using a scoring sheet — with considerations like implementation costs and stakeholder pushback — and IDEM’s input.
The next step was to model the impacts of those proposals. Last is collecting it all in the state’s new plan.
Help wanted
In Dubois County, Striegel-Winner’s team is “super small.” Even as director, she does everything from answering the phones to doing payroll and even working at the site.
The county of 47,000 residents is largely rural. One processing center takes old paint, household chemicals, electronics and bulky waste. Recycling is done at eight drop-off sites for free, while trash incurs a fee.
But the logistics are challenging.
“We have a limit to the type of recycling that we can take. Those limits aren’t because that can’t be — in some way, shape or form — recycled,” Striegel-Winner said. “Those limits are because it’s not feasible to try and get that from point A to point B, where somebody would want to purchase that and … turn it into something new.”
The county can take glass, unlike others in southern Indiana. Clear and colorful glass must be separated, then stored until there’s enough to transport for recycling. Only plastics labeled 1 and 2 are accepted — also manually sorted, because there’s no specialized sorting facility nearby.
“People have to choose to do that sorting, and so we probably get a little less than if you just had a curbside bin out,” Striegel-Winner noted.
She’s interested in the prospect of sorting and processing aid.

“We do not have access to a lot of that infrastructure,” she said. “We need businesses that will set up in our area, and be able to make money from sorting our stuff. … All of that is going to be a huge improvement.”
Public education is also key.
“There’s still tons of stuff going into landfill that shouldn’t,” Striegel-Winner said. “I feel like we’ve become more of a throwaway society.”
“We get people thanking us all the time for … the time that we take with them to help them understand. They don’t know about us until they need us — and when they need us, we’re here,” she later added. “We’re here with those answers. We’re here with those recycling and disposal options.”
For others, food waste is the next frontier.
It represents a whopping 40% of the waste stream at Indiana University’s Bloomington campus, for instance. That’s according to Chief Sustainability Officer Jessica Davis, whose team advises all of IU’s campuses.
“It’s a pretty significant hit if we aren’t able to recover that, which is why we’re focused on solutions,” she said.
The Bloomington and Indianapolis locations had “pretty robust” composting programs pre-pandemic. Amid the chaos, many companies serving big institutions like IU stopped offering those services or even went out of business, per Davis.
“So, really, how can we extract the highest value out of this material ourselves?” she said. Bringing composting in-house “also kind of mitigates that risk of being overly reliant on external vendors.”
IU is piloting a food waste dehydrator purchased through a state grant. Removing the water makes it lighter and more compact, and therefore cheaper to dispose of, Davis described.
But the university is interested in using it — like for soil or biofuel. It’s already submitted another grant application to buy an in-vessel composter to speed up the decomposition.
Those efforts come in addition to a wide variety of existing programs, many of which bring financial perks alongside environmental ones.
The university’s used but serviceable items are sold back to campus, so that employees, students and community members can “go shopping” among the surplus. Huge amounts of stuff are collected from on-campus housing during the springtime move-out, and are collected for free reuse or paid surplus instead of becoming “a really big trash bill.” Recycling contracts at some campuses include a per-ton rebate, too.
Others programs are for the “mission,” Davis said, like “fix-it clinics” or free bicycle repair services in the fall and spring.
“Any skills that we can equip (students) with, even if it’s maybe an outside-of-the-classroom skill, is of value,” she continued. “… Students might have financial struggles, so if they can repair something for free or very, very cheaply, it might be just one less stressor in their life.”
The plan is also expected to include a focus on preventing waste.

“If we’re not doing something about the waste that we currently have, we’re drowning in waste,” Purdue University Professor John Sutherland said. “But, you know, if we’re trying to be smart, we should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. … We should be taking efforts to … reduce the amount that we’re generating in the first place.”
Sutherland leads the institution’s Laboratory for Sustainable Manufacturing and environmental engineering program. He’s a fan of “lean” manufacturing that cuts out unnecessary materials, motions and more in pursuit of efficiency.
“If I wait until I have waste, it’s going to cost me,” he said. “… By being smarter about the system that you create, not only do you reduce what you have to pay at the back end (for disposal) but you’ve undoubtedly saved money by using less resources.”
Government action can make unwanted behaviors more expensive. But Sutherland was confident the incentives go deeper.
“I was doing this before the regulations were there,” he said. “I was helping companies get better without (those).”
Decades ago, Sutherland helped Ford Motors eliminate expensive and dangerous metal-working fluids — along with related procurement and health costs. The move also meant less environmental remediation.
Now, his lab is working to make it easier to recycle rare earth elements, among other projects. They’re used technology from smartphones and wind turbines to medical and defense systems.
“It’s an energy security issue, right? We’re too reliant on non-domestic sources for these materials that are vital to the economy,” Sutherland said. “To me, you know, recycling and remanufacturing of the stuff that we already have here — it just makes sense.”

Members of the Paramus Visibility Brigade often show their messages from an overpass on Route 4. (Photo courtesy of Paramus Visibility Brigade)Robert Quinlan used to vent his frustration with the Trump administration at political rallies.
“The demonstrations were always energizing, maybe cathartic. But I realized that after a while, it’s the same 100 people walking around in circles, carrying their signs, showing them to each other,” the Readington retiree said. “I didn’t feel it was reaching very many people.”
Then he heard about the Visibility Brigade, in which protesters seeking a bigger impact take their dissent on the road — literally. They line highway overpasses with giant letters to form messages for the thousands of motorists hurtling by underneath. After attending one earlier this year, Quinlan was hooked, so he helped organize a brigade in Hunterdon County whose 280 members have held 24 actions since spring, usually over Route 78.
“We average about 4,000 vehicles per hour. Sometimes we’re out there for up to two hours, that’s 8,000 people,” Quinlan said. “We reach a lot more of an audience. It’s just more effective.”
Since it first formed in 2020 in Paramus, the brigade has grown into a bona fide movement — with about 270 chapters around the country — because of opposition to President Donald Trump, said Dana Glazer, one of its founding organizers. He calls the group’s actions “rush-hour resistance” and a “defibrillator for democracy.”
“There are, unfortunately, a lot of very misguided people who have been manipulated, primarily by billionaires, to do their bidding,” Glazer said. “But we’re not there for them. We’re there purely for the people who haven’t lost their minds — and are deeply concerned but maybe aren’t doing enough about it or are pretending like it’s not happening — to remind them that A, they’re not alone, and that B, we all have a role to play in this.”

Recent messages have addressed everything from Trump’s military deployments (NO TROOPS IN CITIES! in Cape May) to immigration crackdowns (STOP ICE CRUELTY in Newton, Massachusetts) to comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension (BAN FASCISTS NOT COMEDIANS in Spokane, Washington).
Chapters come up with their own messages.
“I think of this as a giant creative art project,” Glazer said. “There’s a degree of poetry involved. Words have power. They have a magic to them. We only have a very few words to put forth, and we debate them very vigorously.”
Sometimes, participants aim to educate, as the Paramus group did in July in alerting motorists that the Trump administration plans to detain migrants at Fort Dix with the message “STOP FORT DIX CONCENTRATION CAMP.”
Occasionally, they go for humor in messages Glazer dubs “laughterism,” like May’s “MAKE NAZIS AFRAID AGAIN” and April’s “HEGSETH LEAK NEEDS PLUMBER” after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared classified material in an unsecured group chat.
One popular message riffs on German theologian Martin Niemöller’s famous “First They Came” quote condemning the complicity of those who failed to challenge the Nazis during the Holocaust. “1ST THEY CAME FOR IMMIGRANTS,” Ann Arbor, Michigan, participants messaged in May. “THEN THEY CAME FOR A MAYOR,” the Paramus group messaged the same month, after federal authorities arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside a migrant jail in his city.
The group prohibits profanity or any calls for violence.
“The idea is to activate people and engage them, not to repel them,” Glazer said.
The overpass signs aren’t exclusively about Trump. Earlier this year, the group in Paramus touted its support of Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, who was one of six Democrats seeking his party’s nomination for governor in June. Last week, the groups announced they would launch a statewide effort supporting Democrat Mikie Sherrill’s gubernatorial bid.
Their activism occasionally irks opponents, who sometimes report them to police or more often shout things like “get a job!” as they pass. Organizers hold regular de-escalation trainings, urging participants to avoid confrontations with critics by seeking help from police if they persist, Glazer said. He said the brigade actions require courage as political violence escalates, a theme that shows up in some messaging like “BE BRAVE WITH US.”
“What we’re doing on the overpass, every time, is an act of bravery,” he said. “There’s a targeting aspect to this, a degree of safety that’s involved. It’s a paradox — this is the Visibility Brigade, and we’re trying to be as visible as possible. At the same time, we have families. We have to be thoughtful about their safety.”

Despite such fears, a majority of New Jersey residents support people taking their political concerns to the street in protests and rallies, with 80% of voters surveyed last fall regarding them as “always” or “sometimes” justified, said Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University.
She does not think they move the needle much at the ballot box.
“They really are much more about symbolism and participating in the political process in some way, more than they are about really convincing voters,” Koning said.
Richard Krasney of West Orange said the bridge actions give him an outlet for his fears that Democratic leaders haven’t done enough to oppose Trump’s actions.
“My parents had Vietnam, and my grandparents had World War II. My generation really has never faced a war before. I’ve never ‘served my country before,’ so to speak, quote, unquote,” he said. “I felt like this was my country needing me to step forward to do something, and this was what I felt like I was drawn to do.”
For Pamela Lynn Brause of Hunterdon County, it’s how the administration carries out its policy priorities that really rankles. Brause, who’s an attorney, said Trump has an unacceptable contempt for courts and the rule of law. She regards many of his actions as “an authoritarian power grab.”
“I don’t want you taking somebody off the street because they have to ask for a glass of water in Spanish,” Brause said. “If you believe that a person is here illegally and that there should be deportation proceedings, file the proceedings in court. Give the person due process and have a judicial determination. Snatching people off the street and leaving their little kids behind is not what we want.”
Quinlan, a retired police chief, seconded that sentiment. He pointed out that Trump vowed during his campaign to deport “the worst of the worst,” such as undocumented immigrants who commit crimes.
“I don’t think many people would oppose that. Instead, masked ICE agents have aggressively pursued hard-working, decent people with no criminal record, leaving their families without the breadwinner. It’s just all so un-American,” Quinlan said.
He has friends from various marginalized groups who have felt unsafe and even fled the country as anti-immigrant rhetoric ramps up, he said.
“My parents had close personal friends who were Japanese Americans. They were naturalized citizens, yet they were rounded up and placed in internment camps near the West Coast during World War II. What we’re witnessing now is no different. The country is just demonizing a different group of people,” he added.
As more people join the brigade, members have experimented with expanding the idea of visibility, including with “Crush ICE” car caravans to condemn Trump’s deportation policies. In Hunterdon, Quinlan plans to stick with overpass messaging.
Holding a sign on a bridge might not convert those passing by, as politics becomes increasingly polarized, he conceded. But that’s not the point, he said.
“People drive along the highway, listening to often terrible news from around the country, from the White House, from different places, and they look up and they see us — and we give them hope,” he said. “That’s our real mission.”

This is a change from previous language, which required “fair, courteous, and respectful treatment” from Michigan judges. The order came seven months after the rule was initially put forward by the court for public comment, and did not include any concurring or dissenting opinions.
The final rule is less specific than the initially proposed version, which included a long list of protected characteristics: “race, color, sex, gender identity or expression, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, height, weight, sexual orientation, marital status, familial status, socioeconomic status, [and] political affiliation.” It is based on the American Bar Association’s Model Rule 2.3 — these model rules are designed to provide guidance to judges and lawyers around the country. 
The proposed rule change, which had been paired with another proposal to change attorney conduct rules to similarly include anti-bias and anti-harassment rules against specific protected classes, drew strong criticism during its open comment period, especially from Christian and Catholic legal groups that took issue with language that would require both judges and attorneys to respect LGBTQ+ identities. 
The Catholic Lawyers Society of Metropolitan Detroit, for example, criticized the requirement in the rule to align with “gender ideology [that] is incompatible with the Catholic faith.”
But some groups, like Citizens for Racial Equity in Washtenaw, expressed strong support for the rules, writing, “These amendments represent critical steps toward creating a more equitable judicial system by explicitly prohibiting bias, prejudice, and harassment based on protected characteristics.”
The attorney conduct rules were not included in this final decision by the Supreme Court, with those changes to the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct being “held for further consideration by the Court,” the order notes. Those are based on the American Bar Association’s Model Rule 8.4(g), which has garnered controversy in the legal profession, especially in conservative legal spaces. 
Many of the comments submitted in opposition to the changes noted potential First Amendment issues with the proposal, with a number singling out the attorney conduct rules that have yet to be decided on. The Christian Legal Society argued that it would impose a “speech code” on lawyers, while the Diocese of Lansing wrote that it would “impermissibly regulate speech and infringe the free exercise of religion.” 










“These amendments represent critical steps toward creating a more equitable judicial system by explicitly prohibiting bias, prejudice, and harassment based on protected characteristics.”


– Citizens for Racial Equity in Washtenaw


And it’s not just Christian groups expressing concerns — the Council on American-Islamic Relations Michigan wrote that the proposal was “threatening to discipline judges and attorneys who express or act upon sincerely held religious beliefs.”
According to Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ+ legal advocacy organization, Michigan had previously been one of just three states without any specific bias or harassment language in its judicial code of conduct, along with Alabama and North Carolina. It will now join Arkansas, Louisiana, and Virginia as the four states that have only general anti-bias language without any reference to specific groups.
OUTreach, a student-led pro bono law project at the University of Michigan Law School centered on the LGBTQ+ community, also submitted a comment in favor of the changes. 
“By accepting the outlined changes, Michigan will put itself on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment to all its citizens,” the group wrote. “While the proposed rules are slightly more expansive, they indicate the Court’s commitment to equitable justice for all people and the evolving standards of respect within our society.”
Justice Brian Zahra, the only GOP- nominated justice on the court, would have declined to publish the proposal for comment at all, the initial proposal notes. 
It marks the second change to judicial conduct rules in Michigan focused on inclusivity, after a 2023 order from the Supreme Court required judges to address defendants, litigants, attorneys and others in court by the pronouns and salutation that they select. 
That change also provoked backlash, especially from conservative and Christian groups.

(Getty Images)Many hard-working Hoosiers will be in for sticker shock when they start shopping for next year’s health coverage in the individual marketplace. For the past several years, thousands of Hoosiers have been able to afford coverage thanks to a temporary life line: enhanced premium tax credits to purchase coverage under the Affordable Care Act. This meant that monthly premium payments were much more affordable. 
Open enrollment for health coverage in the marketplace for 2026 begins soon. But these enhanced credits are set to expire at the end of this year. We all see the headlines about budget disagreements and we’re now in a government shutdown. But unless Congress acts soon to extend the enhanced credit, premium costs could spike for thousands of individuals and families.
Who will be affected? 
Approximately 300,000 Hoosiers get their insurance through the individual marketplace. They have this option because they are unable to get coverage through an employer-sponsored plan or they are not eligible for programs like Medicare or the Healthy Indiana Plan. Think small business owners like barbers and caterers. Entrepreneurs just getting started. And farmers, already squeezed by global trade disruptions.
What will be the effect?
In a nutshell, costs will rise. Using KFF’s calculator, you can estimate what the average change in premium costs will be. Here are a couple of examples of what we can expect:

A family of 4 in Indianapolis earning around $70,000/year could see a $265 per month increase to insure mom and dad. 
A small business employee in Logansport earning around $30,000/year could see a $113 per month increase.

For many families, affordable coverage has been the difference between having a doctor to call, getting prescriptions filled, or skipping care altogether. And in balancing rent, utilities bills, and groceries, it’s not unreasonable to expect people will forego coverage. We could also see a significant increase in individual and family medical debt.
It’s not just the individual families that will face hardship. Skyrocketing premiums could be a drag on our state’s economy by increasing the rate of insured workers. Evidence shows that without health coverage, workers are less productive and have more sick days. And when people don’t have health coverage, local hospitals and health care providers face greater financial uncertainty.
What can be done?
The solution is simple. Congress can extend the enhanced premium tax credits. But, time is running out. With open enrollment starting around November 1st, individuals will start having to decide what they can and cannot afford.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-939048116-1024x683-1-700x467-1.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 07:57:30.276618

As an early 20s college student, Stephenson was Hortman’s 2004 campaign manager. 
As caucus leader, Stephenson will have to work with Republicans in the 67-67 tied House if the Democrats hope to pass any legislation, while also charting a path to majority in the 2026 election. 
The issue of the moment is gun control. Gov. Tim Walz has publicly called for a special legislative session following the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church that killed two children and wounded many more. The special session looks increasingly unlikely but Stephenson — who is also a Hennepin County prosecutor — said his caucus is unified in passing an assault weapons ban because every member was impacted by Hortman’s death. 
“Our caucus is entirely constituted of survivors of gun violence,” Stephenson said. 
Hortman and her husband Mark were killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home in a political assassination by a man who was targeting Democratic elected officials and abortion rights advocates, prosecutors say. 
The Reformer recently sat down with Stephenson to learn more about his background, how he plans to lead House Democrats in Hortman’s wake and what can be done to make life more affordable for Minnesotans.
So nobody knows who you are. Why don’t you tell Minnesotans how you came to this point. What are some essential things about you?
I grew up a mile down the road from the house I live in now. I’m a lifelong Minnesotan. I grew up in a middle-class family. My parents were small business owners, medical sales, surgical sales.
I got interested in politics late in high school. Inspired by Paul Welstone. It was a hard time in some ways for me growing up. 
In 2023, I came out as bisexual, and when I was growing up that was not a safe thing, and it came with a feeling of powerlessness. The thing that attracted me to Wellstone was the fact that this was a guy whose entire political career was organized around the idea that people without power could have power if they work together — grassroots organizing. 
Melissa Hortman represented the district I grew up in. I saw that Melissa’s campaign was just her doing it all herself, and so I had this idea that if I could get a few of my buddies together, we could go to Melissa Hortman or someone else and say, “Hey, we’ll work for you full time. You don’t have to pay us, but you gotta make me your campaign manager.” Melissa would say later, “I had lost twice, and I was crazy enough to try anything, and so did these kids.” The year George W. Bush was reelected, she won the district by 402 votes.
Why did you want to be the next DFL House leader?
When you think about this time, it really calls upon us all to do whatever we can do to make it better, and that call to service that’s something that Melissa Hortman felt her entire life, and something that I have reflected on a lot in the time since she died. I think it calls upon us all to just pick up a shovel and get to work. And that’s what I intend to do.
What’s the work? 
There’s a lot. Right now, we’re talking about gun violence, but you look at the challenges Minnesotans are facing — with affordability, with housing, with prescription drugs, with class sizes and schools — it’s all around you. There’s so much to do.
Well, you can’t do everything. So what are some top priorities?
I picked the ones I mentioned on purpose. Gun violence is obviously top of mind for everyone right now, and it shouldn’t be lost on anyone that the only reason why you and I are talking right now is because of an act of gun violence.
And then what the ordinary Minnesotans out in the community will hear about how hard it is economically right now, how people are squeezed on every front. Cost of health care, cost of child care, cost of housing. So those basic affordability issues have to be front and center for us.
What can you do? Those are big national problems.
But there are local solutions. What we do locally matters. We’re apparently third in the country for child care costs. And then you look at some of the policies that we’ve enacted in recent years and the impact that’s having in helping people afford their lives. There are definitely things we can do. It’s not something where there is just one solution. I wish I could tell you, “This is the bill that solves the affordability crisis.” That’s not reality. 
It’s a lot of little things, and sometimes it’s stuff that isn’t very exciting. When I was chair of the Commerce Committee, we worked really hard to try to go after storm-chasing, fly-by-night contractors who were convincing people to fix their roofs when they didn’t need a fix. When people do that, that’s what’s driving up homeowner’s insurance. Those little things can actually have a pretty big impact on people’s experience
You do face fiscal constraints that have emerged in the last couple years. So it seems like big solutions, like on child care, are going to be hard. How do you square that?
Minnesota is actually in very strong fiscal shape. When we had DFL control in 2023 we ended the budget period with a very significant surplus. We have AAA bond ratings from all the credit agencies. We have a very healthy rainy day fund, and on a month-to-month basis our state’s finances are beating the forecast.
I don’t know that I totally agree that we’re living in a time that’s totally constrained. We have some challenges. I think those challenges are largely driven by some demographic pressures and long-term challenges in the health care space, but I think there’s also opportunities to be creative here.
Can Minnesotans expect you to lead similarly to Melissa Hortman? She was a mentor to you. So are you going to follow her playbook or try to chart your own path? 
I met Melissa Hortman when I was 17. I’m 41 now, and I’ve known her my entire adult life. She was a friend and mentor who taught me a lot. Certainly, there will be some things that are similar. There are some things that she did that absolutely are a guidepost for me, whether it’s treating folks with respect regardless of where they’re coming from or just her commitment to doing the work and not trying to have an ego about it. 
But we’re not the same person. There is no next Melissa Hortman. That’s an impossible task. She was the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history, so I’m not trying to be a carbon copy of Melissa. But there’s a reason we were good friends. We think about this job on a similar basis.
How do you think you’re different? 
She was really someone who liked to do a lot of stuff herself. I don’t always have that do-it-myself mentality that she had. 
Why did you want to be a prosecutor?
I wanted to be in court. I was spending all day staring at a computer screen at the firm Faegre Drinker. I wanted more people time, less computer time and I never made progress at that. Now being a prosecutor, it’s a flip.
I don’t have a caseload any longer. I can’t with the Legislature, and I take 100% leave of absence when the Legislature is in session. I help fill in for people who are on leave or in trial. I do a lot of charging cases.
How has that shaped your view of the criminal justice system?
When you’re a prosecutor, you do believe in accountability, but you also see it as an imperfect system. The criminal justice system can deliver accountability, but it can’t deliver healing, and it can’t really even deliver closure for people who are surviving. That’s not what you’re going to get out of that. It’s important for public safety, it’s important for accountability, but it can’t solve every problem. It can’t make people whole.
What’s one piece of legislation that you’re most proud of getting through in your tenure?
I think some people expect it would be the cannabis bill, which is certainly a huge bill that got a lot of attention, and it was a big challenge to get it done. But I actually found a lot of the work I did as Commerce Committee chair around consumer protections and economic issues a lot more personally rewarding.
The reason why I wanted the job was the less exciting but more consequential piece of it, and there’s a lot of things that we did there that I’m really proud of from some of the stuff we did on prescription drugs or capping insulin costs. We are also a leader in Minnesota on confronting social media companies and trying to put some guardrails around that, so I’m really proud of getting that ball rolling.
You mentioned the fiscal constraints being due to demographic challenges, and it does seem a huge but long-term challenge. Do you have any particular ideas about what to do about that aging population and population stagnation here, which is probably going to cost us a congressional seat?

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)No matter what we look like or where we come from, we all deserve a seat at the table. But billionaires and big corporations, and the politicians they bankroll, are working around the clock to take that away from us. 
They distract and divide us from one another, stoking fear so we won’t notice how they’ve captured our democracy. They do it in the halls of government with their lobbyists and paid-for cabinet positions, and they do it on the campaign trail with the politicians they buy. Every step of the way, they’re consolidating power for themselves while working families get left behind. 
Minnesotans understand what’s at stake. We are watching as extremist politicians in Washington hold our government hostage, slashing health care, SNAP, and the programs we rely on — all to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy few. They are weaponizing the Department of Justice against public leaders who dare to hold them accountable. They are sending masked law enforcement to kidnap our neighbors off the streets. And they are weaponizing the National Guard in our cities, turning soldiers against the very people they are sworn to protect.  

At the same time, Minnesota families are facing impossible choices. Parents are working two jobs to provide for their families. Seniors are rationing their medication because of the rising cost of prescriptions. The tariffs are squeezing farmers, rural hospitals are closing due to Medicaid cuts, and so are child care centers, leaving families with limited options for either health care or child care. No Minnesotan should have to face these choices.

The only people these politicians are working for are the billionaires and corporations that bankrolled their campaigns. To these leaders, this was never about cutting waste or a budget; they are dismantling our government piece by piece and selling it off to the highest bidder, all while families like ours are being left behind. 
Two paths lie on the horizon: let our politicians, with all the power, continue to hurt our working-class neighbors — or draw a line in the sand. To us, the choice in this moment is clear.
We are proud that our senators and leaders in Washington chose the latter. They understand what Minnesotans already know, that there is no “compromise” when it comes to sacrificing the health, safety, and dignity of our neighbors. Suppose the alternative to a shutdown is caving to demands that slash the programs people depend on. Refusing to play along is not dysfunction —  it is the only choice. 
Minnesotans know a better future is possible. We believe in an inclusive, multiracial democracy where people, not corporations, have the power to shape our future. We know that getting there takes vision, courage, and fight. It takes leaders who are willing to push back against these corporate-backed power grabs, even when it means taking tough votes. It also takes all of us speaking out, organizing, and refusing to accept politics as usual.

Thank you, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Sen. Tina Smith, U.S. Reps. Betty McCollum, Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison, for fighting for Minnesotans and defending access to health care, SNAP, and against federal overreach against our neighbors. 
For those who did vote for it, they must remember, now more than ever, democracy is for the we, not the thee. It cannot be bought by billionaires, captured by corporations, or held hostage by billionaires, corporations, and the politicians they back. It can only be defended when we fight together.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2233026155.jpg,,,2025-10-06 07:57:30.276618

(Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent)MOBERLY — Programs to help lower-income Missourians stretch their food benefits allow many families to put fresh produce on their tables, said Kara Bunten, director of the Randolph County Farmers Market, on Thursday, the last market of the year.
Families rely on these programs “to feed their family fresh fruits and vegetables at a reduced rate, so they’re not spending all the money off their cards,” Bunten said.
Those programs, currently supported with $2 million annually of state funds, could get more help under a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps, waiver application filed last week with federal officials by the Missouri Department of Social Services.
But that same waiver could bar recipients from buying soft drinks, candy and ready-to-eat desserts. And those restrictions, critics say, could mean even fewer choices for consumers in areas classified as food deserts. 
Christine Woody, food security policy manager at the progressive nonprofit Empower Missouri, said that in addition to “headache and complications,” the proposed restrictions could increase stigma and “cause a lot more people to not want to use those benefits.”
The waiver, with a projected implementation in October 2026, needs approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which operates the SNAP program. 
The request was filed after Gov. Mike Kehoe issued an executive order Sunday calling on the department to run SNAP “in a manner that prioritizes healthy foods.” It comes as federal changes passed by Congress in July narrow eligibility to receive benefits and impose additional costs on the state to ensure that SNAP users meet stricter work requirements. 
In August, 667,531 Missourians were receiving SNAP benefits, according to the Family Support Division. More than 41% of them were children.
This spring, efforts failed in the General Assembly to prohibit SNAP recipients from buying candy and soda with their benefits.
Gabby Picard, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, said in an email that “while no specific food items are being identified at this point in the process,” the restrictions proposed in the request reflect “initial language DSS plans to use to evaluate specific food items, upon USDA approval.”
Kehoe’s executive order also called on the department to “incentivize the purchase of fresh fruits, vegetables, and Missouri-produced meats and dairy products” with food assistance, without specifics.

‘Headache and complications’
Dan Shaul, executive director of the Missouri Grocers Association, which will participate in the process to implement the waiver, said that wherever Missouri decides to draw the line between “what is healthy and what is not healthy,” the changes will cause “confusion” for SNAP users and retailers. 
Shaul gave the example from Indiana, one of 12 states that has secured USDA approval to restrict SNAP purchases. When Indiana’s waiver begins in January, Shaul said, Snickers bars will be excluded as candy, while Twix will not, due to a definition in the state’s tax code.
“One would think, ‘It’s got peanuts in it, so it’s got to be the food,’” Shaul said of Snickers. “It’s absolutely the candy. The Twix is considered food because it has flour in it.”
The dilemma for SNAP users, Woody said, is knowing which foods are eligible and which are not. 
“You bring a whole cart of groceries, and you put them on there,” she said, “and then they’re like, ‘You can’t have that,’ or ‘You can’t have that.’”
Shaul said that although retailers will bear the upfront cost of reconfiguring their systems to implement restrictions, some of the expense will be passed to shoppers, whether they use SNAP or not.
“There’s going to be administrative costs, there’s going to be training costs, and ultimately, in an industry that [has] normally a 1% margin, any cost is going to be felt at the end, at the consumer,” Shaul said. “We’ll do everything we can to minimize it, but there’s truly going to be issues.”

‘A stick instead of a carrot’
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbaum, a Democrat from Kansas City, questioned whether the request would help low-income Missourians to eat healthier.
“The issue with using a stick instead of a carrot when it comes to this approach of healthy eating is that we are doing nothing, nothing at all, to actually help get healthy food into the household of Missourians,” Nurrenbaum said.
Kehoe’s executive order called on the state to incentivize SNAP users to buy healthy, locally produced food, but did not specify how the state should do this.
Kehoe called for the expansion of programs like Double Up Food Bucks, which allows SNAP users to double the fresh fruits and vegetables they bring home from select grocery stores and farmers markets.
Karissa Kary, president of the Missouri Farmers Market Association, said vendors would welcome more support for Double Up Food Bucks.
“The state stepping up to help support that further would be incredible, because it allows opportunities for both farmers and people on food assistance to get the freshest, most local food that is in the area,” Kary said.
But Kary said that although vendors would benefit from more incentives to buy fresh produce, they are wary of more state rules on top of impending changes to the program on the federal level. Bakers, for instance, will need “clarity” on what Missouri will count as a “prepared dessert.”
“It is very difficult for farmers markets to get the accreditation and everything they need to accept SNAP dollars,” Kary said. “So the fear of losing it or being fined for doing something inadvertently incorrect is really scary for a lot of small vendors…let alone the farmers they serve.”
Nurrenbaum said many people on SNAP don’t have access to farmers markets and shopping choices are limited in many rural areas.

(SeventyFour/iStock Images)Ridding the country of illegal immigrants was the rallying cry, the clarion call, which has morphed into deploying the National Guard and the U. S. military into major cities to reduce crime.
But the real purpose and purge go deeper.
My great uncle Arthur, who lived to be 106, would often say, “Niece, niece, you have to watch those who look you dead in the eyes and make grand promises as they are pulling the rug from under your feet.”
Is that what is happening across America — from the White House and Capitol Hill to state capitals?
There are coordinating and coalescing efforts to remove the democratic principles on which we have stood while falsely claiming to be making things better.
Make things better for whom?
Dramatic and alarming efforts are taking place to keep our focus on the need to deport  immigrants, both undocumented people and hard-working legal residents. Using Gestapo tactics, and deploying the National Guard and troops under the guise of needed additional assistance and to stop crime is to achieve other purposes: distraction, conditioning, and ultimately slow acceptance of oppression.
Seriously consider what is happening, how it is happening, and why.
While all the media drama is occurring, other systemic and defining legislative efforts are taking place in Washington and across the states to diminish, marginalize, and undo the rights, privileges of the majority of American citizens.
Namely, women and Blacks.
While Latinos make up the largest and fastest growing group in the country, women and Blacks have long been, and still are, the most powerful when it comes to the potential of voting in a bloc to bring about meaningful change.
Examining the voting results in the 2024 Presidential election is instructive.
Plus, history shows that women and Blacks voting in blocs was pivotal in getting voting rights, and equal treatment, and what has been achieved when it comes to equal employment, educational opportunities and access to other aspects of life that have always been afforded automatically to white males.
But the White House, Congress, and state legislatures are working overtime to pass laws, policies and practices — to revert, turn the clock back — that will disenfranchise women and Blacks in particular.
It started with the flurry of executive orders to get rid of DEI programs in every sector of American life—educational institutions, government departments and agencies, even private sector businesses either done by edict, monetary punishment or other looming threats.
Who are the primary targets of dismantling DEI? Women and Blacks.
Then there is the wholesale effort to distort, delete, and destroy the role women and Blacks have played and the contributions the have made to  making America what it is today.
This is done by ordering the removal of historical documents, photographs, artifacts and other evidence from our museums, and other public spaces.
This is being done with the selective banning of books from school curricula, libraries—with the goal of censoring and indoctrinating future generations by passing on a distorted, white-washed and false history of who and what America is.
Targeting women, Blacks and other minorities who historically have voted for Democrats more than Republicans is the focus of redistricting efforts taking place in states to ensure that the current political power — doing all the disenfranchisement to reshape America — remains in place.
Whose voting power will be most negatively affected by redistricting efforts?
Who will be most affected by the continuous efforts to ban abortion and other reproductive health care?
Then there is the perennial collateral victim — the working poor, which includes Blacks, whites and other minorities. While many elected officials make hopeful promises to improve their conditions, they are implementing measures to do just the opposite: keep wages stagnant while inflation increases; deny or cut access to health care by cutting and de-funding needed health care services.
What if women and Blacks — and some components of the working poor — decided to come together to stand and fight for their rights and well-being?
Women and Blacks, together, could make up the largest voting bloc.
Just imagine what could be accomplished if they came together in communities, cities and states across America?
Vote as a bloc against elected officials who are not working for policies and laws to meet their needs.
Vote as a bloc against ballot initiatives that could negatively impact or change the  quality of their lives, their families, their communities, future generations.
The changes taking place in Washington and states were not conceived overnight. One could argue that the vestiges of separateness and elements of autocracy run deep and have always been resident in the American way of life. 
But when those vestiges have raised their ugly heads from time-to-time during the last nearly 250 years, like-minded Americans who believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and our common humanity have prevailed.
We should be embolden and empowered by how democracy has withstood past threats.
We should be reminded of the milestones that can be achieved if what ordinarily might appear to be unlikely partners come together to fight and achieve common goods.
There are political groups, active and caring citizens that have a wealth of political will and experience on how to build and mobilize coalitions that can determine if a candidate is elected or a ballot measure is defeated.
Women and Blacks coming together would make a powerful coalition, along with other like-minded and caring citizens.
Mobilizing such coalitions is a dire need to counter and stop the negative political actions taking place.
Not just for the immediate future. But for generations to come.
To show them how democracy is not given, not automatic.
Preserving it requires engagement, participation, vigilance, and coming together when necessary to protect and fight for our common interests.

“I can't tell you when the opinion will be out,” Lynne Boomgaarden told WyoFile, “but it is my best guess that probably by the end of the year, in that timeframe.”
The post Abortion ruling not expected until year’s end, Wyoming chief justice says appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Supreme Court may not issue its highly anticipated decision on whether the state constitution protects abortion rights until sometime closer to December, Chief Justice Lynne Boomgaarden told WyoFile. 
“I can’t tell you when the opinion will be out,” Boomgaarden said, “but it is my best guess that probably by the end of the year — in that timeframe is kind of where we are on it right now. But I’m making no promises.”
The timeline put a damper on any expectations for a rapidly forthcoming ruling, which court watchers have said could come any day since mid-summer. The justices heard oral arguments in April, and under their basic timeline, they then have 90 days to craft and circulate an opinion — the legal explanation from the majority side. 
But any justice can call for an extension to that timeline as they debate and craft an opinion that satisfies a majority of the justices, Boomgaarden said after WyoFile asked about the decision’s timing in a rare interview Wednesday. Boomgaarden did not offer any indication which way the court is leaning, and said the justices could not discuss case specifics.
The justices are deliberating an opinion that many in the state have waited on for more than two years. 
The case centers on whether a 2012 amendment to the state constitution, which appears to give individuals a right to make their own health care decisions, is overshadowed by language that allows the Legislature to act to protect “the health and general welfare of the people” of Wyoming. 
Lawmakers in 2022 passed a “trigger bill” that would ban abortions in Wyoming if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade case, which it did in June 2022. A group of doctors, women clients and an abortion aid group sued in Wyoming a month later, and a judge temporarily blocked the law. In 2023, the Legislature passed two new, more restrictive bans, including one that rescinded and replaced the trigger bill. The same group of plaintiffs sued again that March, kicking off the legal fight that awaits resolution from the high court. 
Abortion has remained legal in Wyoming during that court fight. In November, District Court Judge Melissa Owens struck down the more restrictive ban, which the state of Wyoming quickly appealed to the state high court.
The justices are not trying to publish the opinion at some opportune moment on the state’s political calendar, Boomgaarden said. “What I don’t want people to think is, ‘oh yeah, it’s going to be two years.’ Or ‘they’re going to wait till after the [legislative] session is over.’ No.” 
A thoughtful and collaborative process is what’s driving the long wait on this particular opinion, she and Justice John Fenn, who joined her in the interview, said.

Boomgaarden and Fenn went on to outline the steps judges take before issuing a decision. 
After receiving legal briefs from both sides — and in this case, but not all, after hearing oral arguments in the court chamber — the judges sit around a conference table and speak their piece. One justice serves as the leader of those discussions — a position that rotates randomly throughout the year, Boomgaarden said. 
“We just go around the table,” she said. “Everybody gets a chance to speak. If we need to speak again … We just keep going around the table.” 
As a majority opinion begins to form and after a straw vote is held, a justice is chosen to write the opinion. Unlike in the U.S. Supreme Court, justices do not have the opportunity to lobby for the opportunity to be the lead author of an opinion because they feel strongly about it or have some expertise in that area of the law, Boomgaarden said. 
The justices “try to keep those assignments as random as we can,” she said. 
Within 90 days of that discussion, the first draft of the opinion gets circulated among all five justices. They have 10 days to vote on whether to join the opinion. But they can also offer suggestions for additional analysis or push for a rethinking of some portion of the opinion. “There’s just a lot of back and forth among the members of the court,” Boomgaarden said. 
Justices who find they can’t join the majority opinion then begin crafting the minority opinion, which goes through the same level of collaborative drafting.  
And justices’ positions can change over the course of opinion writing.
“It’s rare, but you can have a case where you assign it to the majority, the majority opinion is circulated, and someone says I’m going to dissent,” Boomgaarden said. Then they win their colleagues over with them. 
“They write the dissent, and pretty soon they’re in the majority,” she said.
Sometimes, Fenn said, the justices have to get together again in the conference room. “There’s enough to talk about that we want to get the five of us in a room and talk through it again,” he said. 
Though the justices didn’t offer specifics, it’s clear the abortion case is going through some iteration of that deliberative process — and perhaps an even more thorough one than usual, given the weight the opinion will carry in Wyoming and in the lives of women in the state who may seek an abortion. 
“The court is working very diligently on it right now,” Fenn said.

High court maintains business-as-usual approach as justices weigh high-profile cases on abortion, school financing, justices say. 
The post Two Wyoming Supreme Court justices discuss role amid growing legislative, public scrutiny appeared first on WyoFile .","The justices on the Wyoming Supreme Court want the state to understand that, unlike their counterparts in Washington, they don’t select the cases that reach their chamber in Cheyenne.
Any case in Wyoming that’s appealed beyond the district court lands in their courtroom, and requires a resolution from the five justices.
“We just take them as they come. We don’t get to pick and choose,” Chief Justice Lynne Boomgaarden told WyoFile on Wednesday. 
She made the remarks in an hour-long interview, in which she was joined by Justice John Fenn. The rare sit-down between the two justices and a reporter covered topics ranging from the timeline of a highly anticipated ruling on abortion rights to the judicial nominating process to the scrutiny state judges have found themselves under from the Wyoming Freedom Caucus. 
That pushback at the state level joined a national rise in criticism against judges that reached such a crescendo earlier this year that more than 100 Wyoming lawyers and retired judges publicly called on the state’s congressional delegation to condemn the attacks.

Over the weekend, President Donald Trump continued his administration’s conflict with the federal judiciary, criticizing a judge he appointed who blocked his sending of Oregon National Guard troops into Portland. Trump has repeatedly sought to send armed troops into American cities, labeling protests as acts of rebellion against the government. In this case, a federal judge ruled the administration failed to provide sufficient evidence of that claim.
In a response that will likely be seen as defying the judiciary, Trump within a day ordered the California National Guard into the neighboring state instead. 
Closer to home, Wyoming’s high court is increasingly being asked to rule on controversial laws the Wyoming Legislature has implemented in the realms of school finance and school vouchers and abortion access. Lawmakers have at times passed those bills over outspoken warnings from opponents that lawmakers were crossing the constitution.
Amid those pressures, the justices projected a picture of consummate legal professionals, taking on business as usual. 
“Do we have cases in the pipeline now that have a great public interest? I think we do have that,” Fenn said. “But you know, those ebb and flow over time.” 
Pushback from the right
The Freedom Caucus put a spotlight on the state’s courts — specifically Wyoming’s process of selecting judges through a nonpartisan panel and gubernatorial appointment — after lower judges ruled against abortion restrictions and the Legislature’s school finance decisions.
“For far too long, the judicial branch has been seen as untouchable, outside the realm of criticism,” an April 30 post to the group’s substack read. The posts are not signed by a particular author. 
“As our founders knew well, all human institutions are capable of corruption,” the post continued. “It’s time for judicial reform in Wyoming in a way that gives the people a stake in our bench.”
In August, senators on the Joint Judiciary Committee narrowly rejected a proposal to change the state constitution to require lawmaker approval of state supreme court justices. That measure is likely to return and other judicial reform bills may surface, given their popularity in the Freedom Caucus-controlled House. 
Any measure to change the Wyoming Constitution would require approval from voters in a statewide election. 
The two justices said Wednesday’s interview, which was offered to WyoFile by judicial branch officials, did not come in response to legislative scrutiny. It was, instead, part of a broader effort by the court to educate the public on the state judiciary’s role and processes. 
A two-year strategic plan developed by the Wyoming Judicial Council — the courts’ governing body — calls for an increase in public education by the justices. The court has added a new communications director, Jacob Just, to its staff and justices hope to soon begin publishing a public-friendly explainer to accompany the often dense legalese of new court opinions. 
“We are very consciously and intentionally not speaking to the media or anybody in the public in response to legislative initiatives,” Boomgaarden said. Boomgaarden, age 65, was appointed to the court by former Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican, and took her oath of office in February 2018. 
On the other hand, “some of the legislative effort … maybe it verifies the need for awareness,” Fenn added. The veteran jurist served as a district judge in Sheridan for 14 years before Gov. Mark Gordon appointed him to the Supreme Court in December 2021. Fenn is 63. Wyoming Supreme Court justices are required to retire at age 70. 
Voters get the opportunity to remove any judge in the state from office within two years of their appointment. Two supreme court justices, former attorney general Bridget Hill and Robert Jarosh, will be up for retention elections in 2026, according to Just.

The justices pointed to those retention elections as an example of an existing but little-talked-about way to hold judges accountable if they’re believed to be out of line. “The public isn’t cut out of this system,” Boomgaarden said. There is also a council on judicial ethics that fields and investigates complaints about judges. The justices pointed, as well, to the fact that Wyomingites can lobby the governor after the names of three finalists for a supreme court seat are published.
“Our world is changing,” Boomgaarden said. “There is so much misinformation, disinformation, lack of knowledge out there, and that’s why we’re talking in our strategic planning about the need for judges to be more proactive,” in public education.
Considering change to nominating process
In Wyoming, members of the state bar apply for open judgeships. Those applicants are vetted, and some are interviewed, by the judicial nominating commission — a group of three lawyers elected by state bar members and three non-lawyers appointed by the governor. That group of six, with the chief justice serving as a tie-breaking vote, sends three names to the governor for a final decision. 
Lawmakers and other critics who say the selection process is dominated by legal industry insiders want to see the names of all applicants made public. Judicial officials, like Boomgaarden’s predecessor, retired Justice Kate Fox, have indicated they’re open to making such a change. They’ve cautioned, however, that making the names public from the beginning might diminish the pool of applicants, because some attorneys won’t want clients, law firm partners or (in the case of an elected district attorney, for example) voters to know that they’re considering a new job. 
At Wednesday’s interview, Boomgaarden said members of the nominating commission are split on the issue — and that split isn’t simply between lawyers and non lawyers.
The commission just completed its second discussion on the question, Boomgaarden said, and has chosen to poll bar members on whether publication of their names would impact their decision to apply for judgeships. Boomgaarden did not offer a concrete timeline for when the commission might reach a decision, but said “it was possible” they could do so before the 2026 legislative session begins in February. 
And what if, as critics of the Freedom Caucus’ judicial reform initiatives contend, it’s not a lack of knowledge, but dissatisfaction with judges’ rulings, that’s driving the scrutiny? 
In that case, Boomgaarden said, there’s a “disconnect” about the role of the independent judiciary and the constitutional separation of powers. 
Or even, “a lack of respect, maybe, that we take an oath of office to uphold the rule of law, to apply the law fairly and impartially to any case that comes before us. And if somebody is expecting us or asking us to do anything other than that, we won’t.” 
The Legislature always has the opportunity to react to a state supreme court decision by crafting new policy, Boomgaarden and Fenn noted. Attorneys who staff the Legislative Service Office, in fact, each year review the high courts’ opinions and flag for lawmakers decisions they think could merit a statutory review or fix. 
That becomes more challenging for politicians when it comes to a constitutional decision — like the question justices are being asked to resolve around abortion access in Wyoming. If the justices uphold the lower court’s finding that the Legislature’s abortion ban violates a provision in the Wyoming State Constitution regarding individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions, then abortion opponents will have to make their case to voters for a constitutional amendment. 
But how lawmakers react to their decisions is neither the justices’ problem nor their concern, Boomgaarden said. 
“Our job is to look at the issues that were brought to us, look at the evidence that was presented, and make sure that the law was applied in the correct way,” she said. “When you start talking about what might be important long term or not, or have broader implications, that gets into that policy realm that belongs to the legislative branch.”

That’s deeply subsidized by tax credits Congress created in 2021.

But a couple weeks ago, they got a letter from their health insurance company that said their premiums would be hiking. It’d be $400 a month with the same enhanced tax credit, or more than $2,200 without. 
The full price is almost how much the retired school teacher, who lives in Council, Idaho, and his wife earn each month.
“If we spent that much on health care — which we won’t be able to do — we wouldn’t be able to buy groceries, or gas, or pay our utility bills, or anything else,” McMichael told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
Unless Congress extends them, the enhanced premium tax credits that let people buy cheaper health insurance on exchanges will expire at the end of this year. Without those credits, 25,000 Idahoans are likely to cancel their insurance policies — as average premiums are expected to double, said Pat Kelly, executive director of Your Health Idaho. 
The federal government shutdown this week came after weeks of partisan disagreement over this health policy issue. 
Republicans — who control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but need bipartisan support for most legislation — have blamed Democrats for the government shutdown. Congressional Democrats insisted on extending the health insurance tax credits and repealing Medicaid cuts as part of the stopgap funding bill.
But the vast majority of Americans — over 78% — say Congress should renew the enhanced credits, according to a poll by health policy research group KFF released Friday. Even most Republicans, 59%, say they want the credits extended. 
If the credits end, the rate of uninsured Idahoans will “skyrocket,” said Idaho Supports Medicaid Policy Associate Ivy Walker. 
That’ll likely trigger a ripple effect that strains the entire health care system, she said, forcing hospitals to take on more uncompensated care that private insurance companies will offset — by raising premiums for people still insured. 
“This is all going to feed into a very vicious cycle. And families are going to essentially have to choose between getting health care or feeding their families or paying rent,” Walker said.

 How the enhanced premium tax credits for health insurance work

The enhanced premium tax credits ensure people don’t pay more than 8.5% of their income on health insurance for benchmark plans. 
The credits only apply for health insurance people buy through the federal government’s marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, and state-based insurance exchanges, like Idaho’s Your Health Idaho. 
Exchanges are a common place for people to buy private health insurance when their jobs don’t offer any, their employer’s policies are unaffordable, or people don’t qualify for public assistance like Medicaid or Medicare. 
In Idaho, the enhanced credits reduced average monthly premiums by more than $400 — knocking down $636 payments down to $179, Walker said. 
Smaller credits already existed for insurance through exchanges. The enhanced credits offer two key new types of help, according to KFF: Boosting aid for people already eligible, and expanding eligibility to people who earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level, which is $106,600 for a family of three. 
After the credits were created, more than twice as many people got insurance through the federal marketplace, according to KFF. Since 2022, enrollment in Idaho’s exchange is up by 84%, Kelly said.
In 2021, Congress created the enhanced tax credits discount in the American Rescue Plan Act. Then Congress extended the enhanced credits through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Former President Joe Biden signed both bills into law.
Extending the credits permanently would cost $350 billion over the next decade, and lead to 3.8 million more people having health insurance, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September. 
 Why was this part of the federal government shutdown?

As the federal government was about to run out of money set aside by Congress at the end of last month, GOP lawmakers crafted their own temporary funding bill to keep the government running before addressing the next year’s full budget. 
The federal government has partially shut down. What does that mean for Idaho?

But Democratic lawmakers largely voted against Republicans’ bill, calling for extending the enhanced tax credits and repealing Medicaid cuts made through the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” 
In mid-September, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he viewed negotiations over the enhanced tax credits as “a December policy issue, not a September funding issue,” States Newsroom reported. But open enrollment for the federal marketplace — when people can pick or change health insurance plans — starts Nov. 1 and ends Dec. 15. 
Walker said waiting until December to take up extending the credits “would be far too late.”
The policy positions of Idaho’s congressional delegation, made up of four Republicans, are not immediately clear. 
U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson does not support extending the enhanced tax credits, a spokesperson told the Idaho Capital Sun.
“This has nothing to do with a September 30th funding measure — it’s purely a distraction from the Democrats,” Simpson’s spokesperson, Lexi Hamel, said in a statement. 
Amanda Critchfield, a spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said “Crapo welcomes conversations with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle about policies to lower health care costs for all Americans once the federal government re-opens.” 
In a statement, U.S. Sen. Jim Risch criticized Democrats.
“Democrats, not Republicans, set the expiration date on the Biden administration’s enhanced Obamacare credits,” Risch told the Sun in a statement. “These are temporary, COVID-era subsidies. If Democrats wanted to extend them beyond the pandemic, turning them into a defacto entitlement program, they had every opportunity to do so during the Biden administration. They did not. Now, they are using it as a ploy to shut down the government and extort nearly $1.5 trillion in federal spending increases.”
U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Idaho Democratic Party Chairwoman Lauren Necochea said Democrats pushed for the health care policies as part of the stopgap funding bill “because they know how dire this is going to be for regular American families.”
“Huge health care price hikes are being shoved down the throats of the American people, and Democrats are saying, ‘We’re not going to be part of this. We’re going to fight this,’” she told the Sun in an interview. “And this is the only lever Democrats have to try to stop those huge health coverage price hikes before they happen.”
In Idaho, Walker said the enhanced health insurance credits potentially expiring would pile onto a range of Medicaid cuts — to doctor pay rates, reforms from a state law this year, and federal cuts from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — that are priming the state for a health care crisis.
“Idahoans will have such a hard time finding access to health care all over the state. And it won’t matter whether you have insurance or not. It’s going to affect everyone,” she said. 
 Open enrollment for health insurance is approaching in Idaho

Open enrollment for Idaho’s insurance exchange, Your Health Idaho, starts Oct. 15 and ends Dec. 15. 
Kelly, who leads the exchange, stressed the importance of working with an insurance broker or agent on plans for next year. 
“It is more important than ever for 2026 that you work with those professionals. There’s about 1,200 agents or brokers all across the state,” he said. “… They are the experts when it comes to health insurance. So, they can help you find a plan that still meets your needs even with these increases.” 
McMichael, 63, retired three years ago. After retirement, he said he and his wife were on Medicaid expansion — until she tapped into Social Security early, and they earned too much to qualify. Then they got on an insurance plan through the exchange. 
McMichael said he’ll have to wait until open enrollment to see if there’s other insurance that’s affordable. 
“Like the 10s of millions of other people in our situation … we will not have health care. And if one of us gets really sick, then the options are pretty bleak,” he said. 
He said he and his wife are pretty healthy; they aren’t on routine prescriptions, and don’t have serious illnesses. 
A few years ago, he had back surgery. Issues have popped up again, but he can’t afford to fix them.
“But I just kind of live with pain. Because trying to get a treatment plan and all the other hoops you have to jump through, like an MRI and physical therapy, is just — even with the health plan that we have, the out of pocket costs are too much,” he said.

I think that is because I’ve always served in rural communities where we had to do whatever we had to do. If the yard needed to be mowed, if the gym needed to be swept, that was something that I was always willing to do.”
McVay, who lives on a hobby farm outside of El Reno, saw public school budgets tighten and the teacher shortage worsen over the latter end of his career. 
His administration at El Reno tried to boost its local pipeline of new educators by putting district funds into helping teachers’ aides earn college degrees through a partnership with Oklahoma Christian University.
However, Oklahoma still ranks last among all its bordering states in per-pupil funding, the chief source of most public schools’ budgets, according to the Oklahoma State School Boards Association.
That’s something McVay said he’s determined to change as state superintendent by working with the Oklahoma Legislature to raise public education funding. 
Although lawmakers have increased support for public schools by more than $730 million over the past two years, McVay said the Republican supermajority at the state Capitol has failed to keep pace with inflation. 
Adding extra funding could help districts hire more school counselors and employees focused on improving student attendance, which he said would translate into better high school graduation rates.
“Having 15 years of a supermajority has not worked for our kids,” he said. “And so, I think there’s a different approach that I’ll be taking, especially in the area of, again, per-pupil expenditures.”
McVay will face former Tulsa Board of Education member Jennettie Marshall in the Democratic primary for state superintendent.
Two other school district leaders are running on the Republican ticket: retired Bixby Public Schools Superintendent Rob Miller and current Peggs Public School Superintendent John Cox.
State Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, joined the race on Thursday. Ana Landsaw, of Tahlequah, is another GOP candidate for the post.
Former Tulsa Public Schools board member Jerry Griffin is running as an independent.
McVay labeled himself a centrist Democrat in the style of Carl Albert, the former U.S. House speaker from Oklahoma. He said he decided to run for office after seeing the website WalletHub rank Oklahoma 50th in education, a ranking that gained significant attention across the state.
“If you want to continue to be in 50th, keep voting for the same people,” he said. “If you want change, I’m going to be the change agent.”

(Photo by Brian Bahr/Getty Images)I found myself stunned when I learned that Oklahoma State University would be paying its underperforming coach $15 million to go away.
Because most Oklahomans who perform below expectation at their jobs are summarily fired, most often without severance or a massive payday.
But not Mike Gundy. 
Despite losing 11 of his last 12 games and proving last year he has no respect for Oklahoma State University’s average fan base, Gundy is expected to walk away with a hefty $15 million payday thanks to a buyout provision in his contract that protects him when he gets fired.
Obviously someone in high places is looking out for him, but who is looking out for the rest of us?
Imagine how many scholarships $15 million could pay for. Or perhaps it could be used to reduce tuition rates for in-state residents.
Gundy’s $15 million buyout comes as Oklahoma’s higher education governing board approved average tuition increases of 1.9%, or about $121 annually. While OSU didn’t ask for a hike, 15 others did, including the University of Oklahoma.
Meanwhile, the average Oklahoma college student carried $32,200 in debt, according to the Education Data Initiative, which collects and analyzes education statistics. That $15 million could erase student debt for hundreds of students.
But don’t worry your pretty little heads about that, we apparently have plenty to invest as long as it’s on winning football teams and coaches.
What message does that say about our priorities?
College football has always been an expensive endeavor, and universities desperate to win are increasingly promising to fork out big money to land top coaching talent. But as the landscape continues to shift with revenue sharing and name, image and likeness deals and ever-shifting player allegiances thanks to a busy transfer portal, I find myself wondering how much is too much to spend on buying out losers.
Someone pointed out that Oklahoma State University got off relatively easy with its buyout compared to what other public universities are potentially on the hook to pay if they want to rid themselves of underperforming head coaches.
Sports Illustrated looked at college football coaches contracts and found that University of Georgia coach Kirby Smart would be owed over $118 million. Former University of Oklahoma head football coach Lincoln Riley, who fans love to hate, purportedly stands to make $90 million if he’s fired from the University of Southern California. The University of Alabama would be on the hook to pay its coach, Kalen DeBoer, around $70 million if he’s fired. Texas Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian would receive $64 million. And Mike Norvell, who coaches at Florida State, has a negotiated buyout of $63 million.
The coaches at Louisiana State University, the University of Miami, Clemson, Pennsylvania State University and Nebraska round out the top 10 biggest winners if they’re losers, according to Sports Illustrated’s analysis.
If fired, University of Oklahoma head coach Brent Venables will receive his guaranteed compensation, though he’s required to try to find similar work to help offset the university’s costs, The Oklahoman reported in August. Venables is expected to make $7.55 million per season and his contract runs through 2029.
I get that college football is a business, and universities and their fan bases want to win. But are the leaders of our public institutions of higher education being good stewards of their resources if they’re agreeing to pay tens of millions of dollars when they fire people who aren’t meeting minimum expectations?
Former OSU President Kasey Shrum inked her name on Gundy’s latest contract in December 2024. She chose to retain Gundy despite his terrible performance both on and off the field.
Under the terms of the current contract, OSU wouldn’t have had to pay Gundy if he was found to be insubordinate, in violation of athletic rules, had a criminal conviction or engaged in conduct that “brings the employee into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule or that reflects unfavorably on the reputation or the high moral or ethical standards of the University.”
Having a losing record doesn’t count, though it should.
Last year, Gundy definitely opened both himself and OSU to contempt and ridicule when he said people who were critical of his team’s subpar 3-7 record were “the same ones that can’t pay their own bills” and called those same people “failures.” OSU fans, including donors, were furious. But rather than being fired, Gundy got a new contract that guaranteed the massive buyout and allowed him to have another losing season.
OSU soon will likely enter into negotiations with Gundy’s successor. It will be interesting to see what sort of buyout they guarantee him.
A few months ago, Joe Castiglione, OU’s vice president and director of athletics, told members of the Oklahoma State Chamber that his school is focusing on college athletics as a business, and that his school’s expenses are growing much more rapidly than revenue.
OU sports will have a $225 million budget built by generating its own investments, he said.
“We live by a scoreboard for many people in our world so that’s how they measure whether or not we’re successful,” he said.
That may be true, but let’s not forget what universities are here to do — educate our future workforce and do it in the most cost-effective way possible.
Regents have said they’re planning to press the Legislature to increase their funding.
But maybe Oklahoma lawmakers have the funding allotment correct if two of our largest universities can afford to pay eye-popping amounts to guarantee buyouts of football contracts while the average Oklahoman struggles to afford tuition.

(Carol Waller/Trailing of the Sheep Festival)A new podcast will highlight stories and explore the history and culture of sheep ranching in Idaho’s Wood River Valley.
The podcast, “Sheep Stories,” is produced by The Community Library’s Jeanne Rodger Lane Center for Regional History and features archival recordings and interviews from the Trailing of the Sheep Festival. The series aims to tell the story of Scottish, Basque and Peruvian immigrants who have worked in Idaho’s sheep industry for over 100 years.
The “Sheep Stories” podcast is available through a distribution partnership with Boise State Public Radio. Listeners can find all three episodes on the radio station’s website or listeners can download them wherever you get your podcasts.
“The voices and stories in ‘Sheep Stories’ illuminate the human side of Idaho’s sheep industry,” said Mary Tyson, the library’s director of the Center for Regional History, in a press release. “The new podcast that our summer intern, Vance Cunningham, made, gets me excited for this year’s Trailing of the Sheep  Festival. He picked out great stories from years past. His narration as the host of the podcast is very relatable and conveys an enthusiastic spirit for lifelong learning about sheepherding. I’m so proud of the work that he did to realize this new podcast.” 
The podcast centers on the theme of sheepherders and their culture and place of origin, according tot he press release. The first episode is about sheepherders who emigrated from Scotland and found their way to the American  West to herd sheep. The second episode is about sheepherders from the Basque Country/Euskal Herria, including tales of comradery in a Twin Falls Basque boarding house and the loneliness found in the mountains. The third episode is about sheepherders from Peru. 
Cunningham created the podcast from presentations and recordings from one of the center’s archival collections: the Trailing of the Sheep Festival Archive.  
 Cunningham is a senior at Western Washington University and completed the Patricia Crandall Lane Trailing of the Sheep Festival Archive internship from June through August. 
“His project was to listen to and watch media in the archive and describe it in the inventory,” the press release said. “As he listened, he developed a theme of immigrant sheepherder stories. He is the host of the podcast and narrates the three episodes from his point of view as a newcomer to the valley and as someone who is just  learning about the sheep industry and sheep ranching. 
“My love of history and community storytelling goes back to my time working for the Museum of History and Industry during high school, where I worked on the ‘Rainy Day History Podcast,'” Cunningham said in the press release. “This summer, that work continued at The Community Library, where I created the podcast ‘Sheep Stories.’” 
This is the first podcast created by The Community Library.

Opponents cheered the move, while lawsuits are still pending over whether county regulations can trump state-sanctioned activities on state-managed lands.
The post County zoning sways state board to deny lease extension for controversial Casper Mountain gravel pit appeared first on WyoFile .","Gravel miner Prism Logistics has lost its two final leases on state-owned “school trust sections” at the base of Casper Mountain, where the company’s proposed gravel pit on the west side of town has contributed to a broader controversy over state-versus-local control of industrial activity throughout Wyoming.
The Wyoming State Board of Land Commissioners voted 3-2 on Thursday to deny extending the leases. The board, composed of Gov. Mark Gordon, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Treasurer Curt Meier and Auditor Kristi Racines, similarly denied Prism’s request in June to extend the two-year terms for six other leases in the area.
Prism obtained all eight leases in 2023 and met fierce opposition from neighbors and residents throughout the county when the leases came to light in 2024. The Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance was formed in response. The group collected more than 20,000 signatures in opposition to the gravel pit. Casper Mountain is a popular local recreation area, drawing hikers, cyclists and skiers.
“We feel a big relief,” Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance cofounder Carolyn Griffith told WyoFile. “It’s not about [the Preservation Alliance]. It’s about the community, the state and what will be most beneficial for everyone.

“We’re supportive of gravel mining,” Griffith added. “But we’re also supportive of it in the right place.”
The winning argument, which Gray noted in his motion and denial vote, was that Natrona County — after the state leases were issued — banned heavy trucks on multiple roads, including Coates Road, which Prism would solely rely on to access the area. The county also modified zoning to ban mining in the area. 
Those restrictions preempt Prism from obtaining other permissions both at the county and state level, Gray said.
“I don’t believe Prism is going to be able to [obtain] the necessary authorizations, and I think that’s very important when we consider the fiduciary aspects here,” Gray said. He added that mining the state lands, which are adjacent to a rural neighborhood that relies on a shallow alluvial aquifer, would unduly harm private property rights.


What are state trust lands?
Upon granting statehood in 1890, the federal government bestowed some 4.2 million acres of “state trust lands” to Wyoming, and it now manages about 3.4 million acres of trust land. The Wyoming Constitution prescribes that the primary use of those lands, which are scattered throughout the state in a checkerboard pattern, is to generate revenue to support public schools.
The Office of State Lands and Investments commonly leases those lands — often referred to as “school sections” — for grazing and industrial development such as mining and oil and gas drilling.


“Again, this is just wrong,” Gray said.
Prism Logistics Manager Kyle True, as well as his attorney, told board members the controversy has been highly “politicized,” obscuring what should be a simple regulatory process.
“In this small state, those who contribute are asked to serve and function in many ways,” True said. “I think there’s a political realm and there’s a regulatory realm.”
The board, despite the political nature of those who serve on it, True suggested, is obligated to extend the leases based on the company’s due diligence to test the gravel resource and the fact that it filed notice with another state agency for a limited mining operation exemption. He urged the board not to be swayed by those opposed to the gravel pit.
“What we’re dealing with is a veritable tempest in a teapot,” True said. “There are sincere passions by people that don’t understand our industry and are bringing up things that simply are inapplicable here.”
Treasurer Meier and Gov. Gordon voted against Gray’s motion to deny the lease extensions.
“I think this has been politicized, and this necessarily isn’t the right place to play politics,” Meier said. He noted that the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance is exploring ideas to create recreational and educational opportunities on the state lands that might generate revenue as an alternative to mining.

“It struck me that the course of action that you probably should entertain,” Meier told Griffith, “is to let us run the regulatory aspect of it, but go to your politicians within your district and ask them to make that a state park.” 
State versus local control
True still holds out hope that Prism will eventually win its way to mining gravel at the base of Casper Mountain, he told WyoFile. The board’s denial to extend the company’s leases, he noted, seems to counter its contention that counties may not impose zoning and safety regulations that might impede state-sanctioned activities on state-managed school trust sections.
In fact, the state-versus-county question was already simmering before Prism’s controversial gravel pit.
The state sued Teton County several years ago to prevent it from enforcing its codes and regulations on a glamping operation, which the state had permitted on a school trust section. The state won and, upon appeal, the Wyoming Supreme Court confirmed in April that “the State Board and its permittees on state land are not subject to a county’s land use and development regulations.”
Meanwhile, Prism is asking for judicial review, challenging the Natrona County Board of Commissioners for imposing zoning and safety regulations that were enacted after the company acquired its state leases. Prism has also filed a petition for judicial review in the 7th District Court in Natrona County in July, claiming the state’s lease extension denial in June was “contrary to law” because the company insists it had met conditions qualifying for an extension.
Both lawsuits are still pending.

(File photo by Getty Images)A pipeline company tasked with supplying natural gas necessary to run a proposed power plant in South Carolina’s Lowcountry has sent out letters to 185 potentially impacted landowners as the massive energy project, billed as “generational” for the state, gets underway.
Gov. Henry McMaster, in May, signed into law a sweeping energy package that, among other things, granted permission for Dominion Energy and state-owned utility Santee Cooper to partner on a 2,000-megawatt natural gas-fired plant along the Edisto River in Colleton County.
Utility executives told the SC Daily Gazette they plan to begin the permitting process for that power plant, estimated to cost $2.5 billion, as early as December.
The facility, they say, is essential to meeting South Carolina’s power needs amid rapid industrial and population growth, as well as a proliferation of high-energy data centers that fuel the nation’s ever advancing technologies.
Data centers gobble up energy. Should SC block them from getting special deals?

“We need the energy,” Dominion Energy South Carolina President Keller Kissam said.
But before the first shovel turns dirt at Canadys, the companies need to know they’ll have the fuel to power it.
That’s where another partner — Kinder Morgan — comes in.
The power companies have a standing agreement with the Houston natural gas giant to build a $431 million pipeline, running from the south Georgia border, across Hampton and north Colleton counties, to deliver 325,000 dekatherms of gas per day to the plant site 71 miles to the northeast.
Bridge-Project_v1
 
A number of environmental groups, including Southern Environmental Law Center and Conservation Voters of South Carolina, have already expressed concern over the pipeline’s proposed route — in particular its proximity to the ACE Basin, a 350,000-acre undeveloped estuary named for the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto rivers that feed it.
But one organization dedicated to the basin’s preservation, the ACE Basin Task Force, won’t oppose it, according to chairman Charles Lane.
Lane said the proposed route will have far less impact on the sensitive ecosystem and endangered species than if the utilities had chose to run the pipeline beneath the transmission lines Dominion owns closer to the coast.
The proposed pipeline won’t go into the heart of the basin. In all, it will cross just four miles of land that’s part of the ACE’s larger watershed — where rainfall might eventually drain into the basin — according to Kissam.
Laying plans and laying pipe
The three companies started laying their pipeline plans last year.
As part of that process, Kinder Morgan Vice President of Public Affairs Allen Fore, along with engineers and project managers, took a helicopter flight over the projected route, landing occasionally to see things from the ground.
“One of the things I do on every major project we have across the United States is to see with my own eyes the potential route from the air and to go every mile,” Fore said. “That’s the level of detail that we take on projects, from a very, very high level to an individual conversation with the landowner.”
The company also has met, both publicly and privately, with officials from both counties. Now, they’re asking landowners’ permission to survey the land under which the pipe could run.
Kinder Morgan plans to hold community meetings with the landowners, who received letters last week.
The company will seek to survey a path 300 feet wide but ultimately will need a 50-foot-wide right-of-way, for which they will pay rent to the landowners. How much is unknown. Amounts will depend on the land’s value and negotiations.
Easements will give Kinder Morgan permanent access to the property. Landowners can still use the land, with limitations. They can plant crops or bushes, but not large trees with deep roots, and they can’t build any kind of structure on it in case Kinder Morgan has to come back and dig up the pipe for maintenance. And payments don’t transfer if the landowner sells.
A large portion of the pipeline’s route will run under existing power lines owned by Santee Cooper so as not to disturb more land than necessary.
Once they’ve secured a final path — sometime between April and June of next year — they’ll officially begin the permitting process with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
In addition to permission from the presidentially appointed commission, they’ll need various approvals from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, state Department of Archives and History, and the state Department of Environmental Services.
The partnership
Meanwhile, cleanup and site work at the former gas plant is largely complete, Kissam said.
The Virginia-headquartered power company has now started placing orders for the plant’s specialized equipment, including turbines, steam generators and transformers, which take a long time to have built and delivered.
In addition to the Canadys plant, Dominion is eyeing sites for gas plants in its home state and expects to buy in bulk as a way to save on costs.
“We need to be ordering the equipment,” said Santee Cooper President Jimmy Staton. “But we’re going to wait for the certainty of the certification of the pipeline before we start spending, in my view, major dollars.”
The partnership wasn’t necessarily easy to secure. Legislators and power customers pushed back, still upset over an earlier failed partnership between Santee Cooper and Dominion’s now defunct predecessor, South Carolina Electric & Gas.
The two companies mothballed a planned expansion of the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station in Fairfield County in 2017 amid fraud, mismanagement and cost overruns. Customers of both companies are still paying for the nuclear reactors that have never produced a single megawatt.
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

Now, consumer groups say, customers will be asked to pay for a gas plant on top of it.
Under initial agreements, copies of which Santee Cooper provided to the SC Daily Gazette, the two utility companies plan to each have equal ownership and equal cost sharing in the gas plant.
The companies will split that natural gas supply from the pipeline 45/55, with Dominion taking the larger portion and selling off any excess to its customers.
While Dominion Energy crews will handle the power plant’s construction, Santee Cooper’s chief operating office will oversee it, the executives said.
When it’s operational, the plant will employ between 40 and 60 full-time workers in rural Colleton County, which struggled economically following Canadys’ coal closure in 2013.
The access to natural gas the pipeline provides could draw other industry to the area as well, Kissam said.
“Everywhere natural gas comes, businesses follow,” Staton added. “And so, we think it’s not just a great opportunity for us to get the electricity that the state needs, but it’s also a great opportunity for economic development for those areas.”
Kinder Morgan will own and operate the pipeline.
And by working with Kinder Morgan, Staton and Kissam said, they’ll be able to tap in to its vast system. That includes 80,000 miles of pipe that spans 43 states, drawing from every major gas-producing basin in the country.
That means, if something impacts one pipeline — a natural disaster or a maintenance outage — the utilities can get their gas from another Kinder Morgan line without having to pay a higher price to buy from other providers, Staton said.
In addition, the Canadys pipeline is part of a larger $6 billion proposed expansion by Kinder Morgan across the Southeast, with lines across Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, most of which is following the route of the company’s existing pipelines.
Even without those expanding lines, Fore said, Kinder Morgan already has enough on its existing system to power Canadys.
Environmental protections
To protect the environment, Fore said, Kinder Morgan electronically monitors its pipelines 24/7. With the flip of a switch, and in many cases automatically, the pipeline will shut down if there’s any indication of a leak.
“(The power) plant is state of the art — so is our pipe,” Fore said.
And because the line is carrying natural gas, which is lighter than air, any leak will rise rather than sinking underground or contaminating a water source, he said.
The company has the ability to drill down and run lines some 70 or 80 feet underground without disturbing the ground above. It already has pipelines that run beneath the Mississippi River and the San Francisco Bay. 
When it comes to the power plant, Kissam said, the companies plan to use an air cooling system for the turbines, rather than water. The plant will use 1/100th of the water consumed from the Edisto River by its coal-fired predecessor.
Because natural gas plants are easier to fire up and pull back, tracking right along with power demand at any given time, they also work much better alongside solar power than their coal-based counterparts, Staton said.
Until battery technology becomes more developed, power companies cannot rely on renewable energy alone to keep the lights on. When the sun is shining, gas power can be dialed back. When it’s cloudy, the gas takes over.
“That’s critical for us if we’re going to continue to develop renewable resources around South Carolina,” Staton said.
Currently, Dominion Energy South Carolina has 1,000 megawatts of solar capacity on its system, while Santee Cooper and the electric cooperatives collectively have 638 megawatts.
Under Santee Cooper’s latest long-term plan, the utility company plans to add another 1,500 megawatts of solar power by 2040, largely by purchasing power from solar developers rather than owning and operating its own arrays. One megawatt of solar is enough to power 168 homes, on average, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Kinder Morgan hopes to have the necessary approvals in hand to start constructing the pipeline in early 2029, Fore said.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) Xcel Energy customers in North Dakota are facing an unusually large increase in their electric bill, which a North Dakota official attributes in large part to the company’s move away from coal. 
Northern States Power Co., part of Minnesota-based Xcel Energy, has asked the North Dakota Public Service Commission to approve a rate increase of more than 19%. Customers will have a chance to sound off with utility regulators next week. 
If the PSC approves the full increase, an average NSP residential customer would pay an extra $22.34 per month over last year’s rate. NSP customers have already seen an interim rate increase this year while the rate case is pending. The increase was nearly 12%, or $11.36 per average residential customer. 
Victor Schock, director of utilities for the PSC, said it would be unusual for the three-person commission to approve such a large rate increase request in full. What is more likely is a negotiated compromise, he said. 
Xcel has about 97,000 customers in North Dakota, including in West Fargo, Grand Forks and Minot. The proposed increase would increase Xcel’s annual revenue in North Dakota by $44.6 million.
North Dakota green lights natural gas power plant

Xcel says that since its last rate increase four years ago, it has invested in North Dakota projects, such as a new Grand Forks service center, a new substation and equipment upgrades.
Schock said the increase is driven by infrastructure upgrades, but also by Xcel’s move away from coal-fired electricity. 
Xcel last year retired one of three coal units at the Sherburne County Generating Plant, or Sherco, near Monticello, Minnesota. It plans to retire Sherco’s remaining coal-fired units in 2026 and 2030, marking the company’s full exit from coal
Xcel instead will use the site for what it calls the largest solar facility in the Midwest and a battery storage facility.
Schock said Minnesota public policy, which tends to favor green energy much more than North Dakota policy, is a driver behind the change. 
“We’re close geographically; policy wise, we’re pretty different,” Schock said. 
He said North Dakota views the Sherco coal facility as an asset that should keep producing coal instead of one that should be retired with costs passed on to North Dakota customers. 
“That is, in my opinion, one thing that is driving their large requested increase,” Schock said. 
Xcel says its North Dakota residential customers’ electric bills were about 28% below the national average from 2019 to 2023, and it anticipates bills will stay well below that average, in part because of federal tax credits for nuclear energy plants. 
Xcel representatives on Oct. 13 will make two presentations on the rate increase, at noon and 6 p.m. in the state Capitol. Public comments will be taken after the presentations. 
The hearing can be seen online through the PSC’s website.
People can watch the hearing and provide in-person comments at the Capitol or these locations:

The PSC has set aside a full week for a formal hearing beginning Dec. 1, but if a settlement agreement is reached before that hearing, it would likely not take that long, Schock said.

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Fewer people crossed state lines to obtain an abortion in the first six months of 2025 than the same period last year, marking the first reported decline in clinic visits since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. 
But data contained in a new report by the Guttmacher Institute, a policy organization that advocates for reproductive rights, makes clear that is only a partial picture of abortion in America this year.
While the data shows an 8% decline in patients traveling to clinics in states where abortion remains legal, it does not take into account the increasing reliance on telehealth to obtain abortion-inducing medication. 
That shift to telehealth for abortion services was borne out in Tennessee last year.
Federal judge blocks Tennessee law making it crime to aid minors seeking out-of-state abortions

In 2024, 10,020 Tennessee residents travelled out of state to obtain an abortion, according to data compiled by Guttmacher.
However, an additional 5,840 patients terminated pregnancies with medication obtained through telehealth appointments. The total number of Tennesseans obtaining abortions — both surgical and medication — in 2024 surpassed those obtained before the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision triggered a Tennessee near-total abortion ban in 2022.
Tennessee women continue to seek abortions at organizations like the The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, a medical practice established two years ago to provide abortion care via telemedicine to patients in all 50 states.  
The organization serves between 50 and 75 Tennessee patients each month, Dr. Angel Foster, its co-founder, said this week.
“Our patients are largely the same as patients getting in-clinic services in their states prior to Dobbs,” she said. “Financial precarity is shaping their decisions. We also hear every day from women in unstable or abusive relationships and college students early in their careers.”
It operates under a so-called Massachusetts’ “shield law” that allows it to prescribe and mail FDA-approved abortion pills anywhere in the country. The law also protects the organization and its medical staff from out-of-state prosecution.
And many of the Tennessee patients already have one or more children, she said. 
Thus far 22 states and the District of Columbia have adopted so-called shield laws since the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, making telemedicine abortion appointments widely accessible to those living in states with abortion bans to obtain a prescription for the two-pill regimen generally prescribed up to 10 weeks of pregnancy.
The increasing availability of abortion pills has prompted a backlash from attorneys general in Republican-led states, including Tennessee, which has laws barring the mailing and prescribing of abortion-inducing drugs.
More than 10,000 Tennesseans travelled out of state for abortions last year, new study finds

Earlier this month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, was mounting a review of the safety of mifepristone, the commonly prescribed abortion inducing medication, raising alarms for medical providers and abortion rights advocates about looming federal action to limit its availability. 
“It’s unclear what studies they will review, whether they are peer reviewed or junk science reports recently released by anti-abortion groups,” said Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at University of California, San Francisco in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, & Reproductive Sciences of the Trump administration review.
The Guttmacher report also notes decline in out-of-state travel for abortions was most pronounced in states that implemented six-week abortion bans. 
Before South Carolina’s six-week ban was allowed to take place in August of 2023, it was one of six states that served as a destination for about 100 Tennessee patients seeking an abortion that year.
After a federal court allowed South Carolina’s six-week abortion ban to take effect, Tennesseans ceased obtaining abortions in that state, Guttmacher data showed.

(Photo courtesy of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library) The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation has tapped into $53 million of a $70 million Bank of North Dakota line of credit to pay for construction costs while private fundraising continues.
Ed O’Keefe, CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation, said the foundation anticipates accessing the full $70 million by the end of the year.
North Dakota lawmakers in 2023 first established the line of credit through the state-owned bank to allow construction on the $450 million library in Medora to continue if donations have been pledged but not yet received by the library foundation. The loan did not get used in the 2023-25 budget cycle. 
Lawmakers voted earlier this year to continue that line of credit. Unlike a traditional loan, a line of credit allows the borrower to access the funds only as needed, saving money on interest, said Kelvin Hullet, chief business development officer for the Bank of North Dakota.
The library foundation began accessing the funds for the first time in July, with the balance now at $53 million, Hullet said Friday. 
Those dollars are needed because construction costs are coming in while some donations have yet to be collected, O’Keefe said.
Some donations to the library are multi-year commitments, he said. For example, a $1 million donation could be paid in $250,000 installments over four years.
“In many cases, we have commitments on the fundraising, but the construction costs, in addition to the exhibits and ramping up operations, are hitting now,” O’Keefe said. 
Under the legislation, the line of credit is required to be repaid, plus interest. There is not a payment due until June 30, 2027, Hullet said.
“Hopefully they can pay the entire line of credit back,” Hullet said. “If they can’t, then we’ll look at some sort of a structure over the course of a couple of years, as their donations come in, then to repay that back.”
Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library launches virtual event series

The Legislature also approved up to $5 million in state funding in the North Dakota Industrial Commission budget to pay for some of the interest. 
Interest is accruing at a market rate, Hullet said, but the library foundation will pay 2% interest, with the state funding covering the difference.
Hullet said he doesn’t expect the full $5 million to be used. That payment will be calculated at the end of June 2027.
The library foundation has raised $344 million toward a $450 million fundraising goal, O’Keefe said. That total includes $50 million in state funds the North Dakota Legislature approved in 2019 for the library’s operational endowment. Those endowment funds are to be used to operate the facility, not cover construction costs. Project construction is estimated at $400 million. 
The library foundation had donor events over the weekend in Medora and has upcoming events in Dallas, Texas and Washington, D.C., said Matt Briney, chief communications and marketing officer for the library.
The presidential library is under construction in western North Dakota, where Roosevelt spent time after the deaths of his wife and mother. He famously said he would not have been president without his experience in North Dakota.
O’Keefe estimated construction was about 70% complete as of Friday and expected to wrap up by May 2026, including the exhibits. Briney said the federal government shutdown will not affect continued construction at the library site since no federal funding was provided for the project.
“You can absolutely count on it, July 4, 2026, the doors will open to this library,” Briney said.
Lawmakers earlier this year rejected a proposal to add another $50 million in state funding to the library’s operational endowment, though proponents signaled the proposal could be back next session. Some lawmakers who opposed the additional funding raised concerns about taxpayers being asked to fill funding gaps with the library.
The presidential library has also received a $4 million Department of Commerce Destination Development Grant and $500,000 from the state Outdoor Heritage Fund. There’s also an effort to secure federal funding for up to $50 million for the library.

Attorneys for the department explained their view of the law in a brief at the request of Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble. Froble oversees two consolidated lawsuits filed by plaintiffs on both sides of a legal fight over the state’s school vaccine law and religious liberty. 
“Even before the [Equal Protection for Religion Act] came to be, West Virginia law was clear: ‘religion’ ‘in any … dispute concerning religious freedom’ encompasses ‘convictions which form the basis for the moral and ethical aspirations upon which [West Virginians] structure their lives,’” the attorneys wrote in court filings. Lacking any express indication otherwise, the EPRA must “be read in context with th[is] common law.”
“The broad common-law understanding leaves no room to draw arbitrary lines between ‘religious’ or ‘philosophical’  vaccine exemptions,” they wrote. “Whether an exemption request stems from a church doctrine, a spiritual worldview, or a secular moral conviction, the practical effect is the same: a person is considered to have practiced his or her religion so long as he or she rejects vaccination based on a deeply personal conviction about what is ‘right and wrong’ and that belief is ‘held with the strength of traditional religious convictions.’”
West Virginia has not allowed families to opt out of the school vaccine requirements for religious or philosophical reasons, but that could change. Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order earlier this year requiring the state to allow religious exemptions based on the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023. 
The state Board of Education has directed the county boards of education not to allow religious exemptions.  
In one of the lawsuits, families in Raleigh County sued the school boards to accept their children’s religious exemption to the requirement. In the other lawsuit, parents of immunocompromised children are suing the state Department of Health to stop it from issuing religious exemptions. Froble has consolidated the two cases at the request of state Attorney General J.B. McCuskey. 
In July, the judge granted a preliminary injunction allowing families in the Raleigh County case to send their children to school. The ruling applied only to those students. A hearing on permanent injunction in the cases started in September and will continue this week.
At the time of the September hearing, the state Department had processed 570 requests for non-medical exemptions to the state’s vaccine requirements, but health officials had not distinguished between exemptions based on religious and philosophical objections. Froble indicated the difference is important because Morrisey’s executive order is based on the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act. Philosophical exemptions wouldn’t apply under the EPRA, the judge said. 
In the brief it filed with the court, the state Department of Education argues that the health department asks the court to expand the state’s religious freedom law beyond what the Legislature contemplated. The court should refuse, they wrote. 
“Even if the Court were to consider expanding EPRA beyond its text, a broader problem remains,” the attorneys wrote. “If ‘philosophy’ is protected by EPRA, those protections cannot reach mere disagreement with a law. Otherwise, all one would need to do to exempt oneself from a law is express disagreement and opt out of it. 
“Therefore, this Court should draw the bounds of the EPRA exactly where the statute’s title suggests they should be drawn: at religion alone,” the attorneys wrote.
They go on to argue that if the law is interpreted to expand to philosophical beliefs, those beliefs should be so deeply ingrained that they’re virtually the same as that person’s belief in God. 
In their brief, attorneys for Marissa Jackson and Joshua Hess, the parents of immunocompromised children in school, argued that the court should rule that the religious protection law does protect philosophical and moral beliefs but the law should be applied with a “a fact-based, individualized analysis.” Jackson and Hess are represented by attorneys with the America Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. 
They argue that the Department of Health’s interpretation of the religious protection law would  have far reaching implications that would make the law vulnerable to anyone who disagrees with it. 
“If adopted, this interpretation could not be confined to vaccination requirements without raising new, distinct, and significant constitutional concerns,” they wrote. “Under Defendants’ interpretation, every West Virginia law becomes vulnerable to challenge by individuals who simply disagree with its provisions, without requiring explanation of the nature of their objection or its significance in their lives. Criminal statutes, regulatory frameworks, and routine governance mechanisms would all face the most demanding constitutional scrutiny. 
“The West Virginia judicial system would bear an enormous burden reviewing every law through this lens, fundamentally altering how legal challenges operate in this state,” they wrote. 
Attorneys for the parents who are suing the state and Raleigh County boards of education to allow their children to attend school had not yet submitted a brief on the question of religious and philosophical exemptions on Friday afternoon. 
The court hearing on a permanent injunction is expected to continue Wednesday and Thursday at the Raleigh County Judicial Center in Beckley. 
Paul Hardesty, president of the state Board of Education, and Larry Ford, president of the Raleigh County Board of Education, along with acting state Health Officer Dr. Mark McDaniel, have all been subpoenaed to testify, according to court documents. 
Attorneys for the parents of immunocompromised children are also expected to call witnesses from the state Department of Health, including people involved in the reviewing of exemption requests, people who helped create the policies and procedures for reviewing the exemptions and a person identified by the department who has requested a non-medical exemption. 
Miranda Guzman and Carley Hunter, plaintiffs in the case against the boards of education, are also on the witness list, according to court documents. Attorneys for those parents have asked the judge to make the case a class action.

(Photo: Angela Dennis for the Tennessee Lookout)Knoxville College has named former Knox County Commissioner Dasha Lundy, Ph.D., as its new interim president, marking the return of a familiar leader at one of the most pivotal moments in the institution’s 150-year history.
Lundy, who served as chief operating officer and vice president from 2021 to 2023, steps back into leadership as the historically Black college faces a pressing financial crisis and must restart its accreditation process from scratch.
“The most immediate priority is securing the resources or an extension to repay a $4.4 million debt by December 31,” Lundy said. “If we’re unable to meet that obligation, there’s a real possibility that portions of our historic property could be auctioned off. This is about saving an institution that has served generations of Black students, families, and leaders.”
Founded in 1875, Knoxville College has long been a cornerstone of educational opportunity and civil rights activism in East Tennessee. Its Mechanicsville campus once buzzed with student life and civic engagement, but decades of financial strain, loss of accreditation and campus disrepair have left the college operating primarily online and relying heavily on alumni and community support.
One of the hardest blows came last year when a fire destroyed Elnathan Hall, a historic campus building. Lundy described the loss as devastating and said the investigation remains ongoing.
According to her 2023 resignation letter, Lundy said she raised serious issues with the board that she felt were critical to address in order to protect the institution. After a recent vote, school leaders asked her to return.
After fire at historically Black Knoxville College, leaders speak out on school’s status

 “It’s nothing but God,” Lundy said. “I’m a woman of faith and a lot of people didn’t understand why I left, but I had to protect myself and do the right thing. It’s always been about protecting and saving this school.”
“I’ve always believed that KC is the backbone of our community and can help address the Black poverty rate in our city,” she said. “I came back because I believe in what this college means for our community.”
Lundy said the college’s path to recovery depends on being honest about its current challenges, from financial struggles to accreditation setbacks.
“To rebuild Knoxville College, we have to raise money and that includes being transparent about where we stand, what’s broken, what needs repair, and what we can realistically achieve,” Lundy said. “The community, our alumni, and our students deserve that.”
Lundy emphasized the college’s deeper roots, tracing its mission back to 1863, when Rev. J.G. McKee worked in Nashville to help newly freed people with few resources. 
“He probably didn’t have much, maybe nothing at all, but he was driven by a mission, and that mission is still alive today,” she said.
Accreditation and campus challenges
One of Lundy’s first tasks after addressing debt and finances is to restart the accreditation process with the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) after the college failed audits in 2024. According to records, the college submitted its application in August 2024 and received a list of 23 compliance violations that must be addressed, including leadership clarity, financial stability, and accurate enrollment reporting.
Founded in 1875 by the Presbyterian Church, Knoxville College lost its national accreditation in 1997, a major blow that triggered declining enrollment and deepened financial struggles. Without accreditation, students became ineligible for federal financial aid, making it difficult for the college to attract and retain both students and faculty.
No classes have been held on campus since 2017 due to building safety concerns. Today, all courses are offered online, while several historic campus buildings remain unused, many listed on the National Register of Historic Places.










Knoxville College will look different, but it will continue to stand for the mission that has carried it for 150 years. Educating, uplifting, and empowering our people.


– Dasha Lundy, Ph.D., Knoxville College 


Lundy said addressing the physical campus is as urgent as stabilizing finances and accreditation, and that it could be a process several years in the making.
“There is a lot of work to do and it’s going to take time. Our goal is to create a safe, functional campus that honors the college’s history while meeting the needs of our students.”
She said that online programs and campus restoration are part of a broader vision. 
Local leadership key to revival
Lundy’s appointment comes after a series of leadership changes. Former presidents Leonard Adams and Rotesha Harris both left within the past two years, leaving the college’s top post vacant until Lundy’s return. She began serving as interim president on Oct. 2, an appointment announced during the school’s 150th homecoming celebration.
The college also announced several changes to its board of trustees, signaling a renewed focus on leadership and governance.
Von Smith, a former member of the board of trustees, said Lundy’s leadership represents a fresh opportunity to rebuild with focus and transparency.

“It’s going to take a collaborative effort from the community and alumni,” Smith said. “We need to support the administration that has been chosen to lead us into the next 20 years. Dr. Lundy is here in the city, in the community, and knows the people who can help move this college forward.”
Michael Rodgers, Director of Alumni Affairs, said the school’s survival hinges on both innovative thinking and unity.
“We have to have radical new ideas to move forward, and I think Dr. Lundy brings the outside-the-box thinking that this college truly needs,” Rodgers said. “ We’re at a point where we either pull together or we fall, and that unity piece is huge. I believe she’s a unifier who can bring all these aspects together.”
Rodgers also stressed the importance of a leader deeply rooted in the local community. “We need someone who knows the community, is well connected, and can engage all the movers and shakers here in Knoxville. It’s going to take the entire community to support this effort, not just Black residents, but everyone who cares about the future of this historic institution.”
Looking ahead
Lundy expressed confidence that Knoxville College can regain stability through transparency, accountability, and strong community partnerships.
“This is our defining moment,” she said. “We have an opportunity not just to survive, but to build a stronger, more resilient institution. My goal is to continue the work I started before, strengthening academic programs, improving operational systems, and deepening relationships with alumni and the community so that Knoxville College thrives for generations to come.”
She acknowledged the challenges ahead but said her approach balances respect for the college’s heritage with innovative strategies for the future.
“Knoxville College will look different, but it will continue to stand for the mission that has carried it for 150 years. Educating, uplifting, and empowering our people,” Lundy said. “This is about moving forward together, with vision, purpose, and accountability.”

Jim Pillen before his press conference at St. Teresa Catholic School in Lincoln on Sept. 29, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN – Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, like a number of governors nationally, says he would be open to redrawing the state’s congressional maps in the middle of the decade. 
The governor said so during an Examiner interview as White House talk of Nebraska redistricting has cooled — for now.  Pillen’s embrace of the idea appears less bullish than his pushes to alter how the state awards its Electoral College votes for president.
“I’m open to all kinds of conversations,” Pillen said. “Obviously, a couple of states have done redistricting. It was done before I became governor, so that was off my radar … I’ve just not paid attention to how all that works.”
Nebraska, like other states, typically redistricts once a decade after the U.S. Census has finished providing population estimates. The Legislature is tasked with drawing congressional and legislative maps.
Pillen, like many Republican governors with swing or Democratic districts, faces White House pressure to redistrict the state’s congressional districts mid-decade to advantage the GOP in the 2026 mid-term races for the U.S. House.
While all five members of Nebraska’s federal delegation are Republican, the now-open seat contest in the Omaha area’s 2nd Congressional District could prove crucial to national Democrats, who are trying to retake control of the U.S. House. The seat is considered a possible pickup for Democrats after GOP U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retired.

After the 2020 census, the GOP-led majority in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature redrew the state’s congressional maps. It did so in a way that shored up the slight GOP lean of the 2nd District by swapping some Democratic-leaning residents in suburban Sarpy County with more reliably Republican residents of rural Saunders County. 
The Nebraska Constitution requires redistricting after each census, but the language doesn’t specify whether lawmakers can revisit the maps before the next census. Some have argued the language allows the Legislature to redistrict at different times. Others have argued any effort to redistrict mid-decade would face legal challenges.
President Donald Trump initiated the national redistricting tit for tat when he urged Texas to redraw its map, mainly to give Republicans a better chance of holding onto House control in an off-year election when the party out of power usually fares better. The Texas Legislature approved new maps this summer designed to give the GOP up to five additional House seats in the 2026 elections.

California and other Democratic-led states have since attempted to redraw their maps to counter the GOP’s gains in Texas and to potentially offset other Republican-led states that are also pursuing new maps mid-decade, including Missouri. 
Nebraska has been mentioned as one of the states likely to consider redrawing. Bacon confirmed such talk locally in August. Thirteen Nebraska state lawmakers visited the White House last month for a state leadership conference but said they didn’t hear a redistricting pitch from the Trump team. Some with knowledge of the meeting said plans changed because of media attention.
The governor’s reserved approach to redistricting — at least while the Legislature is out of session — differs from his full-court press for winner-take-all ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Pillen and Trump got personally involved, calling and lobbying lawmakers to shift the state from parceling out some electoral votes to the winner of the presidential popular vote in each congressional district to awarding all five of the state’s electoral votes to the statewide winner, which is typically a Republican.
Nebraska is one of just two states — Maine is the other — that parcel out some electoral votes by district.

Pillen at the time floated the idea of calling a special session for winner-take-all, but only if he received a “clear and public indication that 33 senators are willing to vote.” He also held an 11th-hour meeting at the Governor’s Mansion with at least two dozen GOP state senators about securing support and tried to convince holdouts to support winner-take-all. The 2024 effort died after former Democratic State Sen. Mike McDonnell of Omaha, who had joined the GOP, opposed the change.
The governor pushed again during this spring’s legislative session, despite lacking enough support from GOP state lawmakers to overcome a promised filibuster. The effort fell short.
One possible explanation for the difference in Pillen’s approach: Redistricting mid-decade appears to have less support.  GOP state lawmakers have privately questioned whether such an effort could secure 25 votes, far fewer than the 33 needed to get through a likely filibuster.

Here’s what it looks like in neighboring states,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/06/school-choice-mississippi-vouchers/,"Some Mississippi legislative leaders want to join a growing move toward 'school choice,' policies that give families options outside of traditional public education and often include diverting public dollars to private schools.","One by one, universal school-choice programs are expanding across the Southeast.
Now, as state lawmakers are considering doing the same in Mississippi, they’re looking to our neighbors and talking to experts about what happened in those states.
There has been a nationwide push to expand school-choice programs, most of which give families public money to spend outside of traditional public schools. These options range from charter schools to vouchers that pay for private-school tuition. When these programs are available to all students, regardless of family income, they’re described as “universal.”

Rep. Jansen Owen, a Republican from Poplarville and one of the leading school-choice proponents in the House, said he’d like Mississippi to consider a plan with education savings accounts that are at least partially reserved for students of all backgrounds. Education savings accounts, or ESAs, give parents public dollars to pay for their child’s education — that can include tuition to private schools and online education curriculum for homeschooling. Mississippi currently has an ESA program limited to students with disabilities. 
Owen also would like to see expanded open enrollment policies, which would allow students to transfer between public school districts. Owen said he believes parents should be able to make the final decision on their child’s education. He also said parents regularly tell him their local districts don’t offer the ideal educational program.
“They’re telling me that they have no options right now,” Owen said. 
But school-choice opponents say the pricey programs don’t actually give students more options. Private schools can turn away students, unlike public schools. And national data shows school-choice programs are still out of reach for many low-income students, students of color and students with disabilities because of private-school access, transportation issues and tuition costs. 
A Mississippi House committee studying school-choice policies has called on experts from Arkansas and Louisiana, who have lauded school-choice efforts in their states. Owen said he hopes to mimic parts of Tennessee’s plan in Mississippi.
Others from those states often have a different perspective. 
Tennessee
Tennessee’s first two education savings account programs were limited to students with special needs and families in Nashville and in Hamilton and Shelby counties who wanted their children to attend private schools instead of their local public school. 
But a similar program established this year is open to all students in Tennessee.
Half of the program’s 20,000 scholarships are reserved for students who previously qualified for the education savings account program, students with special needs or students in households with income lower than 300% of the federal free- and reduced-lunch guidelines. The other 10,000 scholarships are open to anyone. 
The omnibus legislation also gave public school teachers one-time bonuses and included a “hold harmless” clause that reimburses public schools for any state funding lost from students leaving to participate in the voucher program. 
The income cap will be removed next year, and the program can grow by 5,000 scholarships each year, as demand requires.
And the demand is there, said Tori Venable, Tennessee director of Americans for Prosperity, a national conservative advocacy group funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. This year, people applied for twice as many vouchers as were available, she said. 
“We saw a groundswell of parents demanding this after COVID,” she said. “We saw schools shut down and parents were dissatisfied with online learning.”
It’s not clear who has received vouchers so far, Venable said. The state won’t release details about who’s enrolled in the program. Some Tennessee lawmakers previously predicted a majority of the money would go to students who already attend private schools. 
The biggest issue for Jenny Mills McFerron, assistant director for policy and research for EdTrust Tennessee, is student performance at private schools. 
There’s little data to show how well students are learning in Tennessee’s voucher program. Private-school students in the smaller initial program generally performed below their public-school peers.
Additionally, the rural nature of Tennessee — similar to Mississippi — presents challenges. 
According to a 2025 report from the Partnership for Equity and Education Rights, five counties host over half of the private schools in Tennessee. More than 30 counties have only one or two, some with fewer than 10 students each.
While some school-choice programs allow parents to use the money to cover transportation costs, the voucher funds are limited and averaged about $6,000 during the 2023-24 school year, according to the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank based in Washington.
The conservative policy group Empower Mississippi reports that in-state average private school tuition hovers around the same amount, but some schools in Mississippi have rates higher than $15,000. And after voucher programs were established in other states, private schools raised their tuition.
“The private school-choice programs are not really providing choice to the vast majority of rural families, and they divert funding from public schools, leaving rural students with less,” said Paige Shoemaker DeMio, senior K-12 education policy analyst for Center for American Progress.
While a rural student might be able to utilize a voucher program, losing the student could be harmful to the local public school, she said. Rural areas have lower student population and have to make fewer dollars go further. 
“Even when no students from a community use a voucher program, when state-level funding gets cut due to the cost of the practical voucher program, like has been seen in Arizona or in Ohio, rural schools are definitely going to feel it the most because they rely more heavily on state and federal funding,” Shoemaker DeMio said. “We’ve seen this in West Virginia and Indiana, where rural schools are closing or they’re dramatically losing funding as they’re feeling the effects of these programs.”
As federal funding cuts trickle down, McFerron is concerned the program’s costs will continue to increase, putting Tennessee into a tight financial situation.
“Our concern is that the data and accountability are so limited,” she said. “Since we’re in our first year, it’s too early to see large-scale effects.”
Arkansas
The LEARNS Act created an Arkansas education savings account program in 2023. 
The program has been slowly scaled up, and as of this school year, all Arkansas students are eligible. Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has committed to funding every student who wants to participate.
The majority of dollars so far have been spent on private-school students. During the 2023-24 school year, 64% of students who received funds through the state’s program were already enrolled in private schools, according to a recent report. Data also show Arkansas private schools raised their tuition in response to the voucher program.
Shay Rafferty, director of social media and marketing for Citizens for Arkansas Public Education and Students, said her child’s religious private school charged more for tuition when it started accepting vouchers. 
“Most of the other local private schools have done that, too,” she said. “These students are supposed to get school choice, but they still can’t afford it.” 
Still, Josh McGee of the Office of Education Policy at the University of Arkansas said the program has improved education options in rural areas. He said micro-schools and cooperatives have sprung up in unexpected places, and more parents are opting for homeschooling, thanks to the vouchers. 
According to him, the competition makes everyone work harder to keep students.
“Superintendents would tell you they’re having to think about how to keep parents in their schools for a number of reasons,” McGee said. “The ultimate story is that if folks can leave, you have to deliver the goods.”
It’s a popular free-market idea that’s been embraced by Mississippi conservatives — that more school choices will make public schools better. 
While research shows that in some places, charter school presence has slightly improved the performance of public schools, Nicole Carey from Arkansas Advocates for Families and Children isn’t sure the results are worth the growing price tag. 
If every student who applied for vouchers this year is funded, that will cost Arkansas $355 million — far more than the $277 million budgeted for the program.
“We’re letting in everyone even if we don’t have the specific amount of money appropriated, with the hope that every student will not use their entire amount,” Carey said.
Alabama
Since 2013, Alabama has offered tax-credit programs to parents who send their children to private schools. 
This year, however, they state has widely expanded school choice after the passage of the CHOOSE Act. Now, families of four that don’t make above $93,600 are eligible for the education savings accounts, and by 2027, all Alabama families can opt in.
The program funds the ESAs through refundable income tax credits, so it’s administered by the Department of Revenue, not the state education agency. Money is never distributed directly to parents. Giving money directly to parents created problems in Arizona, the first state to establish a universal school-choice program. Costs ballooned, and parents reportedly spent money on things such as diamond rings and lingerie. 
The tax-credit nature of the program makes it an unlikely option for Mississippi. The state is phasing out in income tax under legislation passed this year.

But Mississippi lawmakers may take note of the accountability measures built into the program, the income caps, the slow rollout and the prioritization of students with disabilities.   
Much of the money has been going to students already in private schools, but Alabama Policy Institute’s Stephanie Smith doesn’t see an issue with that. 
“Lots of private-school parents pay public-school taxes and don’t utilize the service,” she said. 
But Allison King, government relations manager at the Alabama Education Association, said tax dollars go to public education because it’s a public good.
“Public education may not always be perfect for everyone, but we don’t apply this principle to our police or fire departments or any other public service,” she said. “Like if you don’t like your police department, you don’t ask for your tax dollars to hire private security.”
King acknowledged there hasn’t been a mass exodus from public schools due to the tiered rollout of the program, but taxpayers are “certainly” subsidizing students who were already in private school, she said, and the costs are set to grow. 
“The sell, when the bill is running through the Legislature, is that we are doing this to help poor kids get out of failing schools,” she said. “When the dust settles, that’s really not the students that are benefitting at all.”
Louisiana
Louisiana has had a number of school choice programs since 2008, but last year, the Legislature approved the LA GATOR program, which creates education savings accounts across various eligibility groups. By the program’s final phase, the money will be available to all students, regardless of income. 
But the Legislature allocated far less money to the program last year than what the governor and other school-choice proponents wanted. 
It’s resulted in a self-limiting program that hasn’t been able to reach its full potential, said Erin Bendily, senior vice president of the Pelican Institute. 
Bendily said there are more than 30,000 families currently waitlisted for the program.
“The timing of this has just been incredibly frustrating and disappointing for families because they got this news in the middle of the summer, after many of them had already put deposits down,” she said. “Many people just were really counting on this. … The only other option is the public school they’re zoned to.” 
In context, that’s 30,000 students out of 700,000 in public schools, said Jan Moller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana. He suspects many of those thousands of students are already enrolled in private schools. 
Moller disagrees with the idea that there was a “broken promise” on behalf of the state Legislature. 
“This is subject to appropriation,” he said. “Everybody understood that. … To Louisiana’s credit, they saw where this was heading and put the brakes on it.”
Louisiana students using vouchers for private schools were more likely to make lower scores in the four tested subject areas than public-school students, according to research. And by the end of the voucher program’s fourth year, voucher students performed “noticeably worse” on state assessments than their counterparts. 
While Bendily acknowledged most Louisianans are educated at public schools and the important role those schools serve in their communities, there are parents who want other options for their children. 
“There’s a sense of community around your public schools, and you want your public school to be great, but we still have enormous challenges in our public education system,” she said. “We still have needs that are not being met.”
That’s a reality Mississippi lawmakers have grappled with. 
While the state’s public education system has seen great improvement in recent years — improvement that’s been nationally recognized — that doesn’t mean every parent is satisfied with the education their child is receiving.
“We believe that we can do both,” Bendily said. “While we’re making public schools better, we need to make sure that we are also giving families the options that they need.”
The math, however, doesn’t always add up.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Pennsylvania officials say they have few options to prop up federally-funded food assistance programs that are expected to run out of money quickly if the federal government shutdown drags deeper into October.
The Women, Infants & Children (WIC) program could see its funding dry up as soon as this week, absent a special appropriation from the U.S. Department of Agriculture or federal budget resolution. Pennsylvania’s estimate is about two weeks before that happens, according to the state Department of Health.
Nearly 186,000 Pennsylvanians were enrolled in WIC as of July. 
WIC recipients likely wouldn’t see their benefits reduced unless the shutdown and state budget stalemate drag on – in part because they receive cash assistance in three-month increments, according to program administrators in the commonwealth.
“Today, if a client comes into our office, we’re loading three months of benefits on their card,” said Melissa Bishop, director of WIC Implementation and Development at the Family Health Council of Central Pennsylvania.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Bishop noted clients have been asking whether their cards will work at the grocery store or whether organizations like the Family Health Council still are providing a range of services. That’s in addition to money for groceries including nutrition education, breastfeeding support, health screenings, breast pumps for women, and referrals to medical providers and other social service agencies.
“We try to get ahead of it by saying we’re still open, keep your appointments and use your food benefits at the grocery store,” she said. “We just don’t want people to sit there with a benefit on their card, thinking they can’t use it when they absolutely can.”
USDA has about $150 million reserved to draw on for WIC — equivalent to a week or two for the program nationwide, according to the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit that advocates for eliminating hunger.
Listen to the audio recap here:

Once that funding is spent, states can use their own money for WIC and expect to be reimbursed after the shutdown. Colorado lawmakers, for example, have appropriated money to fill the gap.
But in the commonwealth, moving around funds is more difficult because the shutdown is overlapping with a state budget impasse now in its fourth month.
The program was funded at $278 million in Pennsylvania during the last fiscal year, according to the Department of Health budget.
The Pennsylvania Capital-Star asked the Health Department and Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office about short-term funding options the administration might have, such as whether declaring a public health emergency would be possible to provide flexibility to operate outside typical processes and procedures.
“In this instance, the Commonwealth does not have the ability to declare a public health emergency and pull down additional funding for WIC, nor can we utilize dollars in the rainy day fund without a General Assembly appropriation,” department spokesperson Mark O’Neill wrote in an email. “We are awaiting further direction from the USDA as it remains unclear whether services will continue without additional action at the federal level.” 
In response to questions from the Capital-Star about their contingency fund and what they’re advising states, the federal Department of Agriculture issued a statement that said, “The Democrat shutdown will cause real harm to American farmers, ranchers, and rural communities. President Trump has made it clear through his support of H.R. 5371 that he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”
Pennsylvania’s budget impasse has also affected the state’s ability to utilize federal passthrough money, which funds other health and nutritional assistance programs.

How long social service agencies can stay open in this funding environment will vary.
The majority of more than 100 organizations responding to a survey by the Pennsylvania Association of Nonprofits anticipated running into cashflow problems, running out of contingency funds or both by the end of October, if they haven’t already. And dozens reported planning or already having initiated layoffs, pay cuts and other staffing changes.
Clients might get referred to another office for certain services as agencies shift and share resources to get by, said Tricia Fonzi, president and chief operating officer of the Family Health Council.
During the federal shutdown in 2019, her organization – which also administers programs funded by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs and the state and federal departments of health and human services – kept its doors open.
“That’s the same playbook we’re using now until we hear otherwise. Because we really have not received any guidance,” Fonzi said.
She’s optimistic that the organization will similarly weather this storm – and that WIC money will keep flowing. At the same time, Fonzi and Bishop had been expecting an increase in enrollment in the program due to the onset of new work requirements and other rules for the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program (SNAP) – which now also faces a funding crisis in the face of the federal government shutdown. 
Fonzi, O’Neil and others acknowledged the stress created by so much uncertainty.
The National WIC Association said in a press release that the timing of the shutdown, at the beginning of the fiscal year, “puts WIC at risk of rapidly running out of funds.” 
That’s because states have less money to shift around to the program.
“This failure needlessly jeopardizes the health and nutrition of millions of pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children who rely on WIC,” the statement said. “Failure to rapidly reopen the government could result in State WIC directors being put in the horrible position of trying to manage their programs with insufficient funds.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/snapphoto_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 06:56:13.592055

Kentuckians living with addiction can call Kentucky’s help line at 833-859-4357. Narcan, which can help reverse overdoses, is available at pharmacies for sale and through some health departments and outreach programs for free. 

Citing the need for more collaboration in the treatment of substance use disorder, 10 nonprofit organizations from around Kentucky have banded together to form the Kentucky Nonprofit Recovery Alliance. 
Launched publicly on Oct. 2, the founding members — which span from West Kentucky to Ashland — will advocate for Medicaid reforms that prioritize patient outcomes over quantity of services, as well as establish a memorandum of understanding to easily refer patients within the network for the best care. 
This will get recovery advocates out of “our organizational silos” and into a formal system of “warm handoffs and linkages into care between every step in the process,” said Jennifer Hancock, the president and CEO of Volunteers of America Mid-States and a founding board member of the new organization. 
While overdose deaths in Kentucky have declined in recent years, Kentuckians still suffer from opioid use disorder at one of the nation’s highest rates. 
As of 2022, Kentucky had 70.34 treatment beds per 100,000 people, the highest in the country, according to a study released in 2024 by East Tennessee State University’s Center for Rural Health Research. Despite that capacity to treat people, the state has high rates of addiction. 
Jennifer Hancock is the CEO of Volunteers of America Mid-States.
“That dissonance is something that we are deeply concerned about,” Hancock said. 
A national report in May showed Kentucky is one of four states where the rate of opioid use disorder is higher than 2.5% of the population aged 12 or older. The others are New Hampshire, Nevada and Massachusetts. Meanwhile, 1,410 Kentuckians died from an overdose in 2024, according to the 2024 Drug Overdose Fatality Report. In 2023, there were 1,984 overdose deaths, which was a decrease from the 2,135 lost in 2022. 
Even though deaths are down, the high rate of addiction means “the urgency has never waned” when it comes to treating it, Hancock said. 
“Even though fewer people are dying, which is something that we would celebrate, we’re not really seeing that much of an impact in overdoses,” said Abbie Gilbert, the chief policy and external affairs officer with the Kentucky Nonprofit Recovery Alliance. “We have to find other things to show that we’re helping people get healthy (and) move back into the workforce.” 
‘Volume over value’
One disconnect in resources and effective treatment, Hancock said, is the reimbursement system. 
“The current system incentivizes volume over value,” Hancock said. “Because it’s a fee-for-service model … Medicaid is paying providers to deliver a health care activity, regardless of whether or not that activity is producing positive results.” 
Hancock’s organization, Volunteers for America, has “value-based” contracts with Medicaid and its managed care organizations (MCOs), she said: “They are paying us for delivering healthy babies not born substance exposed, graduating a mom who has a living wage job and stable housing.” 
She wants to see other organizations land such contracts. The organization will also advocate for the General Assembly to require demonstrated outcomes in Medicaid contracts, she said. 
The Kentucky legislature convenes for the 2026 session on Jan. 6, but it’s “too early” to say what bills will be introduced on this, Hancock said. Coalition members are “just beginning” to have conversations about this with members of the Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board, she said. 
“Our coalition believes that the system could be redesigned to incentivize quality outcomes, which would change the behaviors of providers in transformational ways,” Hancock said. “These are significant changes that could be positively disruptive to the system, especially during a time when Medicaid reform is at the top of every policy maker, provider and even citizen’s minds.”

In one case from Washington County, the court ruled last month that election officials violated voters’ rights by misleading them about the status of their mail-in ballots. 
And it heard oral arguments in a case from Philadelphia over whether the most common mistake – omitting the date from a ballot envelope – should result in mail ballots being disqualified.
A decision in that case almost certainly will not be made in time for next month’s election, voting rights advocates said. But election officials across the commonwealth are operating under guidance from the Department of State that the date on ballot envelopes is not a factor in determining whether they are valid.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in August writing the date on a mail-in ballot envelope is a minor burden for voters. But the impact of making a mistake or forgetting is too great, rendering it an unjustifiable infringement on the fundamental right to vote.
For the average Pennsylvanian, it’s a lot to keep track of decisions made by the state’s highest court, Commonwealth Court, county courts, federal courts, and even the U.S. Supreme Court. 
So what has changed with voting by mail since last November’s presidential election?
Most voters won’t notice any difference in the process of requesting, receiving, completing and returning their mail-in ballots, election officials and voting rights watchdogs said. 
But they can vote by mail with the confidence that if they do make mistakes, all is not lost, University of Pennsylvania political science professor Marc Meredith said. 
The Supreme Court ruled last month that county election officials must notify voters if an error results in a mail-in ballot being disqualified. That gives voters an opportunity to challenge the decision or go to their polling places on Election Day to cast provisional ballots.
Another high court decision in October 2024 affirmed that voters have the right to cast provisional ballots and have them counted when their mail-in ballots are set aside because of a mistake. In that case, it was voters neglecting to use the secrecy envelopes provided with their ballots.
“Those decisions have provided some clarity about how counties should handle ballots that come in with an incomplete affidavit or missing secrecy envelopes,” Meredith said.
The other vote-by-mail case before the commonwealth’s Supreme Court deals with the most litigated mistake that voters make: Forgetting to date or incorrectly dating the declaration on the outside of the return envelope. Courts have made at least nine different rulings that have changed the rules, but none so far has been definitive.
The Philadelphia-based U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that the requirement violates the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment right to vote and the 14th Amendment right to equal treatment under the law. The GOP has asked the court to rehear the case en banc, in hopes that a larger panel of judges would reach the opposite conclusion.

In oral arguments Sept. 10 before the state Supreme Court, lawyers for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and the Republican National Committee argued writing the date on a ballot declaration is not such a burden that it unconstitutionally interferes with the right to vote.
The GOP is appealing a Commonwealth Court decision in favor of two Philadelphia voters whose mail ballots were among 69 disqualified in a special election for a state House seat because of missing dates.
Lawyers representing Susan Kinniry and Brian Baxter argued the date requirement violates the state constitution’s guarantee of the right to vote because the date serves no purpose that justifies government interference.
“Even if this date requirement was not intended as a disenfranchisement trap, we now know that that’s what it has become,” American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania lawyer Stephen Loney said during the arguments.
Marian Schneider, formerly senior policy counsel for the ACLU of Pennsylvania, said the Supreme Court stayed the lower court’s ruling in the case last year, noting it came too soon before the election to risk confusion by changing the rules. The court is almost certain to follow the same doctrine with its decision this year.

“I can’t imagine they would change the rule so close to the election, especially when three of them are on the ballot,” Schneider said.
The ruling in the Washington County case could help reduce the number of disenfranchised voters statewide by ensuring they have a chance to vote provisionally, which Schneider noted is a requirement of the federal Help America Vote Act.
That figure was about 22,000 in the 2022 election, when gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races were on the ballot. Revisions to the design of mail-in ballots and the opportunity to fix missing or incorrect dates have reduced the number of disqualified ballots statewide to about 4,500 in last year’s election.
Washington County Commissioner Chairman Nick Sherman said he still disagrees with the state Supreme Court’s ruling on notifying voters. While the Statewide Uniform Registry of Voters automatically generates an email to voters who provide an address informing them of their ballot status, Sherman said he believes that’s at odds with the law. 
Act 77, which amended the Election Code to allow mail-in voting, allows county election workers to begin “precanvassing” or preparing ballots only at 7 a.m. on Election Day. 
“They went a step further in the last election and said we have to review the ballot,” Sherman said, adding that it adds cost and additional labor.
Chantell McCurdy, the elections office director in Butler County, said voters there shouldn’t notice any changes either. If there is a problem with a mail-in ballot, such as a missing signature, the county gives the voter the option of going to the election office to fix the mistake or going to their polling place to vote provisionally. 
Lehigh County Chief Elections Clerk Tim Benyo said the recent decision won’t change procedures in his office, which has been notifying voters of mail ballot problems for years. 
“We have adapted over time to the different court rulings but these don’t necessarily change anything for us,” Benyo said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7466-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-06 05:56:53.182134

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) Graham Platner, the progressive, union-backed oysterman challenging longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, has been making national headlines and turning out large crowds at town halls in southern and coastal Maine. But how does his candidacy fare where votes may be most consequential? 
On Saturday, Platner brought his pitch to Collins’ hometown. Hosting a town hall at the American Legion Post 15 — situated one block from the senator’s Caribou office and about a block in the other direction from a storefront of her family’s sixth-generation lumber business — Platner said, “Maine deserves better than Susan Collins.”
Leading up to Platner’s visit, when asked if they knew about him, several area residents responded, “Who?” 
But about 200 people from Caribou and surrounding towns packed his town hall, a smaller crowd than he’s been drawing elsewhere in the state but much larger than his campaign expected, leading volunteers scrambling to find more seats while some attendees stood or sat on the floor.
Gail Goodblood of Woodland, a Democrat who was once unenrolled, had no problem securing her spot an hour early, when Sweden Street, which runs through downtown, was still largely empty. Goodblood didn’t know much about Platner prior, but she liked what she saw of his stances on social media and decided to come to the town hall to learn more. 
“He appears like he’s going to be forceful and speak out and we need that so bad,” Goodblood said, before pausing to question, “As a matter of fact, what is he? I don’t even know. What is he running under?”
Drawn to his policies and persona rather than political party, Goodblood’s thinking appears to be exactly what Platner is after. 
“Everyone in Maine — Republican or Democrat, Trump supporter or progressive — when you walk around this state, you ask any working person in the state, ‘Do you think that you live in a system — a political system, an economic system — that has your best interest at heart?’ Nobody says yes to that,” Platner told the crowd. He was wearing jeans, a t-shirt and a hoodie from the latest record of the ​​American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys, titled “For the people.”
That exact phrase was repeated by many attendees explaining their enthusiasm for the political newcomer and military veteran. They were particularly keen on his push for Medicare for All. In a county where the health care system was already sparse, federal cuts made by the GOP have exacerbated access and affordability issues. And thousands of Mainers are anticipating higher insurance premiums, as the future of health insurance subsidies — the issue Democrats tried to leverage to avoid a government shutdown, to no avail — remains unclear.

While the turnout was sizable for a Republican-leaning town, not all attendees were set on Platner just yet. For those who are members of the Maine Democratic Party’s local chapters, it’s because of the party’s neutrality policy before the primary. But even so, many said they still want to hear from other candidates.
There are seven other Democrats, an independent and two Republicans also running, most of whom are also political novices like Platner.  
Meanwhile, Democrats in Washington, D.C., have been pressuring Maine Gov. Janet Mills to enter the race. Though she has yet to announce, she’s been touring the state more frequently in recent weeks in her capacity as governor, including making a stop in Caribou in late September for a ribbon cutting of Maine’s first Amazon delivery warehouse. 
The crowd Platner attracted was not enthused by an establishment candidate of any kind, even though many commended Mills for standing up to Trump. As Woodland put it, “We have to make a big change.” 
A movement beyond the man
While Platner is critical of the Democratic establishment, he said he has faith that the party can be turned back into one of and for working people. And despite his critiques, he does believe there are people in the Senate doing good things. 
Smoking outside after the town hall, Platner rattled off some current U.S. senators who he admires: Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democrats Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Ed Markey of Massachusetts. On the other side of the aisle, Josh Hawley of Missouri. 
“We don’t see eye to eye on a lot of things, but he has been fighting for stuff,” Platner said. “For instance, trying to ban stock trading. Yeah, I’m into that,” notably the opposite stance Collins has taken.
But what Platner is not interested in is being what he considers a “reform candidate.” Even the politicians he likes he doesn’t believe are thinking big enough. 
He’s pitching a return to a Democratic Party that backs major structural change. As an example, he pointed to his personal hero, Frances Perkins, a workers rights advocate who served as U.S. Secretary of Labor under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the first woman ever to serve in a presidential cabinet. She wasn’t “looking to make little changes around the margins” or “trying to figure out how to use a tax credit here or a block grant there,” he said. Perkins, whose family had a homestead in Maine, invented something entirely new: Social Security.
While Platner often repeats that the extent of his political career before his bid for Senate was serving as harbormaster of Sullivan, he has experience when it comes to grassroots organizing, previously leading efforts through a local political group called Acadia Action along with his friend-turned-campaign-staffer Daniel Pelt of Surry.

Pelt, who quit his job as a carpenter building boats to help with Platner’s campaign, said Platner has rejected previous calls to run for local offices, but when Maine labor leaders and community activists approached his friend about challenging Collins, he saw it as an opportunity to not just become a senator but build out a structure for grassroots politics in the Pine Tree State.
He and Platner share a belief that effective resistance must come from the bottom up.
“This race, for me, is not just about beating Susan Collins. It is not just about flipping the Senate back to a Democratic side,” Platner told the crowd. “It is about building in the state of Maine an organized working class power that we have not seen in generations.”
That’s appealing to Beth Paradis of Van Buren. She first met Platner at an Aroostook County Democrats meeting when he shared his interest in running before he’d officially announced, accompanied by gubernatorial hopeful Troy Jackson, who Paradis said she used to babysit. 
“He was like a normal person,” Paradis said of Platner, comparing him to Jackson. “He knows what it’s like to be me, to live check to check, and wondering how I’m gonna get through the winter.”
Paradis said she had voted for Collins until the last time Collins was up for reelection in 2020. “Now, I think she’s totally lost her way,” she said, before adding the caveat, “We’re in a very, very heavy Collins area. I’m careful.”
A senator from The County
While those who turned out Saturday knew of Platner, the candidate hasn’t exactly broken through with Aroostook Republicans. Shane Hill of Caribou had no idea who Platner was, or any of Collins’ challengers for that matter.
Hill, the facilities maintenance manager for the Mi’kmaq Nation, explained that his party affiliation accounts for some of why he continues to support Collins. He’s business-minded, he said, and wants an elected official who promotes self-sufficiency, which he tied back to the Wabanaki Nations’ fight for tribal sovereignty. (Recognizing tribal sovereignty is a main plank of Platner’s campaign.)

While Hill said he’s generally a proponent of term limits, he believes Collins’ long tenure is ultimately beneficial because “just to have the recognition, being a little spot on the map, it helps us.”
“She is from the area, that gives her a bit of buy-in for us,” Hill said. 
It’s also a matter of understanding the way of life in The County. If Congress is voting on a measure related to heating oil, he gave as an example, those from farther south don’t personally understand the implications for many of their constituents. 
“They’ve never shoveled snow off of their roof in Caribou,” said Hill, whose neighbor happens to be Collins’ brother. Everyone knows each other, he explained. That’s true of the Mik’maq Nation but also the broader community. 
Despite being geographically large, The County has comparatively few residents as much of it is forest. And Collins’ history cannot be separated from the history of the area. 
Founded by her ancestors in 1844, Collins’ family lumber business, S.W. Collins, touts the slogan “the pioneer lumber yard.” Samuel Collins, the first in the family to come to the area, is described in archives as a “poor collector of debts,” giving credit freely to help others get their start. 
Four generations of Collins family members, including Samuel, served in the Maine Legislature, also proving staying power by being elected for multiple terms, similar to Susan Collins today. And, locally, both of Collins’ parents served as mayor of Caribou.

Will present concerns trump hometown ties? 
Hometown appeal is what led Alison Willette of Houlton to vote for Collins in the past, even though she’s been a registered Democrat since she was old enough to vote. 
Now, Willette, who grew up in Linneus, said, “I am horrified to admit that I have voted for her in the past, just trusting that she’s from The County… so she must be great and she must understand our way of life up here.” 
Before 2024, Willette described herself as a “lazy voter.” The turning point for her to get more involved in politics was Trump’s reelection, which she described as terrifying for a number of reasons, notably cuts to health care as part of Trump’s signature legislative achievement.
She knows the failures of the system intimately as a mother of three who works as a nurse at the Houlton County Jail, which is affiliated with Houlton Regional Hospital. 
In May, Houlton Regional Hospital closed its labor and delivery department. It now has no provider for obstetric care. Throughout this year, Waldo Hospital in Belfast, Mount Desert Island Hospital in Bar Harbor and Northern Light Inland Hospital in Waterville also ended all of their maternity services.
Willette’s concern, she said, is exacerbated by the fact that Northern Light Health, which essentially has a monopoly on health care in The County, and the insurance company Anthem haven’t been able to reach an agreement to keep the system’s hospitals and doctors within the insurer’s network.
Willette did not attend the town hall, but Platner echoed many of her concerns, including calling out the Northern Light and Anthem dispute when criticizing the U.S. for its poor health outcomes despite spending more on health care than other developed nations. 
“We just have what might be the most inefficient system of providing health care that you could possibly think of, and the reason we have it is because it was built to make a couple rich people even richer,” Platner said.

Medicare for All is a fundamental plank of Platner’s campaign. It’s a key reason George Gartley of Presque Isle, a retired nurse who now relies on Medicare, is drawn to him. The Affordable Care Act gave Americans breathing room, he said, but it didn’t fix the system. 
“With the shutdown, they finally got some balls,” Gartley said of Democrats, “but it’s almost too little, too late.”
Friday night before the town hall, an agreement to reopen the federal government failed again, for the fourth time. Democrats are holding out support to try to get Republicans to extend the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidies that lower the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, including tens of thousands in Maine.  
Last month, Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, told Maine Morning Star that she supports extending the credit but believed it should be addressed outside a must-pass spending bill. 
Turning Trump’s message on its head
In a city and county where there are more unenrolled voters than those affiliated with the Democratic Party, Platner will have to appeal to more than this already enthusiastic Democratic base, especially given Maine’s semi-open primaries.  
In 2024, Maine switched from a closed primary system — when only voters enrolled in a party can vote in that party’s primary — to one that allows unenrolled voters to vote in a party’s primary, though members of another party cannot. 
Collins will effectively clear the Republican field once she officially announces, which could lead to many unenrolled Mainers voting in the Democratic primary because it’ll be the only game in town for the U.S. Senate race.
“Depending on how many of those voters do that, that could have an impact on the outcome,” said Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine. He wonders if this will encourage candidates to adjust their campaign strategy to try and talk to those unenrolled voters.










This race, for me, is not just about beating Susan Collins. It is not just about flipping the Senate back to a Democratic side. It is about building in the state of Maine an organized working class power that we have not seen in generations.


– Graham Platner, candidate for U.S. Senate


When Maine Morning Star asked Platner about his pitch to unenrolled voters, he said, “It’s the exact same.” 
“Look, at the end of the day, I don’t care if you’re an independent or Republican or Democrat in the state of Maine,” Platner said. “If you work for a living, you know for a fact that you’re getting screwed. And you know that we have a political system that is run by establishment politicians who have been screwing you. The pitch is: let’s stop doing that.”
That pitch is working for some people who have historically voted for different parties on the same ticket. 
Bill Bartlett of Danforth was raised in a Republican family and has voted for both Republicans and Democrats, though he said that was before he stopped voting for a while. That changed during the last presidential election when he voted for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. 
Bartlett volunteered at Platner’s town hall in Caribou, as well as one earlier Saturday in Houlton that drew about 100 people. It’s the first time he’s ever volunteered for a political campaign. 
“This is the first time I’ve heard someone worth campaigning for,” Bartlett said.
As Bartlett shared his enthusiasm for Platner, his wife Holly Gilleo was busy assigning tasks to other volunteers, often taking breaks to dance, exclaiming how energized she was by Platner’s campaign. Gilleo, a Democrat, had previously been a Republican but described herself as a “never Trumper.” 
Fueled by polarization, the country overall has seen Senate outcomes become more aligned with presidential results. However, Maine voters have bucked the trend and continued to split tickets.

Between the 2016 and 2020 Senate elections, Maine was the only state to vote for Senate and presidential candidates of opposite parties. Many Mainers’ split tickets again in 2024, when Trump won reelection. 
Many Mainers who voted for Trump told Maine Morning Star at the time that they believed he would solve their affordability concerns, such as high taxes and food prices, but also that they were just exasperated with the status quo. 
Both are appeals Platner has been relying on so far, though he’s made his opposition to Trump abundantly clear.  
While Platner’s progressive policy positions may not necessarily be appealing to a lot of Republican or unenrolled voters, Brewer said, stylistically Platner might be a better fit for those voters than an establishment candidate, whether it’s Mills or Collins.
“A relatively big part of Trump’s appeal is, and has always been, this anti-establishment outsider — ‘I’m going to stand up for the average person in a way that typical political insiders don’t,’” he said.
For that reason, some people are fans of both Trump and Sanders of Vermont, an independent and self-described democratic socialist. Sanders has endorsed Platner and joined him for a Labor Day rally in Portland in September.   
Platner made a direct comment about reaching Trump voters on Saturday, telling attendees, “We need to be there with open arms to welcome back many of our neighbors who were lied to.”
Referring to Trump supporters, he said, “They’ve been robbed of access to real information, and through that, they’ve been robbed of their empathy and their compassion.” 
He continued, “But I honestly don’t think that many of them did it willingly. I think people are misinformed. I think people are propagandized, but I don’t think people are stupid. I think at its core, people know that they’re being screwed. And Donald Trump came along with a message that that was true.”
Democrats did not have the answers to that anger, Platner said. Now he hopes everyone can get behind pointing fingers at “the oligarchy,” which he said includes Collins. 
And, placing himself firmly on the opposite side of the small elite group in power, he added, “What’s amazing to me is I’m continually told to not use that word because somehow people aren’t supposed to know what it means. And yet, every single time I use that word, everybody cheers. So, I assume we’re a bit more literate than the political class actually thinks we are.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)The Denver mayor’s newly released 2026 budget makes one thing clear: Denver faces hard choices.
A projected $200 million deficit is forcing cuts across the city, including a reduction of about 6% in spending. Every Denverite knows that in tough times, families and businesses have to tighten their belts. But in the mayor’s scramble to balance the books, he has made a dangerous misstep that needs to be called out. Attempting to cut the independent agencies that do not answer to the mayor, especially those that keep city hall honest, is a damaging precedent.
Both Clerk and Recorder Paul López and Auditor Timothy O’Brien recently raised alarms about the mayor’s budget proposal. López warned that a reduction could translate into fewer ballot drop boxes, longer lines at polling places, and slower election results. O’Brien accused the mayor of interfering with charter-protected independence and warned that “forcing budget cuts for this office is short-sighted; it sets a dangerous precedent.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
They are right to sound the alarm. These are intentionally independent agencies so no mayor could tilt the playing field or muzzle the watchdog.
The Denver Auditor’s Office is tasked with scrutinizing city contracts, construction projects, technology systems, program performance and city spending. It is empowered to challenge whether taxpayer dollars are being used effectively and appropriately.
The clerk and recorder administers the free and fair elections that give Denver residents their most fundamental right as Americans.
When funding is reduced for either, the consequences are real. An auditor with fewer staff conducts fewer audits or is forced to cut corners, leaving waste or mismanagement unaddressed. A clerk with diminished resources may have to scale back voter access.
The office of Mayor Mike Johnston has argued that “every agency must share in the sacrifice.” That talking point reflects a deep misunderstanding of the checks and balances of government and ignores the fact that oversight is not a passive function that can be slashed or disregarded. Cutting watchdogs to close a budget gap is like balancing a family budget by canceling health insurance. You might save money in the short-term, but you face greater risks in the long-term.
The risk here is not just about a single budget proposal. It is about precedent. If a mayor can force cuts on the auditor or clerk, then every future mayor will feel entitled to do the same. Independence that voters deliberately wrote into the charter becomes meaningless if it can be undone by the budget process. The auditor needs to be able to call out mismanagement, waste, abuse and fraud without fear of reprisal. Once that boundary is blurred, it may never be restored.
None of this is to deny the reality of Denver’s fiscal challenges. Responsible government demands efficiencies and every agency should be expected to operate leanly. But that is not the same as deliberately weakening oversight or overstepping the bounds of independence. The right path is to cut redundancies, streamline processes, identify inefficiencies, and insist on smarter management.
The Denver City Council faces a critical decision. Members will have the opportunity to amend the mayor’s proposal and to weigh the short-term savings against the long-term costs. If the mayor insists on pressing ahead, it is up to City Council to defend the independence voters demanded when they created the Denver Auditor’s Office and the clerk and recorder.
Denver is right to have a conversation about fiscal responsibility, but responsibility is not achieved by silencing accountability. Families do not balance their budgets by turning off smoke alarms. Cities cannot balance theirs by stripping resources from offices that ensure our city is working for the people. We need strong, independent watchdogs. It’s non-negotiable.
Denver can balance its books without undermining accountability. That is the only responsible path forward.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)During my recent twin pregnancy, pain and discomfort were constant companions. Early on I had three separate episodes of heavy bleeding. Certain conditions can cause bleeding, including miscarriage, something I’ve experienced four times before. 
Fortunately I was able to carry my twins for 37 weeks, but it was hard, I got sick with a fever, and there were times I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get out of bed from pain. I took acetaminophen only when my doctor said it was appropriate and only when the pain was unbearable.
That wasn’t impulsive, it was evidence-based care. Which is why the current administration’s sweeping warnings that pregnant women shouldn’t take acetaminophen are not just reckless; they’re dangerous.
Blanket pronouncements from politicians flatten nuance into fear. They don’t sit with the patient who hasn’t slept from back and pelvic pain. They don’t weigh the risks of untreated fever. They don’t field the midnight calls from women scared to swallow a tablet their own OB recommended.
I lived that fear. After years marked by miscarriage, a fatal fetal diagnosis, and the trauma of delivering a baby I knew would never cry, I have learned to ask careful, specific questions and to follow medical guidance exactly. I shouldn’t have to second-guess my doctor because a podium statement turned a routine medication into a moral toughness test.

I know what happens when politics crowds the exam room. In past pregnancies, I navigated laws that pushed care later and made every decision feel suspect. Now, a simple, clinically sound choice, taking acetaminophen for severe pain or a fever, gets recast as irresponsible. That stigma doesn’t protect anyone. It isolates patients, handcuffs clinicians, and replaces informed consent with confusion.
If leaders want to help, they can fund maternal health, expand access to obstetric care, and align public guidance with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, not undermine safe, standard treatments with sound bites. Respect for life includes respect for accurate information.
We deserve to share our struggles openly and to receive care grounded in evidence, not ideology. 
I will not apologize for following my doctor’s advice. I will not accept a politics that makes women choose between untreated pain and public shaming. 
Women are capable of making careful, informed decisions with their physicians. That is the correct chain of command in health care, patient and doctor, not politician and microphone.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The Washington Bridge audit report cast a harsh spotlight on the state officials and transportation employees who failed to notice or remedy the highway’s deteriorating condition. 
Still in the shadows: whoever leaked a portion of the analysis on Instagram on Sept. 26, prompting Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha to publish the entire 64-page report online that night on his office’s website.
“I felt it was better for the real article to be out there than some outlet dribbling it out in dribs and drabs, creating chaos around it,” Neronha said in an unrelated press conference on Sept. 30. “It had gotten to the point where it can be manipulated when that happens. I thought, the best way to handle this is just for you to see the real article.”
Neronha identified the account, “What’s Going On In Rhode Island,” that first published an excerpt of the report. But he did not name the person or people, because there are none listed on the Instagram page, nor its corresponding website and Facebook page. Online forms offer a chance to submit news tips or propose business ads without any contact information. A 2025 business incorporation filing with the Rhode Island Department of State lists a business development service, with an office in Pawtucket, as the resident agent for the Delaware-based LLC.
Rhode Island Current contacted the account through its Instagram page and website. The Instagram page sent an automated reply, but no person followed up.  
Despite, or perhaps because of its anonymity, the social media platform has a wide reach: 232,000 followers, with several thousand likes on some posts and dozens of comments. Described as “Rhode Island life,” the account features photos of iconic local landmarks side-by-side with pets available for adoption, recently sold homes, traffic updates and short news reports.
The post that set off the audit’s release came just after 8:30 a.m. on Sept. 26. The first image shows the bridge’s graffiti-splattered underside, with headshots of Gov. Dan McKee and Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti. Bold red-backed type declares “EXCLUSIVE.”
The accompanying 390-word description promises to share parts of the forensic report over the next few weeks before releasing the entire document.
“No other media outlet in RI has access to the report,” the post stated. 
A Sept. 26 post on the What’s Going in Rhode Island Instagram account was the first leak of the now-public Washington Bridge audit report. (Screenshot)
Exclusive? Maybe not.
That same day, reporters at WPRI-TV 12 were working feverishly to authenticate the document, which had been leaked to the station separately. WPRI posted a full story, outlining the findings report and including comments from McKee and other state officials, at 6:39 p.m.
Neronha published the entire document moments earlier, despite his belief that the findings should have been kept private because it’s part of the state’s lawsuit against various contractors who worked on the bridge. 
The complaint seeking damages for the state’s losses from the bridge closure is tentatively scheduled to go to trial in late 2027.
“You don’t try your case in the press,” Neronha said. “We’re not going to put 30,000 pages of discovery up on a website for uninvolved experts to opine on, so when it’s time to pick a jury we can’t find anybody who can sit on it. There’s too much at stake here.”










We’re not going to put 30,000 pages of discovery up on a website for uninvolved experts to opine on, so when it’s time to pick a jury we can’t find anybody who can sit on it. There’s too much at stake here. 


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha


That’s the same explanation McKee and Alviti have shared when asked why the state held on to the highly-anticipated document for more than a year after its completion.
Amid outrage over the bridge’s closure, McKee repeatedly promised a “day of reckoning,” which included unveiling the findings of the state-commissioned forensic audit. He stopped publicly referencing the report soon after the Virginia-based consulting firm finished the April 2024 draft.  
But news outlets continued to pester the state about the highly-anticipated analysis, which documents nearly two decades of inspections and repairs to the cantilever bridge — including multiple warnings about its worsening condition that went ignored.
The report doesn’t call out McKee, Alviti, or other state officials by name, though it makes clear that a host of longstanding problems with the cantilever bridge demanded attention.
“Many of the issues highlighted in this report show that program managers, bridge inspectors, and designers should have and could have been aware of problems that were developing,” the report states.

The blame game 
The expose prompted swift and mounting criticism against McKee and Alviti, both for the negligence on the bridge, and in keeping an unflattering depiction of their leadership veiled from public view. 
Among the critics is the person or people behind “What’s going on in Rhode Island,” which often uses its platform to suggest duplicitous or manipulative behavior on the part of state officials.
Take, for example, a July 25 post. It begins with a straightforward recap of the widely reported news that the state amended its contract for the bridge demolition to expand the scope of work — with an extra $38.4 million cost. Then, it shifts to a series of questions:

“Will the demo change order actually cost $38.4 million, or is the real cost closer to $10 million, leaving a potential $28.4 million windfall for the contractor?” 


“How much of this $38.4 million change order will find its way back into the pockets of the people that awarded the work, or obtained the grants? 


“What else could we spend this money on to improve our infrastructure?”

There is no evidence cited to back up this line of questioning.
Similarly, the Sept. 26 post about the audit report draws upon four select pages about bridge inspections, along with 2019 concept drawings for a bridge replacement, to pose a series of questions implicating RIDOT and its contractors in the bridge’s degradation.

“Why did RIDOT want to replace the bridge in 2019?” 


“Was VHB legally bound to inform the Barletta/Aetna Joint venture that they had done this work prior to joining them on the phase 2 work?” 


“Who paid AECOM to lie for the state?” 

It ends with a tease of what’s to come.
“We dig deeper next week into this politically motivated cash-cow of a bridge.”
While the full report is now available online — and widely reported by news outlets statewide — the Instagram account continues to post “exclusives” about the findings, including a series of emails between the audit report’s authors posted to its website on Friday. 
In the same post, the account also defended its publishing of the materials, noting that the firm hired to audit the bridge was never classified as an expert witness in the state’s case against the contractors.
“AG Peter Neronha is a smart man. He knows what he is doing. He paved the way for the WJE report to be leaked, then quickly added it to his page as soon as it was. Why? The timing wasn’t great for potential political opponents, so….”
Neronha denied that he or his team were involved in the leak during a Sept. 30 interview with WPRO’s Gene Valicenti.
The post continues by criticizing “investigative journalists,” who it claims choose not to run stories because of ties to the state government. A previous post, published Oct. 1, also alleges that local media in Rhode Island get paid by the state government, creating leverage for government officials to kill unflattering stories about them by threatening to pull state funding to their outlets.
This is not correct.

Drawing a line 
Traditional journalism and anonymous, social media-based content are different — most importantly in the process that leads up to publishing a story or piece of content. 
“If a legitimate news outlet is going to get this document, they’re going to vet it to find out if it’s genuine,” said Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University and national media commentator. “They’re going to give government officials a chance to comment, and give them a chance to make their case that ‘you shouldn’t report this.’ It’s the ethical thing to do.”
Tim White, Target 12 investigative reporter and managing editor, offered a glimpse of what happened in his newsroom after it obtained the leaked audit report during a Sept. 30 panel event hosted by The Boston Globe’s Rhode Map. While the document sent to the station looked official, White and his coworkers did not want to publish it without confirmation that it was the real thing.
“If your mother says she loves you, check it out,” White said, referring to the beloved adage among reporters on the importance of confirmation.










If a legitimate news outlet is going to get this document, they're going to vet it to find out if it’s genuine.


– Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University and national media commentator


The What’s Going On in Rhode Island account did not explain how it got the report, or whether it first sought to verify its authenticity. The first time Neronha was asked to confirm if the leaked document was real was when White called him that afternoon, he said.
The Target 12 story, and subsequent articles by other mainstream news outlets, including Rhode Island Current, feature comments from McKee, and related state officials. What’s Going On in Rhode Island does not indicate in any of its posts that it asked for comment from any state officials or outside experts.
Still, that doesn’t diminish its value in Kennedy’s eyes.
“This anonymous account performed a service in getting this information out there,” he said. 
The source not being a traditional journalist or news publication was far less important than the content it provided, and prompted in turn from state officials, he said.
First Amendment protections
While Neronha has made clear he’s not happy that the information was forced out, he acknowledged the leaker didn’t violate court rules.
“If anyone bears the risk here, it’s me,” Neronha said during his appearance on WPRO. “I am the one who put it on our website.”
Indeed, there’s a deep and strong history of constitutional protections for anonymous speech that would make it difficult to sanction the Instagram account, said Justin Silverman, executive director for the New England First Amendment Coalition. 
Like Kennedy, Silverman was glad to have the information made public despite state officials’ insistence that it compromised the legal case.
“Generally, those in government are often arguing that there are documents that shouldn’t be released,” Silverman said. “That doesn’t necessarily make it true.” 
However, Silverman added that who publishes the information — and more importantly, the motives in doing so — still matters.
“One of the benefits of having that information come from a newsroom is that if the information turns out to be false, we know who to hold accountable,” Silverman said.
Neronha told Valicenti that he thinks he knows who’s behind the Instagram account, which his team has been “monitoring” for over a year.
“But I don’t spend too much time worrying about it,” Neronha said.

Amanda Batten are squaring off in a high-stakes rematch for Virginia’s House District 71. (Photos courtesy of campaigns)In Virginia’s House District 71, Democrat Jessica Anderson and Republican Del. Amanda Batten are back for a rematch that was decided by just 667 votes in 2023. With control of the House in play, the stakes — and the spending — are markedly higher this fall.
Redistricting turned the district into one of Virginia’s truest swing seats, combining historic Williamsburg, established neighborhoods in James City County, and the fast-growing suburbs of New Kent. The mix of a university town, suburban bedroom communities, and booming exurbs has reshaped both the politics and commuter patterns of the Peninsula’s western edge, making the district a priority for both parties.
The contrasts across the district drive its competitiveness: New Kent is now one of Virginia’s fastest-growing localities, Williamsburg’s economy is powered by the College of William & Mary and Colonial Williamsburg, and James City sits in between, balancing suburban growth and long-time residents. Those cross-pressures have fueled debates over housing costs, school capacity, wages in a tourism-heavy economy and traffic along I-64 — all issues central to this year’s campaign.
Politically, 2023 underscored just how narrow the margins are here. Batten finished with 50.9% to Anderson’s 49.1%, a districtwide spread of 18,152 to 17,485. It was one of the closest House races in the state — and a clear signal that modest swings in Williamsburg turnout or New Kent persuasion can flip the seat.
The cash chase reflects the district’s importance. According to data from the Virginia Public Access Project, Anderson has raised $741,837 so far in the 2025 cycle, compared with Batten’s $443,718 — a reversal of 2023, when Anderson was outspent two to one. Statewide coverage has repeatedly listed House District 71 among the key races likely to shape the House majority this fall.
Early voting has also fueled the “tipping-point” narrative. Republican-leaning districts jumped out to an initial turnout edge, while competitive seats like House District-71 are being watched daily for movement as absentee and in-person totals update. 
Since last year, Batten has helped organize an informal “Purple Caucus” of Republicans in swing districts, part message shop and part defensive line for incumbents on competitive turf. Anderson, meanwhile, has leveraged name ID from 2023 and a larger volunteer corps to scale up paid communication she largely lacked last time.
 Jessica Anderson

The Democratic nominee casts herself as a grounded candidate rooted in the experience of her district. A lifelong Virginian and longtime Williamsburg/James City County resident, Anderson has worked in the front office of a local elementary school while raising two daughters. She says those roles — as parent, neighbor and community member — shape how voters see her.
“People know me outside of a political hat, and they know my heart,” she said in a recent interview with The Mercury. “There is this concept that I don’t know the issues, and once people meet me and really hear me articulate it, they realize real fast that what they’ve heard is wrong.”
Anderson’s story often returns to her experience of divorce in 2014, losing health coverage and relying on Medicaid and SNAP benefits. “That was life-saving,” she said, “but the programs aren’t set up to really help you be successful.” She emphasized that experience informs her focus on health care affordability and protecting Medicaid.
In 2023, Anderson mounted what she calls a “very grassroots campaign,” knocking on more than 6,000 doors but running without TV or digital ads. This time, she says, the caucus is investing in her race, her own fundraising has surged, and volunteers are plentiful. “We are on TV, we are on digital, we are in mailboxes,” she said.
Education is central to Anderson’s platform. She argues the state’s funding formula is outdated, pushing for reforms that would add early childhood education for 3- and 4-year-olds, expand pre-K, and strengthen incentives for teacher pay and retention. She noted Williamsburg/James City County already has infrastructure through its Bright Beginnings program that could be scaled up.
Anderson also highlighted challenges in K-12 transportation, citing her own daughter’s 0.7-mile walk to a bus stop. “That’s unacceptable,” she said, urging the state to lift support caps and raise pay for bus drivers and other support staff.
In the district’s tourism-heavy economy, Anderson supports raising the minimum wage to $15 statewide, but notes that in parts of Virginia, even $20 to $23 an hour may be necessary. She wants to ensure small businesses have a seat at the table while also arguing that “raising the tide” helps all.
On housing, she advocates for first-time homebuyer grants, incentives for retirees to downsize, and revitalization of vacant properties. She also calls for regulatory tweaks to expand supply. On infrastructure, she emphasized accountability in the I-64 widening project and closer cooperation with VDOT.
Anderson pledges to protect reproductive rights, supporting Newport News Democratic Del. Cia Price’s contraception bills and a constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion access. “Any delegate that votes against any of these constitutional amendments is telling on themselves, because they don’t trust voters,” she said.
Anderson also supports universal background checks and stronger safe-storage laws for firearms, citing the 2023 case in Newport News where a 6-year-old shot his teacher. 
“Accessibility to firearms should be protected in state law, but we should have the highest penalty for families or guardians who do not maintain that,” she said.
If elected, Anderson said her first bill would be to expand early childhood education funding, ideally with bipartisan support. 
Her turnout strategy, she said, is to energize Williamsburg’s Democratic base, persuade voters in New Kent, and win swing precincts in James City. Early voting, she added, has the bonus of “removing yourself from being inundated by the campaigns at large.”
 Amanda Batten

Amanda Batten has represented the area since 2019 and is seeking her third full term. A James City County resident, she previously served as a legislative aide before winning election. She is now chair of the House Republican Caucus, a role she says sharpens her understanding of bills while allowing colleagues to rely on her for policy briefings.
“As far as signature accomplishments, frankly, a lot of it has to do with my role in leadership,” she told The Mercury in a recent interview. “I read every bill that goes up on the floor, I listen to what my constituents are asking for, and I carry those bills.” Recently, that has included a proposal to reform foster care placement and bills for law enforcement.
Batten emphasized that her leadership role in her caucus and her representation of her district are distinct. “I represent my constituents, and there’s a period at the end of that sentence,” she said. “We don’t take caucus positions … every member is free to vote independently.”
Batten highlighted New Kent’s rapid growth and said her experience in James City allows her to advise constituents on how to prepare. On housing, she supports reducing regulatory costs she said add about 25% to home prices and favors leaving zoning to localities. She opposes limits on investor home purchases, saying it’s not a concern that’s raised locally.
On transportation, she noted progress on I-64 widening and expects it to remain a state priority, rejecting tolls as an option. She also points to the upcoming 250th anniversary celebration as a tourism driver and touted her relationships with William & Mary leadership.
Batten favors economic incentives and site readiness to attract private-sector jobs, citing the AutoZone distribution center in New Kent as a success. 
On data centers, she anticipates the state will need to regulate energy and water use but encourages innovative power sourcing.
Batten supports public access to curriculum and library content and backs education savings accounts with guardrails, while opposing full vouchers. 
On abortion, she opposes the constitutional amendment as written, saying it could override parental notification and allow late-term abortions without sufficient limits. She supports exceptions for rape, incest, life of the mother and viability.
On gun policy, she defended the Second Amendment and said current background checks are adequate, though she wants stronger prosecution of misuse. 
On resilience, she warns against over-development in flood-prone areas and recommends leaving most land-use decisions local.
She said much of her funding comes from the party and national GOP organizations and favors transparency over contribution caps. If re-elected, she plans to reintroduce foster care reform bills.
Batten’s pitch is straightforward: “I have the experience of advocating successfully for legislation that benefits our district. It’s my home, and I’m very connected to my constituents.”

Still, one division is actively disputing the charge.
The Essex, Northumberland and Loudoun county school divisions’ misuse of federal money for special needs students became widely known after the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) investigated Loudoun County Public Schools in May. 
VDOE later confirmed to the Mercury that school divisions in the Essex and Northumberland counties had also been found in violation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This law requires school divisions to meet a Maintenance of Effort (MOE) obligation, which stipulates that spending on children with disabilities fueled by local or state funds not dip below the level of the preceding fiscal year. 
Essex, required to pay around $450,000, is disputing the agency’s claim, asserting that the shortfall calculation was substantially misreported due to a terminated employee’s error, a letter from the division’s attorney states. The division is currently conducting a forensic audit, but in the meantime, has requested that payment be held in escrow pending review and reconsideration of the division’s request.
 Essex schools responds, VSP investigation in Northumberland, Loudoun also navigating federal challenges

VDOE, in a letter to Essex, stated that it did not qualify for an allowable exception because the division was informed that it had previously received technical assistance, and if it had not met the MOE compliance, it would be required to repay the funds.
“Essex County Public Schools has paid its Maintenance of Effort penalty in protest, and is very hopeful that the Virginia Department of Education will either grant us an allowable exception or support our request for review of the penalty to the U.S. Department of Education,” said Scott Croxton, chairman of the Essex County School Board.
He later told the Mercury that the school division “doesn’t want to be on any list that implies that we’re not properly educating our special education population, because that’s just not true.” 
Loudoun, the largest of the three, was hit with the most significant bill of $28,997,133. Essex, with $451,036, and Northumberland, billed $243,607.80, represent a fraction of the size of Loudoun’s enrollment.
A VDOE spokesperson stated that the agency had not received any direct appeals or hearing requests from the three school divisions. The department would be responsible for considering any such case.
However, Essex’s attorney wrote in a letter to the agency that the division is submitting the payment “under protest” and not admitting liability to begin the process of requesting a review through the USDOE’s General Education Provisions Act hearing process with the assistance of VDOE. 
Croxton said VDOE was made aware that Essex lost five personnel through termination or departure who directly impacted the division’s special education program. The division said it also let the department know it has initiated an ongoing forensic audit in coordination with the Virginia State Police to investigate financial irregularities, including issues that may have affected special education spending and compromised the integrity and accuracy of the MOE data submitted. 
“Despite these challenges, ECPS has an exceptional leadership team and instructional staff in place, and tremendous achievement gains are being made,” Croxton said. “We firmly believe that our transition to a County-School Centralized Services model for financial and human resources functions will be a key component for improved fiscal oversight and stewardship of taxpayer dollars.”
Northumberland’s case comes as the Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Office of the Northumberland County Commonwealth’s Attorney conduct an “inquiry,” or preliminary review gathering and assessing information to determine if further action is warranted, according to Jessica Shehan, a VSP spokesperson.
In Loudoun, the school board agreed to repay its funds after reports revealed an accounting mistake that led to some of the funding being used for English Learner (EL) programs. 
“Historical support of special education services has not been impacted nor will current and future special education services be impacted,” said Sharon Willoughby, LCPS chief financial officer, in a presentation to the school board at an Aug. 12 meeting, adding that spending on special education students continues year-over-year.
Willoughby said last spring was the first time VDOE conducted an in-person fiscal compliance review. The division was also surprised, given its years of successful compliance submissions to VDOE. 
“I don’t know what the catalyst of that was, but that’s what started this whole process,” Willoughby said at the business meeting. 
The repayment case has also raised concerns among school board members amid warnings the division could lose other federal funding after the U.S. Department of Education determined LCPS violated Title IX and retaliated against male students. That determination came after three male students expressed they felt “uncomfortable” when a student, who identified as male but was assigned female at birth, changed clothes in a boys’ locker room and recorded the event.
Loudoun, along with five other school divisions in Northern Virginia, is also being targeted for its transgender policies. School divisions in Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, and Prince William have also faced scrutiny.
The Mercury contacted Loudoun and Northumberland for comment, but they did not respond.

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)RICHMOND, Va.—You might think the state that is the undisputed epicenter of global internet traffic has a leg up on managing the challenges of the artificial intelligence arms race.
So far, it’s not working out that way.
Nationwide, that push by Silicon Valley is gobbling up energy, increasing average customers’ electricity bills and threatening progress on decarbonization. In Virginia, data-center developers warned the utility Dominion Energy at the end of last year that their upcoming projects would need 40 gigawatts of electricity—the energy equivalent of increasing Virginia’s households nearly fourfold.
Dominion plans to respond by building more natural gas power plants, which could raise utility bills for households and businesses both here and beyond the Mid-Atlantic state.
Virginia’s legislators certainly took notice. At least 33 unique bills were introduced in the last session to address various data-center dilemmas, an Inside Climate News analysis found.
“We are practically providing data centers for the entire world and I don’t want that cost to be borne by ratepayers in my district,” said state Del. Shelly Simonds, a Democrat representing the port city of Newport News.
But almost all of the bills ran aground, meeting cumulative resistance from tech businesses, local governments, labor unions and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
Of the four that made it into law, only two were more than a symbolic measure.
The data-center growth spurt was already putting pressure on the state’s power supplies before this year. Virginia overtook California, the most populous state, in 2023 to emerge as the top importer of electricity, driven by rapid growth in commercial power consumption.
That means the impact of Virginia’s data-center decisions extends to the wider region. It shares an interconnected grid with much of the Mid-Atlantic, and that grid’s operator is increasingly under pressure from state governors as costs spike.
“Virginia cannot produce the amount of power needed for the data centers, so we’re going to have to pipe in power from neighboring states. And if Maryland is enhancing its grid and building infrastructure, then odds are Marylanders are going to be paying for that when the power is coming here,” said Del. Ian Lovejoy, who sponsored four data-center bills last session, none of which passed.
The skyrocketing power demand is also creating hurdles for the state’s ambitions to completely wean its two largest electric utilities off planet-warming fossil fuels in the next few decades. Many data centers also have on-site diesel generators that are meant for backup power but are being run more frequently, worsening air quality and prompting noise complaints from residents.
As a result, “the rapid growth of data centers [has] surpassed all environmental issues in Virginia practically, so it’s something that demands our attention,” Simonds said.
But the failure last session of nearly all 33 bills on the subject, most without even getting a hearing, underscores the challenge of legislating on data centers in a state home to the greatest number of them.
 Legislative roadblocks

The most ambitious of the five data-center bills that the Virginia General Assembly passed was vetoed by Youngkin.
That bill would have required jurisdictions considering a data-center proposal to mandate a noise study if the site is close to homes and schools, and to review with the local utility any electric substation upgrades that would be needed.
The majority of bills, 22, never even made it out of committee. That’s the stage where a bill must get approval from a smaller group of legislators before it advances to the full chamber.

Some of the bills had bipartisan backing. But interviews with a dozen state lawmakers pointed to a range of hurdles—chief among them a muscular lobbying effort by tech companies as well as the fraught politics of treading on the decision-making domain of local officials.
Nineteen of the 33 bills were primarily sponsored by Democrats, while Republicans were the primary sponsors of the other 14. Geography, rather than politics, helps explain who pushed for change.
“In areas that are affected most egregiously by overdevelopment of data centers, you have bipartisan support for regulation,” said Lovejoy. The Republican’s district covers part of Prince William County where a local rezoning fight is unfolding over an upcoming 1,700-acre data center corridor.
“It’s when you move away from the blast zone of the impact of the data centers, people become less concerned,” Lovejoy said.
The legislative proposals covered a variety of issues: improving transparency, reforming tax incentives, protecting ratepayers, increasing state oversight and overhauling data-center siting and zoning.
Two bills that would have required data centers to disclose their often-massive water and power usage died in committee. Another seven bills that sought to change the tax incentives for data centers—some by requiring clean energy use, higher energy-efficiency or wage minimums—also all died in committee.
A handful of bills sought to explicitly protect ratepayers from bearing the costs of infrastructure that will be built to accommodate data-center growth. Under the current system, everyone pays. Two of those measures got merged, and variants passed in the House and the Senate. But the chambers could not resolve the differences.
One ratepayer-protection measure did make it into law, and it’s a meaningful change—but only for the roughly 700,000 customers served by the state’s nonprofit electric co-operatives, a fraction of the total customer base in Virginia. The new law creates a path for the co-ops to create an affiliate to serve large electricity users in order to reduce their impact on average ratepayers.
Of three bills attempting to increase state oversight, one became law—after an amendment wiped out nearly all the extra oversight it would have brought.
The original version would have required electric utilities to create a separate classification for data-center customers. The enacted version requires the state utility regulator to exercise authority it already has: to determine whether existing customer classifications are reasonable when considering rate increase requests from Dominion or Appalachian Power Co., the state’s biggest electric utilities.
Dominion now has a rate case before that regulator, the State Corporation Commission, with the powerful utility and big tech companies squabbling over what fair rates for data centers should be.
“The issue is none of this stuff has enough teeth,” said Del. Michelle Maldonado, a Prince William County Democrat who voted for the weakened bill and had sponsored one of her own that stalled. “What ultimately got passed was a significantly watered-down version.”

Del. Irene Shin, a Fairfax County Democrat, proposed the bill about the State Corporation Commission. She thinks the law it became sends “a clear signal to the SCC with what the General Assembly wants them to do.”
Those wants include “safeguards that protect ratepayers like your normal, average Virginia family, and prioritize their protections over what the big corporations need,” Shin said, “because we’re talking about billion-dollar corporations, multi-billion-dollar corporations that can absolutely afford to pay the cost of getting the energy that they need.”
Her region is taking a hit from the Trump administration’s big cutbacks to federal employment, and she’s worried about further economic consequences to residents from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Adding the proposed increase to Dominion customers of about $20 every month for typical households starting next year, she said, is “insane.”
Del. David Reid, a Democrat who represents part of Loudoun County, sponsored two of the four data-center bills that made it to the finish line.
The first offers an incentive for large electricity users to install battery storage.
He also sponsored legislation to build transmission lines with advanced conductor technology to deliver power more efficiently. What ultimately made it into law was diluted from a requirement to a suggestion: to “consider the prudency of using advanced conductors.”
“I was probably trying to accomplish much more in the earlier version, and then you get to the point where it’s like, OK, we can all agree to this this year,” Reid said, pointing to varying perspectives that crop up during the session. “The process works. It’s just that sometimes, in Virginia, it doesn’t work very fast.”
Over a dozen bills, more than for any other data-center issue, would have changed how localities handle siting and zoning for the facilities. None of them made it through.
One was vetoed. Another was voted down by the Senate. Two were turned down in committee, and the rest languished and expired without making it even that far.
The bill vetoed by Youngkin, which would have required a noise study and information about substation needs from data centers, had been more ambitious in an earlier iteration. Initially, the measure would have required details on the electricity generation within a locality that would serve any proposed data centers.
“The bill that we started with, that I wanted, does not look very much like the one that passed,” said Del. Josh Thomas, a Democrat representing parts of Prince William County, who sponsored the measure in the House.
In his explanation for vetoing it, Youngkin said the bill “limits local discretion and creates unnecessary red tape” and warned it “could chill investment and hinder economic development.”
“Do we need to make sure that citizen voices are heard? Yes,” the governor said afterward at an event announcing a $9 billion investment from Google. “Do we need to make sure that local leaders are empowered to make decisions about where they go? Yes. Should that be decided in Richmond? Absolutely not.”

Thomas said his constituents are frustrated about seemingly inexplicable siting decisions being made locally, and they wanted state intervention.
“The current Republican administration in Virginia has made it very clear that they are unabashedly and, at times, irrationally pro-data center,” Thomas said. “Why we would continuously build industrial sites that have diesel generators on top by schools is beyond me but yet the industry keeps pushing to have that happen.”
 Following the money

The downfall of data-center legislation in Virginia speaks, in more ways than one, to the role of money in politics, advocates and state lawmakers told Inside Climate News. The state is among the minority of states that set no contribution limits on campaign finance.
“Nobody’s immune to taking a lot of money,” said Ashish Kapoor, senior energy and climate advisor with the Piedmont Environmental Council, an advocacy group.
Dominion, which opposed two of the data-center bills, is the top political donor in the state. The company contributed more than $13 million to both parties from 2024 through Aug. 31, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project. Powerful Silicon Valley giants have also poured money into the state in recent years, through the Data Center Coalition—which testified against many of the 33 bills—and associated political action committees.
The Data Center Coalition and Dominion Energy did not respond to requests for comment.
“Anything that makes it more difficult to lubricate the wheels of commerce from data-center development that people are making a lot of money off of is going to be met with the typical sorts of issues in subcommittees where some of these bills go to die,” Kapoor said.
Another source of pressure: localities that reap the financial benefits of this data-center growth.
“We essentially have inadvertently created a monstrous money-making machine for local governments,” said Simonds, the Newport News delegate. “A huge number of cities and localities across Virginia are lining up to have a data center because of the tax revenue.”
Loudoun County, for instance, collected $733 million, almost a third of its total tax revenue, from data centers in the 2023 fiscal year. That kind of revenue allows local governments to avoid taking the unpopular step of raising real estate taxes.
“There’s a lot of folks in rural parts of the state, we’re all for data centers,” said Del. Terry Kilgore, the Republican House minority leader representing parts of several counties in Southwest Virginia, an area that has struggled to recover from the downturn of coal.
The political cost for state lawmakers to be seen as stepping on the authority of localities is especially high during a big election year. Virginia, with a Democratically controlled Senate not up for election until 2027, will vote on a new governor and all 100 House of Delegate members in November.
“The General Assembly doesn’t like to get involved in local siting issues because they don’t want to open that can of worms, so to speak,” said Lovejoy, the Prince William County delegate.
The result is an uncoordinated system in which local decisions about data centers create fallout for the power grid that will affect everyone’s pocketbook if the state doesn’t intervene.
“It’s like an orchestra where you’ve got certain instruments playing loud and unwieldy and then you’ve got other areas where they’re not playing at all,” Simonds said. “We need somebody to be the conductor of this orchestra.”
There’s also an unlikely political alliance at play.
“You have businesses and unions agreeing on something. And that doesn’t happen that often. But it’s happening over data centers,” Lovejoy said.
The support of organized labor is largely coming from the construction trades and electrical workers’ unions. In Virginia, data centers support an estimated 74,000 jobs and generate $5.5 billion in labor income, according to a study by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.
Most of these jobs, however, don’t last beyond the construction stage. And “there are other unions that might be really concerned with what’s going on,” said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that seeks to hold companies and governments accountable on economic growth.
“For example, public sector unions might be concerned that the states are losing revenue and there’s less money” to hire teachers and firefighters, she said. Virginia forgoes close to $1 billion in yearly revenue over its tax exemptions to attract data centers.
The Virginia Economic Development Partnership contended there’s a 14 percent average annual local and state tax return on the exemption incentive for the years 2022 through 2027. But there’s spirited debate across the country about whether states dangling incentives would get this development either way. And that return on investment figure doesn’t account for the extra power costs.
Economic overdependence on data centers might also prompt companies with job-intensive investments to look elsewhere with more available power supplies, Tarczynska added.
 Climate and costs

The huge increase in expected demand for power is throwing a wrench in the state’s progress toward fulfilling its legal mandate of using 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050. The General Assembly set that target in the Virginia Clean Economy Act of 2020.
“You can’t have your cake and eat it too,” said Sen. Russet Perry, a Democrat whose district encompasses parts of Loudoun and Fauquier counties. “You can’t continue to not regulate and to sign off on these massive data centers, each one of which often requires more power than your average city, and simultaneously say, ‘OK, we’re going to get to 100 percent clean energy on this deadline.’”

Del. Rip Sullivan, a Fairfax County Democrat, was the primary sponsor of that clean-energy law in the House. He thinks all is not lost.
“I’m not blind to the fact that it makes the road steeper, makes the challenge harder,” he said. But “if we were to put as much energy—pardon the pun—political energy into accelerating the Clean Economy Act as some opponents that you see are putting into trying to kill it, if we put all that energy into trying to improve it and meet those goals, I have every confidence we could meet them.”
One of his bills this year, which made it through the legislature but was vetoed by the governor, would have set targets for how much energy storage capacity utilities must build or buy in the next couple of decades. If enacted, it would have been a market signal for energy storage companies to come to Virginia, he said.
Ratings from the regional grid operator show solar’s effective load carrying capacity, its ability to produce energy when it’s most needed, is as low as 33 percent without storage but as high as 75 percent when paired with it.
Asked for his views on battery storage, Youngkin cited the costs of the technology, supply chains dominated by China and “great alternatives” that are available.
“If people want to invest in battery storage, God bless them. All of the above—we need everything. But to mandate what the answer is based on misinformed facts, I firmly believe is a mistake,” Youngkin said.
Meanwhile, the way that electricity rates are set by utilities and approved by state regulators is putting a disproportionate burden on households and businesses.
“We are effectively seeing customers across the Mid-Atlantic subsidizing the electrical infrastructure that’s needed for Northern Virginia’s data centers,” said Cathy Kunkel, a North America energy consultant with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a  global think tank with a mission to accelerate the energy transition.
Multiple state lawmakers spoke of their constituents’ electric bills while explaining their motivations for sponsoring data-center legislation.
“You have certain counties getting rich and then in other places, like my city of Newport News, I have constituents hopping mad about their energy bills going up,” Simonds said.
Thomas, the Prince William County delegate, was also concerned about declining property values. “Residents who were living in an area first, and then a data center was built later, had pretty much lost their largest wealth-building tool, which is their home value that’s plummeted because now there’s an industrial building a hundred feet from their back deck,” he said.
Legislators hoping to raise oversight to shield their constituents aren’t giving up. Sen. Danica Roem, a Prince William County Democrat, said her work for the next session can begin with the 13 Senate members who voted for a water-protection bill introduced by Sen. Richard Stuart, a Republican who represents parts of the Middle Peninsula northeast of Richmond. They just need eight more votes to get the bill out of the Senate.
“I need to bring in four more Democrats. Richard needs to bring four more Republicans,” Roem said.
House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) and Senate Democrat majority leadership did not respond to requests for comment.
Ultimately, voters can influence what happens next.
“The pushback has to come from the ground and it has to come from the people,” Piedmont Environmental Council’s Kapoor said. “The more these legislators, whether they’re rural or urban, feel the pushback from their constituents, those [proposed bills] will have increasing resonance.”
From Sullivan’s perspective, it’s not too late for Virginia to chart a nation-leading course that avoids sticking residents with the tab for data centers, from their electric bills to the climate consequences.
“This is an immense challenge, and it is going to take a concerted effort to meet that challenge,” he said, “but the difficulty of the challenge should only embolden us rather than cause us to give up.”

Joro spider. Carly Mirabile, University of Georgia, Bugwood.org On top of everything else that’s going on, now Georgia is being invaded by giant spiders.
If you live in north Georgia, there’s a good chance you’ve come face to cephalothorax with the Joro spider in the last few years. The behemoth black and yellow arachnids hitched a ride to Georgia from East Asia around 2014 and have been growing in population ever since – last year’s count from the University of Georgia’s Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health turned up more than 2,200 spiders, up from around 1,900 the year before.
Joro spider distribution in the South. EDDMapS. 2025. Early Detection & Distribution Mapping System. The University of Georgia – Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health. Available online at http://www.eddmaps.org/; last accessed October 2, 2025.
The actual population is likely much higher. Female Joros, whose leg span can exceed three inches, lay up to 500 eggs at a time starting in mid-October.
The eight-legged critter’s bite poses no danger to people or pets, and they are inclined to flee rather than fight when disturbed, though that’s likely cold comfort to anyone unlucky enough to wander face-first into their thick, sticky webs on a dark front porch or forest trail.
The little pests also don’t appear to pose any threat to Georgia crops or to its ecosystem, but the keyword is appear, said Rebekah Wallace with UGA’s Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health.
“We don’t know that at this time. They’re still being researched,” she said.
With some invasive species like the honeybee-killing yellow-legged hornet, researchers know ahead of time that they are bad news.
“With Joro spiders, it wasn’t on the radar for most of the people doing this type of research,” Wallace said. “And so they’re still trying to understand what impacts they could be having. Whereas something that came in that is going to be a known impact on some of our crop species, they know ahead of time, ‘OK, this is going to impact this crop species, which is potentially going to have these economic impacts.’ But we didn’t have that kind of head start for Joro spiders.”
Citizens can help researchers track the spiders’ spread at jorowatch.org, which was developed by the University of Georgia, by filling out a form and attaching a photo.
Peak Joro spotting season lasts from August through October, and starting Monday and running through Oct. 12, people who submit Joro reports can enter their spider photos into a contest for bragging rights and spider stickers.
Wallace said the contest is a big help in collecting data – last year’s contest period brought in more than 500 confirmed reports.
Wallace said people often confuse Joros with a native species of spider called the golden silk orb weaver, but there are some ways to tell them apart.
For Joros, the adult female has an abdomen that is black on the back with a belly that is black and yellow and has an orange splotch towards the end of it. Their legs are usually black and yellow, but occasionally all black.
For golden silk orb weavers, the body is more orange with whitish, silvery spots, and the legs are yellow with brownish bands.
“And the bands have huge tufts of hair on them,” Wallace said about the orb weavers. “They look like they’re wearing leg warmers.”
Experts say some invasive bugs like the Spotted Lanternfly are too dangerous to be allowed to live and should be killed on sight, but the Joro is not in this category.

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)In the months since the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled that the state is underfunding its public schools, lawmakers have been divided over how to respond.
Democrats have called on the state to meet its court-ordered obligations. Republicans have denounced the ruling and said the court is infringing on the Legislature’s domain. But no detailed plans have been released. 
Now, one Republican says he has a possible answer: increase — and redistribute — statewide property taxes. 
At a committee hearing last week, Rep. Walter Spilsbury of Charlestown said he plans to file a bill next year to more than quadruple the Statewide Education Property Tax. Doing so would raise an extra $1 billion per year — enough, Spilsbury says, to satisfy the court’s requirements. 
The proposed bill, whose text has yet not been released, would expand the tax so residents across the state would pay about $5 per $1,000 in property valuation toward the SWEPT, according to Spilsbury. In total, the tax would raise about $1.5 billion per year, Spilsbury said. That amount could allow the state to distribute about $10,000 per student to public schools. 
That approach would be a major departure from the present system. Cities and towns must currently raise $363 million in SWEPT, not $1.5 billion. And the state currently pays out a base amount of $4,266 per pupil, not $10,000.
In August, in its decision in Contoocook Valley School District v. New Hampshire, the Supreme Court wrote that the current amount is too low, and it agreed with a lower court that the state should spend at least $7,356.01 per pupil to sufficiently cover the basic cost of education. 
But Spilsbury’s proposed bill would change the current tax system in another way: All revenue raised by the SWEPT would go to the Department of Revenue Administration and would be redistributed across the state. That would end the process by which wealthier towns are able to retain “excess SWEPT” revenue that they don’t need to fund their schools and use it to offset other local taxes. 
Built into his proposal is some tax relief: New Hampshire residents would get a 20% reduction in the SWEPT paid on their primary residence; people who did not have children in the school system would get a 10% reduction in the SWEPT; and people over 65 would also receive a 10% reduction. 
Spilsbury said the bill “probably will become a lightning rod.” “It’s ambitious,” he said before the House Education Funding Committee. “Maybe it’s too ambitious.”
And the idea comes as few in Concord appear eager to grapple with the implications of the Supreme Court’s ruling. 
In its 3-2 ruling, the court said that the Legislature and governor must fix the current funding system in order to increase the amount the state sends to public schools. But the court did not lay out exact timelines or methods for doing so, with the majority writing that doing so would be an inappropriate breach of separation of powers.
Some Democrats have proposed immediately raising the state’s school adequacy formula to address the court ruling. 
A bill by Hopkinton Rep. Dave Luneau, House Bill 651, would increase the base per-pupil adequacy rate to $7,356.01 — exactly the amount ordered by the court — at a price of about $576 million per year. But Republicans have said that move would be too fast, and on Tuesday, the House Education Funding Committee recommended HB 651 be killed, with Democrats voting against killing it. 
Other Democrats have embraced studying approaches to addressing the court orders. Democratic leadership has said lawmakers should work to find a solution, but that it is the responsibility of Republicans, who hold power, to present ideas.
“That’s not something Democrats can solve on our own,” said Rep. Alexis Simpson, the House Democratic leader, at a press conference last week. “It just isn’t. And I would say the first step is I would invite Republican leadership from the governor on down to come to the table and actually look for real solutions.”
Meanwhile, Republicans have denounced the court ruling and have begun openly questioning a pair of landmark opinions in the 1990s, known as the Claremont decisions, which established the state’s constitutional requirement to guarantee an adequate education in every school.
The Claremont decisions centered on an interpretation of the word “cherish” in the state constitution. Part 2, Article 83 states that legislators have a “duty” “to cherish the interest of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries and public schools.” The court said this duty means the state must make sure it is providing an adequate education.
Those decisions have influenced how the state pays for education for three decades. But Republicans say they are flawed.
“That word ‘cherish’ is probably the most expensive word in the New Hampshire Constitution, according to the Supreme Court,” said Rep. Daniel Popovici-Muller, a Windham Republican. “I do intend to follow the guidance of the Supreme Court, but to say that the word cherish clearly means that is more than I’m comfortable saying.”
Even Spilsbury says he opposes the court’s interpretation. He clarified Tuesday that he is proposing to expand SWEPT not because he agrees with the court rulings, but because doing so would be beneficial to towns with struggling public schools.
“I’m not here because a court said this is what we have to do,” he said. “We don’t need a court to tell us what we ought to do. I think this committee should proceed because we have a clear understanding that our constituents expect us to do something.” 
For progressive Democrats who have been pushing for the state to dramatically increase its funding to public schools, Spilsbury’s proposal has earned a mixed reaction.
Former Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky, a Concord Democrat who helped bring the Claremont lawsuits against the state in the 1990s, said that on the one hand, he is heartened that Spilsbury is seeking solutions to the problem of funding.
“I think Representative Spilsbury deserves a great deal of credit for actually representing his constituents, rather than some strained ideology,” he said in an interview.
On the other hand, Volinksy argued, addressing the funding gap by increasing statewide property taxes is not the most fair way to fix the problem. 
Property taxes are regressive and hurt poorer homeowners more than wealthy ones, he said, unless a “homestead exemption” were built into the tax that would exempt a set amount of the home’s value from taxation. 
“The problem of a property tax is that it’s inelastic. It doesn’t vary with the homeowner having more or less income, being well or ill,” he said.  “… If you’re increasing SWEPT it’s better than relying heavily on unequal local property taxes, but it doesn’t address the inelasticity problem.”
Jeanne Dietsch, a former Democratic state senator from Peterborough who once proposed an income tax on wealthy Granite Staters to pay for education, agreed that property taxes could not solve the problem alone.
“It’s still all on you — all on the property tax,” she said in an interview, speaking on Spilsbury’s proposal. 
To Dietsch and Volinsky, the only way to fairly raise the money needed to support schools is to seriously consider an income tax targeted at the wealthy. 
“I think we should backtrack on a couple of the four business tax cuts that we’ve given. And I think we should reinstate the interest and dividends tax … or have an income tax with a very high (floor),” Dietsch said. 
Fellow Republicans, who oppose income taxes, called Spilsbury’s proposal an interesting start. 
“Four times our Statewide Education Property Tax: That has pluses, but it all has negatives too,” said Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and the chairman of the Education Funding Committee, in response to Spilsbury’s proposal. “It’s going to cause some hardships on those towns which are going to be contributing the bulk of the money.”
”I heard things I liked and things that made me raise my eyebrows a little,” agreed Popovici-Muller. “… It’s always good to hear those complex proposals that are unlikely to survive as they are, but they are a great starting point.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Classroom1-1024x648.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 05:56:53.182134

Ohio public universities saw a decrease in international student enrollment compared to last fall. 
International student enrollment for fall 2025: 

Bowling Green State University — 599 students (33.2% decrease)
Cleveland State University — 1,249 students (34% decrease)
Miami University — 663 students (22% decrease)  
Ohio State University — 5,996 students (4.9% decrease)
Ohio University — 1,049 students (5.32% decrease)

University of Toledo — 1,370 students (6.2% decrease)
Wright State University — 1,550 (4.26% decrease)
Youngstown State University — 1,251 (8.81% decrease) 

Ohio State University has 3,226 students from China, 777 from India, 321 from Korea, 162 from Taiwan and 135 from Canada, according to university data. 
Cleveland State had the biggest decrease with 34%, followed by Bowling Green with a 33.2% decrease, and then Miami with a 22% decrease.  
“It’s tough,” said Cleveland State’s Vice President of Enrollment Management Randy Deike. “I think there are a lot of families that still see U.S. education as the best in the world. It’s just so many things are up in the air. Families are concerned about safety and all kinds of other stuff.”
A new higher education law recently took effect in Ohio that bans diversity efforts, prohibits faculty strikes, and regulates classroom discussion at Ohio’s public universities. 
The law also creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, sets rules around classroom discussion, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed Ohio Senate Bill 1 into law in March and students threatened to leave the state if S.B. 1 became law.
International students have faced challenges under the Trump administration. Many international students across the United States had their visas revoked for a period of time earlier this year, but then the Trump administration ultimately restored the visas at the end of April. 
The Trump administration issued an executive order on his first day in office ordering the State Department to review all visa programs and make sure foreign nationals do not pose a threat to national security. 
In June, the Trump administration announced a 19-country travel ban. Afghanistan, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen have a full travel ban. Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela have a partial travel ban.

“These events are an opportunity for North Dakotans to connect with one of the nation’s foremost voices on the history and future of America’s public lands,” Shannon Straight, executive director of the Badlands Conservation Alliance, said in a news release announcing the tour.
The dates and locations are:

Oct. 14 at Dickinson State University’s Beck Auditorium
Oct. 15 at the North Dakota Heritage Center in Bismarck
Oct. 16 at the University of North Dakota’s Gorecki Alumni Center in Grand Forks

Each film will start at 6:30 p.m. and will be followed by a question-and-answer segment with Dabney. Discussions will be moderated by local conservation leaders.
Dabney worked in parks including Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Yosemite, Grand Teton, Everglades and Mount Rainier, eventually serving as superintendent and chief ranger of the National Park Service. 
In the news release announcing the tour, he said he’s an admirer of President Theodore Roosevelt, who established the country’s National Park System. 
“Much of the land we enjoy today — and that many depend on for their livelihoods — would not exist without Roosevelt’s actions before he left office in 1909,” Dabney said in a statement.
The tour is a joint effort by the Badlands Conservation Alliance, North Dakota Wildlife Federation, North Dakota Natural Resources Trust, North Dakota Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, North Dakota Chapter of The Wildlife Society, North Dakota Sierra Club and the Dakota Resource Council.

Martinez, a clinical psychologist and member of the Chumash Tribe, helped run an American Indian youth ceremonial camp. Held at a sacred tribal site in Northern California, it was designed to help kids’ mental health. He remembers a 14-year-old girl who had been struggling with substance use and was on the brink of hospitalization.
On the first day of the four-day camp, Martinez recalled, she was barely able to speak. In daily ceremonies, she wept. The other kids gathered around her. “You’re not alone. We’re here for you,” they’d say.
Traditional tribal healing practices are diverse and vary widely, unique from tribe to tribe. Many include talking circles, sweat lodge ceremonies with special rituals, plant medicine and herb smudging, along with sacred ceremonies known only to the tribe.
Martinez and the girl’s counselor saw her mental health improve under a treatment plan combining tribal traditional healing and Western medicine.
“By the end of the gathering, she had broken through the isolation,” Martinez said. “Before, she would barely shake hands with kids, and she was now hugging them, they were exchanging phone numbers. Her demeanor was better, she was able to articulate.”

Indigenous health advocates have long known the health benefits of integrating their traditional healing practices, and studies have also shown better health outcomes.
Now, for the first time, tribal traditional healing practices are eligible for Medicaid coverage in California and three other states under a new initiative. Last October, the federal government approved Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program coverage of traditional healing practices at tribal health facilities and urban Indian organizations in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Oregon.
These were approved under a federal demonstration provision that allows states to test new pilot health programs and ways to pay for them.
Arizona’s waiver went into effect Wednesday. While California’s waiver currently only covers patients with substance use disorder, like the girl in Martinez’s camp, any Medicaid enrollee who is American Indian or Alaska Native is eligible in the other three states. Officials have said California’s program will expand to have such coverage in the future.
Under the waivers, each tribe and facility decides which traditional healing services to offer for reimbursement. Services can also take place at sacred sites and not necessarily inside a clinic, explained Virginia Hedrick, executive director of the California Consortium for Urban Indian Health.
“If a healing intervention requires being near a water source — the ocean, creek, river — we can do that,” said Hedrick, who is of the Yurok Tribe and of Karuk descent. “It may involve gathering medicine in a specific place on the land itself.”
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

Tribes long had to practice out of sight. The U.S. government’s assimilation policies had targeted tribal languages, cultural and religious practices — including healing. It wasn’t until 1978, when the American Indian Religious Freedom Act was enacted under President Jimmy Carter, that they regained their rights.
“It was illegal to practice our ways until 1978 … the year I was born,” said Dr. Allison Kelliher, a family and integrative medicine physician, who is Koyukon Athabascan, Dena. “Traditional healing means intergenerational knowledge that have origins in how our ancestors and people lived generationally to promote health, so it’s a holistic way of looking at well-being.”
Last month, Kelliher and hundreds of others gathered at the National Indian Health Board’s health conference on Gila River Indian Community land in Arizona. During a panel discussion about the waivers, tribal members discussed how health centers will bill for services, ways to protect the sacredness of certain ceremonies, and how to measure and collect data around the effectiveness of the treatments, a federal requirement under the waivers.
But teasing out those new protocols didn’t dull the enthusiasm.
“This is where we really start intersecting the Western medicine as well as traditional healing, and it’s exciting,” said panelist Dr. Naomi Young, CEO of the Fort Defiance Indian Hospital Board in Arizona.
The Trump administration announced earlier this year that it doesn’t plan to renew certain other Medicaid waiver programs approved under the Biden administration. But it hasn’t announced any changes around the traditional healing waivers.
Studies have found that Incorporating sweat lodge ceremonies and other cultural practices in treatments led to substance use recovery and emotional health, and better quality diets when incorporating traditional foods, according to analyses of research by the National Council of Urban Indian Health.
“When there is an opportunity to braid traditional healing with Western forms of medicine, it’s very possible, and the research is indicating, we may get better health outcomes,” Hedrick said.

Traditional practices
Decades of historical trauma, such as displacement and forced assimilation in boarding schools — where American Indian and Alaska Native people were forbidden from speaking their languages — are behind their disproportionate rates of chronic illness and early deaths today, tribal health experts say.
Tribes have long offered traditional healing — both outside brick-and-mortar health care settings as well as within many clinics. But health centers have been paying out of pocket or budgeting for the services, said retired OB-GYN Dr. John Molina, director of the Arizona Advisory Council on Indian Health Care and member of the Pasqua Yaqui and Yavapai Apache Tribes.
Molina said the new Arizona waiver may help clinics afford to serve more patients or staff more traditional healers, and build infrastructure, including sacred spaces and sweat lodges. For other clinics, “They’ve been wanting to start, but perhaps don’t have the revenue to start it,” he said.
“I’m hoping that when people engage in traditional healing services, a lot of it is to bring balance back into the lifestyle, to give them some hope,” Molina said.
That’s the effect traditional healing practices have had on Harrison Jim, who is Diné. Now a counselor and traditional practitioner at Sage Memorial Hospital in Arizona, Jim, 70, said he remembers his own first all-night sweat lodge ceremony when he returned from a military tour.
“I [felt] relieved of everything that I was carrying, because it’s kind of like a personal journey that I went through,” he said. “Through that ceremony, I had that experience of freedom.”
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

Kim Russell, the hospital’s policy adviser, who also spoke on the panel about the traditional healing waivers, told Stateline her team hopes to bring on another practitioner along with Jim.
Tribal health leaders have expressed concern about people without traditional knowledge posing to offer healing services. But Navajo organizations, including Diné Hataałii Association Inc., aim to protect from such co-opting as it provides licensures for Native healers, Jim said.
Push in Washington
Facilities covered under the new waivers include Indian Health Service facilities, tribal facilities, or urban Indian organization facilities. In Arizona, urban Indian organizations can get the benefit only if they contract with an Indian Health Service or other tribal health facility.
In Oregon, Yellowhawk Tribal Health Center spokesperson Shanna Hamilton said that while the center can’t speak on behalf of other tribes or clinics, many are still in the early stages of developing programs and protocols. She called the waivers a “meaningful step forward in honoring Indigenous knowledge and healing practices.”
Meanwhile, in neighboring Washington state, a bill that would have required the state to submit an application for a waiver by Sept. 1 died in committee.
But the state doesn’t need the legislative OK to apply. It’s still going to submit an application by the end of the year, the Washington State Health Care Authority told Stateline in a statement, emphasizing that each tribe would determine its own traditional health services available for reimbursement.
Azure Bouré, traditional food and medicine program coordinator for the Suquamish Tribe, a community along the shores of Washington’s Puget Sound, called the waivers “groundbreaking.”
“We’re proving day in and day out that Indigenous knowledge is important. It’s real, it’s worthy, and it’s real science,” Bouré said.
On a brisk summer day in 2009, Bouré recalled, she had attended a family camp hosted by Northwest Indian College. It was then she tasted the salal berry for the first time. A sweet, dark blue berry, it’s long been used by Pacific Northwest tribes medicinally, in jams, and for dyeing clothing.
“It was just that one berry, that one day, that reignited that wonderment,” Bouré said. For her, it unlocked the world of Indigenous plant medicine and food sovereignty, a people’s right to the food and food systems of their land.
Dental therapists, who can fill cavities and check teeth, get the OK in more states

She got her bachelor’s in Native American environmental science and now runs an apothecary, teaches traditional cooking classes, recommends herbs to members with ailments and processes foraged foods.
One day she could be chopping pumpkins or other gourds and the next, cleaning and peeling away the salty-sweet meat from dozens of sea cucumbers harvested by shellfish biologist divers employed by the tribe.
Bouré’s grandmother died when her mom was 12 years old. “That’s a whole generation of knowledge that she lost,” she said. One way she unearths that lost knowledge is by learning tribal medicine and teaching it, and holding on to memories like watching her great-grandmother Cecelia, who wove traditional sweetgrass dolls even when she was blind.
“I think that I come from a long line of healers,” she said. “It just skipped my mom and my grandma that passed, but I really relate to my great-grandmother Cecelia in that way.”
Dr. Gary Ferguson, who is Unangax̂ (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at the Tulalip Health Clinic about 40 miles north of Seattle. He’s certified in naturopathic medicine in Washington and Alaska.
His health center already has a variety of integrative medicine offerings, he said, including traditional ones grounded in Coast Salish traditions of the Pacific Northwest. He said he hopes the waivers and continued support for Indigenous ways of healing will help tribes address health disparities.
“These ceremonies and ways are part of that deeper healing,” he said.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Two years ago, Brian Miller said he was still unsure whether to sign up the rural Arkansas hospital he runs for a federal program that promised more financial stability.
DeWitt Hospital and Nursing Home is now a rural emergency hospital, which draws more federal funds to rural hospitals if they reduce or eliminate inpatient services and focus on emergency and outpatient treatment. Five Arkansas hospitals have made this trade since September 2023.
The DeWitt hospital has had “nothing but success” since receiving rural emergency designation from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in May 2024, Miller told the Advocate in August. The extra funding from Medicare, which insures the elderly, has been particularly helpful for the facility’s nursing home, he said.
The facility has also added cardiology, wound care and “some things like that that have generated a little more cash,” Miller said.
While rural emergency status has benefited the DeWitt hospital and its patients, it’s not necessarily the right fit for all rural Arkansas hospitals. The Southwest Arkansas Regional Medical Center in Hope will not be applying for rural emergency status, Chief Administrative Officer Shelby Brown told lawmakers in September.
Rural hospitals with no more than 50 beds are eligible to apply for rural emergency hospital (REH) status. If accepted, they are subsequently licensed for zero inpatient beds.
Brown said in an interview that giving up the Hope hospital’s inpatient beds would not serve the health needs of Hempstead, Lafayette, Miller and Nevada county residents.

“We want to be able to, if we need to admit someone, to put them in our hospital so they can stay home locally,” Brown said, adding that rural emergency hospitals’ primary goals are to “treat, stabilize and transfer” to a larger facility.
Brown also said the number of patients at Southwest Arkansas Regional’s emergency room can range from 30 to over 50, which exceeds rural emergency hospitals’ typical patient volume.
Southwest Arkansas Regional instead received approval Sept. 19 to become a critical access hospital, a federal designation for facilities located no fewer than 35 miles from other hospitals and maintaining no more than 25 beds.
CMS subsidizes critical access hospitals for inpatient treatment of Medicare recipients. The DeWitt hospital was a critical access facility before it converted to REH status.
Southwest Arkansas Regional reduced its beds from 48 to 25, and two of the eliminated beds were in its geriatric psychiatric unit, Brown said.
She petitioned the Legislature’s Joint Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee on Sept. 11 for more state funds for rural health care.

Rural Arkansas hospitals weigh trading inpatient care for new federal funds


“The big scheme of rural health in the state of Arkansas is in a crisis mode,” Brown said in an interview. “I would always think it’s better to have a rural emergency hospital versus no hospital.”
 Other considerations

Two counties and 50 miles east of Hope, Ouachita County Medical Center reduced its beds from 65 to 49 in preparation to apply for rural emergency hospital status.
The hospital in Camden is under three miles too close to the hospital in Fordyce to be eligible for critical access status, said Glenda Harper, who took over OCMC as CEO in August.
OCMC is a prospective payment system (PPS) hospital, meaning it receives Medicare reimbursements based on predetermined amounts. If it becomes a rural emergency hospital, it will receive an additional 5% reimbursement rate for outpatient services. Harper said this extra money will be crucial to financial stability.
There’s a catch: the Camden hospital would have to scale back its labor and delivery services.
Patients’ average stay at a rural emergency hospital over the course of a year must be no more than 24 hours, according to federal eligibility requirements. Delivering a baby via Cesarean section requires two or three days in a hospital for post-birth observation, so OCMC would have to limit its obstetric services to low-risk patients only, Harper said.
Aside from Camden, Southwest Arkansas has only four delivery hospitals: two in Hot Springs, one in Arkadelphia and one in Mena. Texarkana, Arkansas, no longer has a hospital, and the facility on the Texas side of the state line does not accept Arkansas Medicaid.
Ouachita County’s labor and delivery unit “does not make money at this point.” Administrators have considered closing it, but decided to keep it open “because our community needs it so badly,” Harper said.
“Our fear was that if we closed it, we’d have women presenting in labor who had had little or no prenatal care, and we’d have people delivering in ambulances on the way to a place that did have OB services,” Harper said.
For some rural communities, a stripped-down hospital is better than none at all

The extra money brought in via rural emergency status should make it possible for OCMC to keep both its labor and delivery unit and wound care unit open, she said.
Arkansas’ five existing rural emergency hospitals did not have labor and delivery services before receiving the designation. In addition to DeWitt, the other REH hospitals are in Pocahontas, Eureka Springs, Osceola and Helena-West Helena.
Thirty-three hospitals in 22 of Arkansas’ 75 counties have labor and delivery units, and six maternity wards have closed since 2020, including the one in Helena-West Helena.

City zoning laws don’t permit outdoor cannabis cultivation in the neighborhood where Jason Struthers lives. He says he’s had a state license since before those laws were adopted.

An Essex Junction resident who recently lost his ducks to new city zoning regulations is now fighting to hold on to his cannabis cultivation operation.
“I’ve been growing cannabis for 20 years. This has never been an issue,” said Jason Struthers, 48, at his half-acre backyard Tuesday where rows of bright green cannabis plants, heavy with flower, glistened in the bright sunlight.
It’s harvest season and he has been hard at work for more than 10 days. Most of the plants near him were about 5 feet tall, but they’ve been trimmed. Some of them grew to be 14 feet high this year, he said, pointing up to a trellis framing the blue sky. There was an odor but it was not noticeable from the street or outside the tall fence that shades the backyard from public view.
But, if the city gets its way, this may be the last crop of the Struthers strain — a sativa-dominant hybrid that he spent 10 years perfecting and said is good for doing work and being creative during the day.
Since neighbors complained about smells and noise from his ducks and weed, Struthers has been embroiled in a yearslong battle that has led to yelling matches, police visits, lawsuits, appeals, letters to legislators and contentious public hearings.
Struthers’ farm is located in a section of Essex Junction that is zoned for residential use. At the heart of the dispute is his right to farm versus the city’s fairly new zoning rules.
The conflict began in 2023, when the city’s development review board voted to prohibit Struthers from having ducks in an area designated as Residential-1. Struthers appealed, lost, and sold his ducks two months ago.
On May 30, the Vermont Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s decision and a yearslong practice, with justices reasoning that municipalities in Vermont can regulate both cannabis cultivation and farming practices by enforcing local zoning laws.
On July 14, Christopher Yuen, the city’s administrative officer, issued Struthers a notice of violation because “agriculture was defined and was not permitted in the R1 district,” and because some of his cannabis plants are within the town-required 50 feet setback.
And last month, the city’s Development Review Board voted unanimously in line with the courts to prevent agricultural cannabis cultivation in residential neighborhoods.
State vs. local regulation
Struthers began growing outdoor cannabis on his property at 8 Taft St. in July 2022. He received his cultivator’s license from the state on July 29, 2022. On May 4, 2023, he received his farm designation from the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, according to town documents.
Vermont legalized marijuana in July 2008. In July 2022, cannabis cultivation was not a defined use in the new city’s development code. However, agriculture was defined and was not permitted within the Residential-1 zoning district per the city’s land development code amended in February. Struthers’ growing is categorized as agriculture.
Struthers says he has been cultivating outdoors for three years with state approval. His state-issued license predates Essex Junction passing a charter change to become a city in 2021. So he claims the use is grandfathered.
The city’s review board determined on Sept. 22 that the use is not grandfathered because it was never compliant with zoning regulations to begin with.
Between the complaints and the appeals, Struthers feels the city is discriminating against him due to the stigma surrounding cannabis, even though he is licensed by the state.
“I’m not trying to be a nuisance to anybody, but at the same time I followed the law to the letter,” he said. 
City Manager Regina Mahony wrote in an email Wednesday that the city “has an obligation to uphold the land use regulations in a way that is consistent with state statute and judicial interpretation.”
Struthers contends none of his neighbors, despite voicing opposition in local meetings or filing letters, has stopped by to talk about their problem, whether it’s the smell or the proximity or just the idea of growing weed. “There was never a discussion. Not once,” he said.
While residents have voiced concerns over the years about the operation being too close to, or less than a mile from, Essex High School, administrators from the Essex Westford School District said this week they have not received any complaints.

Statewide impact
The case has become a touchstone for cannabis  growers and agriculture statewide, highlighting issues of state versus local authority and legal ambiguities that could set precedence for the future of farming in the Green Mountain state.
Where previously lower courts ruled that the city could not regulate Struthers’ duck raising and cannabis cultivation operations since they’re exempt from municipal bylaw under Vermont’s Required Agricultural Practices Rule and state law, the May Supreme Court decision has reversed that.
Now that he’s lost the appeal in Essex Junction, Struthers, who currently holds a state-issued Tier 1 outdoor cultivator license and a Tier 1 manufacturing license, said he plans to challenge the board’s decision in court within the 30-day appeal period underway. If he loses, he loses his livelihood.
“It’s a bummer I lost the ducks, but if I got to choose one to keep, that’s gonna be the cannabis,” he said this week.
Like Struthers, cannabis and agriculture entities in Vermont are also wrestling with new and changing rules governing the highly regulated cannabis industry. Some claim Vermont’s adult-use cannabis marketplace does not adequately support small growers and manufacturers.
“I think this is a good case of where this question of scale-appropriate regulation and who’s regulating what really has come to the fore in Vermont,” said Graham Unangst-Rufenacht, policy director at Rural Vermont, a grassroots member-based organization that advocates to improve equity in food and agriculture systems.
He visited Struthers’ farm last harvest season and said he didn’t find any issues with the operation in the suburban neighborhood. 
He has also come up against the “reality of the stigma around cannabis” in the Statehouse. “It’s a bipartisan issue and I think we see that play out a little bit in Jason’s case,” he said.
In January 2024, two state representatives from Essex Junction introduced a bill, H.549, to prohibit outdoor cannabis cultivation in densely populated areas that are served by municipal water and sewer and have 500 or more persons per square mile — a bill that, if it returns next session and passes, could effectively end Struthers’ operation.
Rep. Karen Dolan, D-Essex Junction, declined to comment while Struthers’ case “continues to unfold.”
Rep. Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction, did not respond to a request for comment. At the time, she insisted it was not “an anti-cannabis bill,” but one that was asking the state to consider density when issuing outdoor cultivator licenses.
Canary in the coal mine
Historically, the state has regulated cannabis and farming. But the Supreme Court decision sets a new precedent. Justices reasoned that towns and cities in Vermont can regulate both cannabis cultivation and farming practices by enforcing local zoning laws. They also clarified state law “does not prohibit all municipal regulation of farming.”

The ruling has dramatically shifted things from an agricultural perspective, according to  Unangst-Rufenacht. “In a sense, cannabis was a little bit of a canary in the coal mine, I think, for changes related to broader agriculture,” he said.
Geoffrey Pizzutillo, executive director of the Vermont Growers Association, said the ruling unnecessarily poses a threat to farming statewide and that the case extends beyond cannabis cultivators. After all, the states’ municipal zoning statute is not narrowly defined for cannabis but applies to all farming activities.
On its face, the Vermont Supreme Court decision seems to be a solution in search of a problem, detractors say. “It amounts to a disruption of a core tenet of Vermont as a right-to-farm state. That is significant,” Pizzutillo said. 
Specific to Struthers’ case, Pizzutillo said, “It is challenging to see how that situation in Essex is anything other than discriminatory.”
Meanwhile, Rural Vermont and other organizations put out a call last month for stories and signatures to “demonstrate the importance of the farming exemptions from Municipal Zoning and Act 250 for the working lands community.”
“The court’s ruling will impact the Vermont farm community at a time when farmers are already grappling with many emergent challenges, including flooding and other impacts of a changing climate, lack of federal funding, and widespread inflation,” the Sept. 2 letter reads. 
“Opening the door for municipal regulation of farms contradicts the longstanding policies, culture, and precedent that has protected Vermonter’s right to farm on the land they have access to, hindering Vermont’s ability to produce its own food, and by extension compromising the state’s food security,” according to the letter.
James Pepper, chair of the state Cannabis Control Board, said the board typically doesn’t take a position on the efficacy of policy decisions. The intent of the original legislation created in 2020 was to find creative ways to get cannabis cultivators out of densely packed residential neighborhoods, he said, taking into consideration factors like municipal wastewater.
The cannabis board has encouraged the Legislature to very intentionally not have zoning apply to outdoor cannabis cultivators, Pepper said, because the whole point of legalization was to encourage former and legacy growers to join the regulated market.
 In a January report, the board outlined the potential impacts of the municipal setback authority that precipitated this dispute.
If municipal zoning is too restrictive, it could  “paint entire swaths of a town out of cultivation,” he said. In Pepper’s view, Struthers’ situation was inevitable. “Someone was going to have a farm where the odors were going to impact their neighbors,” he said.
And equity in cannabis cultivation has been much talked about in Vermont. In January, the cannabis board submitted a legislative report on equity that recommends implementing direct sales for small producers. As of now, cultivators are only allowed to sell directly to retailers.
Singled out
Although Struthers has been growing hemp – and more recently, cannabis – for two decades on his property, the town sees the operation as an unallowed use per Essex Junction’s new land regulations. 
The state issued Struthers his license to grow cannabis in July 2022, around the same time that the village of Essex became an independent city. His license was renewed this year, the Cannabis Control Board confirmed.
A year ago local officials tried to shut down the cannabis operation before admitting they had little power to void Struthers’ state grower’s license. State officials have since renewed the license.
All of it makes him feel like the city is singling out his one-man, outdoor, fenced-in operation and trying to regulate him out for what is, he claims, a grandfathered use in a state that promotes and celebrates agriculture.
“They are just biased against cannabis. Don’t let them fool you,” he said.
Struthers is one of four cultivators in Essex Junction and one of 369 cultivators in Vermont, according to the state Cannabis Control Board’s data, of which 119 are outdoor cultivators. 
“It’s way more environmentally friendly,” Struthers said of his outdoor plantings. “We use the sun. We don’t use any electricity. We don’t produce any greenhouse gasses. In fact, we sequester carbon, if anything.”
Struthers turned to medical marijuana after he injured his back and sustained a spinal injury while skydiving in 2011. He said he secured his medical marijuana license soon after.
“It’s medicine for me. And it’s a far greater source of income than duck eggs and tomatoes. And I enjoy it more,” he said with a chuckle.
Without his operation, Struthers said he isn’t sure what he would do, as he walked around the grassy yard interspersed with groups of cannabis plants and an arched trellis brimming with yellow and red cherry tomatoes.
He is licensed by the state to have 125 plants but said he has a lesser number that he declined to share. A view from inside the backyard reveals at least 60 plants.
He says it’s a lot of work for a one-man operation. He usually starts the seeds in March or April, and puts the baby plants outside, weather permitting, on Memorial Day weekend. Then he starts to harvest in late September and early October. This year he started on Sept. 20.
His situation would have been different had he lived a mile down the road in Essex town – which has three cultivators and a very different attitude towards cannabis cultivation, he said. 
“They fully allow anybody to have a dispensary or cultivation and manufacturing” without “the limitations” Essex Junction is trying to impose, Struthers said. 
“There is where I allegedly could buy property and do exactly what I’m doing and it’s perfectly respectable. But because I’m here, even though I’m in the same 4.5 square mile city, they’re legal, I’m not legal… That just doesn’t make any sense.”
The only rule governing personal and commercial growers in Essex is the state-required license and a 500-foot buffer zone around schools, an Essex zoning official confirmed. Aside from the three commercial growers, the town does not track people who are growing from private residences. There have been no complaints filed for any of them, a town official said.
While the case plays out through town hearings and court cases, it is business as usual in the fenced up verdant backyard on Taft Street, now free of the quacking that neighbors once complained about.
“I am doing what I want to do, continuing as usual,” Struthers said. “I just want to be left alone. I want to cultivate my flowers. I want to create products for people to use and just be happy.”

The year-to-year decrease was small but continues a broad downward trajectory in abortions since the mid-1990s.
In all, there were 21,829 induced abortions in Ohio in 2024, compared with 22,000 in 2023; the abortion rate per 1,000 residents declined from 8.7 to 8.4.
The vast majority of procedures continue to happen early in pregnancy. More than 64% involved a pregnancy of less than nine weeks, and another 23% involved pregnancies of 9-12 weeks.
Non-surgical abortions, using drugs like Misoprostol or Mifepristone, made up a little less than half the total.

Ohio’s new reproductive protections stand out among many of its neighbors, and that appears to be showing up in the data as well. For most of the last 10 years, out of state residents made up about 1,200 of those seeking abortions in Ohio in a given year. In 2023, even before Issue 1 passed, that figure jumped to more than 2,700, and in 2024 in climbed again to 3,113.
Supporters and opponents reactions
Despite passage of Issue 1, which guarantees Ohio officials can’t “burden, penalize, prohibit, interfere with, or discriminate” against an individual making their own reproductive decisions, abortion access remains a live issue.
In March, Ohio Right to Life filed a complaint with the Department of Health about a company offering reproductive care via telemedicine. The laws the company was supposedly violating had been put on hold by a judge more than a year prior.
This summer, two Planned Parenthood clinics closed following federal changes to Medicaid. Even after a judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s efforts, the clinics decided it was too risky to continue. Republican state lawmakers even filed a bill defining life at conception in a bid to circumvent Issue 1 and outlaw abortion and IVF treatment.
Abortion opponents welcomed the decline in the most recent report but promised to keep fighting.
“Given that Ohio has some of the most liberal abortion laws in the country and we have radical judges pushing this agenda, these numbers are encouraging,” Ohio Right to Life Executive Director Carrie Snyder said.
“We aren’t satisfied with the loss of any innocent pre-born child, and our efforts to protect them will continue,” she added.
Snyder highlighted “disturbing trends” like Black mothers making up a disproportionate amount of the state’s procedures and the continued rise in out-of-state abortion seekers.
“This is another reason why we have called on Governor (Mike) DeWine to sign an executive order prohibiting any Medicaid funds from going to abortion providers,” Snyder said. “Taxpayer dollars should not (be) used to support the practice of abortion in any way, and even more so on people not from the Buckeye State.”
Kellie Copeland from the organization Abortion Forward compared the current moment to the brief window in 2022 when Ohio’s 6-week abortion ban took effect — cutting off access to abortions before most mothers know they’re pregnant.
“For 82 days in 2022, Ohioans were forced to travel out of state for the abortion care they needed,” Copeland said. “Thankfully, those days are behind us, and abortion is protected in the Ohio Constitution.”
Still, she said her organization has work to do.
“People must be able to plan if, when, and how they start a family, and government should be ensuring they have access to education and resources to make that plan for themselves,” Copeland said. “Unfortunately, Trump, Congress, anti-abortion organizations, and their friends in the Ohio Legislature continue to do everything they can to impede access to reproductive healthcare.”
Copeland criticized lawmakers threatening Medicaid funding and leaving tens of thousands of Ohioans without access to medical services. She’s concerned about the number of out of state abortion seekers, too — but not for the same reasons as Snyder.
“I am glad that those people could come to Ohio for the care they needed,” Copeland said, “but they should have been able to get the care much closer to home.”
“No one should be forced to cross state lines for health care,” she insisted.

“Legislators legislate with their lived experience, and right now, too few lawmakers in Congress know what it’s like to navigate childcare, school pick-ups, and the cost of raising kids in America,” Vote Mama Foundation Founder and CEO Liuba Grechen Shirley said in a statement. “The U.S. does not support parents.”
The report found nearly 30 states do not have a mom of a minor children in Congress: Ohio, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
“That’s not just a gap in representation; it’s a crisis,” Shirley said in a statement. 
Ohio U.S. Reps. Greg Landsman, Max Miller, and Mike Carey, along with U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, are all fathers of minor children, according to the report. Landsman is a Democrat while Miller, Carey and Husted are Republicans. 
There are 39 moms of minor children and 124 dads of minor children in Congress, according to the survey. 69.2% of moms of minors are Democrats and 61.3% of dads of minors are Republicans.
A Vote Mama report from last year found only about 6% of Ohio’s state lawmakers are moms with children under 18, ranking the state 37th in the nation. At the time of last year’s report, eight of Ohio’s 132 state legislators are moms of children under 18. 
California, Florida and New York have the most moms of minor children in Congress with four, according to the report. 
Delaware, Idaho, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Wyoming have no parents of minor children in Congress. 
Vote Mama had eight recommendations for Congress: 

Create a reasonable voting schedule that does not require members to leave their families at unpredictable times. 
Normalize parents making the decision to live in their district or in the capital based on what is best for their families. 
Allow members to vote by proxy or virtually so they can perform their duties remotely when they or their families have increased care needs. 
Normalize members of Congress using campaign funds to pay for child or dependent care, and allow them to use campaign funds to pay for security expenses. 
Normalize federal candidates using campaign funds to pay themselves a living wage and cover dependent care. 
Create an official family leave policy to allow members to care for their families without stigma. 
 Install changing tables in all members’ bathrooms, regardless of gender, and ensure accessibility of pumping rooms in all legislative buildings. 
Expand House and Senate childcare centers to reduce waitlists and better meet the needs of legislators and staff.

(Getty Images)Every October, Substance Use and Misuse Prevention Month provides a reminder of the lives at stake in the fight against substance use disorders (SUDs). For New Hampshire, this year brings signs of real progress.
After nearly a decade of drug-related mortality rates falling above the national average, the Granite State is now experiencing record declines in drug-related fatalities. A closer look at the data suggests that sustained investments in prevention, treatment, and recovery may be paying off.
Drug-related deaths in New Hampshire, once among the highest fatality rates in the country, have begun to fall sharply. From 2013 to 2020, Granite Staters experienced drug-related fatality rates well above the national average, peaking in 2017 when an estimated 490 people died from drug-related causes, nearly five times higher than the number killed in traffic-related accidents in the state. But by 2024, deaths had declined to 287, the smallest number recorded since 2014 and the sharpest year-over-year decline across the previous decade. Early data suggests that this trend may continue into 2025: an estimated 77 Granite Staters died from drug-related fatalities the first half of this year, a decline from the 122 people during the same period in 2024.
These declines follow a decade of increasing state and federal investments in SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery services. Since 2014, New Hampshire has invested more than $835 million in SUD services, with spending increasing by an estimated 450% from 2014 to 2024.
Medicaid, the single largest payer of SUD services, has been vital for increasing access. The passage of Medicaid expansion in 2014, now commonly known as Granite Advantage in New Hampshire, expanded health coverage for adults up to 138% of the federal poverty guidelines. Of the almost $58 million spent on Medicaid-funded SUD services in 2024, nearly 80% was financed services under Granite Advantage. Opioid abatement funds resulting from legal settlements with drug manufacturers have also added funding support. By late 2024, New Hampshire had received close to $96 million in settlement money, although around half remained unspent. As of January 2025, it is estimated by the Kaiser Family Foundation that New Hampshire will receive more than $168 million in future payments, combined with a large continuing balance allowing for more spending flexibility across the state.
Yet despite these gains, access to treatment remains uneven, and many Granite Staters are still left behind. In 2022-2023, nearly 3 out of 4 Granite Staters who needed SUD treatment did not receive it, due in part to barriers such as provider shortages, regional disparities, coverage limits, and housing instability. Social determinants of health also play a role in which services people are able to obtain and can impact engagement with treatment and sustained recovery. Nationally, people identifying as Black or Native American experience disproportionate health outcomes from substance misuse. Research also shows that communities with greater income inequality experience higher drug-related fatality rates.
In New Hampshire, over half of drug-related deaths in 2024 occurred among people age 30 to 49, although shifting demographics have impacted fatalities, with older adults age 65 and older comprising around 13 percent of drug-related deaths. Men have accounted for around two-thirds of fatalities each year across the previous decade, and rural counties, including Coös and Sullivan counties, also report higher mortality rates, likely reflecting limited service availability resulting from workforce shortages.
In addition to better health outcomes, an investment in SUD services contributes to longer-term economic and social benefits. Increased prevention, treatment, and recovery services can reduce costly emergency health care spending, decrease burdens on the criminal legal system, and help keep more people engaged in the workforce.
However, new federal and state policy changes could undermine this progress. Although Medicaid has remained the largest source of funding for SUD services, new state and federal changes could impact access to health care across New Hampshire. Both the new federal reconciliation law and the latest state budget add work requirements for Granite Advantage adults, requiring people to prove employment or engagement in an eligible community engagement activity to obtain health coverage. While people in SUD treatment are exempt from the new requirements, differing state interpretations of the law, as well as difficulties with exemption paperwork and redeterminations could mean coverage losses for people in treatment and recovery. Early national research suggests that as many as 156,000 people across the country could lose access to medication-assisted treatment, resulting in an estimated 1,000 additional opioid-related deaths each year. These Medicaid changes come at a time when access to services is already limited.
As this year’s Substance Use and Misuse Prevention Month arrives, New Hampshire’s recent experience demonstrates that sustained investments in prevention, treatment, and recovery services can save lives. This progress, however, may be fragile. Without continued investment and innovation, the advances made in reducing drug-related deaths could stall, or even reverse, putting more families and communities at risk.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/drugaddiction-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 04:56:12.911408

(Pool photo by Yui Mok/Getty Images)Have you heard the one about a ceremonial sword, the Trump administration and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene?
It’s no joke, unfortunately.
It’s also not as cutting an anecdote as you may think. After hearing from ousted library director Todd Arrington, I’m left with more questions than answers. National and local media covered the story in such a way that readers could believe that Arrington was fired after refusing to give the Trump administration a fancy sword from the Eisenhower library. The president wanted to present a memento to Britain’s King Charles during his September state visit.
In reality, Arrington worked with the administration to secure a saber from West Point and was complimented about his handling of the situation.
“The day that the president gave the sword to the king, I got a message from my boss’s boss saying: ‘The sword has been presented. It all went great. You did a great job. Thank you for all your help,’ ” he told me.
So we don’t know for certain why Arrington was ousted from the job where he served for a bit more than a year. To hear him tell it, he had gotten on well with staff and the Eisenhower family and was making connections to Abilene.
A lifetime civil servant and Army veteran, Arrington has written books about presidential history and previously served at the James A. Garfield National Historic Site. Nothing in his record or interactions about the sword suggested someone trying to make a political point or otherwise grandstand. He’s just not that kind of guy.
When I reached him by phone Saturday, he was driving his father from the Wichita airport. Arrington still wasn’t quite sure what had happened.

Todd Arrington served as the director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library. (National Archives)

“I have no idea,” he said. “I don’t know. I never had any indication that anyone thought I’d done anything wrong. So what happened is a mystery to me. I have no idea. I would love to know. I have reached out to superiors at the National Archives, and I have not had anyone call me back.”
In our conversation, the former librarian was at pains to tell me that none of the national or local reporting about his departure had been 100% accurate. That’s catnip to a journalist like yours truly, who’s always on the search for untold stories.
Arrington didn’t single out any account for praise or blame, but he said he didn’t think President Donald Trump or First Lady Melania Trump had any inkling of issues with the sword.
“At no time did anyone express to me that the president or the first lady had anything to do with this,” he said. The former library director added that “I thought we provided some good service. We helped them find the thing they were looking for by getting them eventually to West Point.”
For reference, Eisenhower was raised in Abilene and served as Allied commander during World War II. He briefly served as president of Columbia University, helped found NATO and then served as president from 1953 to 1961. He was a moderate Republican, a sober statesman and an implacable foe of fascism. Who knows what he would make of this moment in history, or how he might advise his fellow Americans.
I’m no Ike, and you don’t have to like me. But I have some thoughts.
Throughout the past nine months, I’ve repeatedly urged my family, friends and Kansas Reflector readers to exercise caution with news media consumption. Not because we don’t live in challenging and scary times, but precisely because of that. When humans believe they’re under siege, they see threats everywhere. They’re more likely to believe scary stories of government overreach and brewing authoritarianism.
They might be right! Regardless, we live in an attention economy, driven by social media gadflies and AI slop. Commentators abound who will feed your fear no matter the facts. Be wary of them.
It may be that some MAGA world dispute drove Arrington’s forced resignation. But he doesn’t know that, and we don’t know that. Living with uncertainty is OK.
We can, however, reach some conclusions about those in the Trump administration. We know that at least a few people wanted to take a sword from a presidential library and use it as a gift for another country’s kind. We know that they were willing to do so regardless of federal law (read Anthony Clark’s in-depth account on his “The Last Campaign” blog).
This alone tells us a lot.
It tells us that the Trump administration sees the nation’s treasures and heritage as possessions of the president. It sees our shared institutions as storehouses of plunder that it can hand out to impress peers. Arrington’s refusal to meet that initial demand was principled and courageous. He showed good faith in helping locate a replacement blade, but I worry that gave the initial request more legitimacy than it deserved.
He had big plans for the library in Abilene. He was preparing for America’s 250th birthday next year and overseeing new initiatives.
“We were looking forward to a lot of success,” Arrington said. “We were planning a new film. So we were working with a great company to get a new film made. We were just looking into the future, both short term and long term.”
For now, Arrington has been left unemployed. As too often happens in today’s hyper-partisan world, headlines focus on firings and palace intrigue, while discounting the actual human cost.
“All I care about right now is I need to find a new job,” he said. “I have a wife. I have children. I am trying to pick up the pieces and find the next thing. I’ve told everybody I’ve talked to if there was any way to go back to this job, it really was a dream job for me. And if there’s a way to get back to it, I would love to do that. I don’t know if that’s possible, or if anybody would consider that, but that would be my best-case scenario.”
I hope that Arrington can continue to serve the people of Kansas. I fear that too many people think they know the punchline to let him do so.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)With the Nov. 4 election less than a month away, Maine voters can now vote absentee in person at their municipal clerk’s office.
Some municipalities may have received ballots early and already started in-person absentee voting, but it is available statewide as of Monday.
While Maine doesn’t have any big ticket statewide races, there are two referendum questions that will go before all Maine voters, as well as numerous local races and referenda. 
Question 1 will ask voters if they want to make a series of changes to state election laws, including requiring voters to show certain photo ID when voting and adding restrictions to absentee voting.
Question 2 asks voters if they would like to implement a red flag law, officially called an Extreme Risk Protection Order, which would make it easier to temporarily confiscate one’s guns if they are deemed to be a threat by law enforcement or their family members.
Here are some details about in-person absentee voting in Maine.
Who can vote absentee?
Any eligible voter can request to vote absentee in Maine. No special circumstance or reason is required. Absentee ballots can be requested online, by mail or by calling the municipal clerk in the town or city where they are registered to vote.
As of Tuesday, more than 19,350 absentee ballots had been requested, per data from the Maine Secretary of State’s office, which will be regularly updated in the lead up to the election.
More than 7,200 ballots have been issued and none have been returned yet. Thirty-eight ballots have been rejected.
Here are the big questions that will appear on Maine’s November ballot

How do I find out details about where and when to vote absentee?
The hours and location details vary, based on the municipality where a person is registered to vote, but contact information for municipal clerks and registrars is available on the Secretary of State’s website.
Can I track my absentee ballot?
The Secretary of State has a new tracking system for voters to monitor the status of their absentee ballot.
When does absentee voting end?
An absentee ballot request must be received by the municipal clerk by the close of business on Thursday, October 30, unless special circumstances exist. Voted absentee ballots must be received by the municipal clerk by 8 p.m. on November 4, 2025

Last week, however, Gov. Jim Pillen announced that the state would opt into a federal school voucher plan, part of H.R. 1, the Big Ugly, which Congress passed earlier this year.

This end run around Nebraska voters continues a troubling trend in the state where the voting public’s voice, in part, has been questioned, hedged — or, in this case, muted.

To be eligible for scholarship funds, a family’s household income must not exceed 300% of the “area’s median household income.” According to census data, in Scottsbluff that makes eligible any family earning as much as $180,000 a year; in Gretna it’s $350,000.

During his enthusiastic endorsement of the opt-in, Pillen said Nebraskans “totally agree” on “school choice,” the PR term used to sell school voucher programs. Not sure from where he culled that data, because when Nebraskans spoke against school vouchers last November, they did so loudly, too. The final tally was 57% to 43%, a clear, decisive victory. Nor was the win an urban/rural split. The referendum carried only five of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
The governor also questioned the process, saying initiatives such as 435 are beholden to writers of big checks who pay to gather petition signatures to get initiatives on the ballot. While he’s right about modern petition gathering, you still have to get the votes once it’s there.
Governing by ballot initiative does have its own set of problems, not the least of which are time consumption and ballot language. Nevertheless, we shouldn’t forget that petition drives that end up on ballots are part of a process known in its origin story as a “redress of grievances” and are, like speech, religion, assembly and press, enshrined in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. 
Nor should Flood and Smith overestimate the popularity of the Big Ugly, which, according to a number of research firms including KFF and the Pew Research Center, remains underwater by  14 points to a whopping 29 points. Flood did not specifically tout this part of H.R. 1 when he held a town hall in Lincoln in early August. Maybe now we know why.
While the votes were the votes and the numbers are the numbers, the state will nonetheless be offering the federal voucher program to families in the state starting in 2027. As they did in last year’s campaign against 435, opponents such as Nebraska State Education Association president, Tim Royers, pointed out that the program “… diverts public resources into private systems without accountability or limits.” 
The federal dodge of last fall’s ballot box is on brand for a worrisome way the state has responded to voter intentions. In 2018, Nebraska voters chose to expand Medicaid coverage by a margin of 53.5% to 46.5%, not really close as elections go. Then-Gov. Pete Ricketts and his administration slow-walked the implementation of the law for nearly two years, using a series of add-ons and requirements that gummed up the works needed to enact what Nebraskans wanted … and said so via their votes.
Voters in 2022 passed a ballot initiative that incrementally raised the state’s minimum wage only to watch a concerted effort in the Legislature to weaken the language of the initiative and tack on exceptions, both of which ran contrary to the spirit and the details of ballot measure. 
In November 2024, over 75% of voters supported a ballot initiative requiring the state’s businesses to offer paid sick leave for employees. The Legislature intervened again, fiddling with portions of the initiative over the protests of some senators, unions and other labor groups, who argued once again that the Unicameral was diluting the chorus heard in the voting booth. 
The law went into effect last week.
No one is arguing Nebraska students shouldn’t have the best when it comes to educational opportunities. The way to achieve that, per those who took the time to vote, was not, however, school vouchers. Which, apparently went unheard — or ignored — in high places.

OTTAWA COUNTY — Chris Kleinjans still has the servant spirit inspiring him.
“My name is Chris Kleinjans and I’m a Democrat … yes, that Democrat. And I’m running to be your next state senator,” the Park Township resident says in his website’s campaign video.
The Ottawa County Democrat has announced his bid for Michigan’s 31st Senate seat, with current Republican Sen. Roger Victory terming out at the end of next year.
“I’m doing this because the system isn’t set up for people like me to run,” Kleinjans said. “So I run because I’m obstinate. Someone has to do it, I can do it really hard, I know how to do it, and I don’t mind losing another six months of life doing it. So here we go.”
Michigan’s 31st Senate District consists of portions of Allegan and Ottawa counties.

 An Ottawa County household name

Kleinjans surged into the forefront of Ottawa County politics in late 2023, when the county’s Democratic Party selected him as their candidate to run against an Ottawa Impact Republican on the county board of commissioners in a special recall election.
The recall targeted then-commissioner Lucy Ebel, a member of the far-right political group, and Kleinjans ultimately defeated her by a 20% margin in May 2024.
“It was a double-edged sword coming in the way that I came in, because there was a lot of animosity, a little bit of resentment, a little bit of grumpiness, a little bit of any number of things,” he said.
The victory was short-lived, however, when Kleinjans was fired from his job as a community nutritional instructor at Michigan State University’s Extension office just weeks later.
The school claimed his employment was “incompatible” with his newly elected office representing District 2 on the board of commissioners. Kleinjans claims he was fired from the school over political pressure from the far-right majority on the board.
He sued MSUE in June 2024, claiming the university violated his First Amendment rights when it gave him the ultimatum of taking an unpaid leave through the remainder of the year or face termination.
He later added the county as a defendant in the lawsuit after emails revealed that former board chair Joe Moss, OI’s founder and president, attempted to pressure MSUE to fire Kleinjans while he ran in the recall election campaign.
The lawsuit remains ongoing; Moss was re-elected to the board in November and no longer serves as chair.
“Thinking back on that period … any of us that followed it or were in it, it was wild,” Kleinjans said. “I mean, that November was just bananas. People’s passions were high, and when passions are high, things get weird.”
When Kleinjans filed the lawsuit, he was already in the midst of running for re-election, as the partial term he secured in May last year was set to expire at the end of the year.
He said he doesn’t want the lawsuit to distract from what he’s trying to offer to voters.
“I realize that people are going to ask me about this when I’m out canvassing, and I’m going to be out canvassing. It’s an unfortunate distraction,” he said. “Because really, when it comes down to the fundamentals and why I’m doing this, it’s based on what I’ve learned so far. It’s based on the good that serving the people can accomplish when it’s done in an honorable way. I still feel that what we’re doing is an honorable thing, and I feel it’ll turn out all right. It’s just taking longer than I thought.”
He said the wheels of justice move slowly, and civil lawsuits take time to sort out. Kleinjans’ lawsuit was one of more than half a dozen filed against the OI-led board in 2023 and 2024.
“Well, obviously I would rather have had this resolved, but if there’s anything worse than trying to get two lawyers to find a workable date for mediation, it’s getting three lawyers to find one,” Kleinjans said. “I’m still very confident in our claim, and everything that’s come out thus far only confirms what I was told by MSUE admin back in November of 2023 regarding the actions of former chair Moss and MSUE.”
In the November general election, Kleinjans lost to Republican Jordan Jorritsma by just 237 votes, and the totality of the previous months took their toll.
“After November, I was pretty bushed. It had been two complete campaigns back-to-back with an intense level of action right from the jump. We didn’t have a long runway to get things going — from the time the recall was certified,” he said.
Kleinjans was tired, but not deterred.
“I loved serving the county. It was exhausting, because it was like the hardest part-time job ever.”
 Why he’s giving elected office another shot

Kleinjans said he decided to jump back into politics because the 31st District seat in the Michigan Senate will be up for grabs in the fall 2026 election. He pointed to gains Democrats made in 2024, when Ottawa County bucked a statewide trend when it skewed two percentage points to the left.
“I looked at the returns after the election, and saw how locally Democrats outperformed the top of the Democratic ticket; 40% of this county is reliably Democratic voters,” he said.
He said, as a Democrat who has previously won a county seat — which he says puts him “in a really small club” — he knows what it takes to win.
“I’m a Democrat. I worked on a commission where I was one of two Democrats and it was a little bit frosty — because of the way that I came in,” he said. “But I didn’t spend all this equity and time and sweat and shoe leather helping move the Democratic Party forward in this county just to see everybody drop a ball on the midterms. It’s on like ‘Donkey Kong.’”
Kleinjans said that, even though he didn’t stay on the county commission, the experience he gained was invaluable.
“I think coming out of that whole environment of 2022 to 2024 really helped ground me and … always focus on the fact that it is the common good and it is the benefit of everybody,” he said. “I want to get us back to that level of governance, where we’re all cognizant of why we’re doing it, and we’re all willing to do a little bit of extra work for it, and to not have it be this coliseum-type event.
“You’re working on behalf of the people. You should be honored to do it — never take it for granted.”

 Why the state Senate?

Kleinjans said his experience at the county level helped him gain valuable skills that are sorely needed at the state and federal levels.
“I’ve worked alongside other elected officials who I didn’t agree with and certainly didn’t agree with me — and made no bones about the fact that they didn’t agree with me. You know, that’s important to have at that next level in Lansing — to have been in some really intense decisions and discussions and events, because it’s one thing to see it outside … it’s another one to be in the room,” he said.
“That kind of perspective is really important; it’s necessary to have that balance. Sometimes I think the reason that things are kind of the way they are now, in addition to all the other reasons, is that there’s not this kind of seasoning of starting out at a lower office and then going up to another higher office,” he said. “I think that what I can bring to it is a much more level-headed kind of approach. I really do try to believe in the best in people, because I think everybody deserves their shot, and everybody should have access to the tools they need to get where they want to get.”
He said the dysfunction in Washington and Lansing isn’t new, and that it’s important to focus on how to move forward.
“It’s a really weird time right now to be in politics. Sometimes it gets really loud,” he said. “If we can create a culture where we’re reminded that this is a service, I think we’ll get better results.”
He pointed to Democrats holding majorities in all three branches of government in Lansing from 2022 to 2024 as the natural “give and take” of the two-party system.
“Two years ago, when the Democrats had the trifecta, they got some things done. And yes, those were some things that didn’t really appeal to the GOP, but they were things that were part of the platform. However, there were a lot of things where there was a lot of agreement,” he said.
Republicans were able to make gains in both legislative houses in 2024, and now the GOP controls the House and Democrats have just a one-seat majority in the Senate.
“The Dems have the Senate barely right now; this is a chance for a hard-working person to get a pickup. And I know how to work hard,” Kleinjans said.
He said one of the things that he can offer to constituents is that he’s a listener.
“I’m a big fan of not saying a lot and listening, because I think that is something that has gotten lost in our culture where, if you’re not saying something, your relevance seems to decrease because of social media and stuff,” he said. “But I am a big fan of listening, and I’m a big fan of studying.”
He pointed to his background in history — he has degrees in youth services from Grand Rapids Community College, history and education from Grand Valley State University and a master’s in public administration from GVSU.
“Back when I was in college, one of my really good professors said being a good historian isn’t knowing everything about history. It’s knowing where to look,” he said. “A lot of people think that historians wander around with dates and people locked in their heads — and we do because we’re weird — but it’s knowing where to go, where to find the material and how to tell if the material is good that determines how interpreting history is accomplished.
“I feel it’s the same way in politics.”
 What would he do if elected?

Kleinjans said he has three main goals that he wants to discuss while on the campaign trail: housing, mental health care and food security, particularly for children.
“I don’t see a lot of the things that I support as being incredibly partisan,” he said. “We all want houses. We all want a strong and robust CMH system that takes care of our residents. We all don’t want kids hungry at school. These are things that I feel are good jumping-off points. The difference is in the approach.”
Kleinjans is passionate about creating solutions for the housing crisis that plagues most parts of the country, West Michigan included.
“Even before it cost an additional 20% to build a house, which we now have to deal with because of the tariffs, housing was and is expensive; developments are expensive. It’s an incredibly complex beast,” he said. “I have yet to meet someone who says that we’ve got just enough housing. If anything, I want my kids to live closer. I want my grandkids to live closer. I don’t want my kid living in my basement. We all see the need.”
He applied to serve on the Ottawa County Housing Commission; the new moderate Republican majority, along with the four OI commissioners who remain on the board, voted against adding Kleinjans to the subcommittee when they made appointments at the beginning of the year.
“I don’t see a lot of the things that I support as being incredibly partisan. We all want houses. We all want a strong and robust CMH system that takes care of our residents. We all don’t want kids hungry at school. These are things that I feel are good jumping-off points. The difference is in the approach.” — Chris Kleinjans
“What I wanted to do, at that point, was blow up the Ottawa County Housing Commission, metaphorically speaking,” he said, “and really bring a lot of people to the table — a lot more people.”
He said housing should be a conversation between all stakeholders, including the nonprofits, the developers, the funders, the municipalities and the state.
“You want Lakeshore Habitat. You want Jubilee. And you want Dwelling Place … but you also want, for example, someone from Wolverine [Construction]. You want some people from the larger financial groups that can be the top-line funder for some programs.
“You want a big table, because this is an incredibly complex issue,” he said.
Kleinjans, who has a 25-year history working in the nonprofit sector — including the development of educational programming for the Holland Historical Trust and his time at MSUE — currently works as the housing community impact officer for the Allegan County Community Foundation.
He said the state local units of government can work on adjusting zoning laws to accommodate new developments, but the state also has a role to play.
“If a municipality wanted to do some work on zoning to make things a little bit … more development-friendly, maybe there’s a way to come in and assist with that so that it reduces build costs. The state is helping prime the pump a little bit to get those things going,” he said. “There’s a lot of statewide entities that are leaning into helping local units do the work.”
He said housing will continue to be one of the most pressing issues the state and, more importantly, his district, will face.
“We have a Senate district that has a lot of ALICE population,” he said, referencing those residents who are classified as asset limited, income constrained and employed, meaning they earn more than the federal poverty level, but still struggle to afford the basic cost of living, such as housing, food and healthcare.
“That is a population that is pretty consistently paying more than 30% of their monthly income towards their housing, which puts them in a really delicate situation,” Kleinjans said. “We need to be more engaged and more interconnected with the discussion of getting housing everywhere, literally everywhere, and as a state, raise the amount of stock, and in doing so, kind of drop some of the prices and create an environment where everybody has housing that’s accessible to their income as well as their location.
He said development can be a touchy subject in many communities, as existing residents are resistant to change and expansion.
“That’s a tough conversation, because zoning is hyper-local and hyper-passionate, but it’s important to not let the heat of the crowd, as we’ve sometimes seen in local politics, detract from the long-term good for the project,” Kleinjans said. “I feel that if the Legislature leans in a little bit more, they can help facilitate making some of those conversations easier.”
He also said developments should be discussed at length with communities to get early buy-in, rather than quick approval with little discussion.
“I’m a big believer that these conversations take place over months, not hours, and you want to make sure that everyone’s bought in,” he said. “I think we can do some stuff to encourage local units of government to reinvestigate their zoning to create the things that allow for a wider variety of housing styles and types to be built where there’s already infrastructure.”
Kleinjans is also passionate about community mental health, having previously served on Ottawa County’s CMH board of directors both before and during his tenure as a commissioner.
He said cuts championed by the Trump Administration in July and approved by congressional Republicans include significant funding cuts and policy changes to Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces, Medicare physician payment and medical student loans, among other health care-related items, all of which will worsen patient access to care, according to the American Medical Association.
“CMH funding relies quite a bit on Medicaid, which flows through [the Department of Health and Human Services] and into the counties, through the Lakeshore Regional Entity,” Kleinjans explained. “That system, which came about after the last period of economic instability 25 years ago, resulted in the regionalization and the operation under the LRE. Now we’re looking at it and going, ‘Oh, well, this isn’t right.’”
He said the state government can help in conducting better oversight of the departments for which it has purview.
“I am not at all a big fan of privatizing components of the mental health system. I have yet to see anything that’s privatized that worked — that operated either more efficiently or more economically than a government service, particularly when it comes to health care and mental health care,” he said.
He pointed to Ottawa County being unique in that it was one of the first counties in the state to approve a county-wide mental health millage, but the millage has limitations.
“The county millage was a groundbreaker when it was passed. It was designed for a very specific use, and it was designed to specifically handle things that weren’t Medicaid-eligible,” he said. “Well, if Medicaid isn’t covering what needs to be covered, the millage is kind of like a blanket that’s just a little bit too short — you can stretch it and pull it and it can do different things, but it can’t quite cover what you really needed to cover.”
He said even if county voters were to re-approve the millage when it appears on ballots in 2026, there will still be an existing “untenable system.”
“What I’d like to see from the state level is a top-down sort of assessment of how we’re doing this,” Kleinjans said. “A Medicaid-eligible person who’s 65 and above is a very different individual than an 18-year-old who is becoming an adult and has a severe cognitive impairment and is going to need complex and nuanced services for the remainder of their life.
“Those differentials are something that needs to be addressed. Do we have the ability at the state level to address these concerns? Or come up with mechanisms within the state to make up that difference? Or is it always going to be a 1-to-1 ratio?”
He also pointed to the rise in autism diagnosis rates, as doctors and researchers are learning more about the neurodevelopmental disorder.
“With the rise in the ability to diagnose autism earlier, and the realization that autism is a multifaceted, nuanced thing that requires a wide modality of treatment options to assist people with being as successful as they can be, these conversations are things I feel we should have as a state,” Kleinjans said. “This is something we owe our residents.”
He said his political and career experiences uniquely position him to help in that space.
“I’ve spent time in Lansing with my new position, doing advocacy and things like that, and when you talk as two people that want to get something done, and you’re doing it with a little bit of humility, you can get some good things … you can approach each other with a little bit more humanity and grace,” he said.
Kleinjans also said that although state officials finally approved a budget last week — which funded meals in schools — the issue needs to stop being a political football every time the budget comes around and the party in power changes.
“I was very disappointed when the state House removed the free breakfast and lunch program that had been implemented just a couple of years earlier, when the Democrats had the trifecta,” he said, referencing House Republican efforts to strip the funding prior to the budget’s approval.
“I worked in schools a lot in my previous work with my employer, and when I was working in nutrition education, I witnessed firsthand the impact that well-fed students have on the culture of a school,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ONN-Chris-Kleinjans-4638.jpg,,,2025-10-06 14:58:21.067469

(Photo by Airman Gavin Hameed/U.S. Air Force)The Maryland Food Bank is monitoring traffic at food pantries across the state, its network of about 800 community partners — anticipating a rise in federal workers and contractors hit by the federal government shutdown, which currently has no end in sight.
As the shutdown continues, missing paychecks and the potential pause of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) support could lead to a surge of patrons at food banks around the state, said Chloe Woodward-Magrane, Maryland Food Banks director of communications.
“People should not go hungry because something is happening with their job,” Woodward-Magrane said.
The food bank is just one of businesses, government agencies and nonprofits that have mobilized since last Wednesday when the government shutdown began, an event with an outsized effect in Maryland, where the economy relies heavily on federal spending.
The shutdown threatens the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of federal workers, many of whom were sent home Wednesday morning. Even those who are still coming to work because they were deemed essential workers — airport security, health care workers, customs workers and the like — are feeling the pinch, as they will work without pay until the shutdown ends.
Moore vows to keep some federal programs in Maryland operating – for now

Maryland is home to about 260,000 federal workers and 200,000 federal contractors, and has lost more than 15,000 federal jobs since the Trump Administration took office, according to an email sent Wednesday by the governor’s office.
“Shutdowns don’t just stop the government — they shortchange the people who need it most,” Lt. Gov. Aruna K. Miller said in the email.
As the Maryland Food Bank braces for an influx of federal workers and contractors, other groups are stepping forward to help ease the burden for federal workers during the uncertainty of the shutdown.
Utility protections
Utility companies are prohibited from turning off gas or electric services of impacted workers during a government shutdown or within seven days of the shutdown’s conclusion, according to a statement from the Maryland Public Service Commission. Those who are involuntarily furloughed or who are not paid during the shutdown are eligible.
In a letter to utilities Wednesday, Gov. Wes Moore urged companies to “go further” by exploring payment plans or suspending residential shutoffs during the shutdown, as opposed to requiring customers to reach out to companies themselves. He said that would help lessen the stress of “families who are already facing significant financial stress and uncertainty.”
“Taking this proactive step would demonstrate true corporate citizenship and provide a crucial safety net for all Marylanders, alleviating the need for impacted federal workers to negotiate individually,” Moore wrote in the letter.
WSSC Water, which provides water and sewer service to Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, on Wednesday suspended water turnoffs and waived late fees for federal workers impacted by the shutdown, according to Lyn Riggins, a spokesperson for the utility.
WSSC is also extending its “Get Current” program through November instead of its previous expiration date at the end of October. The program forgives a portion of customers’ balances and waives late payment charges and turn-on fees.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE“While we are a large entity providing critical services, we’re also your neighbor,” said Riggins. “Anything that we can do to help our customers, to help our neighbors — this is what we can offer right now, and hopefully it will ease a little bit of the burden.”
Baltimore Gas and Electric and Pepco, two Exelon gas companies, said they are offering flexible payment options, late payment charge waivers, personalized bill assistance and streamlined verification that does not require proof of government identification.
Housing Protections
Moore, in another letter Wednesday, reminded state judges of a 2019 law that requires Maryland courts to temporarily pause mortgage foreclosures and evictions for federal workers who face a loss of pay during a shutdown.
“The Moore-Miller Administration is committed to ensuring that Maryland families, especially our dedicated federal workforce, are shielded from the consequences of inaction at the federal level,” the letter said.
Credit Union Support
As of Friday, 27 credit unions associated with the MD|DC Credit Union Association had offered assistance programs, such as short-term relief programs, low-rate credit cards, payment deferrals, fee waivers and financial counseling.
“Credit unions have a history of stepping up to serve their members in challenging times,” said John Bratsakis, president and CEO of the association. “We want members to know that credit unions are here with flexible options and solutions to help them through this federal government shutdown.”
How the federal shutdown is playing out across the government

Loan and Job Assistance
Moore announced other resources for Maryland workers impacted by the federal shutdown on Wednesday, including unemployment insurance, housing and utility protections, loan programs and resources for veterans.
“The federal government is stepping away from its basic obligations to Maryland and our people. But despite the challenge, our resolve is unwavering,” Moore said in Wednesday’s email. “I encourage federal government workers to take full advantage of these resources.”
Those who are working without pay during the shutdown can apply for a short-term $700 no-interest loan for essential expenses through the Federal Shutdown Loan program, starting Monday. The loan must be repaid within 45 days of the conclusion of the shutdown.
The Federal Worker Emergency Loan Program is available to federal workers who are laid off during the shutdown, and offers a $700 loan for support during financial hardship.
The governor’s Wednesday email also included links to resources that can help federal workers find a new job, such as job fairs, a virtual workshop designed for former federal workers and contractors and information about American Job Centers, which provide employment-related services.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/7697060-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 01:57:09.201465

(Photo by Rosanne Skirble)Abel Olivo wasn’t sure how many people would show up for the fifth annual version of the Latino Leadership Summit held each fall, sponsored by Defensores de la Cuenca — Defenders of the Watershed — a group he leads.
Given the anxiety in the Latino immigrant community over deportations, he feared many would just stay home.
But whatever fears there may have been could not keep a crowd of 100 participants from turning out at Seneca State Park last month for panel discussions, workshops, dancing and a celebration of environmental achievements within their ranks.
Olivo, the founding director of Defensores, said attendance went beyond his expectations, surpassing all previous years.
“That’s a testament to the hard work that we have put in over the years, establishing a level of trust among our participants,” Olivo said. “They felt they were in a safe space.”
Olivo began Defensores in 2020 to connect Latino communities in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. He concedes that it was “strange that one would want to start a new endeavor in a pandemic. But the need to address these longstanding environmental, social and economic injustices was just too great not to take action.”
A fourth-generation Mexican American, Olivo has guided that vision into a robust organization, with a full calendar of events that attracts families to the region’s parks. They, in turn, serve as the backdrop for entry into a suite of programs for participants of all ages.

Defensores Academy trains adult community leaders. Its Youth Corps promotes environmental stewardship among young people and the Defensores Tree Ambassadors are foot soldiers in the urban forest, charged with finding places to host and care for trees. Fifty-two ambassadors have run through its classroom certification. More than half were recognized at the summit.
“This year we have a goal [to plant] 2,000 trees in underserved areas,” Olivo said, citing the 2021 Tree Solutions Now Act, legislation that called for planting 5 million native trees across the state, with at least 500,000 of those in marginalized neighborhoods.
The Sept. 11 event was not entirely without a nod to current circumstances: Olivo said a know-your-rights workshop was inserted in the day-long summit.
“Part of leadership is being knowledgeable about the issues of our time and knowing how to navigate various situations and how to incorporate and address those for the benefit of ourselves and others,” he said.
Chispa, a spark for environmental justice
Among the panelists was Ramón Palencia-Calvo, director of Chispa Maryland, a grassroots program of the League of Conservation Voters Education Fund. He said the group’s mission “is to ensure Latino families have strong leadership and power to identify and influence environmental policies and decisions that affect their lives.”
“Our hope is an environmental movement that is inclusive and just, where there is a diversity of voices, those voices are respected as equals, and we want to see those diverse voices leading the movement,” Palencia-Calvo said.
Among Chispa’s most effective advocates are the “promotores” or promoters, members of the Latino community brought together for skills workshops, where they get the tools they need to address pollution where they live.  Many of its 125 graduates continue this work in committees established across Maryland.
Palencia-Calvo says these activities are ongoing, adjusting to political realities by meeting online or in safe places.
“One of the things that we bring to this moment is solidarity, how communities come together, regardless of where they were born, regardless of the language they speak,” he said, “they come together to support a healthy environment for their families and for their communities.”

Immigrant activist
In that chorus of diversity sits Linda Flores. A physical therapist by training, the El Salvador immigrant came to the United States in 2012 to escape violence, gang activity and extortion in her home country. She is a field worker with the Latino Health Initiative in Montgomery County and has certificates from both Defensores de la Cuenca and Chispa Maryland.
While it is a difficult moment for the community, she says, it hasn’t stopped her from taking immigrant concerns to decision-makers in Annapolis as part of Chispa’s ongoing campaign to replace diesel buses with electric ones.
“We brought our cardboard buses [to Annapolis] and my girls were there, demanding that our political representatives [buy] more electric buses, she said.
She is unafraid to speak out at public events.
“No, I’m not afraid. I served the community during the pandemic, which was a matter of life or death,” she said. “And, now, I have [again] a strong need to serve, and feel like God is protecting me.”
Palencia-Calvo of Chispa — Spanish for “spark” — says that in this work, at this time, connections matter.
“We also have relied and continue to rely very much on partnerships and coalitions, working together with other groups to move the work forward, to continue providing opportunities for engagement and participation.”
Juntos somos más — together we are more
Walkiria Pool is among Chispa’s most powerful allies. An immigrant from the Dominican Republic shortly after high school, Pool comes to the table armed with degrees in psychology and economic development, as well as two decades of experience working with marginalized communities.
In 2006, she founded Centro de Apoyo Familiar (CAF) or Center for Assistance for Families. Her idea was to tap leaders of faith in the immigrant community.

“By empowering them, connecting them with resources, and educating them so that their congregants, who have so much trust in them, could receive the assistance they needed in an integrated way,” she said.
What began in Massachusetts, expanded to Maryland, Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia and Puerto Rico, serving more than 55,000 low-income and immigrant families each year with food distribution, environmental and health and justice initiatives, and housing opportunities.
CAF is also the co-anchor of the Mid-Atlantic Justice Coalition, a statewide-organization focused on economic and environmental justice.
“We have over 40 groups that work on public policies, legislation, education, community engagement, capacity building and fundraising,” Pool said, adding that together they coordinate priorities and advocacy.
Pool says among those priorities in for 2026 is the re-introduction of the CHERISH Our Communities Act, a bill that would reform Maryland’s permitting system to better protect neighborhoods that already face a heavy burden of pollution. She says, their voices matter.
“[They] have the right to approve who does or does not enter their community,” Pool said.
Pool acknowledges these are difficult times to be an immigrant. She tells the majority Latino summit that it is their combined strength that can lift barriers to climate justice.
“We have leaders, committed young people, and a collaborative spirit among us,” she said. “Juntos somos más; together we are more.”

Unemployment rates are creeping up, especially in the public-service sector, and, like many others, Florida’s current governor will soon be out of a job.
He’s got only 15 months left to ride the taxpayer gravy train.
Once a promising presidential candidate, accustomed to hearing himself called “DeFuture,” Ron DeSantis will be DeThroned, DeMoted, DeFunct.
In common with thousands of recently — or soon to be — laid-off government workers, he may experience DePression.
Rumor is he harbors ambitions to again run for the White House — assuming there are elections in 2028.
The problem with this plan is that in 2024, America met him and America said, “Oh, hell no.”
DeSantis was a truly, epically, terrible candidate. They had to remind him to smile.
Polls show him favored by only 10% of Republican voters: Ahead of Marco Rubio but way, way behind J.D. Vance.
When people think you’re weirder than J.D. Vance, you might want to adjust your ambitions and rethink your career path.
Perhaps go for something a little more realistic.
Never fear: DeSantis has plenty of options.
He prides himself in making sure Florida is “Open for Business,” so why not open a business?
Maybe a surf shop in his hometown of Dunedin: Ron Ron.
Sure, Ron Jon might sue, but DeSantis is a lawyer: He can surely handle it.
Speaking of the law, as long as he keeps his bar license current, why not practice whatever it was he learned at Harvard?
Oh, maybe that’s not such a good idea. Lawyers, even Florida lawyers, are expected to perform a certain amount of pro bono work every year, representing the poor and the powerless.
DeSantis doesn’t much like the poor and the powerless.
The university option
Still, he could open a boutique firm, specializing in suing school librarians, middle school teachers, college professors, and anyone else who smells “woke” to him.
Shoot, he could become a college professor himself!
Evidently anyone can.
Seems politicians finding themselves between elected gigs can always find a university home.
Mike Haridopoulos, who now represents the Space Coast in Congress, used to teach at UF and Brevard Community College.
When Secretary of State Marco Rubio got term-limited out of the Florida Legislature, Florida International University paid him 23 grand a year to teach one class — around seven times what your average adjunct pulls in per course.
Maybe DeSantis could teach a political science class called “Authoritarianism for Fun and Profit.”
Other washed-up politicos, including Richard Corcoran, Manny Diaz Jr., and Jeannette Nuñez, all scored top jobs as university presidents. DeSantis could, too.
All he has to do is push somebody out, the way he did at New College or at the University of West Florida, and “suggest” he’s obviously the best possible choice. Given that he appointed most of Florida universities’ boards of trustees, it’s a safe bet he’d get what he wants.
But perhaps he’d prefer to reconnect with those “blue-collar” roots he’s always talking about and do something a bit less exhausting than the day-to-day business of firing academics for mentioning race and gender.
How about opening his own specialty restaurant?
He could lean into Donald Trump’s affectionate nickname for him: Call it Meatball Ron’s Fine Dining, home of the No-Lab-Meat Polpette.
He likes to say that while he grew up in Tampa Bay, his true home is the Rust Belt of his parents’ Ohio.
You know, declining Industrial Heartland, home of Real Americans (Real American places do not have beaches, leggy pink birds, or free-range Burmese pythons), casseroles, corn fields, Vice President J.D. Vance, and rampant addiction to opioids.
He could sell farm equipment. Foster our amber waves of grain.
Only thing is, farmers can’t afford tractors. John Deere is losing money and laying off workers, thanks to tariffs on steel and aluminum, retaliatory Chinese tariffs on soybeans, and diminished crop sales owing to Trump’s gutting of USAID.
Back to the roots
On second thought, maybe DeSantis could sell fish bait.
Given the rate of inflation at the grocery store, a lot of us may soon have to start catching our own dinner.
Or go back to his first, best love, baseball, at which — as he reminds us on every other page of his memoir — he was really good, awesomely good.
Luckily, the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, a beloved minor league team located in the governor’s birthplace, are hiring everything from Kid Zone Attendant to Assistant Concessions Manager.
Some day he could even try out for the team.
It would be like a movie!
Maybe not.
DeSantis claims he cares about Florida’s economy, so why not contribute to our agriculture industry?
Given the mass deportations and immigrants’ fears they’ll be dragged off by ICE, even if they’re legally here, Florida farmers can’t find people to harvest their crops.
Strawberry fields forever — also tomatoes, cucumbers, cabbages, and cane.
The governor clearly thinks 12-hour days in our world-renowned Florida sunshine build character: A bill he signed last year bans local government from requiring employers to give workers water and heat breaks.
But let’s get real real. While Ron DeSantis likes to talk up learning a trade instead of getting a degree from a snooty college (or, in his case, two snooty colleges) where you will undoubtedly become a Marxist follower of that Imp of Satan Greta Thunberg, he bleached that blue collar long ago.
In other words, Ordinary Joe jobs won’t cut it.
The man doesn’t fly commercial.
There’s always Disney World
Anyway, he might not leave Tallahassee at all.
It all depends on his wife, and, maybe, his hand-picked Number Two.
Jay Collins, former state senator, former Green Beret, a man whom DeSantis calls “the Chuck Norris of Florida Politics,” says he and his family have been “praying about” his running for governor.
Collins also says he would consider the “brilliant” Casey DeSantis as his running mate.
Floridians will have Thoughts about this.
First of all, Florida’s First Lady has not ruled out her own run for governor, even though the Current Occupant of the White House has endorsed the 30-watt U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, giving him a large advantage with Florida MAGAs.
She has other political liabilities too, including $10 million in Medicaid overbilling settlement money “donated” to Hope Florida, a charity she founded, which mysteriously (and illicitly) ended up going to an outside PAC.
Investigations continue.
Collins has his own problems. He rejects “the woke mind virus,” but, as right-wing news site “Florida’s Voice” has reported, at Operation BBQ Relief (they provide barbecue meals to disaster victims), the charity he worked for, he was in charge of overseeing their robust DEI policies.
As the few remaining Floridians who aren’t too exhausted to care have noticed, Collins has yet to formally announce his candidacy.
Meanwhile, the seas rise, the heat gets more intense, the water gets dirtier, the rich get richer, the poor can’t afford to go to the doctor, library shelves get emptier, public schools crumble, and people get fired for exercising their First Amendment rights on social media.
This is the Florida DeSantis will bequeath us.
If he and Casey fail to hold onto political power in this state, perhaps they’d like to move to Ohio and immerse themselves in that rich Rust Belt culture.
Or, if all else fails, there’s always Disney World.
Surely, they’d hire him to play a character. Donald Duck, maybe? Or Pluto?
Walking around in one of those big heads, nobody can tell if you forget to smile.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-06 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Why CT needs single-stair reform,Amit Kamma,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/06/why-ct-needs-single-stair-reform/,A move allowing single-stair exits in five-story buildings is being negated by extremely restrictive fire department staffing and capacity requirements.,"Across Connecticut, outdated fire safety regulations are blocking new homes and exacerbating our cost-of-living crisis. Right now, any residential building taller than three stories must have at least two staircases. That may sound harmless, but the rule drives up construction costs, makes it harder to build on small lots, and prevents many types of critical “missing middle” homes, especially in our town and city centers.
In 2024, Connecticut lawmakers passed “single-stair” reform, aiming to fix this lag in our building codes. While dozens of cities nationwide had already enacted single-stair reform, Connecticut was the first state to actively pass legislation calling for statewide reform, an exciting moment of leadership for us. The legislation directed the State Building Inspector to raise the three-story height limit for new residential buildings with a single staircase, making it possible to build more types of multifamily housing. This reform reflects a modern, safe design approach already in use worldwide, as well as in American states from Virginia to Oregon. But as other states move forward with strong, effective reforms, Connecticut now risks falling short in our execution. 
Last month, the State Building Inspector’s office released draft updates to the codes that attempted to implement the reform. These proposed amendments remain open for public comment until October 11. On paper, the proposal raises the single-stair building height limit from three to five stories. In reality, it buries the change under extremely restrictive fire department staffing and capacity requirements for any town that wants to have such housing.
One mandate, for example, says that a fire department’s “initial full alarm assignment [must] include a minimum of 28 staff,” an unworkable requirement that even relatively large towns with professional fire departments like Meriden and Danbury cannot meet. These requirements will make many otherwise viable constructions impossible, undercutting the reform’s very purpose: to create more homes.
These restrictions in the August draft reflect a common but misguided concern: that taller single-stair buildings are unsafe in fires. The evidence says the opposite. Modern multifamily homes, including single-stair ones, comprise the safest housing stock in America. A recent Pew report found that multifamily homes built since 2010 have one-fifteenth the fire death rate of single-family homes or apartments built pre-2000. Why? New multifamily homes are built with strict requirements to utilize modern life-saving technology, like fire-rated materials, sprinklers, and self-closing doors. For single-stair buildings specifically, Pew found that after New York City passed reform in 2012, the rate of fire deaths in its 4,440 modern single-stair buildings remained the same as in other new residential buildings, which is to say, quite low.
If Connecticut wants to improve fire safety, the answer isn’t to block opportunities to build modern, multifamily housing, but to create more of them. Reforming outdated single-stair rules will make it easier to construct more new multifamily housing and redevelop older properties, which would be categorically safer than most of Connecticut’s existing housing stock, which is the sixth-oldest among U.S. states. In other words, effective single-stair reform doesn’t just promote affordability-—it actively improves fire safety in Connecticut by shifting residents from aging housing to modern buildings with better regulations. The fire community should be leading the charge for this reform.
Connecticut needs a practical and workable code update that matches the intent of the 2024 reform by helping us unlock more types of homes across the state. That means removing the stringent fire department requirements in the current proposed amendment. Otherwise, Connecticut towns won’t be able to adopt this reform, and our housing affordability crisis will deepen while our housing stock continues to age. Lawmakers took the right step in passing single-stair reform. Now, regulators need to follow through and craft codes that balance affordability and safety. 
Done right, single-stair reform can simultaneously expand housing choices and improve fire safety —a win that Connecticut cannot afford to squander.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) EARLING — A mostly red-clad audience at a barn in Shelby County on Sunday asked Republicans, hopeful for the governor’s seat, about the carbon sequestration pipeline and associated concerns of eminent domain. 
The event was also in support of Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, and featured state representatives who have been active in opposing the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project. 
Lawmakers spoke about their plans to continue opposing the pipeline that would transport sequestered carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Iowa and surrounding states to underground storage in North Dakota. 
​”Let the words go out from this place in this day: No eminent domain for private gain in the state of Iowa,” Holt said, opening the event. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Holt, along with Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, have been central to proposing and pushing legislation aimed at limiting the abilities of carbon sequestration pipeline companies to use eminent domain.
In the spring, the duo sponsored several bills that were eventually wrapped into House File 639, which the Senate passed after significant debate on the floor. The bill, which Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed, caused controversy and disagreement among the Iowa Republican Party. 
Holt said all Republican candidates who have said they plan to run for governor were invited. Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, former Iowa Representative Brad Sherman, and former Director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services Adam Steen, attended the event and spoke about their plans if elected governor. 
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra is also running for the Republican slot on the ticket and Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, launched an exploratory committee for governor but has not said if he is officially running. 
Andrews says pipeline issue would end ‘day one’ if elected
Andrews, a Republican representing urban Polk County, where the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline would not cross, has also been a vocal opponent to the pipeline. While he spoke Sunday, Andrews had a slideshow of selfies he has taken over the years with various landowners at the capitol.
Andrews said he’s often asked why he cares about the issue — which pushed him to run for governor — even though it hardly impacts his constituents. 
“When I raised my right hand to defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Iowa, it was to defend property rights and not to add to the pocket of Bruce Rastetter,” Andrews said, referencing the founder of the Summit Agricultural Group which founded Summit Carbon Solutions. 
Rep. Eddie Andrews, who is running to be a Republican candidate for governor, speaks at an event Oct. 5, 2025. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
Andrews said he would support a bill, like one that was enacted in South Dakota, that blocks eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines. Andrews said he would also like to pass a constitutional amendment that would “really address property rights.” 
He said he would also support reform for the Iowa Utilities Commission, including an effort to remove the utility’s authority over eminent domain. 
“It disgusts me, quite honestly, that we’ve collectively allowed this to go on so far,” Andrews said. “This will end on day one , if I’m governor, if not before.” 
Sherman calls for transparency, and principles 
Sherman has been a pastor for more than 40 years and served in the Iowa House of Representatives from January 2023 through January this year. 
He called the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline a “boondoggle” and said the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is regulated by the plants that convert it into oxygen and that carbon dioxide is “not hurting our atmosphere.”
Sherman said he would support a bill blocking eminent domain for CO2 pipelines, if he were elected.

Sherman said a major part of his efforts, if elected governor, would be to put the “founding principles” of the nation into the educational system. 
“So the people know that rights come from God, not government, the purpose of government is to protect those rights, and that the people then understand how to preserve their own freedoms,” Sherman said. 
Sherman also called for “total transparency” on government spending. For example, he alleged some big school districts spent taxpayer money to hire multiple diversity equity and inclusion directors. 
“And of course, we know what DEI is,” Sherman said. 
Sherman said total transparency in the government would alleviate some property tax issues. 
“I think if people could see what’s going on, they would make some – demand some — changes,” Sherman said. “… If the government gets out of the way, business people will get it done. Government doesn’t need to tell people how to run a business, it just needs to get out of the way and get rid of regulations.” 
Steen says it’s time for an awakening
Steen served as Reynolds’ director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services from 2021 until his recent resignation to pursue the Republican nomination for governor. 
Steen was part of Reynolds’ staff when HF 639 was vetoed, but said the decision was outside his purview. Now no longer part of the staff, Steen said he was “shocked and surprised” by the governor’s veto. 
Steen said he has three farms in his family and would “fight for the rights of Iowans every step of the way.”

“Ain’t no way a private entity is going to abuse eminent domain on my watch,” Steen said. “There’s no chance.” 
Steen also said the pipeline issue and the other issues facing the state of Iowa are examples of “evil infiltrating politics in a way that we have never seen before.” 
Steen, who has labeled himself as a “faith guy” running for governor, said he noticed this when he started living his life intentionally. 
“I didn’t become woke, but I woke up and realized that America is under attack. Iowa is under attack,” Steen said. 
He said Iowa needs someone who will say “enough is enough.” 
Steen said the situation that led to the arrest and detainment of former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts, is “insanity at its highest level.” 
Roberts was detained by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement Sept. 26 and DMPS has since learned the immigrant from Guyana was in the country unlawfully. 
“That doesn’t happen, that doesn’t happen unless it’s a DEI hire that has been infiltrated by the enemy,” Steen said. 
Steen said his priorities if elected would include fixing property taxes, prioritizing skilled labor, “bringing the family back to the dinner table” and reaching up to “revitalize and shake up the local church.” 
“You got somebody who knows how to work with the Legislature, you got somebody who’s going to be a champion for culture, and you got somebody who knows how to operate the state day one,” Steen said. 
Steen said he believes Reynolds is the “best governor the state’s ever had,” but he said he is not “Governor Reynolds, 2.0.” 
Pipeline fight continues for another year 
At the Sunday event, Holt called on the Iowa Senate to pass a bill restricting eminent domain on CO2 pipelines and for the governor to support the bill. He said there were already a number of bills in the works for the upcoming legislative session. 
Thomson called the Summit pipeline project a “dagger aimed at the heart of what it means to be an Iowan” and later a “parasite” on Iowa’s government. 
Summit filed, in September, a petition to amend part of its permit from the Iowa Utilities Commission, and allow the company to explore a different ending location for the pipeline, which is currently slated to end in North Dakota.
 Thomson said the filing has the “smell of desperation.” 
Thomson said while the governor and certain members of the Senate did not act the way he had hoped, but said the previous session forced the “other side” to come “out of the bushes.” 
Thomson said this will be an advantage moving forward. 
Some of the dozen GOP senators who refused to vote on vital budget bills until the Senate debated, and ultimately passed, a bill related to restrictions for hazardous liquid pipelines and the use of eminent domain, were also present at the Sunday event.

Steve Kenkel, a fifth-generation Shelby County landowner who formerly served as a Shelby County supervisor, hosted the event at his farm.
Shelby County, along with Story County, passed county ordinances related to pipeline setbacks and other regulations in response to the pipeline. Summit sued the counties over the ordinances and federal judges sided with Summit in the case. The county supervisors filed a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. 
Kenkel thanked the landowners, lawmakers and groups that have spent time opposing the pipeline, these people he said are the “protectors” of private property rights in the state. 
“We can’t do this by ourselves,” Kenkel said. “So I’m putting a challenge out there to you and the entire state of Iowa … when you go to the polls this next year, and following years, you do your homework and you find out who the protectors are for property rights.”

Let’s go back to May 19, 1968. War was escalating in Vietnam. President Lyndon Johnson had just announced he would not run for reelection. Mickey Mantle was limping through his last season with the New York Yankees. James Eastland and John Stennis, two Democrats, were Mississippi’s two U.S. senators. A promising young quarterback named Archie Manning was finishing spring training, preparing for his first varsity season at Ole Miss.
Rick Cleveland
Yes, and in Hattiesburg, B.R. “Mac” McClendon, a rookie playing his first professional golf tournament, won the first Magnolia Classic, defeating 53-year-old Pete Fleming in a nine-hole, sudden-death playoff at the Hattiesburg Country Club. 
McClendon, fresh out of LSU where he was a three-time Southeastern Conference golf champion, won a not-so-grand total of $2,800 for his efforts. He birdied the ninth hole, his 45th of the day, at dusk, as car lights shone brightly from the parking lot just behind the green.
Few, if any, of us present that damp spring evening in Hattiesburg would have ever believed the little tournament with such humble beginnings would endure for 57 years, but it has.
Fast-forward to Sunday’s breezy, cloudy afternoon at the Country Club of Jackson in the final round of perhaps the final Sanderson Farms Championship. Steven Fisk, a 28-year-old Georgian, fired an 8-under-par 64 with birdies on the final three holes to win the tournament that began so long ago as the Magnolia Classic. First prize this time? Just over a million bucks. The late Mac McClendon surely wouldn’t have believed that.
Just as had happened 57 years before, Sunday’s final round came down to a two-man shootout. Fisk and South African Garrick Higgo trading birdies until Fisk birdied the final three holes with a remarkable display of grit and pinpoint accuracy. 
“I know I’m good enough,” Fisk said immediately afterward. “I knew I could do it. It’s a lifelong dream, honestly. Sometimes you doubt yourself, but I just knew I could do it. Nothing was going to stop me from doing what I wanted today.”
A former Georgia Southern golfer, Fisk turned professional in 2019, but his early professional career was slowed – and threatened, really – by a condition in his left hand called carpometacarpal bossing. If that sounds serious, it was. The injury required surgery and then a change in his golf swing to prevent further problems. Fisk persevered.
Perseverance has also been the story of the Magnolia Classic, turned Deposit Guaranty Classic, turned Southern Farm Bureau Classic, turned Viking Classic, turned True South Classic, turned Sanderson Farms Championship. The event’s  57-year-history has included tournaments at three different golf courses, in three different Mississippi cities, and with six different sponsors. It has endured not only the sponsorhip losses, but also a 100-year flood, two lesser floods, a couple hurricanes, a tornado, a pandemic and a half dozen recessions. In 2005, before so much of that happened, Mississippi’s only PGA TOUR tournament had endured so much that a Sports Illustrated deemed it “the little tournament that could.”
The late Robert Morgan, a Hattiesburg businessman, championed the tournament through its first 40 years and a move from the Hattiesburg Country Club to Annandale in Madison. Then, Joe Sanderson, the Laurel poultry magnate, saved the event and oversaw the move from Annandale to the Country Club of Jackson where the tournament had seemingly flourished until now. 
But Sanderson sold his company in 2022 and the new owners have decided not to continue sponsoring the event beyond this year’s tournament. A new sponsor has not been found, which could spell the end of the “little tournament that could.”
That would be a blow to several Mississippi charities and especially Children’s Hospital. Since 2013, the event has raised nearly $19 million for Children’s of Mississippi and $2.75 million for other Mississippi charities.

(Screenshot of NU Board of Regents meeting)OMAHA — The father of three young children injured in a May crash allegedly caused by a University of Nebraska regent appeared in person Friday to call for the regent’s resignation.
Ricoh Mountain of Omaha started an online petition calling for Omaha Regent Elizabeth O’Connor’s resignation in early August after she was charged with one count of allegedly driving under the influence and causing serious injury, a Class IIIA felony. Mountain said his daughters, all under the age of 7, faced minor injuries and that his mother-in-law suffered a broken back and pelvis.
“Ask yourself, had that been me, would it have taken two months to file any formal charges, and would I still be back to my job on Monday, making decisions for the youth?” Mountain said.

It was the third regents meeting since the crash and the second since O’Connor’s charges were filed on July 30. O’Connor has appeared at each. Friday marked the first meetingthe public has addressed O’Connor since, with one person supporting Mountain and another supporting O’Connor.
O’Connor has not yet publicly addressed her fate as a regent. She declined to comment Friday.
‘No one is above the law’
The two-month delay in filing charges against O’Connor came partly because of testing to confirm O’Connor’s blood alcohol level at the time of the crash. It was 0.321%, more than four times the legal limit, according to court records. It also took time to transfer the case to the Omaha City Prosecutor’s Office from the Douglas County Attorney’s Office, where O’Connor had served as a civil attorney until August.
O’Connor is accused of crossing into incoming traffic in a Benson neighborhood in east-central Omaha around 8:30 p.m. May 21, where she allegedly clipped the family’s car.
Mountain again called for her resignation and said a regent is expected to uphold the “highest standards of conduct” and that her alleged behavior raises significant concerns about public trust and safety.
“It is imperative to revoke and remove her position as a [regent] immediately,” Mountain said. “These actions will not only hold accountability but also serve as a firm reminder that such behavior is unacceptable for anyone and no one is above the law.”
Impeachment being considered
Under the Nebraska Constitution, anyone convicted of a felony cannot serve in public office. A constitutional officer, such as O’Connor, cannot be removed by her fellow board members, nor is there a public process for a recall petition.
The Nebraska Legislature has the sole power to pursue and pass articles of impeachment. A simple majority of at least 25 votes would send the charges to the Nebraska Supreme Court to decide whether to remove that officer from service and bar them from future service.
Lawmakers last impeached a state official in 2006 — a former NU regent facing alleged campaign finance violations — in a 25-22 vote. Six Supreme Court justices removed him from office.

State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha has said she is beginning the impeachment process against O’Connor, as the Nebraska Examiner first reported. She recently sent a letter to State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, chair of the Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, requesting a hearing into O’Connor’s actions, which could be used to gather evidence. Sanders did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
On Sunday, Kauth told supporters she plans to meet with Speaker John Arch of La Vista and Sanders this week on how impeachment would play out.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, who served as an NU regent between 2013 and 2023, including four years with O’Connor, has told the Examiner that the charges against O’Connor are “extremely serious,” while noting that she remains innocent until proven guilty.
“If she knows the allegations against her to be true, I urge her to reflect on whether she should remain in a position of public trust,” Pillen said in a previous statement. “The question of impeachment is entrusted by our Constitution to the Legislature, and I respect the judgment of that body on this matter.”
State Sen. Kauth takes steps toward impeaching NU regent, Pillen weighs in

O’Connor is a Democrat. Kauth, Pillen and a supermajority in the Nebraska Legislature are Republicans. Pillen would appoint in the case of a vacancy.
‘Merely political posturing’
Carolyn Folsom of Omaha echoed Mountain’s calls for O’Connor’s resignation Friday. Folsom said that had she been accused of the same thing, officials would have “thrown away the key,” yet Folsom said O’Connor was “privileged” and being treated differently.
“You are a disgrace to this board,” Folsom told O’Connor. “Do us all a favor and resign.”
Joseph Neary of Omaha, who is married to Deborah Neary, a member of the Nebraska State Board of Education, said it is “premature and unfair” to call for O’Connor’s resignation before due process has “run its course,” including allowing evidence to be presented.
O’Connor’s case appears headed to trial, barring any plea deal. She pleaded not guilty in August, and she has a pretrial conference scheduled with the presiding Douglas County District Court judge on Monday.
Neary said calls for O’Connor’s resignation are “merely political posturing.” Neary said it would be easy to step down but that he admires O’Connor, who was first elected in 2018 and reelected in November, for still being willing to work on behalf of Nebraskans.
“We have long recognized the principle of innocent until proven guilty,” Neary said. “To disregard that principle now would set a dangerous precedent.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)This week, Oct. 5 through 11, is National Newspaper Week. Having spent most of my professional life working for newspapers, I know what you can expect in your local publications. There will be advertisements or columns, like this one, reminding you about all the good that newspapers do for their community. This includes reporting all the news and sports, keeping a watch on local government, providing a marketplace for the ads of local merchants and serving as a safe haven for legal notices.
The columns and advertisements you see explaining National Newspaper Week serve a couple of purposes. First, they remind the public about the value of subscribing and advertising in a newspaper. Second, they serve as a kind of pep talk for the people who work in journalism, reminding them of how important it is to meet the challenges they face every day when they show up for work.





It’s a shame that most journalists in this state missed the best pep talk of all. That took place at the South Dakota State University Foundation on July 12 of this year at the annual meeting of the International Society of Weekly Newspaper Editors.
The society is an organization concerned with all aspects of newspaper journalism. Its members are, however, among some of the best editorial and column writers in the nation. I should know. This year I judged ISWNE’s writing contest.
After the writing awards were handed out, there were other awards as well. The most prestigious of ISWNE’s honors is the Eugene Cervi Award, given to the journalist who consistently acts with the conviction that “good journalism begets good government.”
This year’s winner was Eric Meyer, editor and publisher of the Marion County Record in Kansas. Meyer never intended to be a journalism rock star, but that’s what happened to him when his weekly newspaper and home were raided by police in August of 2023 in a move by local authorities that was as illegal as it was ill-advised. Local law enforcement took that unprecedented action under the false pretense that a reporter had committed identity theft by looking up a driving record on a public database.
The raid spawned national outrage, a handful of lawsuits and criminal charges against the police chief who led the raid. Eric’s mother, 98-year-old Joan Meyer, who was a co-owner of the newspaper, died the day after the raid after the stress of seeing her home and files rifled by police.
After teaching journalism for 20 years at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Eric had returned to the family newspaper as a retirement job. In retirement, however, he was not the editor of a sleepy, small-town rag. As one of the people who recommended him for the Cervi Award put it, “They picked on the wrong small-town newspaper.”
In accepting his award, Meyer spoke to the ISWNE crowd for 20 minutes. He needed no notes because this was his story. He told about the challenge of facing the tremendous cost of lawsuits and his luck with a judge’s ruling that his opponent would have to pay the newspaper’s legal costs. He joked about the newspaper’s antiquated bookkeeping system that wasn’t equipped to handle the hundreds of new subscriptions coming in from supporters across the nation.
The meat of his message was that the kind of hard-hitting journalism that led up to the police raid was just the sort of thing that all newspapers should be practicing. He admonished his fellow editors and publishers to ask tough questions, write stories that made elected officials uncomfortable and maintain a strong editorial voice.
Every community should have someone like Meyer who is putting in long hours at school board and city council meetings and keeping tabs on the county commission. They need someone asking tough questions about crime in the community and the plans for economic development.
There is no chance of having an Eric Meyer or someone like him in your community if you don’t make an effort to support your local newspaper. Subscribe and buy a subscription for someone who has moved away. Advertise and frequent the businesses that advertise in your local newspaper.
This country has seen many smaller newspapers struggle or close. At the same time, larger daily newspapers have cut back on the number of stories they cover. Newspaper journalism is becoming a rarity, often cherished only after it’s gone. Just ask the people in Brookings, Huron, Redfield and Flandreau about the gut punch they felt when their newspapers were temporarily closed this fall.
The theme of this year’s National Newspaper Week is “Embracing Local Journalism for a Better Future.” That’s a good slogan, but it misses the urgency of this moment. If readers and advertisers fail to embrace their local newspapers, there’s a good chance that the future will be devoid of the kinds of stories they need to make informed decisions.

Gavin Newsom is vowing to sue after Trump sends 300 California Guard troops to Portland, saying Trump is using the military as a ""political weapon.""","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom is vowing to sue after Trump sends 300 California Guard troops to Portland, saying Trump is using the military as a “political weapon.”


President Donald Trump is deploying 300 California National Guard troops to Portland, Ore. after a federal judge temporarily denied Trump the ability to federalize the Oregon National Guard, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Sunday. The governor said he will sue the federal government to halt the deployment.“The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens. We will take this fight to court, but the public cannot stay silent in the face of such reckless and authoritarian conduct by the President of the United States,” said Newsom in a press release.Spokespeople for Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta did not immediately reply to emailed questions about when the suit would be filed or what it would argue.
The dynamic is highly unusual, in no small part because Trump is essentially pulling troops from one state that has opposed his use of the National Guard to another state where political leaders also reject Trump’s moves.
Trump claims he needs to deploy federalized troops because the city of Portland is under siege by protesters opposing the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement actions. 
But Karin Immergut, a federal judge in Oregon, wrote in her ruling Saturday that the protests there are “not significantly violent or disruptive” to justify Trump’s use of Oregon’s National Guard. Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued her decision as part of a temporary restraining order against the federal government after the state of Oregon and city of Portland sued the Trump administration last week.
Protesters there set up “a makeshift guillotine to intimidate federal officials” while other protesters flashed bright lights into the eyes of federal officials driving, Immegut summarized. “These incidents are inexcusable, but they are nowhere near the type of incidents that cannot be handled by regular law enforcement forces,” Immergut wrote.The Trump administration on Sunday appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson did not directly confirm whether California troops have been sent to Oregon, but said in an email that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement.”
Trump sent thousands of troops into L.A.
California sued Trump in June after the president ultimately federalized 4,000 of the state’s National Guard troops and 700 Marines to protect federal property and provide support for federal immigration law enforcement officers after protests across Los Angeles County erupted over immigration sweeps.
A district judge, appointed by a Democrat, sided with Newsom by issuing a temporary restraining order against Trump’s use of the National Guard in June. But a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked that decision, giving Trump control of the federal troops again.
Trump has characterized Portland and other Democratic-run cities as dangerous, high-crime zones and last week told a gathering of U.S. generals that the military should “use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”

The Oregon judge’s decision doesn’t conflict with the higher court’s reasons for returning the federal troops to Trump, said Kelly Simon, a legal director at the ACLU of Oregon, during a press conference.The appeals court said judges can review such military decisions, refuting an argument by Trump administration lawyers. And while the “courts have to give a substantial deference” to a president’s decision to deploy National Guard troops to a state against the wishes of a governor, the White House still has to make that “determination rooted in fact,” Simon said. “The president’s determination was untethered from the facts.”
The California federal lower court judge also ruled in September that federal troops were used for law enforcement purposes, a violation of a 19th century law banning the military from such activity.“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” wrote Judge Charles Breyer. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.”He blocked the Trump administration from using the military to engage in “arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants, unless and until” the administration presents valid constitutional or legal exceptions.
The Trump administration has also appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)What began as a quiet October Friday in Virginia politics erupted into a full-blown national scandal when screenshots of private, three-year old text messages showing Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones fantasizing about shooting then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his children were made public.
The National Review story revealed an August 2022 exchange between Jones — a former Norfolk delegate and one-time assistant attorney general — and Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield. In the texts, Jones described a scenario in which Gilbert “gets two bullets to the head,” followed by a wish that the Republican lawmaker’s children “die in their mother’s arms.”
The messages, sent shortly after Gilbert offered public condolences over the death of retired Democratic Del. Joe Johnson of Washington County, stunned political circles across Virginia and beyond. Coyner confirmed the authenticity of the exchange in a statement Friday evening, calling the remarks “disgusting and unbecoming of any public official.”
“On August 8, 2022 I had a text conversation with Jay Jones,” Coyner said. “What he said was not just disturbing but disqualifying for anyone who wants to seek public office. Jay Jones wished violence on the children of a colleague and joked about shooting Todd Gilbert.”
In a statement Friday evening, Jones admitted sending the messages and said he takes “full responsibility” for his actions. He apologized directly to Todd Gilbert and his family, and vowed to work to regain Virginians’ trust.
 Republicans seize on the scandal

The revelation instantly reshaped a statewide race that had already been fiercely contested. After initially declining to comment, Attorney General Jason Miyares, the Republican incumbent, condemned his opponent during an impromptu news conference in Richmond Saturday afternoon.
“The attorney general is the chief law enforcement officer of Virginia,” Miyares said. “It must be done with character and integrity. Jay Jones has proven he is reckless, biased, and willing to trade away his integrity. This conduct is disqualifying.”
Miyares added that he had “sat with crying victims” of violent crime as a prosecutor and called Jones’s comments “the kind of darkness that disqualifies anyone from holding public office.”
Gov. Glenn Youngkin echoed that sentiment in a post on X, calling the messages “violent, disgusting rhetoric targeted at an elected official and his children.”
“Jay Jones said that ‘Gilbert gets two bullets to the head’ and then hoped his children would die,” Youngkin wrote. “There is no ‘gosh, I’m sorry’ here. Jones doesn’t have the morality or character to drop out of this race.”
Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, now the Republican nominee for governor, went further — attempting to tie the controversy to her Democratic opponent, former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger.
“Jay Jones is the poster child for the Democrat establishment and he fantasizes about murdered little children laying lifeless in their mother’s arms,” Earle-Sears said in a statement. “My opponent Abigail Spanberger urges her supporters to fill their hearts with violent hate. ‘Let your rage fuel you,’ she says. Words have meaning.”
Earle-Sears’s campaign released a new television ad Sunday morning repeating those claims, even though Spanberger’s 2024 “rage” quote came in the context of urging voter turnout, not violence.
 From Richmond to Washington

The fallout quickly spilled beyond Virginia’s borders. 
On Saturday afternoon, Vice President JD Vance weighed in, using the controversy to accuse Democrats of hypocrisy.
“The Democrat candidate for AG in Virginia has been fantasizing about murdering his political opponents,” Vance wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I’m sure the people hyperventilating about sombrero memes will join me in calling for this very deranged person to drop out of the race.”
President Donald Trump entered the fray Sunday morning, posting on Truth Social that “the Radical Left Lunatic, Jay Jones,” who is running against “the GREAT Attorney General in Virginia, Jason Miyares,” had made “SICK and DEMENTED jokes, if they were jokes at all,” about “the murdering of a Republican Legislator, his wife, and their children.” 
Trump accused Jones of spreading “not funny” and “deranged” remarks, while blasting Spanberger as “weak and ineffective” for not condemning Jones more forcefully. 
“Even Democrats are saying it is ‘RESIGNATION FROM CAMPAIGN’ TERRITORY,” Trump wrote, calling on Jones to “drop out of the Race, IMMEDIATELY.” He closed the post by giving his “Complete and Total Endorsement” of Miyares — his first in Virginia’s statewide elections this year — saying “JASON WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN.”
Other Republicans quickly followed suit, with U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson writing that “there is no conceivable justification for wishing violence against a political opponent and their children,” and urging Jones to “immediately withdraw his candidacy.”
And White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said the episode showed how “dangerously radicalized the Democrat Party has become.”
Republican Attorneys General Association chair Kris Kobach called the texts “abhorrent” and urged Jones to withdraw. The group also launched a website, displaying the messages in full.
U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, said he was “very disturbed” by the idea that Jones would “fantasize about Mrs. Gilbert having to watch her children die in her arms.”
Virginia House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, praised Coyner for “showing real courage by standing up to Jay Jones’ inappropriate and offensive comments.”
And John Reid, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor — who faced his own scandal earlier this year after reports that explicit Tumblr posts tied to an account with his name had surfaced — also joined the chorus. The revelation at the time prompted Youngkin to personally urge Reid to drop out of the race, a request he ultimately rejected.
“Democrats have a violence problem. Jay Jones just got caught saying it a little too clearly,” Reid wrote on X. “Killing your opponent and his kids? Disqualifying.”
 Democrats condemn but don’t call for withdrawal

Democratic leaders across Virginia responded with near-universal disgust — but stopped short of demanding Jones end his campaign.
U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., called the comments “appalling” and “inconsistent with the person I’ve known.”
Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, said she was “disgusted” by Jones’s remarks and had spoken directly with him Friday afternoon.
“I made clear to Jay that he must fully take responsibility for his words,” Spanberger said in a statement. “As a candidate — and as the next governor of our commonwealth — I will always condemn violent language in our politics.”
State Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, said Jones “must take accountability for the pain that his words have caused.”
Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, was among the most forceful in his response, calling the texts “a serious lapse in judgment that cannot be defended.”
“While we don’t share the same political views, I consider Todd Gilbert a friend and an honorable person,” Surovell said. “The comments directed at him and his family were completely out of bounds.”
Surovell added that the context of the exchange — apparently sparked by condolences after Johnson’s passing — made the remarks “even more inappropriate.”
After publicly condemning Jones’ texts, Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, spent Sunday campaigning in Coyner’s district. Speaking to parishioners at Mt. Calvary Baptist Church in Hopewell, Scott urged voters to keep their attention on the broader stakes of the election.
“We have to be mature in our thinking and how we vote,” Scott said. “We can’t get distracted, because they want us to get distracted by the text message here or something else. Stay focused.”
 Jones calls texts “a grave mistake”

Jones issued what he called his “deepest apology to Speaker Gilbert and his family,” adding that “reading back those words made me sick to my stomach. I am embarrassed, ashamed, and sorry.” 
He said he had reached out “to apologize directly to (Gilbert), his wife Jennifer, and their children,” and admitted that while he “cannot take back what I said,” he could “only take full accountability and offer my sincere apology.” 
He added that Virginians “deserve honest leaders who admit when they are wrong and own up to their mistakes,” calling the texts “a grave mistake” and pledging to “work every day to prove to the people of Virginia that I will fight for them as attorney general.”
Appearing live on Richmond’s WRIC Friday night, Jones apologized once again. 
“I’m so deeply, deeply sorry for what I said,” he said during the interview. “I wish that it hadn’t happened, and I would take it back if I could.”
Jones’s campaign did not respond to additional requests for comment.
Some Democratic allies, particularly within Jones’s home base of Hampton Roads, stood by him even as they condemned the texts.
State Sens. Louise Lucas of Portsmouth and Mamie Locke of Hampton released a joint statement describing the comments as “deeply disturbing” but warned against allowing the controversy to overshadow the stakes of the November election.
“There is no place for political violence or violent rhetoric in our public discourse,” they wrote. “Jay must take accountability for his actions. But we will not allow this moment to distract from the urgent fight we are in for Virginia’s future.”
The senators credited Jones for his service as a legislator and assistant attorney general, calling him “a father raising two young boys” who “has demonstrated the character and compassion the Office of Attorney General deserves.”
 A national October surprise

The scandal arrives just one month before Virginians elect a new governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general, as well as all 100 seats in the House of Delegates — a cycle already under the microscope as a bellwether for 2026 and the next presidential election.
For Republicans, the Jones texts have become a rallying cry in their broader message about “Democratic extremism.” For Democrats, they pose a test of unity and discipline at the worst possible moment.
As of Sunday afternoon, Gilbert himself had not commented publicly. 
A longtime Shenandoah Valley Republican and former House speaker, Gilbert stepped down from his role as a lawmaker in June to accept his nomination as the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia — a position he resigned after just one month.

He has not once tried to jump off a lap in nearly 100 hours of visits.” Courtesy photo
This story by Cheryl Casey was first published in The Waterbury Roundabout on Sept. 19, 2025.
Move over, therapy dogs. There’s a new king of emotional well-being in town.
Meet Toby, a 16-month-old Maine Coon of Waterbury Center, the first nationally certified therapy cat in Vermont. 
Toby and his human partner, Lisa Lovelette, have been bringing comfort and smiles to residents and staff at Woodridge Rehabilitation and Nursing in Berlin for nearly a year and along the way, Toby has refined his support skills and gained certification.
Lovelette recalled how she began to consider Toby in this new role after realizing that her dog Teddy, also a certified support animal, wasn’t really fitting in with the residents at Woodridge. “Teddy wasn’t really working out. It was a mismatch of energy,” she explained.
That’s when Lovelette decided to pursue her aspiration of training a therapy cat and found Toby the kitten at Cedar Rock Maine Coon Cattery in Northern Vermont. 
“They did an excellent job of socializing him as a kitten,” Lovelette said. Toby went home with her at 10 weeks old instead of the typical 14 weeks that adopters wait. In those early weeks, Lovelette said she brought Toby everywhere with her – often in her backpack – to expose him to as many kinds of experiences, people, and other stimuli as possible. 
Toby’s first visit took place when Lovelette stopped by to visit a friend at the facility. “He came here as a baby,” recalled Kathi Tynan, who works as Life Enrichment Coordinator at Woodridge. 
From day one at Woodridge, Toby was “absolutely a dream,” admitted Lovelette, describing how Toby would sit next to people or on their laps with complete patience while they stroked and patted him. 
“He’s a real gift to the elders,” Lovelette said, adding that Toby “never once tried to jump off of a lap.” 
Administrators from Central Vermont Medical Center, which manages Woodridge, were skeptical of Toby’s suitability as a therapy animal, citing concerns about allergies and their own lack of a clear policy about therapy animals besides dogs. Toby couldn’t gain official certification as a therapy cat until this spring when he turned 1 year old, so Lovelette and Toby spent much of last winter wondering if that plan would be derailed by red tape. 
Certification required 10 hours of supervised visits under the observation of an approved evaluator; Lovelette intended for these in-training visits to take place at Woodridge. 
Fortunately, the pair had cheerleaders at Woodridge, especially Tynan, who Lovelette said persistently and effectively advocated to administrators for Toby’s visits to continue. 
“The response has been very touching. It’s been very enriching to the residents, improving their quality of life,” Tynan said. “It was kind of a no-brainer because the response was so completely positive – there was no way we could go back!” 
After several months, Tynan prevailed and administrators relented with the understanding that Toby and Lovelette would meet certain conditions – most of which were already part of the certification requirements, including claw caps, vaccinations, a control evaluation by a vet, and use of a leash. They also were to coordinate their visits with the nurses’ schedules, ensuring they would not come on a day when the one nurse with a cat allergy was working.
Getting credentials 
The next task was to undergo the formal certification process. There are only two national organizations that certify therapy cats, Pet Partners based in Bellevue, Washington, and Love on a Leash in Oceanside, California. Lovelette chose the latter, saying Love on a Leash’s process allowed her “to learn and grow” so she can “be that guide for anyone who is even remotely interested” in training a therapy cat. 
According to the IAABC Foundation, a charitable sister organization to the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants, only about 2% of the therapy animal teams certified by the two national organizations involve cats. 
Lovelette said that cats are underrepresented as therapy animals because “they aren’t known to be trainable.” 
A former teacher and principal, she noted that working with Toby was a lot more like working with kids than dogs. “Dogs require this step-by-step process of learning different commands, but training cats is more holistic,” she said. For cats, it’s about “giving them the experiences to acquire attributes of confidence and calm.” 
It also sometimes just comes down to the cat. According to a study by Washington State University professor Patricia Pendry and her research colleagues in Belgium, some cats naturally possess the personality traits that are ideal for a therapy animal, like sociability, willingness to engage with people, and tolerance of being handled. 
“There’s the perception that cats just aren’t suitable for this kind of work, but our study shows that some cats may thrive in these settings,” Pendry said in a press release from the university. The study still leaves questions about whether the desired traits can be developed through experience or if they must be innate and then encouraged. It still points to the promise of expanding the pet-therapy options for people who simply might not like dogs.
For such people, therapy cats remain a largely elusive option, a situation Lovelette is determined to change. But first, she and Toby had to become a certified team themselves. 
Once again, Tynan played a key role. She worked with Love on a Leash to be trained as a formal observer so that Toby and Lovelette could achieve their 10 hours of in-training evaluation.
“It really was not hard,” Tynan said. “Toby would come for an hour a week and I’d observe the reactions to Toby and what Toby’s reactions were. He would just relax.”
Tynan confirmed Lovelette’s assertion that Toby hasn’t yet jumped off a lap. “He is definitely impressive. Not all cats are like that,” she said. 
It’s his easygoing, friendly nature that makes Toby a natural for this role and the reactions from the Woodridge residents prove that. “Their faces would light up and they’d just snuggle up with him – even when there was a vacuum cleaner around,” she said. 
Tynan agreed that the addition of Toby has expanded everyone’s idea of therapy animals, noting that before the furry Maine coon cat came on the scene, Woodridge’s experience with therapy animals was just with dogs. For the residents, not everyone is a dog person, Tynan said, and cats have their own unique way of engaging with people. “Toby gets right up to the residents and snuggles with them,” she said. “He’s just full of love.”
‘A glimmer of light’
The therapy team of Toby and Lovelette officially earned their certification in August. Lovelette called this achievement “the greatest accomplishment of my life because there’s no recipe to figuring it out or experts to fall back on.”

She and Toby continue to spend about two hours every Tuesday afternoon at Woodridge, where she knows Toby is making a real difference in residents’ lives. Spending time at an elder care facility has been “eye-opening” for Lovelette. “It’s a wonderful staff, and they give good care, but residents otherwise have so little actual interaction with others, especially with touch,” she noted.
Staff often give Lovelette tips on who might need Toby most on visiting day, such as a new resident or a resident whose spouse recently passed away. “We try to give everybody 10 or 15 minutes at minimum” if they want it, Lovelette explained. She also observed how staff members’ faces light up when Toby arrives. “He’s a glimmer of light in a very hard job,” she remarked.
Toby’s weekly visits now are a highlight at the facility for staff and residents alike, Tynan said. She shared various comments from the residents that she collected in making the case supporting Lovelette and Toby’s continued appearances. “I remember one saying something like, ‘Today’s a day for living because Toby is coming.’ Or, ‘I wait all week to see Toby,’” she recalled. “Whether they have dementia or not – they know Toby is coming.” 
Hoping to inspire
Now that Lovelette herself has gone through this process and is certified, she said she’s in a position to support other potential therapy-cat teams in the region. “I want this to be the beginning, not the end,” Lovelette insisted, adding resolutely, “If I can get just one person.” 
Lovelette said she’s confident that anyone who thinks their cat has a suitable temperament and personality can follow in hers and Toby’s footsteps. “The majority of the [approximate] 250 therapy cats in our country were mature shelter cats when they started working, so it does not take a special breed to do this work,” she said. 
The cost to obtain certification through the Love on a Leash organization that Lovelette worked with is mainly the time spent to meet the requirements. According to the group’s website, its membership fee is $80 in addition to any veterinary fees for a required evaluation. Once certified, the therapy teams work on an entirely volunteer basis, a requirement for the LoaL program.
Lovelette said she hopes hers and Toby’s story will be an inspiration, and they’re ready to mentor other prospective therapy cats and their humans. “I hope it generates interest to the point where just one person decides to take the journey,” she said. “I am keeping my expectations low and hope I am surprised.”

Montgomery police are investigating a mass shooting that left two dead and 14 injured late Saturday night.(Getty Images)A shooting following a football game in Montgomery Saturday night left two dead and 12 injured, according to police. 
The Montgomery Police Department said in a statement Sunday morning that the shooting took place at festivities following the Morehouse-Tuskegee Classic, a football game between two historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) at the Cramton Bowl. 
The injured included two juvenile males, including one with life-threatening injuries, the statement said. 
“In total, three victims remain in life-threatening condition, and nine sustained non-life- threatening injuries. Detectives are actively pursuing leads and reviewing evidence, including witness statements and surveillance footage,” the release read.
A press conference was scheduled for noon on Sunday.  
Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, condemned the violence on his Facebook page early Sunday morning.
“I am praying for all of the victims and their loved ones. Let us all hope for and work towards the day of conflict being resolved in a non-violent way,” Ensler wrote. 
Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth also extended his prayers Sunday morning.
“Fourteen injured, two dead, and others clinging to life after a Saturday shooting in downtown Montgomery,” he wrote. “Local leaders must be willing to lead in order to stop the crime and violence.”
Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said in July that violent crime in the capitol had decreased 28% in the first half of the year. Reed and the Montgomery City Council in July approved a youth curfew banning people 17 and younger in downtown Montgomery from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. from Sunday to Thursday, and from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. 
Alabama had the fourth-highest firearm death rate in the nation  in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at 25.6 deaths per 100,000. More people died by gunfire in Alabama that year than in New York State, which has nearly four times Alabama’s population. 
Saturday’s mass shooting took place just over a year after a mass shooting in Birmingham left four people dead and 17 injured. Birmingham police said Glock switches – devices that effectively turn firearms into automatic weapons – played a role. The incident led to the Legislature last year passing a law making possession of Glock switches a state crime, which Ensler helped pass.

James Alcorn and former Confederate Gen. James Chalmers led a political coup in Coahoma County.","October 5, 1875
U.S. Sen. James Alcorn and former Confederate Gen. James Chalmers led a political coup in Coahoma County. The white mob they gathered had a “dead list” of Black men they planned to assassinate. At the top of the list? Sheriff John Milton Brown, a Black man they falsely accused of planning a massacre of white men. They planned to hang him.
When a white mob of up to 1,500 moved to seize power, a few hundred Black men, who had been attending a Republican meeting, tried to fight back at Friars Point, only to be overwhelmed. 
“Don’t shoot these Negroes, boys,” Chalmers was quoted as saying. “We need cotton pickers.” 
The coup ended Black participation in local government, signaling the restoration of white supremacy that would continue across Mississippi in the years to come.
Brown and others fled the community. He went on to serve as superintendent of the Kansas Freedmen’s Relief Association, where he helped other African Americans flee racial violence and economic oppression. He later became a leader in Kansas Republican politics and a major in the 23rd Kansas Volunteer Infantry Regiment, the state’s only all-Black militia unit during the Spanish-American War, a pioneering effort to have Black officers command Black soldiers.
As for Alcorn, he continued serving in the U.S. Senate until 1877 when he retired from political life. He died 17 years later and was buried at his “Eagle Nest” plantation in Coahoma County.
Three years after Alcorn retired, Brown took his seat in front of a committee of that same U.S. Senate. He testified that he told Chalmers “there would be no trouble,” but when that failed to help, he fled through the cane-break. 
“I heard the shotguns going off all around me.” 
The mob killed a group of Black men, whose bodies weren’t found for another two months. The mob also shot an unarmed Black preacher, killed another man and pulled a Black man by a rope for eight miles, he said. 
“They had him say his prayers and hold up his hands, and they discharged two barrels of a shotgun through him. That is the way they murdered him,” Brown said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/05080318/Friars-Point-today-public-domain.jpg,,,2025-10-05 09:57:00.747572

Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming on Oct. 26, 2024. (Photo by Hunter C. Kirkland/U.S. Air Force)At a memorial service in 2022, veteran Air Force Capt. Monte Watts bumped into a fellow former Minuteman III nuclear missile operator, who told him that she had non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Watts knew other missileers with similar cancers. But the connection really hit home later that same January day, when the results of a blood test revealed that Watts himself had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
“I don’t know if it was ironic or serendipitous or what the right word is, but there it was,” Watts said.
Within the community of U.S. service members who staff nuclear missile silos scattered across the Northern Rockies and Great Plains, suspicions had long been brewing that their workplaces were unsafe. Just months after Watts was diagnosed in 2022, Lt. Col. Danny Sebeck, a former Air Force missileer who had transferred to the U.S. Space Force, wrote a brief on a potential cancer cluster among people who served at Minuteman III launch control centers on Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.
Sebeck identified 36 former workers who served primarily from 1993 to 2011 and had been diagnosed with cancer, including himself. Of those, 11 had non-Hodgkin lymphoma; three had died. The Air Force responded swiftly to Sebeck’s findings, launching a massive investigation into cancer cases and the environment at three intercontinental ballistic missile bases and a California launch facility. The goal is to complete the research by the end of 2025.
The service has released portions of the studies as they conclude, holding online town halls and briefings to highlight its findings. But while former missileers say they are heartened by the rapid response, they remain concerned that the research, which crosses decades and includes thousands of ICBM personnel and administrative workers, may address too large a population or use statistical analyses that won’t show a connection between their illnesses and their military service.
They need that tie to expedite benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Historically, the Department of Defense has been slow to recognize potential environmental diseases. Veterans sickened by exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam, Marines who drank contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and service members who lived and worked near burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan fought for years to have their illnesses acknowledged as related to military service.
In the case of the missileers, the Air Force already had studied potential contamination and cancer at Malmstrom in 2001 and 2005. That research concluded that launch control centers were “safe and healthy working environments.” But with Sebeck’s presentation and the decision to pursue further investigation, Air Force Global Strike Command — the unit responsible for managing nuclear missile silos and aircraft-based nuclear weapons — said the earlier studies may not have included a large enough sampling of medical records to be comprehensive.
Sebeck, who serves as co-director of the Torchlight Initiative, an advocacy group that supports ICBM personnel and their families, told congressional Democrats on April 8 that the Defense Department has not accurately tracked exposures to the community, making it difficult for veterans to prove a link and obtain VA health care and disability compensation.
“I had to go to a VA person and pull some papers,” Sebeck said, referring to the government system for recording service members’ environmental risks. “It says that I visited Poland once. It doesn’t mention that I pulled 148 alerts in a launch control center with polychlorinated biphenyls and with this contaminated air and water.”
PCBs — and the missileers exposed to them
PCBs are synthetic chemicals once used in industry, including missile control electrical components such as display screens, keyboards, and circuit breakers. They have been banned for manufacture since 1979, deemed toxic and a likely carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Air Force’s Missile Community Cancer Study compares 14 types of common cancers in the general U.S. population and the missile community and also studies the environments at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California to determine whether they may have contributed to the risk of developing cancer.

The Malmstrom, Warren, and Minot bases together field 400 Minuteman III missiles, the land-based leg of the U.S. nuclear triad, which also includes submarine- and aircraft-launched nuclear weapons. The missiles are housed in silos spread across parts of Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, and Nebraska, staffed around the clock by missileers operating from underground, bunkerlike launch control centers.
So far, the Air Force investigation has found no “statistically elevated” deaths from cancer in the missile community compared with the general population, and it found that the death rates for four types of common cancers — non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung, colon and rectum, and prostate cancer — were significantly lower in missileers than in the general population.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounted for roughly 5.8% of all cancer deaths among people who worked in launch control centers from January 1979 to December 2020.
Early results, derived from Defense Department medical records, found elevated rates of breast and prostate cancers in the missile community, but a later analysis incorporating additional data did not support those findings. The studies also did not find increased rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Air Force officials noted during a June 4 online town hall, however, that these assessments are based on roughly half the data the service expects to review for its final epidemiological reports and cautioned against drawing conclusions given the limitations.
The final incidence report will include federal and state data, including information from civilian cancer registries, and delve into subgroups and exposures, which may “provide deeper insights into the complex relationship” between serving in the missile community and cancer risk, wrote Air Force Col. Richard Speakman in a September 2024 memo on the initial epidemiology results.
Gen. Thomas Bussiere, commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, said during the June town hall that only the final results will determine whether the missile community’s cancer rates are higher than the general population’s.
Some lawmakers share the concern of missileers about the Air Force study. Following the release of a University of North Carolina review of Torchlight Initiative data that showed higher rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma — at younger ages — among Malmstrom missileers, Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) introduced an amendment to a defense policy bill calling for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to review health and safety conditions in the facilities.
“Let’s make sure that we have some outside experts working with the Air Force studying cancer rates with our ICBM missions,” Bacon posted July 30 on the social platform X. “We want to ensure credibility and that whatever results come out, we’ve done total due diligence.”
Regarding additional studies on the working environments at the installations and a possible relationship between exposures and cancer risk, Speakman, who commands the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, said Malmstrom had two types of PCBs that the other two missile wing bases did not.
He added that benzene, found in cigarette smoke, vehicle exhaust, and gasoline fumes, was the largest contributor to cancer risk in reviews of the bases.
The assessment concluded that health risks to missileers is “low, but it’s not zero,” Speakman said. He said it would be appropriate to monitor the health of launch control workers.
Next steps
Watts, whose story has been highlighted by the Torchlight Initiative, has asked the Defense Department’s inspector general to investigate — the watchdog agency referred his request to Global Strike Command — and is closely watching the Air Force research. He said the bulk of the cancer cases reported to Torchlight occurred in the 2000s, when ICBM personnel still used technology that contained PCBs, burned classified material such as treated paper and plastic coding devices indoors, and possibly were exposed to contaminated water.
“I open the door and there’s guys standing there in pressurized suits with sampling equipment,” Watts recalled. “They said, ‘We’re here to check for contaminated water.’ I look at my crew commander, and we’re standing there in cotton uniforms. I said, ‘Do you see anything wrong with this?’”
Launch control operators no longer burn code tapes indoors and the Air Force has made improvements to air circulation in the centers. Sebeck wants Congress to consider including missileers and others sickened by exposure to base contamination in the PACT Act, landmark legislation that mandates health care and benefits for veterans sickened by burn pits and other pollutants.
“It’s documented that there is a large cancer cluster in Montana, probably also in Wyoming. People act surprised, but all they have to do is go to the oncology office in Denver. I can find my missileer buddies there. We are sitting in the same chairs getting chemotherapy,” Sebeck said.
Air Force Global Strike Command spokesperson Maj. Lauren Linscott said in response to Sebeck’s remarks that the unit understands the impact of cancer on its personnel and is committed to supporting them.
“While current findings are preliminary and no conclusions can yet be drawn, we are dedicated to a rigorous, peer-reviewed, data-driven process to better understand potential health risks because the safety of our airmen is our top priority,” Linscott said.
Bills introduced in the House and Senate would address the situation. In addition to Bacon’s amendment, the Senate version of an annual defense policy bill would require a “deep cleaning” of launch control centers every five years until the sites are decommissioned as a new ICBM, the Sentinel, replaces the Minuteman IIIs.
The Air Force aims to release its final epidemiological report by the end of the year.

Vermont State Treasurer Mike Pieciak and five of his counterparts in other states are challenging the inclusion of President Donald Trump’s media company in one of the country’s major indexes that’s used to guide investments in the stock market. 
Pieciak was the lead signatory on a letter this week to the head of the Russell 3000 Index, which tracks the performance of 3,000 of the country’s largest companies. The letter asks why the company that manages the listing, London-based FTSE Russell, decided last year to make Trump Media & Technology Group a part of its index.
In addition to Pieciak, the letter was signed by state fiscal leaders from New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Maryland, as well the comptroller of New York City.
Trump Media & Technology’s most prominent brand is Truth Social, the social media network Trump launched in 2022 after he was banned from what was then Twitter. The president’s company, which trades under the symbol DJT, also operates Truth+, a streaming service, and earlier this year launched a financial technology platform. 
Pieciak and the other state treasurers and comptrollers wrote that the inclusion of Trump’s company in the Russell 3000 Index “undermines” the index’s credibility. That’s because the company has lost more than half of its value since it debuted on the stock market in March 2024, they wrote, while at the same time, generating “negligible revenues.”
Other Trump-related ventures, they added, have been similarly volatile for investors, including a meme cryptocurrency coin and non-fungible token trading cards, which “surged briefly before collapsing, leaving many investors with heavy losses.”
“The continued presence of TMTG in the index raises troubling questions on both financial and governance grounds, as well as on the integrity of the benchmark itself,” Pieciak and the other state leaders wrote in the letter, which was sent Sept. 29.
Pieciak and Vermont’s other Democratic statewide officials have repeatedly taken aim at Trump and actions taken by his administration since the president took office for a second term. Attorney General Charity Clark has joined other states to sue the Trump administration more than two dozen times since January, while Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas has pushed back on efforts by Trump’s Department of Justice to obtain sensitive voter data.

Tracking Vermont v. Trump
VTDigger is tracking Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark’s lawsuits filed against President Donald Trump’s administration.



It’s a different tact than Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who has urged state leaders to be less confrontational in what he’s said is an effort to protect Vermont’s existing federal funding and benefits. 
To be sure, Scott rejected two requests over the summer from the White House to use Vermont’s national guard to aid federal immigration enforcement and crack down on crime in Washington, D.C. But he also drew sharp criticism for complying with a request to share data on nutritional benefit recipients.
Pieciak said in an interview Thursday that more than $10.6 trillion in assets flow through the Rusell 3000, which includes retirement accounts, college saving plans and some state pension funds. Vermont’s public pension plans are not invested using the Russell index, he said.
But he noted that it’s likely many Vermonters are invested in funds that automatically buy whatever shares are part of the Russell index. That means many people likely own a piece, albeit small, of Trump’s media company, even if they don’t realize it. 
The treasurer said Trump’s media company is unique among the companies in the index because its value is largely based around the political capital of a single — albeit extremely powerful — person, rather than its own underlying financial success.
The letter asks FTSE Russell for “a clear explanation of the criteria and methodology used to include” Trump’s company in the Russell 3000, as well as “an assessment of how FTSE Russell has accounted for TMTG’s financial instability” and what safeguards the index will use to ensure future additions “reflect sound market fundamentals.”
“In some ways, it is the first of its kind,” Pieciak said.

In his excellent and informative article on prison overcrowding in Vermont, Ethan Weinstein briefly mentions CoreCivic, the private prison company that Vermont contracts to house prisoners in Mississippi. Readers should know that CoreCivic is a current and longtime client of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, with more than 500 ICE officials assigned to CoreCivic’s detention facilities.

They should also know that CoreCivic has a long record of providing inadequate mental and physical health care to inmates, as documented by investigative reporter Shane Bauer for Mother Jones and in his book, “American Prison: A Reporter’s Undercover Journey Into the Business of Punishment.” Bauer documents that the services provided are even more limited than those in state-run facilities and that CoreCivic faces the same hiring problems described by Weinstein.
Vermont prisoners sent to Mississippi may be out of sight, but Vermont remains morally responsible for the way its prisoners are treated. Vermont should find a better way to house its inmates and should not support the private prison industry.

My morning of dancing in the rain
Maelyn Slavik, 15, Burlington
I felt pretty this morning, and
danced around the room to
“Girls Just Want to Have Fun”
in my skirt and polo, and
tried to brush my hair while still
using it as a microphone,
brushing the stars
across my eyelids and
Chapstick onto my lips,
thanking the universe for
my perfect little morning,
as I walked around in my
Darn Tough socks, smiling
with my teeth
at no one in particular,
rereading one of my favorite books
while eating granola, sitting
in my favorite armchair
with my feet tucked up beside me.

I felt pretty this morning, even though
there was acne on my forehead, and
even though it was raining, I
rode my bike 
in all its turquoise-and-pink glory
to school, and kept on dancing,
wind rushing past my face and
already composing this poem
in my head,
even though it’s kind of
just a ramble.

I think, though,
that some mornings simply deserve
such a poetically messy ramble.

On Sunday, a gunman launched a horrifying attack on people at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan.
Thomas Jacob Sanford allegedly rammed his pickup truck, adorned with American flags, into the doors of the chapel as a service was taking place. Authorities stated he shot at worshippers with an assault weapon, then set fire to the building. Four people died, and police killed Sanford at the scene shortly afterwards.
Media reports and government spokespeople suggest Sanford was motivated by a pronounced hatred of followers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), widely known as Mormons.
According to a childhood friend, Peter Tersigni, Sanford became fixated with the church when he started dating one of its members while living in Utah:
He started dating this girl and then investigated and learned about Mormons because she was a Mormon. And I know that also, he got into meth really hardcore. It messed his life up and it messed his head up. And it just happened to be at the time he was around Mormons.
The language Sanford is reported to have used to describe Mormons – calling them “the antichrist” and saying “they are going to take over the world” – taps into a conspiracist suspicion of Mormons that has existed in America since the LDS church was founded in 1830, and which is still widespread in some subcultures today.
 Anti-Mormonism in American history

Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, had enemies from the beginning. New Christian sects were proliferating in America, but Smith went further than most. He declared himself a “prophet” and claimed to have a new religious scripture that was equal to the Bible.
Many denounced Smith as a fraud, and his neighbours feared the political power he wielded over his growing community of followers. After the Mormons were forced out of Missouri by a state Extermination Order and a subsequent massacre, Smith was assassinated by an anti-Mormon militia in Illinois in 1844.
The Mormons fled to Utah in 1847 under the leadership of Brigham Young. There they endured decades of federal government pressure to abandon the practice of polygamy and submit to the authority of the United States, which sometimes brought in armed forces.
This may seem like remote history, but to this day many evangelical Christians fear the fast-growing but “false religion” of Mormonism will lure people away from true Christianity. There is a cottage industry of YouTubers, some of them ex-Mormons, dedicated to disproving the teachings of Joseph Smith.
Nor has the violent past been forgotten. Earlier this year Netflix released a series depicting the Mountain Meadows Massacre, perpetrated by a Mormon militia in 1857.
Jon Krakauer’s 2003 bestselling book, Under the Banner of Heaven, also made into a streaming series, explored 1980s murders in a Mormon splinter sect. The book emphasised the prevalence of violence in early LDS history.
 Anti-Mormonism today

Anti-Mormon violence is relatively rare in America today, but aversion to Mormons is not.
A 2022 YouGov poll of Americans found 39% of respondents held unfavourable views of Mormons, compared to just 17% with favourable views. This net negative approval was comparable to American attitudes towards Muslims, and more negative than American attitudes towards atheists.
I argued in a 2014 study that Mormons face hostility from both sides of America’s culture wars. Many conservative Christians believe Mormons are not real Christians. At the same time, many liberal and secular-minded people associate Mormons with the Christian-right.
In 2012, the high-profile Mormon Mitt Romney became the Republican candidate for the presidential election. The number of liberal and non-religious people who said they would not vote for a Mormon for president increased significantly between 2007 and 2012, despite the fact Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was also a Mormon.
The LDS church was also prominent in campaigns against same-sex marriage in western states in the late 2000s. This led to protests and some acts of vandalism at LDS houses of worship, prompting expressions of solidarity by other conservative religious groups.
The bipartisan nature of anti-Mormonism arguably makes it one of the more socially acceptable biases in the US. But there is a world of difference between not wanting a Mormon president, or enjoying such mockery as the Book of Mormon musical, and physically attacking Mormons.
 From prejudice to violence

Between 2015 and 2024, the FBI counted 160 hate crimes reported against LDS victims. These included 63 acts of vandalism and property destruction and 29 assaults. The states with the most incidents were Utah (25), California (23), Washington (14), Tennessee (12), Georgia (10) and Nevada (10).
A 2019 report in the LDS-owned Deseret News expressed concern over rising anti-Mormon hate crimes. But it pointed out this was part of a larger trend of rising hate crime in the US, and that anti-LDS incidents were dwarfed by hate crimes targeting Jews and Muslims during the same period.
Immediately after the Grand Blanc killings, President Donald Trump called the incident “yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America”.
This fits his culture-war framing of Christians being under constant attack. But it glosses over the specific animus Mormons face in American society, often from other Christians and conservatives (the alleged Grand Blanc shooter wore a Trump 2020 shirt in a social media post).
Since 2000, there have been nearly 500 homicides in American places of worship, three quarters of them by firearm. This is a bigger problem than the violence facing any one religious group.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-05 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Owners of draft of President Kennedy’s speech about James Meredith’s integration of Ole Miss believe it has lessons for today,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/05/owners-of-draft-of-president-kennedys-speech-about-james-merediths-integration-of-ole-miss-believe-it-has-lessons-for-today/,"President Kennedy's speech on James Meredith integrating the University of Mississippi 63 years ago should be used as educational tool, Mississippi attorney believes.","Shirley Payne believes Americans should take a fresh look at the nationally televised speech that President John F. Kennedy delivered Sept. 30, 1962, as he announced he was “federalizing” a unit of the state National Guard to ensure that James Meredith, a military veteran, was enrolled as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi.
Payne, who practices law in the Jackson area with her husband, Dennis Horn, said the speech should be read and admired against the political rancor occurring today, especially over President Donald Trump’s apparent glee in sending National Guard troops to American cities.
She said Kennedy took a different approach  – an almost apologetic approach – as he nationalized a Mississippi unit of the National Guard to try to ensure order as Meredith enrolled.
By happenstance, Payne and her longtime friend, Stephen Sheppard, a former St. Mary’s University Law School dean and now professor at the school in San Antonio, have a copy of Kennedy’s speech draft and they are looking for ways to share it with other Americans, particularly college students.
“We want to contrast how it was handled to deploy troops (in America) before and how so much importance was placed on the courts and the rule of law,” Payne said recently.
Quite simply, Payne believes it is important to contrast that seminal event in Mississippi and indeed American history with what is occurring now.
Sheppard acquired through an auction the draft of the speech Kennedy delivered on national TV a little more than 63 years ago.
The first page that was part of the draft of the speech President John F. Kennedy delivered announcing the deployment of National Guard to ensure James Meredith was allowed to enroll as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi.
The draft contained on the first page the schedule of events as the federal government prepared to ensure Meredith’s enrollment. The front page also contains the prominent signature of Meredith, an “OK,” presumably scrolled by Kennedy, a doodle drawing and then six typewritten pages of a draft that eventually became the speech Kennedy delivered to the nation.
Payne said she and Sheppard have been longtime friends from when he worked as a clerk for Mississippi federal judges appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan – E. Grady Jolly and William Barbour – and she was an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.
Payne said they believe the draft is a history lesson that provides messages for Americans today.
In 1962 Kennedy said, “Our nation is founded on the principle that observance of the law is the eternal safeguard of liberty and defiance of the law is the surest road to tyranny. The law which we obey includes the final rulings of the courts, as well as the enactments of our legislative bodies. Even among law-abiding men few laws are universally loved, but they are uniformly respected and not resisted.
He continued, “Americans are free, in short, to disagree with the law but not to disobey it. For in a government of laws and not of men, no man, however prominent or powerful, and no mob however unruly or boisterous, is entitled to defy a court of law. If this country should ever reach the point where any man or group of men by force or threat of force could long defy the commands of court and our Constitution, then no law would stand free from doubt, no judge would be sure of his writ and no citizen would be safe from his neighbors.”
In terms of activating the National Guard, Kennedy said, “I deeply regret the fact that any action by the executive branch was necessary in this case, but all other avenues and alternatives, including persuasion and conciliation, had been tried and exhausted.”
Through it all, Kennedy tried to strike a conciliatory tone with Ole Miss and the state.
“You have a great tradition to uphold, a tradition of honor and courage won on the field of battle (by Ole Miss graduates)  and on the gridiron as well as the university campus,” he said. “You have a new opportunity to show that you are men of patriotism and integrity.
“For the most effective means of upholding the law is not the state policeman or the marshals or the National Guard. It is you. It lies in your courage to accept those laws with which you disagree as well as those with which you agree. The eyes of the nation and of all the world are upon you and upon all of us, and the honor of your university and state are in the balance. I am certain that the great majority of the students will uphold that honor.”
Of course, Kennedy’s words only did so much. The historic enrollment led to riots and violence, resulting in two deaths and more than 300 injuries.
There were some, including many Mississippi politicians, who learned little from Kennedy’s words in 1962. Shirley Payne and Steve Sheppard hope Americans can learn from those words now.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/07065025/AP_6210020100.jpg,,,2025-10-05 07:58:21.176319

“We have this resource in our backyard of small ponds, midsized lakes, rivers and streams that offer phenomenal fishing that are kind of unknown and overlooked,” a state fish biologist said.

Vermont fisherman Andrew Oestringer wrangled in a nearly 2-foot smallmouth bass on Lower Symes Pond in Ryegate in August. Weighing 7 pounds, 6 ounces, the catch could have broken the official Department of Fish & Wildlife state record by a long shot.
Oestringer — not realizing the catch he had — filleted the fish before weighing it on a certified scale, which would have landed him a spot in the annals of state angler history. 
Shawn Good, a fish biologist and administrator of the department’s State Record Fish Program, said that Fish & Wildlife can only accept fish weighed on a certified scale for the program but said the “new ‘unofficial record’ is one heck of a fish story.”
The bass’ uncertified weight is 10 ounces heavier than the official record-holder catch back in 2003, Good said. 
“It’s a dream come true for me,” said Oestringer, according to a department press release.  “There is no better place to fish than Vermont.”
While Vermont and particularly Lake Champlain is known for bass fishing, it is noteworthy Oestringer reeled in an unofficial record-breaking fish kayaking on a pond in the Northeast Kingdom, said Good.
“We have an incredible diversity of fishing opportunities across the state,” Good said in an interview. “We have this resource in our backyard of small ponds, mid-sized lakes, rivers and streams that offer phenomenal fishing that are kind of unknown and overlooked.”
The State Record Fish Program was established in 1969 to recognize the most sizable catches of each fish species in the state based on weight, Good said. 
In 2010, Good launched and now runs another effort, the Master Angler Program, to increase incentives and participation in fishing across the state, he said. In the past 15 years, there have been 13,174 entries, and only one person has caught all 34 fish species accepted by the state in the program, according to Good.
Unlike the State Record Fish Program, the state measures fish in the Master Angler Program based on length rather than weight. For adult anglers, the catch must be in the 5% length percentile of the fish species to submit to the program, whereas youth anglers can submit catches that fall within the 10% length percentile. 
At Lake Bomoseen, another inland water body in Rutland County, a Fair Haven Middle & High School student, James Lenox, 14, pulled in a 22 inch, 7 pound largemouth bass. The fish is the largest youth entry to the Master Angler Program and third-heaviest largemouth bass catch this year.

Michael Lenox, the young angler’s father and coach of the school’s varsity bass fishing team, said his son has participated in the Master Angler Program from a young age. James pulled in the largemouth bass on the south shore of the lake Sept. 14 and said it was the most exciting thing he has ever done, according to Michael.
“He has been fishing ever since he could hold a rod,” Michael said. “Lake Bomoseen is a great place to fish.”

VIDALIA – On a sweltering morning, Shannan Cornwell and Freddie Green got in a long line to wait for food. 
The couple has struggled to pay for groceries amid soaring prices and health setbacks, they said. She had back surgery. He had undergone cancer treatment.
They turned to a local food bank to supplement their diets. Although they’re grateful for the food, lately they’ve noticed changes in what they receive. For months in the spring and summer their pickups did not include any meat, Cornwell said. 
“You have to learn how to adapt to what you have,” Green said. “Which is hard,” Cornwell added.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In the spring, the Trump administration abruptly cut $500 million in deliveries from a program that sends U.S.-produced meat, dairy, eggs and produce to food banks and other organizations across the country — about a quarter of the funding the program received in 2024. The items that were delivered through the Emergency Food Assistance Program were some of the healthiest, most expensive items that organizations distribute. 
The cancellation of these deliveries comes at a critical time for food banks. Food insecurity is higher than at any time since the aftermath of the Great Recession, according to federal data, and many food banks are reporting higher need than they saw at the peak of the pandemic. Demand is only expected to increase; this summer, President Donald Trump signed into law the largest cut to food stamps in the program’s history. 
ProPublica obtained records from the Department of Agriculture of each planned delivery in 2025, detailing the millions of pounds of food, down to the number of eggs, that never reached hungry people because of the administration’s cut.
The cancellations began in mid-May, when over 100 orders of 2% milk bound for 31 states were halted.
The records show 4,304 canceled deliveries between May and September across the 50 states, Puerto Rico and D.C. (Experience this as an interactive story on ProPublica’s website.)
All told, the deliveries accounted for nearly 94 million pounds of food. The true loss is likely greater, food banks said, because not all of the year’s deliveries had been scheduled.
Most food banks rely on a combination of federal or state dollars, private giving and partnerships with businesses that donate leftover food. While the cancellations were disruptive to all food banks, according to their representatives, those that receive state funding or have strong community support said that they have weathered the cuts better than others.

The Food Bank of Central Louisiana, where Cornwell and Green’s groceries come from, gets more than half of its food from the federal government and receives very little state support. It serves rural areas of Louisiana, which has the highest poverty rate in the nation, according to U.S. census data.
The Trump administration canceled 10 orders for the food bank totaling over $400,000 of pork, chicken, cheese, dried cranberries, dried plums, milk and eggs, records show. The food bank has struggled to keep up with demand following the cuts and a decrease in private donations. Staff told ProPublica they used to distribute 25-pound packages of food, but over the summer, some packages shrank to about half of that weight.
“We’re not turning people away with no food. It’s not to that point,” said Jayne Wright-Velez, who has been the executive director at the food bank for 30 years. “But people are getting less food when they come to us.”
The organization has tried to fill the gap with produce donations, but transporting and distributing fruits and vegetables is challenging, and multiple patrons told ProPublica the produce had gone bad by the time they received it. 
On a recent morning, Codie Dufrene, 23, came to collect food for her grandfather and his neighbors, who live 45 minutes from the closest grocery store.

Usually, the trunk of Dufrene’s car would be full. Not lately. 
Dufrene received chicken for the first time “since way before the summer.” But the poultry came from a donation that hardly made up for the 74,000 pounds of chicken that never arrived in June.
She said that though her family is grateful and will use whatever they get, the quality of the food can be discouraging. Dufrene pointed out the condition of a cantaloupe she received. “You can tell — they’re frozen and they’re already super, super soft.” She said her mother would likely give them to her pigs, “because people can’t really eat those.”
Jayne Wright-Velez
Wright-Velez said the food bank trains its staff on food safety and does its best to check everything before it goes out, but it’s difficult to do at a large scale. “Especially in the heat of the summer, things just go bad so quickly,” she said. “The clock’s ticking as soon as we get the donation.”
The Emergency Food Assistance Program was created in 1983 to purchase farmers’ surplus food and distribute it to low-income people. The program’s budget is typically authorized every five years as part of the Farm Bill, but in 2018, the first Trump administration added funds to help farmers struggling under retaliatory tariffs the U.S. faced amid trade disputes. The additional, discretionary federal funds helped food banks serve more people; last fiscal year, they got nearly twice as much money from the fund as they did from their congressional allocation.
Now characterizing the additional funding as a “Biden-era slush fund,” the second Trump administration cut $500 million that had already been allocated. The government is still distributing food through other parts of the program, but food banks were caught off guard by the canceled deliveries because it’s rare for funding to be cut mid-year. Food bank managers, some with decades of experience, couldn’t recall a disruption like it. With the Farm Bill slated for renewal this fall, officials who run food banks worry that any additional cuts would cause them to have to scale back the number of people they serve. 
Already the need is greater than what food banks have on hand, said Shannon Oliver, the director of operations at the Oregon Food Bank.
“We’re having to kind of prepare for the fact that there’s just not going to be enough food, and having to be clear with setting the expectation that we’re doing everything we possibly can,” she said. 
The USDA did not respond to questions or requests for comment. In a May letter responding to senators’ concerns about the funding cut, the agency said it had made additional food purchases through another program and that the emergency food program continues to operate “as originally intended by Congress.”
“While the pandemic is over, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has not and will not lose focus on its core mission of strengthening food security, supporting agricultural markets, and ensuring access to nutritious foods,” the letter said.


Let us know what you think...


 

The need continues to grow
By 8 a.m., the line in the parking lot of a library in Albuquerque, New Mexico, snaked around a chain-link fence. People had been waiting for hours to pick up groceries from Roadrunner Food Bank, which lost about 850,000 pounds of food to the funding cut, according to USDA records. As a result, people are receiving less dairy, meat and other high-protein items.
New Mexico consistently ranks among the poorest states in the nation, and it has more food bank distribution sites than full-service grocery stores, according to data provided by the USDA and Roadrunner Food Bank. And in recent months, organizers have noticed more people showing up than usual.
“They’re having to run from place to place to place to try to stitch together enough coverage for their family,” said Katy Anderson, a vice president at the food bank.

Vivian Santiago, 54, pieces together what she can from food-distribution sites across Albuquerque. She also uses her benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed her daughter and 9-year-old granddaughter. Lately her electronic benefits card isn’t lasting even halfway through the month because of the increase in grocery prices, which have risen nearly 30% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
“It’s hard out there,” she said. 
Patricia Parker, 42, suffers from kidney failure and receives disability benefits. 
Parker has been homeless for about six months, sometimes sleeping in her car or staying with friends. She’s looking for a job after a recent stint at a laundromat didn’t work out. As she carried Doritos, green grapes, potatoes and onions from the Albuquerque food bank, she said she appreciates the help. 
“I won’t have to go days without food,” she said. 
Workers at food banks and pantries said that the canceled deliveries add to the growing challenges they face. Many staff members said they had seen a decline in private contributions and volunteers. Grocery stores and food manufacturers, which started managing their inventories more efficiently during the pandemic, now have less leftover food to give. Other Trump cuts have disrupted AmeriCorps, which helps staff mobile food pantries and other services, and are ending the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provided food from local farmers. 
Food banks with more resources can be more creative. Several told ProPublica they’ve hired someone whose job is to find grocery stores in the area willing to donate food. But in areas where grocers are scarce, there are fewer options. In some cases, food banks are among the only places where people can get fresh fruits and vegetables.
“When we see federal cuts like this, that affects entire communities and villages and towns,” said Stephanie Sullivan, assistant director of marketing and communications at Food Bank for the Heartland, which serves 93 counties across Nebraska and western Iowa.

‘There’s not an Option B’
Cuts and changes to foundational federal programs for low-income people — namely, SNAP and Medicaid — are a looming concern. The increase in need even before these changes take effect could signal that food banks are a “canary in the coal mine” for what’s to come, said Christopher Bosso, a food policy expert at Northeastern University and the author of a book on SNAP. 
Hunger will also be harder to measure now that the USDA has canceled an annual food insecurity survey, calling it “redundant” and “politicized.” 
“It feels like the idea is to make it harder to identify the consequences of the policy changes that we’re seeing right now,” said Marlene Schwartz, the director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut.
Food bank administrators emphasized that they could not fill the gap created by benefit cuts in the administration’s multitrillion-dollar spending bill. Feeding America, a national nonprofit association of food banks and other organizations, estimates that for every meal its food banks provide, SNAP provides nine. The majority of people who receive food assistance also receive Medicaid, so reductions in both programs could force people to choose between health care and groceries.

The legislation cuts SNAP by $187 billion, or 20%, through 2034, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. The bill, which has expanded work requirements for some recipients and taken protections away from others, will also increase the amount of money that states must contribute to the program for the first time in decades. Experts say it’s unclear how cash-strapped states will be able to shoulder that cost. 
Two experts on food insecurity told ProPublica that hunger is expected to rise with the new program rules as it has when SNAP spending has been reduced in the past. There could also be ripple effects: Research has shown that people enrolled in SNAP are less likely to be hospitalized. And grocery stores where the majority of customers use these benefits could close, said Gina Plata-Nino, the interim SNAP director for the Food Research and Action Center, a national nonprofit that works to eradicate hunger.
The people who are harmed are “working incredibly hard,” Plata-Nino said. 
“They are Americans who are falling on hard times and just need those resources to be able to have economic mobility and be able to escape poverty,” she said. “Without those resources, it just makes them even poorer and less equipped to be able to handle the tough economy that all of us are facing now.” 
Michael Heaton
Michael Heaton, 76, takes care of his 31-year-old son, who has autism; the two live off Heaton’s Social Security and his son’s disability payments. After the pandemic, Heaton, who is retired, said he saw his SNAP benefits shrink from $600 a month to just over $100. To supplement their diets, he goes to pantries and food-distribution centers around Albuquerque.
On a recent morning, he picked up two bags. “This fills that gap,” he said. “We only take what we need, we’re not trying to be gluttonous or anything.” 
Even food banks that rely less on federal funding are worried about what comes next if the emergency food assistance program is reduced or altered in a significant way. 
“There’s not an option B,” said Brian McManus, the chief operations officer of the Food Bank of Central New York. 
Louisiana, one of the states most reliant on SNAP, stands to be among the places hardest hit by further cuts.
“It’s unfortunate that in a time where the social safety nets are being cut, that our resources are also being cut,” said Wright-Velez. 
If people haven’t experienced food insecurity, or don’t know someone who has, they might forget something important, she said: 
“Those are real people on the other end of those cuts.”
In all, the USDA records indicate that food banks were expecting more than 27 million pounds of chicken, 2 million gallons of milk, 10 million pounds of dried fruit and 67 million eggs that never arrived. Food banks had planned to schedule more deliveries in the coming months. Those orders are not reflected in this data.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Lo uisiana Illuminator)It’s downright mystifying at times the lengths some officials will go to paint a rosy picture in the most dire circumstances. Sure, there are times when a dose of positivity will help folks through a tough situation, but there comes a point when reality must be confronted.
That’s where Gov. Jeff Landry seemingly found himself last Sunday after new aerial drone video footage from photographer Eric McVicker revealed the sorry state of the cleanup at Smitty’s Supply Inc. in Tangipahoa Parish – more than five weeks after the Aug. 22 explosion and fire. The video showed an adjacent large pond covered in petroleum products that leaked from the plant, and it pans over to show an oily slick extending into the nearby Tangipahoa River. 
That petrochemical runoff has flowed some 40 miles downriver toward Lake Pontchartrain, though officials say that body of water has not been affected so far. 
The governor was so moved by what he saw on McVicker’s footage that he posted his own video from the Governor’s Mansion to express his dissatisfaction with remediation efforts.  
“They’re not going fast enough,” he said about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-led effort. 
Landry said he arranged a call with EPA Regional Administrator Scott Mason, Louisiana Environmental Quality Secretary Courtney Burdette and state Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson. 
“Starting tomorrow morning, things are getting ready to start changing on the cleaning up of that site,” the governor said Sunday.
But when the governor led a news conference Wednesday in Tangipahoa Parish, his tone had softened considerably. In response to reporters’ questions about the enhanced response measures Landry had promised, he came to the EPA’s defense.  
“While I know it’s real easy to throw popcorn from the stands and it’s easy to make criticisms when you’re not on the ground, I will tell you that this incident is a unique incident. It falls between regulatory bodies,” Landry said.
Questions aren’t criticism, governor. It’s what journalists do in situations when officials can’t or won’t provide information the public needs. 
Case in point: The EPA withheld information about the hazardous product inventory at Smitty’s Supply for five weeks, saying it needed company clearance first. The agency made the info public a day after the Illuminator published a report revealing why it had been kept secret. So far, there’s been no explanation as to why it took so long to reveal what neighbors of the facility have been desperate to learn for health and safety reasons.
The lack of information from Smitty’s Supply since the explosion is conspicuous. No one from the company has taken part in news conferences, and they’ve not responded to our questions about its role in the cleanup. 
The EPA said last month it has $39 million in environmental remediation funds available to respond to the disaster but that it will need more. Smitty’s Supply is not currently paying for the cleanup but will be responsible for the cost, according to federal officials. 
Tangipahoa President Robby Miller told AN17 Local News Wednesday it’s been apparent for several weeks that more resources are needed to tackle the cleanup, and he said the EPA responded with more equipment in recent days.
“If I have a real complaint about the EPA, our federal government, it’s how long it takes them to get things done,” Miller said. “We all recognized three weeks ago that we needed more frac (pump) trucks, we needed more vacuum trucks. Then it took about a week to convince people to come see that we really did. Then it took about a week for them to get that all put together, and it all happened to kind of culminate … Monday. ” 
“It was just good timing on the governor making that statement at the same time all that work was happening,” the parish president added.
The governor will want to take credit for getting the EPA to bring more forces to bear for Tangipahoa cleanup. That’s fine. It’s what politicians do, regardless of whether they actually deserve it.
But it would also be great if Landry placed just as much emphasis on holding Smitty’s Supply accountable instead of the kid glove treatment they’ve been afforded so far.

Ned Lamont has intended to contrast his steady pragmatism with the drama of Trump. To that end, the federal shutdown has been a gift.","Gov. Ned Lamont’s summer favored events that put a gloss on nearly seven years in office that have defined the one-time darling of the left — the anti-Iraq war candidate who drove Joe Lieberman from the Democratic Party in 2006 — as a save-for-a-rainy day Democrat who sees salvation in stability.
The countdown to the launch of a campaign for a third term routed Lamont to a child care center at Trinity College in Hartford, a Swedish aerospace manufacturer in Newington, a building trades convention in Uncasville and a sunny plaza outside a bioscience office in New Haven.
All are places that provided an opportunity for Lamont to tell a story about something that is working in Connecticut, all building blocks to eventually click together in a campaign. The intent is to contrast his steady, if even stolid, brand of pragmatism with the deliberate drama and disruptions of President Donald Trump.
To that end, the federal government shutdown has been a gift.
“We’re the opposite of the federal government, trying to give people some certainty and stability that, despite the ups and downs out of Washington, D.C., we can manage — at least we can manage for the near term,” Lamont said from behind his desk Wednesday, exactly 11 hours after the shutdown.
A recent upgrade of Connecticut’s bond rating already had afforded him a chance to once again explain how depositing huge surpluses in a rainy day fund and the state’s neglected pension funds is paying dividends, a hedge against a fraying safety net as Trump shrinks the federal government and limits access to health care.

In July, a preschool playscape shaded by a towering grove of trees at Trinity was a venue to highlight his one major initiative in 2025: an off-budget, early childhood endowment denounced by Republicans as undermining the state’s belt-and-suspenders approach to spending caps. 
It promises to create 1,000 child care slots through next June, then provide free or subsidized care pegged to income, beginning in 2027. An opportunity to rebut complaints that he does little that is progressive, the governor briefly ratcheted his rhetoric up a notch: “This is a revolutionary investment in the future of Connecticut.”
What next?
But missing are hints of what else Edward Miner Lamont Jr. wants to accomplish if reelected in 2026 to a third term as the 89th governor of Connecticut, one of only 13 states allowing a governor to seek more than two consecutive terms. It’s a question he acknowledges that must be answered.
“You can’t sit around and talk about the past,” he said. “That’s for damn sure.”
Polling consistently shows voters with a positive opinion of Lamont’s performance, but there is evidence of fatigue. Surveys by the University of New Hampshire in May and September found a closely divided electorate on the question of a third term for him.
Lamont no longer is coy about a desire for one final term. When asked why he hasn’t announced, there is no talk of indecision, only timing. He seems on path for a formal announcement after next month’s municipal elections, the same timetable he followed four years ago.
“I keep hoping I can put the politics off a little bit longer,” Lamont said.
Of the other Democratic governors elected with him in 2018, two also are seeking third terms: Tim Walz, 61, of Minnesota declared on Sept. 16; JB Pritzker, 60, of Illinois on June 26. A third, Janet Mills of Maine, is term-limited and considering a run for U.S. Senate at age 77.
The age question
Lamont, 71, would be the first Connecticut governor to seek a third term since Republican John G. Rowland in 2002 and the oldest to seek reelection since the 76-year-old Wilbur Cross, a Democrat, lost a bid for a fifth term in 1938, when gubernatorial terms were two years.
A third term would begin Jan. 6, 2027, three days after Lamont’s 73rd birthday, and conclude after his 77th. His favorite governor, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., left office at 63, the same age as Lamont’s predecessor, Dannel P. Malloy. M. Jodi Rell was 65. (Rowland, whose exit was induced by an impeachment threat, was 47.)
The two contenders for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, 35, of Greenwich and Mayor Erin Stewart, 38, of New Britain, are trying to make liabilities of Lamont’s age, experience and ability to do things in a third term he did not in a first or second.
“Elections are about the future and what you can do to lead the people who you’re running to serve,” Fazio said last week. “And I think that residents across Connecticut want leadership that will make the state more affordable and that will create an economy that works for everybody.”
Stewart, who has been unavailable for an interview in recent weeks as she nears her own expected kickoff in November, opened an exploratory committee in January with a promise to “usher in a new generation of leadership to the state of Connecticut.”
Both are declared supporters of Trump, who lost Connecticut by double-digit percentage points in all three of his runs for president. They are certain to be regularly pressed about how their views and policies mesh with a president who dominates nearly every news cycle.
Lamont, an early supporter of Joe Biden’s run for president in 2020 and one of the Democrats who told the White House in 2024 it was time for the faltering Biden to step aside, said age was not a concern.
“That doesn’t factor in at all. I’m going strong. I feel like I’m more knowledgeable today than I was seven years ago,” Lamont said. Then he smiled and added, as though sharing a secret, “And Annie’s going strong.”
His wife, Annie H. Lamont, is a successful venture capitalist with no immediate plans to retire. While the governor lives during the week in the Executive Residence in Hartford, the first lady stays at their home in Greenwich, not far from her office and the oldest of the couple’s three children, who is married and the mother of the Lamonts’ only grandchild.

As emails previously reported by the Connecticut Mirror confirm, Annie Lamont is a close observer of policies and politics, unafraid to nudge her husband or his staff. More than once, she expressed concern that opponents to an omnibus housing bill were taking control of the narrative.
Lamont ultimately vetoed the bill, which was a priority of the Democratic majority legislative leadership, and sided with a Republican minority that called the measure an intrusion into local zoning. It is a source of friction with liberals, as is his opposition to spending more freely. 
A revised version could come to a vote in a special session by month’s end, one of several potential complications before kicking off his campaign. His administration also is at an impasse in state employee contract negotiations, and he has yet to agree on how much more money should be set aside to cope with the federal shutdown or federal cuts imposed by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Challenges
Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden is challenging Lamont for the Democratic nomination from the left, but fundraising has been difficult. He says the finance report due next week will show him raising $45,000 in his first three months as a candidate.
Qualifying for the state’s voluntary public campaign financing program requires raising $350,000 in small-dollar contributions. The gubernatorial grants in 2026 will be $3.2 million for a primary and $15.4 million for the general election.
Fundraising is no concern to Lamont. He spent $17 million of his own funds to challenge Lieberman, $9.1 million on a gubernatorial primary won by Malloy in 2010; and $15.1 million and $25.7 million on victorious gubernatorial campaigns in 2018 and 2022.
I think that our governor doesn’t recognize the severity of what’s actually happening right now.Rep. Josh Elliott, gubernatorial candidate
Elliott persists in trying to convince Democrats that being affable and unflappable are insufficient in coping with Trump and that Connecticut must aggressively spend to offset federal spending cuts.
“I think that our governor doesn’t recognize the severity of what’s actually happening right now,” Elliott said. “These are not normal times, and being nice is not going to get us through these turbulent times.”
Lamont makes no apologies for his fiscal restraint.
“I talk to other governors,” he said. “They don’t have a rainy day fund. They don’t have any reserves like we have here.”
Connecticut has $4.1 billion in budget reserves, the maximum under a law that allows the administration to bank no more than 18% of the general fund budget. Lamont says that means a recession would not force tax increases or cuts in state aid for education.
“I’m glad I’ve got $4 billion to make sure I won’t have to jack up your taxes or cut your education funds. That gives mayors, and that gives a lot of families, a little bit of confidence,” Lamont said.
A volatility cap adopted in 2017, a recognition that the state’s tax revenues are sensitive to the swings of Wall Street, has limited spending growth during an extraordinary string of annual budget surpluses.
Once the budget reserves reach the maximum, the volatility cap mandates that other surplus funds go to pay down the state’s pension debt. During Lamont’s tenure, that has meant an extra $8.6 billion in contributions to the pension funds, including nearly $1 billion in the previous fiscal year.
Lamont has opposed changes in the volatility payments to the pension funds, with limited exceptions. He signed off on a $300 million deposit to the early childhood endowment, and he is in talks with legislative leaders over setting aside other funds  as a contingency against federal cuts.

A month ago, Treasurer Erick Russell joined Lamont in announcing that the stabilization of Connecticut’s pension funds has lowered annual fixed costs, namely the actuarially required contributions to pensions, by about $700 million. The message was clear: The state should stay the course favored by Lamont.
The state’s pension funds now have $63 billion in assets managed by the treasurer, up from about $30 billion a decade ago, Russell said. 
The unfunded pension liability, plus the chronic fiscal crises that plagued Connecticut for the decade after the 2008 recession, were among the factors cited in a dire account published by The Atlantic in 2017: “What on Earth is Wrong with Connecticut?”
It described a collapse of manufacturing, shrinking population and stagnant economic growth. All three metrics have since rebounded to varying degrees.
For Lamont, the article is a touchstone (even if he tends to wrongly attribute it to the Wall Street Journal, not The Atlantic). It is a point of comparison justifying his approach to economic growth and budgeting.
“That’s not where we are today,” Lamont said at the press conference with the treasurer. “And we’ve made incredible progress in terms of economic growth. We’re making incredible progress in terms of dealing with our unfunded pension liabilities.
Lamont and his commissioner of economic development, Dan O’Keefe, happily reported to a manufacturing convention two weeks ago that federal statistics released that morning showed Connecticut’s GDP grew by in the second quarter by an annualized rate of 4.6%, making the state ninth for the fastest growth. 
The governor says, “I like where we are.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1002_SR_LamontPortrait_030-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-05 05:56:22.091873

The library, which opened in 1914, was one of dozens of Carnegie libraries in the state. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)PEABODY — Sunshine from the front bay windows of the Peabody Township Public Library brushes the desks and chairs and books inside with a natural warmth no electric light can match.
This scene, or something near to it, has repeated itself every afternoon since the library opened in 1914. The bay windows, set beneath patterned stained glass transoms, are on either side of the front door. The wooden chairs are the same chairs the first patrons used all those years ago, although they have since been refinished.
Over the circulation desk is a black-and-white photo of Emma Christ, the librarian in charge at the opening. On behalf of a civic committee, Miss Christ wrote to Andrew Carnegie asking him to fund a new library building in this railroad town in east-central Kansas. And he did.
I’ve come to Peabody to visit the birthplace of the first free library in Kansas. At a time of cultural uncertainty, what better place to find comfort than a civic temple to propagation of fact?
My connection to libraries is deep, from prowling the stacks as a kid at Johnston Public in my hometown of Baxter Springs to peering through the glass floors at the Kansas State Library at the Statehouse. I have measured my reach as a writer by how many card catalogues, online and otherwise, my works have appeared in. Libraries have always been my refuge, but they are under increasing attack from proposed Trump-era budget cuts, coordinated book-banning attempts, and a wrongheaded perception that libraries are useless in a digital age.
Rodger Charles, the Peabody library director, an expressive man with a full beard and blue braces over his striped blue shirt, told me that libraries are essential for communities. In many ways, he said, the Peabody library was the heart of town, providing not only books and programming but reliable connectivity. It wasn’t unusual, he said, to see residents huddled on the steps outside at 2 a.m. during a winter storm to connect to library Wi-Fi.
“Man, it’s a lifeline,” he said. “It breaks my heart when people look at the library as irrelevant because they think nobody reads anymore.”

Books are still his No. 1 checkout, Charles said, and the library has a lot of them — 9,000. As we chatted, one of the library’s 1,100 registered patrons approached the circulation desk with a romance novel.
Oct. 5 is the kickoff of the American Library Association’s Banned Books Week. Charles told me the library has had no books challenged since he arrived in 2011, although he did pass along a complaint about rough language in a western that was part of a regional library system travelling collection.
“I’ve got some books in here people don’t like,” he said. “But I wouldn’t being doing my job if I didn’t.”
The Peabody library was among 63 in Kansas funded by Carnegie in the early 20th century, including four academic ones. Just about every town of more than 1,000 inhabitants had a Carnegie library, and today about a third of them, like the ones in Peabody and Pittsburg and Oswego, are still working libraries. A dozen have been demolished and the rest are either vacant, have been repurposed for other uses, or — like the old municipal library building in Emporia — for sale.
But the Peabody library is not just an example of a surviving Carnegie library. It is also the oldest free library in the state of Kansas. The brick building is the successor to the library founded in 1874 that, unlike private libraries, did not charge a subscription fee of $25 or so. Instead, the books were loaned free to anyone — a citizen or a student or even a stranger — deemed trustworthy enough to return them.
The benefactor of that first library was F.H. Peabody, the town’s namesake, a resident of Boston who was the former vice president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. When Peabody visited the town shortly after its founding in the 1870s, he announced he would donate money for a library and its furnishings if the town would furnish the site.
That first library was a wood frame building, and Peabody sent 2,000 books and periodicals from Boston to get it started, according to Marcia Sebree, president of the Peabody Historical Society. It’s not difficult to imagine what the first building would have looked like; all you have to do is go around to the back of the present library and the well-maintained building is there, looking about as it did in 1874.
The wooden library building has travelled around town, having been moved from its original location in 1914 out to the old state fairgrounds and park and used by the Women’s Relief Corps to serve meals to Civil War veterans. It was restored in 1927 and placed at its current location in 1960.
The building is the local historical society now, and it’s filled with the kind of collective memory that builds up in a community over time. There’s a ledger containing the names of patrons and the books they checked out and returned in the 1870s, for example, and a cabinet containing the wooden models of a Heinkel bomber and other airplanes carved by German POWs interred at Peabody during World War II. There’s also memorabilia from the Joker Windmill Co., various period firearms, and a room full of dolls. But the northeast corner of the reading room, where Miss Christ sat and presumably wrote her letter to Andrew Carnegie, is still preserved, more or less as it appears in an old photograph.
The Carnegie Corporation agreed to provide $10,000 for a building to replace the frame structure, according to “The Carnegie Legacy in Kansas,” a 1985 publication by Allen Gardiner. The local committee chose a design similar to the one used for the Carnegie library in Galena, Illinois, and architect A.A. Crowell of Wichita drew up the plan. The M.R. Stauffer Construction Co. was awarded the construction bid. The library opened April 18, 1914.
The building was refurbished in 1978.
If you’re curious about how the building looks now, there’s a virtual tour on the library website.
The Peabody library survives, Charles told me, through the township mill levy and a combination of grants. In addition to the full-time director position, there are three part-time staffers. The library hosts a variety of events, from author talks to spam carving. Last month’s event with Daniel Markowitz, the author of a novel about a German POW hired to work for a Mennonite family near Peabody, drew 70 people, Charles said.
The first free library in Kansas was establishing in this building at Peabody in 1874. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)
More than 2,800 Carnegie libraries were built from 1883 to 1929.
Carnegie, who was born in Scotland in 1835, came to America as a boy and eventually became the richest man in the world through his steel empire. He attributed much of his success to the kindness of Col. James Anderson, a former officer in the war of 1812 who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to Carnegie and other working-class boys of Allegheny, Pennsylvania.
After making his fortune during an era of robber barons, Carnegie began giving it all away, confounding other industrialists. His favorite form of philanthropy was to endow libraries, in honor of Anderson.
“The man who dies rich dies disgraced,” Carnegie famously said.
The paradox was that Carnegie gave away millions that were made on the backs of laborers in his hellish mills. Like Alfred Nobel — the man who invented dynamite and then created a global prize for peace — Carnegie may have been trying to buy some existential dispensation.
Another reason the Peabody library may have remained viable after more than a century is because the town never fluctuated much in size, never increasing beyond 3,000. In other towns, Carnegie libraries were faced with expensive remodeling or major expansions to meet space and patron demand.
In my hometown of Emporia, there were two Carnegie libraries.
One was an academic library, the Anderson Memorial, located on the (now defunct) College of Emporia campus and opened in 1902. After a succession of owners, including Emporia State University, it has now been restored and is in private hands.
The other is the old Carnegie public library on Sixth Street, dedicated in 1906. The building served until 1979, when a new library building next door was dedicated. The old building then housed the county historical society but was left empty after the society moved to Commercial Street in 2016. The old library building was used for storage until 2020.
On Oct. 1, the Emporia City Commission put the old library building on the market for 90 days. If there are no takers, the city will face demolishing the building, at a cost of up to $400,000, among other options. City estimates for repair and renovation of the brick building exceed $2 million.
Other cities face similar decisions with their aging Carnegie buildings.
Personally, I never met an historic old building I didn’t like. It would be nice if we could save them all, because what we lose is not just space, but a community’s shared history. Nobody, of course, wants to pay for that. But we have been paying for it, all along, through the burden deferred maintenance has had on our communities.
We should have been investing in the upkeep of our century-old Carnegie library buildings all along. Built in an age when public structures were meant to last, they are municipal landmarks. The Peabody Township Library is an example of stewardship done right. But in too many other places the answer to aging infrastructure has been to put off maintenance and try to find buyers.  How many homeless shelters or community centers or arts cooperatives could have been made from those fabulous old buildings that are now falling in on themselves?
We also lose the example that Carnegie – did I mention he was the world’s richest man? — set for philanthropy. Imagine how revolutionary it must have been to build thousands of free libraries in an effort to democratize knowledge. Carnegie libraries were the original World Wide Web, bringing news and information from across the globe to places like Peabody, Kansas.
It is not by chance that libraries, including the Peabody Township Library, continue to provide life skills and links to career training through a variety of programs for their patrons. Charles told me there is hardly an issue a public library doesn’t address, and he described the job of a librarian as helping put people — children, young adults, working people, seniors — in touch with the entertainment, information and services they need. One section of the library is devoted to a collection of books for young adults to help them cope with anger, depression and feelings of self-harm.
“There’s nothing you can’t find at the library,” Charles said.
Libraries remain one of the most vital elements in any community.
As enumerated by the American Library Association, libraries are safe spaces where history is respected. Unlike the internet on your phone, librarians will help you find the right book, are nonjudgmental, don’t track your reading history and won’t try to sell you anything. And they don’t engage in censorship.
We should treat libraries with the same respect and support we give other essential services. They are as important in their way as the police, fire department, and utilities like water and sewer. A public library reminds us not just of who we are, but who we might become. Today’s billionaire philanthropists should take their cue from Carnegie.
Emma Christ, the librarian who got the ball rolling for the Carnegie library at Peabody, retired in 1919 to move to New York and live with her sister and brother. She had worked for the library for 31 years. She never missed a day of work, the Peabody Gazette reported.
“The library in Peabody is noted,” the Gazette said, “not alone for being one of the most artistic buildings, but for the manner in which Miss Christ conducted it.”
Thank you, Miss Christ.

Or how would your HR staff “dialogue” with you if the car’s mileage wasn’t properly logged, and you had apparently used it for personal trips, then left it sitting in a garage and when you did return it to the motor pool, it had $3,500 in damage?


This isn’t a hypothetical question.  These are actual cases of state employees, including former Chief of Staff to Gov. Ned Lamont, Jonathan Dach.
All of this comes to light in the latest detailed report from the Auditors of Public Accounts, a non-partisan, independent body appointed by the legislature. Their reports make for interesting reading, but little else: they have no enforcement powers or ability to penalize for wrong-doing.
Consider their report this past week on how the governor’s office is run:

Of the three cars assigned to the office, mileage logs were not kept.
The governor’s office inventory listed 92 laptop computers for their 30 employees.
Time sheets for staffers were approved by superiors who had no direct knowledge of the employees’ work hours.

In response to the audit, the Governor’s Office said they agreed with the findings and would try to do a better job.  End of story.
Some of these matters require mandatory referral to the Office of Ethics, but there seems to be little enforcement happening there, the case of Jonathan Dach being a good example.
You’ll remember that Dach was the Governor’s Chief of Staff, a $215,000 a year gig that was, as the Governor’s Office said, “a round-the-clock job.”  Dach apparently spent a lot of that time driving including 2,300 miles for personal trips visiting the beach, restaurants, brew pubs and even a Dave Mathews concert, according to the audit.
Electronic tracking in another state-owned Ford Escape showed that somebody — no one was ever publicly identified — once drove 113 mph on a trip from New London to Hartford.  That’s illegal, even for a staffer in the governor’s office.
What did Gov. Ned Lamont have to say about all this? 
“The people of Connecticut deserve transparency and accountability… we need to lead by example,” he said last June.  He added that he would seek reimbursement from Dach for personal use of the state car.  But there’s been no further word on what, if any anything happened since Dach left his job in June.
As for the computers, $7,423 worth of laptops “could not be located.”  But the governor’s staff added that as soon as a laptop is no longer under warranty, it’s replaced and the old model is given to interns for their use. Great.  Blame the kids.
Regarding the time sheets for the $3,746,724 annual payroll for the office’s couple dozen staffers, the audit says “limited resources” in the office meant they had not adopted a formal timesheet approval process.
In an era of tight finances, it’s discouraging to read that the executive branch of state government, which claims that it wants to lead by example, has failed in its oversight of equipment and staff.  It makes one wonder what’s happening in the other 88 agencies in our state, their 45,000+ employees and 3,300+ state vehicles.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-04 17:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Black women are driving a food revolution in rural Mississippi,"Aallyah Wright, Capital B",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/04/black-women-food-revolution-rural-mississippi/,"Black women are providing grocery options in rural Mississippi, where people face high rates of food insecurity and unemployment.","OAKLAND, Miss. — Grocery store owner Marquitrice Mangham hurries out of the sweltering August heat of the Mississippi Delta and enters her newly opened Farmacy Marketplace. 
She arrives about an hour before the doors open at 10 a.m.
It’s a quiet Friday in Oakland, Mississippi, except for the occasional screech of tires from semitrucks passing by on Highway 51. Oakland, fewer than 30 miles from her hometown of Webb, is home to about 400 residents, more than half of whom are Black. 
Inside the store, Mangham greets and praises her assistant manager, Kini Bradford-Jefferson. She emphasizes that without her, the store couldn’t operate. They laugh, ask each other how they are doing and tidy up the 3,000-square-foot space.
Until April, Oakland had been without a grocery store. 
In rural areas, particularly in the Delta, residents face some of the highest rates of food insecurity and unemployment in the state, resulting in poor health outcomes such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. These communities have high populations of Black people. They often struggle to attract grocery stores and are overwhelmed by a striking growth of dollar stores.

Around 14% of Americans — more than 47 million people — were food insecure at some point during 2023, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.
Mississippi had a food insecurity rate of 18%, higher than the national rate.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October 2025, saying the numbers had become “overly politicized.” The decision comes in the wake of federal funding cuts for food and nutrition safety net programs nationwide.
Getting consistent support from the government to fight hunger is often a struggle. For the second year in a row, the Mississippi Department of Health and Human Services opted out of a federal program that would’ve provided kids with $40 in grocery assistance in the summer months. Advocates worry this decision could increase hunger and health issues. Recent federal cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the elimination of grants geared to help farmers and improve food access compound the problem. 
Despite all these challenges, Black women like Mangham are stepping up. From grocery stores to food distribution services, they’re leading community-centered solutions to feed their families and improve the health and well-being of their neighbors.
Local grocer fills a crucial need 
Community leaders in Oakland requested a supermarket after learning of Mangham’s first store in Webb, which she opened in 2022. 
Oakland resident Bradford-Jefferson said there hadn’t been a place to shop for everyday necessities since she was a child. There’s only a library, food service plant, post office, bank and medical clinic. Like other residents, Bradford-Jefferson traveled to the nearest town to purchase food from stores such as Walmart or Piggly Wiggly. 
She used to drive regularly to her retail job in Batesville, a 40-mile round trip. Not only did she get a job closer to home, but she’s been able to cut back on expenses such as gas.
“I can walk here (to work) if I had to,” she said. 
The bell above the door chimed as the store doors swung open, welcoming the first customers of the day. They excitedly greeted Bradford-Jefferson before hugging Mangham.
It felt as if everyone knew everyone.

Bradford-Jefferson seamlessly transitioned from ringing up purchases on the cash register to prepping meat at the deli station for two men on their lunch break.
The 58-year-old understands that the store is needed for her town, as well other rural areas where food access is limited.
“You got to think of the elders, and some people don’t have vehicles and can’t afford to pay people to take them to other towns to shop,” she said. “It’s a good thing for this community and the surrounding communities.” 
Mangham grew up on a family farm in Webb, a majority-Black town of fewer than 500 people. They grew soybeans, corn, fruits and trees, and managed livestock (cows and hogs) on over 200 acres of land. 
Back then, they “lived off the land,” meaning most of the food they consumed, they grew themselves. Even if they wanted to visit a grocery store, they had to drive 20 to 30 miles. But, as a child, Mangham didn’t grasp the severity of the situation. 
The 48-year-old military veteran moved away after high school, eventually settling in Atlanta. In 2016, she inherited her family’s farm, which brought her back to Webb more frequently. She began paying closer attention to the food disparities. 
It was worse than when she left nearly 25 years ago. 
“My 89-year-old grandmother has to drive 15 to 20 miles just to get fresh food,” Mangham said. “She’s a diabetic and has this special diet.”
In 2023, Tallahatchie County, where Webb is located, 21% of people reported food insecurity in their household, higher than the state and national rates, with about 2,610 people who were food insecure.
Mangham’s nonprofit, In Her Shoes Inc., began in Atlanta and focuses on improving access to food and supporting farmers. But she recognized a greater need for these programs in the Delta. She conducted research, secured funding and successfully launched her first Farmacy Marketplace store.

She also teaches families how to prepare meals that cater to their specific health care needs and how to properly store fresh foods. The store also implemented the Double Up Food Bucks program, which encourages SNAP recipients to buy fresh fruits and vegetables. 
Inspired, other communities — like Oakland — have reached out for guidance.
“The most important thing was it showed so many other communities that this can be your community, too,” she said. 
Online delivery services for those without transportation
About 19 miles away in Drew, Gloria Dickerson is working to uplift her community “from poverty to prosperity,” the mission of her youth nonprofit. 
Providing residents with the resources to achieve food security is her North Star.
Despite growing up in poverty, Dickerson and her family knew how to put food on the table. Her parents, Mathew and Mae Bertha Carter, were sharecroppers who lived with their 13 children on a plantation near Drew. They grew a garden filled with fruits, vegetables and beans.
But that was snatched away when the children decided to do the unthinkable: integrate the “all white” Drew High School in 1965, becoming the first Black family to do so. Their house was shot at, credit in local stores was cut off, the garden was plowed up and they were evicted.
Mae Bertha was fortunate to have a friend in the civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, who lived less than 10 miles away. Hamer sent Charles McLaurin, her campaign manager and fellow activist, to check on the family, Dickerson recalled. This came with a wave of support from other civil rights workers who assisted the family with finding a home in Drew.
At the time, Main Street in downtown Drew had retail stores, grocery stores and even “nickel and dime stores,” Dickerson remembered.

More than 60 years later, the same street in the 77% Black town of 2,000 people is different. Today, there are not many businesses. There’s Stafford’s Deli and Dickerson’s nonprofit We2Gether Creating Change, which operates out of several buildings on the street. In the town, there’s no grocery store. It closed in 2012. There’s only one Dollar General, which has some frozen foods. In Sunflower County, where Drew is located, 22.8% of people reported food insecurity in their household in 2023.
Dickerson noticed that many children in her programs often came to class hungry. Although she provided food, it still wasn’t enough. Along with other organizers, she created a group called Drew United for Progress. During a community discussion, residents repeatedly expressed a need for a grocery store.
“(They said), ‘We can’t buy an apple. We can’t buy a banana. We can’t buy any vegetables,’” she said. “’We have to hire somebody to take us out of the community to pay them $10 to get there, pay them $10 to get back and that takes away from the money we have to put on food.’”
They then formed the Drew Collaborative, which included experts to research the feasibility of a store. The market analysis found the town was too small to support a grocer. Instead of pursuing a supermarket, the collaborative launched the Grocery Online Ordering Distribution Service (GOODS) in 2021. 
Residents of Drew, Ruleville, Parchman and Rome are able to place food orders online. The food is stored at the National Guard Armory for delivery or pickup. This initiative was initially funded by HOPE Credit Union in the Mississippi Delta. The nonprofit provides iPads and education on how to order food because of limited broadband and digital literacy concerns.
The program expanded to Shaw, about 27 miles from Drew. With the rising cost of food, more families need assistance. There are still some people who are left behind, said Chiquikta Fountain, former director of Delta Hands for Hope, which shepherds the program in Shaw.

“On a state level, we have a legislature that doesn’t value what it means for children and communities to be food secure,” she said. “They’re not working hard enough to make sure that people who make a living wage are able to buy food and not have to play Russian Roulette with what’s going to be a priority this month.” 
In Drew, Dickerson responded by hosting a monthly food pantry. 
This fall, We2Gether Creating Change will launch family gardens, where at least 10 families will have ownership of a plot of land. This project will teach them how to grow their own food, which they can use to feed their families or sell. Each family will also receive a $200 stipend to keep their garden up, and youth workers will get paid to help out in the summer.
Dickerson hopes to evolve this work into garden parties, cooking classes and more. Her biggest concern is that if food insecurity goes unchecked, it will affect the mental well-being of children and their ability to perform well in school.
Her call to action is for people to get involved, especially because the Delta was ground zero for the Civil Rights Movement, and everyone benefits from those sacrifices — from death and loss of jobs to political violence. 
“People need to remember where they really came from and who was on the battlefield, fighting for them to have what they have right now … it was the people that lived in these small communities putting their lives on the line,” Dickerson said. “Don’t forget us.”
Growing the next generation 
Back in Oakland, once business at Farmacy Marketplace is up and running, Mangham drives nearly 63 miles from the Oakland store to Mound Bayou to open her mobile grocery store around noon. 
A few days earlier, she made the 12-hour trek from her residence in Atlanta to Mississippi. It’s part of her weekly routine. She spends a few days in Atlanta and then heads to her beloved home state to manage not one, but two, grocery stores.
It’s a sacrifice she doesn’t mind making.  
Founded by formerly enslaved cousins, Mound Bayou is considered the “jewel of the Delta.” It is known as a self-reliant Black community that provided solace and refuge from  the threats of the Jim Crow South. During the trial of Emmett Till’s murderers, the town became home to his mother, Mamie Till Mobley, the Black press — including Simeon Booker with Jet Magazine — and witnesses.
Mangham’s mobile truck is parked on the site of the now-shuttered Taborian Hospital, which exclusively admitted Black patients and staff during a time when other health care facilities didn’t accept Black folks. It’s across the street from a gas station, and near the high school, which closed in 2018 and now houses the Mound Bayou Museum of African American History and Culture.
Every Friday, the truck is in Mound Bayou from noon to 4 p.m. It is also stationed in Jonestown on Tuesdays and Coffeeville on Fridays.
Thirty minutes after opening, residents trickled in, asking about watermelon and selecting from a variety of frozen meats, fruits and vegetables. On that day, James Edwards Jr., a retired vocational instructor, traveled from his home in Marks to help out with the mobile market. As his wife, Maudy Edwards, assisted customers, James sat in a chair under a shaded tree, greeting and conversing with residents.

Usually, he’s repairing or cleaning the mobile grocery truck. He makes sure it’s filled with gas and ensures the food is frozen and up to temperature. When he’s not on site helping with the mobile truck, he’s at the distribution center in Lambert or at the stores. 
“It’s been a pleasure to do this because we bring in food to what we call desert communities, where we don’t have the grocery store,” Edwards said. “My wife and I think this is a wonderful thing, and I know it’s gonna grow, but it’s like a young baby, it’s got to be nourished. You gotta be on milk before it grows so and it’s a blessing to Mississippi.”
In Her Shoes received a grant in 2023 to build a chicken processing facility, which will allow Black farmers to make more money by processing their products. The organization is set to break ground on the facility in October.
“Mississippi has a billion-dollar poultry industry, but … there are no private processing facilities for the smaller farmers to be able to get their poultry into local stores,” Mangham said. 
Mangham’s work provides not only a market for farmers to sell their produce and allow residents to purchase fresh foods, but also an avenue to get young people involved. She created an apprenticeship program that pairs students with farmers to learn how to grow produce.
In Bolivar County, where Mound Bayou is located, 24.4% of people reported food insecurity in their household in 2023. Addressing the issue takes more than opening two stores and providing a temporary mobile food truck, Mangham said. She’s looking at other avenues, like partnering with pharmacies to bring in a fresh food kiosk or refrigeration to store meats and vegetables. She’s also working to convert shipping containers into permanent corner grocery stores. 
This work can be overwhelming and exhausting, but Mangham continues because of the community’s support, she said.
“When I see the 75-year-old lady come in and buy all of her groceries, and she doesn’t have to drive … that’s the kind of thing that makes it all worth it,” she said with teary eyes.  
She added that her work has inspired others. “Nobody wants to invest in these rural communities. They don’t want to invest in the people. But just do what’s put on your heart to do, and the rewards will come.”

Community college? Tuition- and fee-free for everyone. 
Four-year public college? Tuition- and fee-free if you’re low-income. 
Books, supplies, cost of living costs? Covered, up to $2,400, by stipends for those who qualify. 
These promises were backed by transformative new programs, MassReconnect and MassGrant Plus Expansion in 2023, followed by MassEducate in 2024, all made possible by the Fair Share Amendment, a surtax on millionaires that voters overwhelmingly approved in 2022 to fund public education and transportation. The rollout was visible. The message resonated. For the first time in years, students and families began to believe in public higher education again. 
And it worked. 
After more than a decade of steep decline, community college enrollment had dropped by 40 percent, Massachusetts saw a remarkable turnaround: enrollment jumped 24 percent in just two years, with another double-digit increase expected this fall. Even four-year public universities, which had faced years of stagnation, began to see signs of recovery.  
Students heard the promise, and they responded. 
But what most of the public didn’t hear is that this promise is already being broken. 
Astonishingly, just one year after launching MassEducate, students are receiving less aid than they did last year. 
Despite doing exactly what they were designed to do — increase higher education enrollment —  these programs are facing quiet rollbacks. Stipends have been cut by up to $400. Completion grants and emergency aid, often the final financial aid dollars that help students persist and graduate, are being eliminated. The base MassGrant has been cut by $200 for the lowest-income students at four-year universities. 
At the Board of Higher Education meeting last week, this issue was discussed at length. William Heineman, president of North Shore Community College and member of the board, spoke up for those most affected by the cuts.  
“A last-minute shift in book awards for this academic year means that our students with the greatest financial need will see fewer dollars for books and supplies come spring, a change that will have a notable impact on students who are already trying their best to make ends meet,” he said. “This was not the intent of the Legislature in the structuring of the free community college program, and we urge you to support our students in ensuring this doesn’t become a reality next semester.” 
Others on the board voiced similar concerns, stressing that when programs succeed, the state’s responsibility is not to cut aid but to adjust budgets to keep its promise to students. 
To some, these may sound like small amounts. But for students already living on the edge, $200 or $400 can mean the difference between staying in school or dropping out. It might cover a monthly bus pass, groceries, or the last bit of rent. These cuts are not just technical, they are destabilizing. 
And it would be unrealistic to assume the rollback ends here. Without corrective action, stipends could disappear entirely, leaving only a bare-bones, last-dollar model that is, by design, regressive.  
The concern is particularly acute for the lowest-income students, many of whom were already eligible to attend college tuition-free through the federal Pell Grant before these state programs were launched. If stipends are withdrawn, those students gain no additional support from the state’s promise, while middle- and higher-income students continue to benefit from full tuition and fee coverage. 
Why is this happening?  
It is not the result of a recession or the loss of federal aid. Rather, the state did not adequately plan for the success of these programs.  
Despite knowing that the goal was to boost enrollment, and seeing that goal clearly achieved, the state level funded these initiatives in the fiscal year 2026 budget. As a result, a fixed pool of dollars is now being stretched across a larger number of students, reducing the support available to each. In practice, this has meant fewer resources for the students with the greatest financial need at the most under-resourced institutions. It did not have to unfold this way. 
The Fair Share Amendment raised over $3 billion this year. Some of that funding remains unspent. Just 1 percent of this year’s Fair Share revenue would have been enough to prevent these cuts. 
It’s not as if higher education had already received more than its fair share. In fiscal year 2026, only 11 percent of Fair Share revenue was allocated to higher education — well below the 25 percent minimum recommended by the Board of Higher Education, and nowhere near what’s needed to meet growing demand or address long-standing underinvestment. 
Massachusetts is in a moment of opportunity, even amid growing uncertainty at the federal level, to advance its progressive higher education priorities. Voters did their part. Students responded. The programs worked. The infrastructure is in place. And yet, the state is now pulling back. 
This is a choice, a short-sighted one that erodes public trust, harms low-income students, and jeopardizes the long-term prosperity of our state. 
But it is not too late. Before second-semester aid is disbursed, lawmakers should act to: 

Restore full stipends and grant aid for low-income students with unspent Fair Share revenues. 


Use Fair Share revenue as voters intended, allocating at least 25 percent of it for bold, new investments in higher education. 

Massachusetts has a chance to lead, to prove that when we say education matters, we mean it. That when we invest in students, we follow through.  
The Fair Share Amendment was supposed to be just the beginning. Let’s not allow it to become a broken promise.

Larry Rhoden speaks to the media on March 6, 2025, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Gov. Larry Rhoden has issued 65 pardons and one commutation since taking office in January, according to records on file with the South Dakota Secretary of State.
As of Sept. 29, Rhoden had also denied four pardon requests, and denied one request for a commutation.
A state board makes recommendations, but the South Dakota Constitution grants the governor sole authority to extend clemency to people convicted of crimes.
Noem commutes sentence of man who stabbed three, killed one 43 years ago

Pardons scrub all government documentation of a crime from a person’s public record. Commutations reduce sentences for inmates, often making them immediately eligible for parole and early release from prison.
In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, Rhoden said his legal team reviews the notes, video interviews with applicants and records for each pardon and commutation request carefully before he makes the call. He trusts his legal team, he said, but “for me, it boils down to just my personal feelings and beliefs about the goodness of humanity.”
“It’s just looking for signs that you feel like they deserve a second chance,” Rhoden said.
Kristi Noem, who preceded Rhoden in office and departed in January to become secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, issued a total of 348 pardons and 27 commutations during her six years in office. 
State law grants the governor the authority to let the state Board of Pardons and Paroles review and recommend pardons and commutations. The board meets and issues recommendations on a monthly basis, in each case after hearing directly from the person requesting clemency and sometimes also from the person’s victims or the prosecutors involved in the case.
Rhoden’s approach, decisions
Noem would sometimes wait months between signing each batch of clemency orders. Rhoden signed his clemency orders at least once a month during the first half of 2025, but hasn’t issued any since July. His first dozen pardons were signed on March 3.
Power of mercy: Noem decisions highlight outsized importance of pardons in South Dakota

Parole board rules say a person must be at least five years removed from the date of their sentencing to request a pardon. 
Pardons are filed and held as a public record at the Secretary of State’s Office for five years after being signed and are sealed thereafter. Commutations, also held by the Secretary of State’s Office, are not closed after five years and do not shield any record of a conviction or the circumstances surrounding it from public disclosure.
Noem’s pardons typically went to people with lower-level crimes like drunken driving, drug possession or property crimes. She occasionally forgave more serious crimes, such as third-degree rape or assault, often decades after the incidents. 
The same pattern has held true for Rhoden in the 65 pardons issued thus far. Few of the crimes pardoned were felonies against other people. One man was pardoned for two charges of attempted sexual contact with a child under 16, for which he was convicted in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Another was pardoned for a robbery and an attempted robbery, both of which took place 41 years ago.
Commutation granted
Rhoden’s sole commutation thus far went to Jack Sidney Hagen, a 64-year-old initially given three consecutive life sentences for a 1995 break-in and kidnapping in Black Hawk. 
At his commutation hearing last year, Hagen told the parole board he’d been foolish and quick to anger, having spent years in the drug trade.
Using a handgun, Hagen threatened a couple whose home he broke into with two other people. He thought the couple had stolen methamphetamine from him. The crime went unreported for more than a year, but the incident came to light when some of the victims were indicted on federal drug charges.
Noem grants early release to 12 convicted of felonies for drug use

The parole board recommended a commutation for Hagen during Noem’s first term in office, but she denied his request.
At his second commutation hearing, in September 2024, Hagen said he’d worked hard to change his life during his nearly three decades in prison.
“Something was not right with my thinking and my drug usage,” Hagen said. “I became a Christian. I’ve been heavily involved in church since I’ve been in, I’ve worked hard, kept my mind busy and tried to change, to not act like the person I used to be.”
He worked more than two decades for market wages at Metal Craft Industries, a shop operated in the South Dakota State Penitentiary’s Jameson Annex by a private company until 2024. 
After moving to Springfield’s Mike Durfee State Prison, Hagen said, he used money he’d saved to invest in the stock market with the help of friends and family on the outside. 
The board recommended that Hagen’s three life sentences be commuted to 60-year sentences. That would’ve made him eligible for parole at the board’s discretion next summer, and a release date of 2027 without their approval, based on credits earned for good behavior.
Rhoden granted the commutation, but did not follow the board’s advice to the letter. His order changed two of Hagen’s life sentences to 153-year sentences, and another to a 114-year sentence. Hagen is still eligible for release by the parole board in June, but wouldn’t be able to walk free without their approval until 2075.
Commutation denial
The most serious crime on Rhoden’s list of five denied clemency requests is the conviction of Dawn Frazer. She was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life for participating in the killing of Morningstar Shalimar Standing Bear in 1999 in Sturgis. 
During her second commutation hearing, which took place in October 2024, a handful of parole board members expressed concerns, ranging from her downplaying her role in the incident to the crime’s severity.
The board also agreed, though, that she was “a changed woman” who’d become a mentor to others at the South Dakota women’s prison. They voted for a commutation that would have made the 57-year-old parole eligible when she turns 70. 
Rhoden denied Frazier’s commutation request in a letter dated June 12.
Rhoden did not comment on any individual cases in his interview on clemency with South Dakota Searchlight. When asked more broadly about his denials, he said the time between an incident and the request has been the primary factor. 
Rhoden said he wants to see that enough time has elapsed that “they truly are rehabilitated.”

Lucrative, but not fully staffed
Glacier and Yellowstone national parks bring in a lot of money to local communities, but they aren’t staffed up with the federal shutdown. Read Friday’s story about how the shutdown affects the parks in Montana.


National Park Service sites contributed to about 9,293 jobs in Montana, about $408 million in labor income, added $675 million in value to the state’s economy, and contributed about $1.2 billion in economic output, according to the report. 
In 2024, about 8.9 million visits were logged among Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Big Hole National Battlefield, Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site, Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, and Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument. The vast majority of those visits were to Glacier (3.2 million visitors) and Yellowstone (4.7 million visitors).
Glacier National Park supported about 5,188 jobs and generated about $217 million in labor income and $656 million in economic outputs for surrounding towns, cities and counties.
“The communities around Glacier are our partners in providing visitors with information that helps them enjoy the park safely and responsibly — so that we may all continue to experience the wonder of this wild and scenic landscape for generations to come. The park contributes back to Western Montana through visitor spending that supports jobs and creates revenue. We’re grateful to work with community partners on a sustainable future for our parks and communities,” said Glacier National Park Superintendent Dave Roemer in a statement on Monday. 
Yellowstone National Park, which contributes to local economies in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, saw visitors spend about $709 million in nearby communities last year, supporting about 6,500 jobs locally and $322 million in labor income. The Park Service said those visitors generated about $903 million in total economic output for nearby communities.
In October, Yellowstone National Park receives around 6% of its annual visitors, which translates to roughly $42 million in spending in gateway communities, a number that could take a hit in 2025 if the federal shutdown continues for multiple weeks.
But the other National Park Service sites in Montana also brought in almost half a million visitors last year as well, along with hundreds of jobs and millions in economic output.
Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument saw 111,000 visitors last year who spent about $9 million in the region, supporting 91 jobs and generating $10.5 million in economic output, according to the report. The Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, also in southeast Montana, saw 219,000 visitors who spent an estimated $11.5 million in the region and supported 121 jobs.
In western Montana, the Big Hole National Battlefield and Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site brought in a combined 72,000 visitors who spent about $4.5 million in the region and supported about 47 jobs, according to the National Park Service.
Nationally, NPS visitors spent an estimated $29 billion in local gateway communities, primarily through lodging ($11 billion) and restaurants ($5.7 billion).",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/53170933307_566cecb540_k-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-04 11:59:36.925762

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens (3-2, 1-1 CUSA) can’t overcome second half mistakes, loses its first CUSA game of the season to the Hilltoppers (5-1, 3-0 CUSA)
NEWARK — When Fightin’ Blue Hens quarterback Nick Minicucci received the snap on third down trailing by three in the fourth quarter, all the action on the play turned to the left. The lineman, the wide receivers and Minicucci himself moved left trying to distract from running back Jo Silver running toward the right sideline out of the flat. Minicucci spun to his right and scrambled a bit before delivering a spiraling pass to his senior running back. 
Silver caught the pass and hustled up the right sideline stretching the ball as far out in front of him as possible as he fell out of bounds. As Silver touched the white line, the crowd of over 19,000 erupted thinking Silver did just enough to keep UD’s drive going. But the crowd was severely disappointed.
Silver’s effort fell a yard short and on fourth and a yard to go the Blue Hens failed to convert on a pitch to the running back. Western Kentucky’s defensive stand provided just enough momentum to defeat the Blue Hens, 27-24, in UD’s first home Conference USA game in program history.
Silver’s third down catch and run was the catalyst for conversation throughout the final minutes of the game and into the postgame. Following Silver’s stretch, head coach Ryan Carty said he saw the chains move signaling to him it was a first down. The referees instead signaled that Silver was short and the confusion on the spot of the ball and the continuation of the play clock led Carty into having to use his first timeout. 
“I thought the spot was close to being wrong and then the chains moved, which is what really tricked me, because I didn’t know what the down and distance was,” Carty said postgame. “And then the play clock was down to 12 [seconds] and the ball was spotted, and I didn’t know if they were reviewing it, or if it was a first down, or if it was a fourth and one or a fourth and two or a fourth and three. And so that’s where the communication was just a little bit tricky and not very great.”
Despite the hectic end to the drive, it wasn’t UD’s final chance at forcing overtime or winning the game. 
The Fightin’ Blue Hens defense forced Western Kentucky into a three and out on the subsequent drive and delivered the ball to their offense with just under a minute to go. UD drove the ball all the way from its own five yard line to the Hilltoppers’ 25 providing kicker Nate Reed a chance to tie the game with a 43-yard field goal. Reed’s attempt flew just right of the post as the clock hit zero.
“We made the last one and made another one today and didn’t make that one. That’s the tough part about being a kicker,” Carty said. “You’re going to have that pressure on you and we’ve got to, obviously, put ourselves in a better position overall.”   
Although there are no morale victories, UD played well against one of CUSA’s toughest competitors. 
The Hilltoppers entered the game with the conference’s highest scoring offense and the UD defense held them slightly below their 35 point per game average. Western Kentucky amassed 338 yards of total offense and threw for its second lowest total of the season (230 yards).
Part of the reason for the Hilltoppers lack of offense was their lack of possession in the first half. The Blue Hens held the ball for over 16 minutes sustaining two drives of over six minutes that ended with points, including the first of three rushing touchdowns for Minicucci on the game’s opening drive.
Minicucci was responsible for all of UD’s touchdowns as well as both UD turnovers. 
The turnovers occurred on back to back drives in the third quarter with the Blue Hens’ holding on to a four point advantage. The first was an interception on third down where Minicucci fired a pass that was tipped at the line of scrimmage. The play slowed the ball just enough for Western Kentucky linebacker Koron Hayward to leap in the air and intercept it, running it 25-yards for a pick six. The next drive — now trailing by three — Minicucci led the Blue Hens to the edge of the endzone, but fumbled at the two yard line.
“I feel like I dealt with a lot of adversity today and I take full accountability for that loss,” Minicucci said postgame as coach Carty shook his head not wanting his quarterback to shoulder the loss himself. “I think that’s all on me and that’s who I am. I’m gonna take full accountability and I’m gonna get better from it.”
UD’s offense finished the game with 435 yards of total offense earning the majority of them through the air. Minicucci finished the game with 314 passing yards and completions to 11 different pass catchers. Wide receiver Jake Thaw was among the 11 receivers returning to the field after missing the prior two games.
The Fightin’ Blue Hens will have over a week to learn from this loss before traveling to Alabama on Wednesday, October 15, for a matchup against Jacksonville State.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2638-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-04 11:59:36.925762

Nearly 500 more students were in attendance on Count Day in the Detroit school district this year compared to last, according to early data.
The numbers are crucial for determining how much state funding the Detroit Public Schools Community District will receive. The early data suggest that the district’s efforts to ramp up enrollment and reduce chronic absenteeism have paid off with incremental gains.
On Wednesday, 45,388 students attended school in the district compared to 44,893 last school year, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told Chalkbeat.
The numbers are preliminary, as districts are able to add some students who attend school within a certain period after Count Day.
Monique Bryant, a school board member, told Chalkbeat the increase in Count Day attendance this year is a move in the “right direction.”
Bryant said she and Vice Chair LaTrice McClendon made an effort this year to ensure parents’ questions about the enrollment process were answered and that logistical issues were resolved promptly by staff members. The two board members answered calls and emails themselves and worked with Vitti and administrative staff to make sure each concern was addressed.
“This is a direct reflection of the work we have done,” Bryant said of the numbers.
Michigan public school districts tally the number of students in attendance on two days each year. The count helps the state determine the amount of per-pupil funding districts will receive the following fiscal year. Count Days are held on the first Wednesday of October and the first Wednesday of February.
The foundation allowance of per-pupil funding will be $10,050 per student this school year, according to a state budget approved Friday morning that still awaits Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s signature.
Michigan districts that serve higher rates of students from low-income families, such as the Detroit district, have received more weighted funding from the state to support children with higher needs since 2023. This school year, the Michigan legislature approved a 25% increase in at-risk funding compared to the last.
In the last 20 years, DPSCD has lost more than 92,000 students. Many factors played a role in the drop, such as population declines in the city, lower birth rates, the state’s emergency management of the district, and the pandemic.
Enrollment declines over the years have led to underutilization of many school buildings. A recent district report found the high per-pupil cost for operating19 small schools is creating funding challenges.
In June, the district outlined potential solutions that included merging schools and phasing out the use of some buildings.
Increasing enrollment has been a top priority of the district for years. This summer, it spent more dollars to market to prospective families, send people to canvas communities, and nearly doubled the number of community events hosted at neighborhood schools.
Bryant and McClendon pushed the district to improve its marketing and have asked Vitti for reports to determine what’s working.
In recent years, DPSCD has focused on retaining students. Vitti said at a board meeting in August the school system has “done a fairly good job” in attracting new students, adding that the main challenge is keeping them.
Bryant said she and other members of the board will continue to regularly assess enrollment and attendance data to refine the methods the district is using to attract and keep students.
“One of the things I think has been a detriment to the district is that we have not told our story,” said Bryant. “We have far more academic programs, resources, and wraparound services compared to our competitors. Too much of that is not being shared broadly enough for parents.”
The board member said moving forward, she will push for changes that will better serve the district’s population of students who have to move to new neighborhoods frequently due to economic and housing constraints.
“We have to make sure students know all the resources they have in one school will follow them to the next,” she said.
The full impact of the district’s recruitment and retention efforts won’t be known until the end of the school year, officials say.
