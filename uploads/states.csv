(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)West Tennessee soybean farmers already on the heels of a tough year are now facing challenges posed by the remnants of early April floods.
Gina Ward’s low-lying fields near Rives and the Obion River flooded in February, requiring the third-generation farm to make costly repairs to the private levee attached to their land.
Just a few weeks later, the majority of the levee was once again washed away in a near-record-setting flood after rain drenched Northwest Tennessee and surrounding areas.
The 96-hour rain event was the second-highest for the Obion, Forked Deer and Loosahatchie Rivers, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
When the water finally began to recede from Ward’s drowned fields about 10 days later, it left craters and debris. 
“It looks like the surface of the moon now,” she said.
Soybeans cover more acres than any other row crop in Tennessee, according to the University of Tennessee. The crop is most popular in the state’s west and central regions.
April typically marks the beginning of the planting season. Ward had not yet planted her fields when the storms began on April 3, but she wants to get seeds in the ground as soon as possible to maximize her yield. 
She has started planting in fields on higher ground. But the sandy moonscape left behind by the flood in lower-lying areas will take a lot of time and work before it’s ready to be planted again, Ward said.

Stefan Maupin, executive director of the Tennessee Soybean Production Council, said most of the flooded land was not planted. 
“The farmers who farm that low-lying ground know that it’s best to wait as long as possible to get outside of flooding season before they start planting that ground,” he said.
But the flooding has pushed back their planting dates, which could lead to lower yields.
“Conventional wisdom in any farming is to get your crop in early, and that’s going to be a little difficult to do on hundreds of thousands of acres in these flood plains, because the water is going to have to go down, and the fields will have to dry,” Maupin said.
Field maintenance could also prove expensive and time-consuming for farmers whose fields were left littered with debris, covered in sediment or rutted by receding flood water.
These delays and extra expenses compound the losses soybean farmers saw in 2024.
Soybean prices paid to Tennessee producers dropped 16% in 2024 compared to 2023, despite farmers planting around 15% more acreage, according to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture. 
Like any other business, a farmer’s goal is to make a return on their investment, and planting requires significant capital up front, Maupin said. Profit margins are thin due to high interest rates and inflated costs for things like fuel, fertilizer, and pesticides. 
“Last year they had no profit in corn, wheat, soybeans and cotton, and they lost a lot of money,” he said. “This year, the prices and the input costs are not any better, so they needed to be able to reduce their costs as much as possible. For those who farm in these flooded areas, it is only going to drive up their costs to put a crop there.”

(Getty Images)In the relentless grip of the opioid epidemic, a surge of tragedies has changed our communities, destroyed families and taken lives.
Since 2000, the United States has seen a dramatic rise in drug overdose-related deaths, including prescription opioids. According to data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, drug-involved overdoses have doubled since 2015, with approximately 107,000 people dying from a drug-involved overdose. 
Need to get rid of old prescriptions? East Idaho drop off sites open April 26.

Opioid-related deaths aren’t just in the streets of Stockton or the alleyways of Portland, but rather, opioid death touches the lives of everyone in our community. 
These numbers are rising as the opioid epidemic continues to affect communities across the country — and Idaho is not immune. According to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, in 2022, there were 270 opioid-related deaths across the state and 755 emergency room visits relating to an opioid overdose emergency.
Opioids are often referred to as narcotics and are medications that doctors prescribe to alleviate pain. There are many types of prescribed opioids, such as codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, oxymorphone and morphine. 
They are used by people of all ages and walks of life for those suffering from ailments, recovering from an injury or surgery, and needing relief from pain. As we have seen the opioid epidemic sweep across the country, we know opioids can be highly addictive and highly devastating. 
When opioids are used to manage pain for long periods, the risk of addiction rises. A prolonged period of taking opioids puts a person at risk of relying on the drug for survival. This problem is more common than it seems, with opioid overdoses taking the lives of 90 people by accident daily, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
Idaho’s youth is no exception to this epidemic. According to the Idaho Healthy Youth Survey, most Idaho students do not misuse prescription drugs. However, of those that do, 72.8% of them said they misuse pain relievers, 30.7% misuse depressants and 30.7% misuse stimulants. Additionally, students who misuse prescription drugs say they do so within their own homes. 
Blue Cross of Idaho and the Meridian Anti-Drug Coalition are proud to partner for the sixth time to host Prescription Drug Take-Back Day. Since 2018, our annual partnership has safely disposed of approximately 1.9 tons of unwanted medication. 
On April 27, 2024, bring all your old, expired, and unwanted medications to Blue Cross of Idaho’s headquarters in Meridian to safely dispose of these substances. Our event is an opportunity to clean out that medicine cabinet and see what is expired and should be disposed of before possibly getting into the wrong hands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration noted that take-back programs are the best way to dispose of unused or expired prescriptions and over-the-counter medicines safely. 
Opioid addiction and abuse know no bounds to who it affects; addiction does not discriminate, affecting all ages and backgrounds. It is a disease that affects families, friends, neighbors, and people we love, and maybe has affected us personally.
Join us in making a positive and long-lasting effect on our community and potentially saving a life by turning in your household prescription medications. 
Our take-back site is open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. April 27 and in Blue Cross of Idaho’s parking lot. We hope to see you there.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those (attempts) are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.

Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Recently, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states, including Colorado, adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) Anyone with concerns about handling the manure from 25,000 cows or other issues associated with what could become North Dakota’s largest dairy are now able to submit comments to the state. 
The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality opened a comment period Friday on the proposed Traill County facility to be operated by Minnesota-based Riverview Dairy. 
The DEQ comment period runs through June 2 and includes a public hearing May 20 from 5-8 p.m. at the Hillsboro High School gym. Comments can be submitted through the DEQ website at deq.nd.gov/PublicNotice.aspx.
Riverview refers to the 25,000-cow project as Herberg Dairy, named for the township along the Red River and North Dakota Highway 200 southeast of Hillsboro where the dairy is planned. 
Riverview already has a state environmental permit for its planned 12,500-cow dairy in Abercrombie Township north of Wahpeton in Richland County. The Dakota Resource Council is challenging that permit in court.

Marty Haroldson, permits program manager of the Division of Water Quality within the Department of Environmental Quality, and other staff members from the agency were in Hillsboro earlier this month as Riverview held an open house to answer questions from the public. 
Haroldson said the plan for the Herberg Dairy is similar to Abercrombie, just on a larger scale. 
“So as far as the technology, that’s all the same, it’s just scaled up,” Haroldson said. “Manure storage ponds are going to have a larger footprint, the barns are going to be a little bit bigger, a few more people working there.” 
Haroldson said even after an environmental permit is issued, some aspects of the plan, such as manure management, can change, such as which farmers want to use Riverview’s manure as fertilizer or on which fields. 
The plan “can be a living document,” Haroldson said, but Riverview would need to document the changes. 
Water sources, processing
Two large questions are not addressed in the environmental plans for the dairy: Where will the water come from? Where will the milk go? 
Large dairy farms like the ones proposed by Minnesota-based Riverview Dairy require huge quantities of water — 20 to 30 gallons of water per cow per day. 
That would equal at least 700,000 gallons of water per day for the Traill County site and 350,000 gallons per day for the Richland County site.
The huge water need coupled with manure output from such a large dairy has some residents in Richland County concerned about the effect on aquifers and the water supply for residents. 
Huge dairy farms planned for eastern North Dakota

Brady Janzen, who works on site development for Riverview Dairy, said during a recent open house on the Traill County project that the company’s dairies use a combination of collected water, such as gathering rain water that runs off barn roofs, surface water and ground water. 
Riverview has a permit request under review with the North Dakota Department of Water Resources for the Richland County site northwest of Wahpeton for using surface water pulled from the Red River.  
A comment period has already been held on that permit. Another comment period will open when the department announces its intent to approve or deny the permit. 
Riverview is working with the East Central Rural Water District that serves Traill and Grand Forks counties for the site southeast of Hillsboro.  Riverview has not yet applied for a water permit for that site. 
The two dairies will use a lot of water and produce a lot of milk that would need to be processed.  The Traill dairy would fill 22 tanker loads of milk – more than 170,000 gallons per day. The Richland site would produce about half that.
“We won’t begin building until we have a processor who has a need for that milk,” Janzen said. 
Riverview already has several large dairies in western Minnesota but does not own its own creamery.
Janzen said Riverview has “kicked the tires” on building a processing plant.

Dairy farmers in the Bismarck-Mandan area, the traditional heart of North Dakota’s dairy industry, have been hurt by the closure of a creamery close to home. 
A bill in the North Dakota Legislature aims to provide some financial incentives for dairy processing. 
Amber Wood of the North Dakota Livestock Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes animal agriculture, is confident that the large dairies will mean more processing in the area.
“With dairy, it’s not the chicken or the egg, it’s the chicken and the egg,” Wood said. “You have to have processing to get cows and cows to get processing.” 
Raising concerns
While Wood is optimistic about dairy in the Red River Valley, others have concerns.

The same evening as Riverview’s Hillsboro open house, the Dakota Resource Council hosted a meeting in Fargo to raise awareness of the Abercrombie Dairy, which would be near the Red River, the drinking water source for Fargo residents.
“So why should you care? Because you’re 35 miles away,” said Madeline Luke, a volunteer with Dakota Resource Council whose main interest is in water protection, told the group. 
Luke said by the time the public became aware of the Abercrombie Dairy, there was little time to review the permit application within the comment period. She cited concerns such as the number of fields where the manure will be applied that have drainage tile installed. 
Luke was already reviewing the Herberg application on Friday.

Erik Olson has become a spokesperson for Abercrombie-area residents opposed to the dairy and addressed the Fargo meeting. The town of Abercrombie is less than four miles from the proposed dairy. 
“Riverview was well into the process of planning and developing for years before the public was made aware,” Olson said. “We have minimal time to learn and educate ourselves on the effects that this megadairy would be having.
“To say that we were shocked is an understatement.” 
The Dakota Resource Council has argued that one reason to throw out the permit is that there was no public hearing. 
Riverview has filed a motion to dismiss the Dakota Resource Council lawsuit. A ruling on that motion is pending with a Burleigh County court.

And a resounding 77% of respondents strongly agreed that focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace is a “good thing.” 
The findings are part of a data-driven effort by the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce to spotlight gaps in meeting expectations of college-educated and high skilled professionals so that employers and policymakers can reverse the “brain drain” trend that has troubled the state.
 ‘Starting point’

About 700 people chose to respond to the questionnaire, which was marketed and made publicly available in the eight-county area served by the chamber. The bulk of those who participated, 86%, had at least a bachelor’s degree. Nearly 75% were white.
Done in partnership with the University of Nebraska at Omaha-based Center for Public Affairs Research, the survey was conducted in 2024 and results were presented to chamber leaders in January. But the findings are now starting to be more widely discussed. 
On Monday, UNO researchers will explain highlights to a gathering at the chamber that is expected to draw young professionals, business and other leaders.
“The more we know about what talent is seeking and wanting, the more we can key in and help elevate what is going on already — or help support improvements,” said Merrick Brtek, director of the chamber’s Young Professionals & Talent Development Programs. “Is it going to fix everything? No. But it is a starting point for us to move forward with that feedback.”
For example, she said, the chamber runs a program introducing newcomers and others to area resources, including information on Omaha’s rapid bus transit system and how to get a daily Heartland Bike Share pass. About 73% of respondents said they were somewhat or extremely dissatisfied with transit options within the region.

The chamber thinks the modern-day streetcar, which has been controversial, will help and be welcomed by young professionals once its downtown-to-midtown Omaha route opens, Brtek said.
Other transit-related concerns also stood out, however. For example, 56% of respondents were somewhat or extremely dissatisfied with available transit options (such as bus, train or plane) from the Omaha area to other regions like Denver, Chicago, Kansas City or Lincoln.
When it came to walk and bike friendly commutes, only 35% who participated marked extremely or somewhat satisfied.
Brtek said she was pleased to see that the bulk of participants gave a high rating to overall quality of life. About 88% said they were somewhat or extremely satisfied. 
About 69% said the same about overall cost of living, though 60% said they were dissatisfied with the cost of taxes, such as sales, income and property.
 Hybrid over remote work

Among the more surprising nuggets to Brtek was the preference that respondents had for a hybrid but primarily in-person work environment, versus more remote.
“It’s exciting that people want that community aspect — to come together, connect and collaborate,” she said.
When asked to choose which work environment was most appealing, 32% marked the hybrid but primarily in-person choice; 28% marked hybrid but equally split between in-person and remote; 19% said hybrid, primarily remote; 11% said fully in person and 10% said fully remote.

Josie Schafer, head of the UNO research team that worked on the survey, said the survey dovetails with another done in 2019 that tracked down and asked questions of high-skilled professionals who had already left the area. In that study, 78% said that they fled for professional growth and development.
It’s not that jobs weren’t available locally, said Schafer, but “density” was lacking. Participants in the earlier survey felt there was not enough upward movement in companies where top management already was set as part of a family or established network.
This latest survey, on the other hand, was focused on young professionals who currently live and work in the area.
Schafer said only about 12% said they were not satisfied with their job overall. The lowest rated workplace factor was pay, followed by opportunity for advancement at work, she said. 
“Inflation has gone up faster than wages in the Omaha area, people are feeling wage pressure, so pay is a real issue for folks,” Schafer said.
When asked which job benefits were most important, a top answer besides salary was paid time off for sickness and  vacations. 
Most respondents said they weren’t likely to try to leave their current job in the next year. But when asked if they did choose to leave, about half said they’d probably leave Nebraska completely.
Top destination states mentioned were Colorado, Illinois, California, and Texas.
‘Quality of life’
“That is concerning,” Schafer said of brain-drain, or high-skilled people with a college education exiting Husker territory for other states. She said that domestic out-migration has been a “persistent issue for at least 15 years.”

Housing opportunities also stood out as a weakness, she said. About 53% of participants said they were either extremely or somewhat dissatisfied with rental or for-sale housing that meets their size and quality needs.
Among community-centric areas of the greater Omaha area that got the highest “extremely satisfied” marks: entertainment, restaurants and bars (41%); health care services (39%): quality of educational institutions (35%) and overall quality of life (31%).
Schafer will be sharing and discussing specifics of the survey findings at the Monday gathering.
“I don’t know that we’re taking enough steps to actually create the job opportunities that keep people here or the culture of organizations that keep people here,” she said, “Or the quality of life that makes people say, ‘It is worth the difference in pay to stay here.'”



 In their own words 

Among comments survey participants took the time to write:

“City council meetings are poorly placed. I would love to get involved but Tuesday at 2 p.m. assures the city only hears business owners, retired folks and those with a flexible schedule to attend. Given the perspective of politics these days, I believe this is by design to keep common folks from participation.”
“The divide on access to services/programs and basic needs is widening. Middle income is increasingly strained and state Legislature is focused on relief for highest and lowest income earners.”
“I like the flexibility. I don’t like that most of the work is remote. It makes it hard to communicate with coworkers and get to know them.”
“When I started in 2021, the benefits system wouldn’t let me register for benefits because it said my same sex marriage wasn’t valid. Management and up regularly misgender me (I use they/them pronouns). The person who has committed the most microaggressions and discriminatory actions is our only HR person.”
“The culture of fun and employee engagement never recovered from COVID.”
“We have got to increase wages; set rental price caps; develop, enact and implement renter protections; stop with all the bars, create spaces where families are welcome but not specifically children spaces; create real public transit and incentivize environmentally conscious transportation options, repair the roads meaningfully so our cars don ‘t get eaten by potholes and we have to pay to repair our cars more frequently; do actual policy work that is going to get people to have a POSITIVE identity with Omaha.”

House Republicans want to change who has the power to appoint the state’s superintendent of public instruction — potentially stripping the State Board of Education of one of its key functions — because they say Michigan’s education system is failing.
A House joint resolution seeks to alter the state’s constitution to give the governor control over the appointment, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The proposal comes as the state’s current superintendent is set to retire in the fall and, if it passed, would go into effect after Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s term ends.
The State Board of Education currently has the sole hiring and firing power for the position. The elected body has held that authority since 1963.
The resolution is tied to a bill that would require state board seats to be elected from geographic districts. Board seats are currently at-large, meaning whichever candidate wins the most votes wins the election, no matter where they live.
Democrats have controlled the board for much of the last two decades.
The Republican members of the House education committee voted to move the proposals forward to a vote in the full legislative body.
In order to become law, the resolution would have to be approved by two-thirds of the Republican-controlled House and the Democratically controlled Senate. It would then go before voters in the November 2026 election. If passed into law by a majority of voters, the new regulations would go into effect after Jan. 1, 2027.
Under the proposal, the state superintendent would serve a term of up to four years, as determined by the governor.
The current law allows state superintendents to remain in their positions either until they resign or are removed by the state board.
Current State Superintendent Michael Rice has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats — including Whitmer — for the lagging academic performance of schools in the state. He will leave his position Oct. 3, and the state board has already begun its search for his successor.
“Clearly, what we are doing is not working,” said state Rep. Bill Schuette, a Republican from Gladwin County, citing the state’s results on recent state and national assessments during a recent House Education and Workforce Committee hearing.
“You look across the country, we are one of the only states that has a so-called independent head of its education department, and I believe that this, in practice, has removed an important element of accountability from our state’s public education system,” Schuette added.
Rep. Regina Weiss, a Democrat from Oak Park, said during the hearing there are concerns the position could become more partisan if the change is made because the State Board of Education’s staggered eight-year terms offer more consistency.
Schuette argued that because governors are elected every four years, there would be more accountability to constituents.
“If you have a governor who wants to implement reforms or changes, and that person has a mandate directly from the people and the governor, I think that it is a better way to execute that accountability,” he said.
Schutte said he is also in favor of eliminating the state board entirely, though there are no formal proposals to do so yet.
The state board’s power has been reduced significantly over the years, particularly under the initiatives of former Gov. John Engler, a Republican who transferred a number of the board’s responsibilities to the state superintendent.
Currently, the board’s role is to establish academic standards, as well as make policy recommendations to local districts and lawmakers. It does not have the power to pass laws or to control school funding.
This month, the state board unanimously passed a resolution to oppose the proposal to strip it of its power to appoint the state superintendent.
The members agreed the potential for state education policy to change frequently due to “short-term, flashy” initiatives of new governors would cause “confusion and frustration” among school leaders.
Tom McMillin, a Republican member of the state board, said during the meeting that he’s long opposed previous efforts to shift the power of appointing the state superintendent to the governor.
“The architects of Michigan’s 1963 constitution were wise to recognize that giving too much power to the governor would be harmful and that providing authority and oversight of education to a separately elected board would be beneficial to Michigan’s children,” McMillin said in a statement. “This separation of power should remain.”

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle | Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.











The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology



Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)When examining the state of national politics and the federal government, there’s much to be concerned about, including President Donald Trump’s enthusiasm for deporting people legally in the country — and possibly, in the near future, U.S. citizens.
Concerned about freedom of the press? You might find it hard not to be if you note the Trump administration tried to ban the Associated Press — the gold standard for professional and fair journalism — from press conferences and has inserted right- wing bloggers in order to get favorable coverage.
It’s easy to get caught up in the doom spiral of national news, but Tennesseans would be better served, if no less sane, by turning from the scary and shiny objects in Washington, D.C., and back towards home, where members of the Tennessee General Assembly eagerly pursue a similarly anti-democratic agenda. 
Monitoring the actions of state lawmakers won’t make you feel less frustrated, but you have greater access to state representatives and senators near you to voice your concerns. 
Anti-immigration measures take priority
Gov. Bill Lee called a special legislative session in January presumably to push his universal school voucher program, but many political observers were surprised when Lee also added to his agenda three other items — in itself unusual, as special sessions are customarily devoted to one topic.
While vouchers remained a priority, almost as much attention was given to what Lee termed his “illegal immigration agenda.”

The legislature created a state immigration agency that would be exempt from public records law, a measure allowing public officials to be prosecuted if they vote for sanctuary city policies — which is unconstitutional, to say nothing of fact sanctuary cities have been illegal in Tennessee since 2018 — and requires immigrants in the state without permanent legal status to have driver’s licenses that mark them as such. 
“The Nazi Germans did this to the Jews,” said Democratic Sen. Charlane Oliver of Nashville, referring to the Star of David sewn into clothing.
Did Republican lawmakers go far enough to make immigrants feel harassed and unwelcome? Apparently not.
As soon as the special session ended and the regular one got into full swing, Republican lawmakers began filing anti-immigrant bills right and left, including: 

Senate Bill 227/House Bill 11: Sponsored by Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis and Rep. Rusty Grills of Newbern, the bill would hold churches and charitable organizations liable for providing housing aid to immigrants without legal status — who then go on to commit a crime. It has passed both chambers and is set to become law. 
Senate bill 836/House Bill 793 : Sen. Bo Watson, a Chattanooga Republican, is carrying a piece of legislation that would require public schools to verify the immigration status of Tennessee’s nearly 1 million students and would give schools the option of charging students without permanent legal status tuition or denying them an education. The House version, sponsored by Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland, hit snags and may not pass. 
Senate Bill 1087 /House Bill 0177: A bill making it a crime for immigrants without legal status to remain in the state for more than 72 hours stalled out in the Senate and was deferred until 2026. Senate sponsor Jack Johnson of Franklin acknowledged the measure is unconstitutional — although that has rarely stopped lawmakers with a bee in their collective bonnet. 

Media matters
The year has been marked by fewer large-scale protests in the Capitol than the two years prior, but plenty of small protests — there have been more disruptions in committee meetings than Comcast has during spring storms — and on several occasions, women protesting against anti-immigration measures have been carried out by Tennessee state troopers. 
But sometimes, even members of the media are challenged trying to cover proceedings. 
For some years, reporters have been able to freely enter the House of Representatives, as long as they stationed themselves behind a dingy plexiglass barrier near the dais, separating them from the power brokers.

No more. Now, reporters must be on a list guarded by House sergeants-at-arms, and even reporters who are members of the Capitol Hill Press Corps can’t count on being listed. At times in the last two years, Lookout reporters have been turned away despite being recognized by officials working the door, requiring a direct call from the chair of the Capitol Hill Press Corps to gain entry. 
And earlier this month, members of the media were denied access to the Senate gallery. A spokesman for Lt. Gov. Randy McNally said troopers who provide security and sergeants-at-arms were concerned about “exceptional interest in the day’s proceedings” and turned media away as gallery capacity was reached. 
In that instance, McNally’s staff did, within minutes, take steps to allow reporters and photographers into the gallery. 
But it shouldn’t be that difficult for reporters to be able to enter public chambers to do their jobs.
Is this a chicken or egg issue? Are Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers emboldened by Trump’s example or would they have arrived at these steps on their own? That’s hard to say, since Trump’s influence has permeated Republican-led legislators for nine years — only six years after Republicans became the Tennessee Legislature’s supermajority. 
And I’m not sure the genesis matters, because here we are. But for Tennesseans who are weary of the flood of national bad news and a feeling of helplessness, there’s a cure of sorts. Turn your TV off, look away from Washington, D.C., and turn your sights to home — where your vote has a more direct impact on those same Trump-like policies and those perpetrating them.

Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Like bringing back smoking rooms to Montana businesses.
This is what Senate Bill 150, now being debated by the Montana Legislature, stands to do.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Wylie Galt of Martinsdale, would weaken Montana’s 20-year-old Clean Indoor Air Act and allow so-called “cigar rooms” to operate in our state. If the idea sounds familiar, that’s because lawmakers have rejected it time after time in past legislative sessions. But those who put profits ahead of our health keep trying.
SB 150 will subject employees and non-smoking patrons to secondhand cigar smoke, which can cause lung cancer and heart disease and stroke, and which contains all the same toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. Every worker deserves a safe place to work – free of toxic air pollutants.
If passed, Galt’s bill as proposed with amendments will irreparably weaken our Clean Indoor Air Act, which, as stated in Montana law, is intended to “protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; to recognize the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air; and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air has priority over the desire to smoke.”
There is no way to contain cigar smoke within a room or building. Smoke filters through cracks in windows and walls, through air ducts and even through electrical outlets. And there is no safe level of secondhand smoke exposure. If bars or brewpubs have “cigar rooms,” everyone inside the building, not just the smoking area itself, will be at risk, just as they were back in the bad old days when smoking was allowed in restaurants and on board airplanes. Say “so long” to the family environment many establishments have cultivated during the past two decades. Many Montanans may see their favorite spots opting in to allow smoking.
There is no ventilation system that can effectively protect against secondhand smoke. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, which sets engineering standards for ventilation systems, says that “the only means of effectively eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to ban smoking activity” from a building. Ventilation may reduce odor, but it won’t protect people’s health.
In fact, people who go inside a cigar bar or room will be at risk even when smoking isn’t taking place. Toxins from cigar smoke seep into carpet, furniture and walls and can be absorbed through the skin or by breathing in contaminated dust or by eating contaminated food. Employees charged with cleaning or otherwise maintaining a cigar bar or room will be at risk. Cigar bars or rooms can even pose a hazard for neighboring businesses.
Not only are backers of SB 150 and its amendment undermining our health and the Clean Indoor Air Act, but they also are breaking a promise made to the people of Montana. When the Clean Indoor Air Act was adopted 20 years ago, it included a four-year phase-in period for Montana’s tavern owners to make their bars and casinos smokefree. The phase-in was agreed upon by the tavern industry, legislators and some health groups. SB 150 breaks this promise, which has been held for 16 years.
The bill also runs counter to public opinion in our state. A 2021 poll by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the American Heart Association showed that 89% of Montana voters from across the political spectrum support the Clean Indoor Air Act, and 77% (3-in-4) of Montana voters oppose allowing cigar smoking in bars.
SB 150 breaks a promise made to Montana citizens and hospitality workers, and it undermines our Clean Indoor Air Act, which prevents disease and saves lives. We’ve had 20 years of smokefree workplaces and 16 years of smokefree bars and casinos. Why bring back the days of smoke-filled air and coming home with your clothes, skin and hair stinking of smoke?
We’ve come to expect clean, healthy air in our public spaces. Let’s not go back to the days of smoking rooms.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cigar-in-ashtray-861x535-1.jpg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

(Photo by Javeria Salman/The Hechinger Report)This story is part of Hechinger’s ongoing coverage about rethinking high school. See our article about a new diploma in Alabama that trades chemistry for carpentry. 
LOUISVILLE — It had been a slow morning at the Class Act Federal Credit Union. But a little after 11 a.m., a client walked through the door. 
“Who’s waiting on me?” said the elderly man, smiling.
“I will,” said Gracie Lacefield, one of three tellers behind the counter. “How are you doing? What can I help you with?” The man gave his account information to Lacefield, and then handed her his money to deposit. 
The Class Act Federal Credit Union isn’t a typical bank. Jefferson County school employees founded it in 1954 to provide educators with financial services; it began setting up  branches in high schools in 2011 as a way to offer students work-based learning. Lacefield and the two other tellers are high schoolers. 
The credit union became one small piece of a districtwide effort, Academies of Louisville, to embed career and technical education, or CTE, alongside core subjects like math and English and require every student to pick a career pathway by 10th grade.
 Piloted in 2017 at 11 high schools, the model has expanded to all 15 of the district’s main high schools. As part of that effort, the district has also launched a career exploration program at 14 middle schools, partnered with local colleges and universities to provide dual credit courses and smoothed the path for students to graduate with industry-recognized certifications. 
Ford Next Generation Learning
The Academies of Louisville is one of roughly 30 such programs that are working to provide CTE for all students, regardless of whether they plan to go to college or directly into the workforce, according to Jessica Delgado, marketing and communications director of Ford Next Generation Learning, which helps school districts adopt the approach. The Ford Motor Company Fund made Louisville part of the network in 2014.
This “CTE for all” model has grown in popularity as support for the idea of “college for all” has eroded amid high tuition costs and low completion rates. The “CTE for all” model has support from employers interested in meeting local and regional workforce needs. And some experts argue that combining workforce and academic learning makes students more engaged and helps them build professional networks.

“A lack of access to work-based learning can actually limit the career prospects and economic mobility of youth and adults,” said Kyle Hartung, associate vice president for education at the nonprofit Jobs for the Future. He noted that there’s some evidence for the effectiveness of individual “CTE for all” programs and models, although data on the impact of the approach as a whole remains scant. 
Meanwhile, the career academies model requires a significant overhaul of the traditional high school model, and without buy-in from teachers, families and local and regional business leaders, it’s unlikely to work. In late November, Anchorage School District in Alaska postponed fully adopting the model after parents and school board members raised concerns about shorter class periods and the possibility that some core subjects would be replaced by career-themed courses. 
Dozing through chemistry, engaged in welding
For Marty Pollio, now Jefferson County Public Schools superintendent, the inspiration to adopt career-oriented education sprouted from a desire to engage more students in learning. He remembers as principal of Jeffersontown High School in early 2010 walking into a chemistry class to find one of the students asleep. 
After Pollio woke him up, the student explained that he didn’t care about the class and asked why he had to learn about the periodic table. Next period, the same student was attentive and engaged in the school’s welding lab, Pollio said, even as the class talked about some of the same content the chemistry class had covered. 
“We have a kid who has a passion for welding, why are we not teaching science from that perspective? Why are we not teaching math from that perspective?” Pollio recalled thinking. He encouraged his teachers to experiment and collaborate to find real-world applications for lessons. To help make science lessons more concrete, for example, the chemistry teacher began holding her class in the welding lab and both the chemistry and welding teachers began interweaving projects and lessons into each other’s classes.

Around that time, the district was seeking to expose more students to career pathways, especially after the state legislature in 2011 expanded how it evaluates schools to include students’ career readiness, a metric it has continued to refine since. In 2014, the city of Louisville was designated a Ford Next Generation Learning Community, and it joined the network of school districts that intend to provide CTE for all students. In 2016, Jefferson County leaders and principals, including Pollio, visited nearby Nashville, one of the first cities to launch the career academies model.
Adopting the model in Louisville required a shake-up of how the schools were organized: Every school created a freshman academy and two to three career academies, each with a designated principal and counselor (in addition to the schoolwide executive principal). 
Today, across the 15 high schools, there are 56 academies offering a total of 155 different industry pathways. As freshmen, students are introduced to each career pathway available at their high school before selecting one. Sophomore year, students start taking career courses in their chosen pathway, getting hands-on education.

Depending on the pathway, students earn either an industry certification or college credit through local postsecondary institutions such as Jefferson Community and Technical College. Students from the same academy also move through the majority of their core classes together, when possible. 
At Jeffersontown High, for example, students can join one of three academies: business and leadership, build and design, or the health sciences. Within those academies, students specialize in an industry pathway like engineering, teaching and learning, welding, allied health or marketing. Students in the business and leadership academy’s financial services pathway can work at their campus Class Act Credit Union. Other schools offer pathways in fields including healthcare, aviation, manufacturing, computer science, civil service and media arts. 
The program looks a little different at every school, said Kim Morales, an executive administrator of high schools for the district. Some combine instruction in core subjects like math with career instruction while others take a less integrated approach, she said.
Academy model requires teachers to be more creative, flexible
Fern Creek High School is among the schools that have tried the combination approach. On a Tuesday morning in late December, in the school’s engineering lab, students were building robotic cars they’d spent months designing. 
Down the hall, a computer science class was reminiscent of a real-world software development company — students worked in teams as lead developers, software developers, business analysts and technical writers for a class project. A few doors down, students in the fire science pathway were creating budgets for how to invest $2,000 to expand either the fire science program or the fire department. Students would present their plans to the Fern Creek Fire Department later in the semester. 
Upstairs, juniors in the early education pathway had just completed a lesson on the characteristics needed for effective early childhood educators and had started to work on the professional resumes they’d need to land internships or part-time jobs at child care centers and preschools that partner with the district. Elsewhere in the school, culinary students studied for a certification exam, while students in the JROTC pathway practiced with air rifles for an upcoming drill competition. 
Ryan Scott, who teaches biology and Advanced Placement Biology within the high school’s engineering, computer sciences and skilled trades academy, said the academy model requires core content teachers like him to be more flexible and creative. It can also help them focus their attention on certain content because their students tend to have shared interests, he said: “I can draw specific examples from computer science, from fire science, from plumbing, to teach my biology kids things, and it gives me kind of like an anchor point.” 
In an ecology unit on how ecosystems change over time, for example, Scott said he talked with his fire science students about the impact of forest fires on an ecosystem, and how sometimes firefighters use burning in specific areas to regenerate land.

Sara Abell, a former Advanced Placement teacher who now leads the academies at Fern Creek, said her thinking on whether students need college has morphed over time. “We need to make sure that we’re preparing all of our students, and college isn’t for everybody,” she said. “Kids don’t need to go to college and waste a bunch of money just to figure out that this isn’t for them and that they could have done something in a skilled trade.”
Students say the focus on career education has shaped them in different ways. Parker Bowdy, a senior in Fern Creek’s fire science pathway, had planned to join a fire department directly after graduation. But recently he said he’s considering college because it would open up more leadership opportunities within the fire service industry. 
Rayna Stewart, a junior at Fern Creek, is in the early childhood education pathway. She plans to pursue a college degree in chemistry, but said the education pathway has taught her a lot about how kids develop mentally and physically. It’s also given her a new perspective on the teaching profession. 
“It made me think more about what my teachers have to do in order to teach us,” Stewart said. “It’s made me think about how it would be as a teacher — like, ‘Oh would I enjoy being a math teacher?’ ”
The model has not expanded to the school’s magnet, specialized or alternative high schools. That’s largely because those schools already offer their own career-focused education, said Mark Hebert, a district spokesperson.
Parental pushback in Alaska
Across the country, in Alaska, the Anchorage School District launched the Academies of Anchorage this past fall — with much controversy. The district rolled out the model with a mandatory career exploration academy for ninth graders, after deciding in June to allow older students to opt out following parental pushback. 
Then, in November, the district emailed parents announcing that it would postpone further changes for at least a year after parents, teachers and school board members raised additional concerns about budget constraints and core classes being cut or replaced in order to make room for the academy changes. In January, the district released an updated plan saying that beginning with the 2025-26 school year, each of its main high schools would offer at least two career pathways, pending budget approval, which would be open to students in all grades but not mandatory. 
Jarrett Boling, a parent with two kids in the district who has been critical of the program’s implementation, said in December that district leaders never clearly explained the academy model and why it was being launched at a time when the school system was already facing teacher shortages and a budget deficit. Nor did the district answer questions about how the model would affect students’ ability to take honors or AP classes, he said. 
He said parents were surveyed about what academies they wanted but weren’t given much context about the model except that it would help increase the district’s graduation rate and build a better working relationship with the business community. “Part of my frustrations have been, I would say, mostly steered toward the school district itself and its kind of lack of transparency and information out to the public,” he said. 
MJ Thim, chief of communications for the Anchorage School District, wrote in an email that the district would not make officials available for an interview for this story, saying that “we are reworking a few things with the program.”
Big cost, big payoff, says superintendent
While Louisville’s model hasn’t generated much criticism, it hasn’t been an easy journey.
The model is expensive: $5.7 million in startup money, in addition to annual costs. “It’s a big cost yearly for us, however the payoff is very well worth it,” said Pollio.
“What’s happened historically is our kids … the ones that are the most successful are on a pathway. The ones who are struggling the most are not. They are just randomly picking classes to graduate and that’s not good for engagement,” Pollio said.
Pollio credits the model, for example, for helping to boost the district’s graduation and postsecondary readiness rates. Those have risen from 81 percent to 87 percent, and 50 to roughly 80 percent, respectively, between 2018 and 2024, according to district officials. At this time, the school system does not collect employment data on its graduates.

District leaders said the program remains little-known in Louisville, even among some parents, in part because it can be complicated to explain. This year the district has done more to publicize it, working with KentuckianaWorks, the regional workforce development board, to expand partnerships with local and regional businesses. Helping local employers understand that the district has 22,000 kids in career and technical education who are graduating with employable skills is “going to change this city long-term,” said Pollio. 
For Fatima Avila, the Jeffersontown branch coordinator at Class Act Credit Union, the model has been transformative. 
Eight years ago, when she was a junior at Southern High School, the district launched the academies model, and a branch of the district’s credit union opened at her school. She became one of its first student employees, and continued to work there part-time while earning her bachelor’s degree in social work at Northern Kentucky University. 
After graduation, she worked at a sober living home, but the role wasn’t as hands-on as she wanted and she missed the camaraderie and relationships she’d developed working in various Class Act branches. In June 2024, after Jeffersontown High School opened its own credit union branch, Avila was hired to lead it and work with students who are in the business and health sciences academy at the school.
“When I graduated high school, I did not think I would be back at Class Act like five years later,” Avila said. But she said she enjoys how the job allows her to mentor students and work with the wider community.
Lacefield, the Jeffersontown student, said she started picking up extra hours at the credit union after school to make money and because she enjoys it so much. A sophomore in the financial services pathway, she said she isn’t sure yet about her plans after high school but the credit union experience has been a positive one. 
“I ended up really, really loving getting to work with members, getting to work with people,” Lacefield said. “I just know that I really want to stay, whether I make money or not.”

The inset shows a closeup of a single strand. (Image by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) appear to be a slowly rising tide in the Ocean State, according to the most recent data from the state health department. 
STI surveillance data is reported on a lag, so the March report issued by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) contains long- and short-term data ending in 2023, plus some tentative findings for 2024. But recent increases in infections could also be trends returning to their baseline prior to the pandemic. 
“If you look at the data starting in 2020 we did see some significant declines starting with the pandemic, and that is because we were seeing less testing, less healthcare visits,” said Dr. Philip Chan, a primary care physician with Brown University Health and a medical consultant on the RIDOH report.
But people’s behavior also changed during that time, Chan added. “People were more likely to stay at home, more likely to isolate. What we were seeing on the ground was that a lot of people had a lot less sex partners, so there was just a lot less sex going on.”
The good news is that the state usually succeeds in treating HIV, with outcomes more positive than national averages and patients’ illness often stops before the virus progresses into AIDS. Less ideal are higher rates for other STIs like syphilis and gonorrhea, which climbed past pre-pandemic levels in 2023.
“From year to year, it’s tough to tell exactly what’s happening,” Chan said. “But I think that the trends the last couple years are clear that things are going up.”
Data for the more ubiquitous infections includes:

Syphilis has increased 58% from 2014 to 2023. There were 328 cases recorded in 2021, the highest number in decades. That fell to 240 cases in 2022, and 190 in 2023 — about the same as pre-pandemic levels, which had already risen since 2014. Preliminary data for 2024 shows similar trends. From 2020 to 2023, there were also about 10 cases of congenital syphilis — the state’s first instances in about a decade, and one example of testing’s importance in early detection, Chan said.

Gonorrhea cases rose 183.4% over the last 10 years. There were 590 cases in 2014, compared to 1,672 cases in 2023. There has not been a year with fewer than 1,000 cases since 2016. Men account for about twice as many cases as women.

Chlamydia cases have remained more consistent since 2014, and rose 21% over the decade, from 4,349 cases in 2014 to 5,269 cases in 2023. Women ages 20-24 exhibited the highest increase over that same period, but the report notes that women access routine screenings more than men, who are often asymptomatic when infected. 

“A key theme for all these STIs is that most people may not have symptoms,” Chan said. “And so the only way that you know that you may have it is to get tested, and that’s why testing is so so important.”
Chan pointed to primary care doctors and sex education as two ways people can become educated about the necessity of screening. Only 52% of adults ages 18 to 64 who had multiple sex partners received an STI test in the past year, according to 2022 data. Only 60% had ever received an HIV test.  










What we were seeing on the ground was that a lot of people had a lot less sex partners, so there was just a lot less sex going on.

Demographic and geographic factors also shaped the data. Racial disparities exist: In 2023, HIV rates were four times higher among Black residents and nearly sevenfold higher among Rhode Island’s Latino population, compared to caucasian residents. New HIV cases among Latinos have risen 132% since 2019, while dropping 63% among Black Rhode Islanders. Of newly diagnosed HIV cases in 2023, 31% were diagnosed in people born outside the United States, most frequently in the Caribbean and Central and South America.
Younger people ages 15-24 account for most new STI diagnoses, about half. The state’s urban core of Providence, East Providence, North Providence, Pawtucket, Woonsocket, Central Falls, and Cranston consistently reports the highest STI rates, with cases numbering in the dozens to hundreds, compared to fewer than five reported cases in many smaller towns.
“A lot of these STIs do disproportionately affect communities of color and other sorts of underserved populations,” Chan said. “It’s important, from a public health perspective, to think about how to continue and promote and increase access to care for those groups in order to address disparities like we see in STIs and frankly, many other things.”

Early diagnosis, prevention making a difference 
While an assortment of drugs can stop bacterial infections, there’s no cure for HIV. But HIV-positive people are living longer than ever due to modern antiretroviral drugs that suppress the virus and prevent it from progressing to a more serious diagnosis of AIDS. An adequately suppressed viral load can also make the disease intransmissible, and greatly improves quality of life by halting the virus from replicating. Advances in HIV drug therapy largely account for the deep reduction in the rate of HIV-related deaths, which nationally fell by almost half from from 2010 to 2017.
In Rhode Island in 2022, 93.2% of people living with HIV knew their status, 76% were receiving treatment and 71% had achieved viral suppression. And 93% of people who received their medical care within Rhode Island achieved viral suppression. 
Still, there was an above average number of HIV diagnoses, the preliminary 2024 data showed. From 2019-2023, RIDOH also observed that about 20% of people newly diagnosed with HIV had progressed to stage 3, or AIDS. On average, it takes eight years for HIV to develop into AIDS. 
Rhode Island has tried to prevent those outcomes by early diagnosis, and by fortifying its residents against HIV through preventative measures — namely, PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis. Patients who adhere to the schedule for taking this group of antiretroviral drugs can have up to a 99% lower chance of contracting HIV from unprotected sex. PrEP provides an approximate 74% reduction in the likelihood of contracting HIV via injectable drug use.
Successful state laws from 2023 and 2024 made PrEP as widely available as possible by slashing away potential restrictions from insurers and eliminating out-of-pocket costs. Chan, only had “good things to say” about those laws — including the resulting interactions with insurers, who have largely been quick to correct mistakes in patient billing. The main challenge now, Chan said, is when interruptions occur, and a person loses their job, insurance, and access to PrEP.

 Several sexual health clinics and community health centers in Rhode Island offer low or no cost services and assist in minimizing any out-of-pocket costs associated with PrEP prescriptions and testing. For a list go to Rhode Island’s PrEP Champions Network. 

“I actually had a patient of mine for several years who had insurance and was on PrEP,” Chan said. “They lost their insurance for a couple months and had to go off PrEP, and they actually, unfortunately, acquired HIV during that time. This was just a month ago.”
RIDOH continues to promote the Rhode Island PrEP Champions Network, which has participating clinics across the state that expedite access to PrEP as well as its sibling PEP, or post-exposure prophylaxis, which is taken for about a month, starting within 72 hours of possible HIV exposure. Properly taken, the drug prevents HIV infection.
The comparable treatment for preventing bacterial STIs is DoxyPEP, which usually consists of a single, two-pill, dose of doxycycline taken after sex. Doxycycline is an old drug, and thus an inexpensive means of lowering contraction rates, Chan suggested. 
“DoxyPEP is the newest kid on the block,” he said, noting that the nationwide rollout is still in its early stages. But so far the data looks good, with evidence from places like San Francisco suggesting it can make a difference.
“We’re very optimistic about it, and I think the coming years will be able to tell whether or not it’s making a significant impact on overall population trends,” Chan said.

For background, the “Shared Responsibility” law (House Bill 540) was passed in 2010. The Kentucky Teachers Retirement System (TRS) board and education community members, including active and retired teachers, school board members, superintendents and experts, collaborated to find a solution.  
The bill established the TRS retiree health fund (health insurance trust), which exists independently from the Kentucky Teachers’ Retirement Fund. At the time, although suggested and requested due to a history of underfunding by the state, the legislature refused to include increased matching contributions by the state into the Kentucky Teachers’ Retirement Fund to begin addressing its much-publicized unfunded liability. 
The funding structure of HB 540 required active teachers to pay 3.75% of their salary, retired teachers under the age of 65 to pay the equivalent of the monthly cost of Medicare Part B, and school districts to contribute 3% of their gross payroll to the health insurance trust.  
Notably, HB 540 included a provision stating that once the health insurance fund achieved sufficient prefunding, as determined actuarially, the 3.75% contribution from active teachers shall be “decreased, suspended, or eliminated.” The same was true for the amount school systems paid in.
While receiving widespread praise for its collaborative development, the Shared Responsibility bill passed through the Kentucky House and Senate without any opposing votes. Gov. Steve Beshear signed it into law on April 13, 2010. 
Overall, the bill was a significant step towards securing financial support for retired teachers’ health care. It reflected a commitment to the education community while relieving Kentucky taxpayers of a $5 billion liability.  
Sounds good?  Right?  Not so fast. The 2025 Kentucky legislature put the brakes on the “shall, in an actuarially accountable manner, be either decreased, suspended, or eliminated” part related to active teachers’ and school systems’ contributions to the health insurance trust.
Now that the retiree health insurance trust is nearly 100% funded, lawmakers voted to renege on the deal that was made in 2010 by passing House Bill 694 (AN ACT relating to Teachers’ Retirement System benefit funding). 
To paraphrase the new law, when the Teachers’ Retirement Fund and the health insurance trust are fully funded, the 3.75% presently going to the health insurance trust may be decreased, suspended, or eliminated. In addition, the school funding for the retiree health insurance trust will be diverted to the Teachers’ Retirement Fund.
According to the actuarial analysis of HB 694, the Teachers’ Retirement Fund will not be 100% funded until 2047. This means teachers will have to wait many more years than initially legislated to have a reduction in the 3.75% deducted from their paycheck. Heavy sigh.
Gov. Andy Beshear vetoed HB 694. In his veto message, he stated,  “House Bill 694 breaks a promise made to teachers in 2010 and does so without even giving them an opportunity for input.”  That’s right; the education community was left out of the bill-making process this time around.  
Beshear went on to mention that teachers would “need to pay much longer than the law calls for” and that “breaking this promise is unfair to the teachers we rely on to guide our children and the future of the Commonwealth.” 
Disappointingly, 67 members of the House and 29 members of the Senate voted to override Beshear’s veto, basically on partisan lines, with the overwhelming majority of the “yea” votes coming from Republicans. 
No doubt, this legislation takes money right out of the pockets of hard-working teachers. 
Like many others across Kentucky, teachers have children to raise, student loan obligations to meet, car and mortgage payments to make, utility bills to pay and groceries to buy, all on a limited budget. In addition, teachers purchase school supplies, necessities and extras for their classrooms.  
The 3.75% deducted from Kentucky teachers’ paychecks equals approximately $1,400 to $2,800 annually. This amount adds up over time while straining  teachers’ monthly budgets. This move does nothing to retain and recruit Kentucky teachers at a time when teachers are becoming harder to find. 
It is the job of those in power in the legislature to fulfill their obligations to teachers.     Transparent and authentic commitments supporting teachers that ensure fair compensation and benefits are vital in creating sustainable educational environments. Before passing legislation that hurts educators’ financial bottom line, lawmakers would be wise to keep in mind that our Kentucky public school teachers have the future of the commonwealth in their classrooms.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/teachers-desk-1024x1024.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

Matters of little consequence often get major time and attention. And vice versa. Two energy bills in the Colorado Legislature this year, one about nuclear energy and the second about electrical transmission, illustrate this.
The first bill, House Bill 25-1040, which is now law, declared that nuclear energy is clean. It proclaims that utilities can meet clean-energy targets with nuclear. It also allows private projects access to financing restricted to clean energy development.
The bill sailed through the Legislature. Gov. Jared Polis signed it into law March 31. For believers, those who want to believe that nuclear energy will be the answer, it was a big win.
To what effect? Likely none. Forget about nuclear waste and safety concerns. Cost of energy from new nuclear plans remains exorbitant.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Some of this was sorted through in a four-hour committee hearing in March. Chuck Kutscher was among several dozen individuals given two-minute slots to testify. He deserved more time. A nuclear engineer by training, he subsequently moved into renewables, retiring from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory several years ago.
At a later meeting in Jefferson County, Kutscher explained why he expects nuclear energy to play no role in Colorado’s energy transition. It comes down to cost.
“I like to give credit where credit is due. And the fact is that nuclear power in this country has saved a heck of a lot of carbon dioxide and air pollution emissions,” he said. “Nuclear provides almost half of U.S. carbon-free electricity, which is pretty impressive.”
As for costs, Kutscher cited two metrics courtesy of Lazard, a financial company that monitors electrical generation. The cost of building new nuclear plants comes in at $8,000 to $13,000 per kilowatt of generating capacity. Solar comes in at $1,400, wind at $2,000.
A broader metric, the levelized cost, includes capital, fuel and operating costs over the life of an energy plant. “The longer a plant runs, the lower its life-cycle costs, because it’s producing more energy,” Kutscher explained. By this measure, nuclear still comes up short: 18 cents a kilowatt-hour compared to solar and wind for 5 and 6 cents.
Might costs drop with a new generation of small modular reactors? SMRs can generate 300 megawatts or less. One was planned in the West, but in 2023 the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems pulled out of its contract with nuclear company NuScale — because of cost.
If nuclear costs make it a non-starter in Colorado, can renewables deliver us to an emission-free electrical system? The sun vanishes daily, and sometimes winds on our eastern plains die down, even for days. Kutscher sees possible solutions in improving storage technologies and expanded transmission. Transmission can enable electricity to be shared across multiple time zones and weather systems.
Transmission technologies
Even moving electricity around Colorado more efficiently has value. The second bill, Senate Bill 24-127, proposes to do that. It would require investor-owned utilities to investigate tools called advanced transmission technologies. They will enable more use from existing transmission lines and associated infrastructure.
Larry Milosevich, a Lafayette resident, decided six years ago to devote himself to fewer pursuits. He says he chose the role of advanced technologies for transmission because of its oversized impact.  The transmission system developed during the last century has many inefficiencies.
“I would love to see advanced transmission technologies get a little more light,” he says. Why hasn’t it happened? “It doesn’t have sex appeal.”
This bill will not solve all problems. “You need a lot of arrows in your quiver to get there. And it’s not one technology that’s going to save the day,” says Leah Rubin Shen, managing director of Advanced Energy United, an industry association that advocates for technologies and policies that advance decarbonization.
More transmission will still be needed. Approvals take time. Using these tools can more rapidly expand capacity at lower cost. “We characterize it as a no-regrets solution,” says Rubin Shen.
State Sen. Cleave Simpson, a Republican from Alamosa, was the primary author of the bill. “We can increase the capacity and resilience of our infrastructure without having to undertake expensive, large-scale construction projects,” he told committee members at a March meeting.
The committee that day heard from fewer than a dozen witnesses. It passed an amended bill and moved on within 45 minutes. Several weeks before, the same committee heard nuclear testimony for hours.
In a later interview, Simpson described the bill, slimmed greatly in ambition from its original iteration, as “maybe a tiny step forward, but a doable one.”
Unlike nuclear, not the answer, but a doable one.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The plot is thickening in the Rhode Island Department of Education’s (RIDE) takeover of Providence public schools. It’s been five years. Providence wants them back ASAP. But neither side has offered ways to rebuild the foundations that cement the dysfunction.  
Until now.
Useful ideas are emerging at the State House, with increasingly specific proposals that have actual meat on nice-sounding principles. In a true act of forward movement, Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, introduced three bills on March 7 that could really improve how Providence schools govern themselves, deploy their own resources, and maintain high quality staff. 
Zurier’s bills were introduced a month after Gov. Dan McKee and RIDE outlined nine conditions the city must meet to regain local control by June 2026.
Basically, the city must provide more money, fiscal transparency, a trained and well-informed board, and improved facilities. No argument there, but where are changes to education policy per se? One condition told the city to “establish performance-based outcomes for contracts at the Providence Public School Department, such as custodial services.” Wait. Custodial contracts?!  
The nine conditions seemed tone deaf to report after report. Like the Providence Blueprint for Education, which called the school district “confused about priorities.”
Like the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy 2019 review that precipitated the takeover by documenting a laundry list of problems, from the majority of students performing below grade level to demoralized teachers and unsafe school buildings. 
Like last year’s Senate Education Commission’s report, identifying the Providence teachers contract as a huge obstacle to student success.   










Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, introduced three bills on March 7 that could really improve how Providence schools govern themselves, deploy their own resources, and maintain high quality staff. 


RIDE Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green soon followed up with a substantial, detailed letter to the city clarifying and reducing nine conditions to five overarching concerns: Governance, Finances, Facilities, Legislation and a Transition Plan. 
Four of the concerns have numbered and bulleted details with educational asks, like requiring the school board to shift its focus from adult inputs to student outcomes — the very heart of the matter.
But “Legislation” has only a vague sentence requesting an intergovernmental team to work on state laws “to remove legislative barriers to improving outcomes and opportunities for Providence’s children.”  
While clearly anti-kid and anti-education, legislative barriers seem immutable because no one wants conflicts with our powerful teachers unions. Remember this: A public-sector teachers union is a private-sector business whose mission is to benefit and protect teachers. The laws serve adults.  
Thankfully, the trio of bills from Zurier offer a better way. Here’s how:
Senate Bill No. 745 – Expedited grievance process  
State law imposes a grievance procedure so onerous, administrators rarely try to discipline or fire a non-performing teacher. Unions argue they “counsel out” poor teachers with a stern conversation, and sometimes that does work. But teachers’ union dues entitle members to full-throated legal protection if they want it. 
Abundant stories, now too old to threaten confidentiality, include the 80-year-old who slept through classes, but whom the union protected on the grounds that the district had not supplied adequate professional development.  
The commission offers an example of the onerous process with the story of a 2014 grievance that originated with an evidence-filled termination letter to a certain teacher. After several district hearings, the grievance went to RIDE for “an appeal to a hearing officer, a review by the commissioner, a second review by the commissioner, an appeal to the Council on Elementary and Secondary Education and an appeal to the Superior Court which upheld the termination.” The Supreme Court is still an option. 
Solution: End blanket protection of all teachers no matter their performance by shortening the wealth of opportunities to appeal administrative decisions. At the same time, this bill would create guardrails to protect teachers who serve students well. The guardrails legislate against arbitrary or vengeful terminations by including a list of specific grounds for reprimand or dismissal. If the shorter appeals process doesn’t work, the matter goes to binding arbitration by specified outside parties whose decision is final. These revisions are fair to teachers and create flexibility for administration.
Senate Bill No. 746. Mandatory annual salary step increases
By law, districts and their municipalities must stick to a “a salary schedule recognizing years of service” with up to 12 annual pay increase steps. This “lock-step” pay system is a throwback to the 1960s automotive factory workers’ contracts on which our teachers’ contracts were modeled. Districts can not negotiate innovative pay systems that incentivize our best teachers to stay in the profession by, for example, advancing up the salary scale more quickly by taking on leadership roles. Conversely, teachers who need to improve get the same salary bump as everyone else.  
Solution: Eliminate the “lock-step” mandate so schools have the freedom to deploy their resources where they’re needed. The adjusted bill allows Providence to “negotiate alternative salary schedules” outside of the rigid factory-model uniformity, which may include other “bases for increased compensation” including paying “teachers willing to take on greater responsibilities.”
Senate Bill No. 747. Laying off teachers by seniority
State law mandates hiring, laying off and re-hiring teachers by seniority, which is to say, who has the oldest date of original hire. If student enrollment declines, unionized teachers must be retained or re-hired by seniority. Administrators don’t get to decide to keep the most effective educators on staff. It’s LIFO, or Last In, First Out. 
Another old story: Years ago, the district dismissed a famously popular Teacher of the Year because his three-year probation wasn’t up yet. Senior teachers who had not been rehired by a failing school that was being rebooted (“reconstituted”) had legal rights to his job. The public hew and cry made no difference. Seniority is the law. Even if contract negotiators agree to suspend strict seniority, they invite lawsuits.  
Solution: Limit LIFO, with caveats. The new bill is longer than the original 1960s-era legislation because it details what teachers might be retained regardless of seniority. They include bilingual teachers, teachers with excellent evaluations or needed skills, teachers of the year and others. For the record, teachers of color are more likely to be new, so LIFO upsets efforts to diversify the workforce. 
It’s worth noting that these bills were assigned to the Senate Labor Committee instead of the Education Committee, again prioritizing adult concerns over kids.
There’s still time, though. The legislature can still make the needed changes. If not, the dysfunctional Providence district will be a hot potato passed back and forth between the state and the city, neither of which really has the tools to succeed. 
If that happens, the Providence students will be right back where they were in 1993 when these problems were first reported. 
Remember the local cliché: “As goes Providence, so goes the state.”

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Before everything went black, Tamika Jackson felt like she was drowning. While in labor giving birth to her baby boy, her body felt heavy and her breaths shallow.
“I can’t breathe,” she croaked to the anesthesiologist.
“If you couldn’t breathe, you wouldn’t be able to speak,” she recalled the doctor telling her, dismissing her as having a “panic attack.”
Minutes later, the 37-year-old’s lungs gave out. Her heart stopped beating.
Clinicians were able to resuscitate Jackson. Her baby boy was born via C-section, and the Michigan mom lived to tell her story of giving birth to Cree, who’s turning 3 next month.
Jackson is now a maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based nonprofit. She spoke with Stateline while on a bus to the Michigan Capitol, where she participated in a Black Maternal Health Week panel and pushed for a legislative package — nicknamed the Michigan Momnibus — which aims to increase obstetric patient protections and improve care for moms of color.
The Michigan Senate passed the package Thursday, and it now heads to the House.
Black moms like Jackson are three times more likely to die than white mothers and suffer higher rates of pregnancy-related complications.
But in its bid to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives, the Trump administration has terminated community health grants and closed federal offices that support state efforts to tackle racial health disparities. Experts say the moves will hinder efforts to improve Black maternal health.
“DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival,” Jackson said. “This is about community-based solutions — and they’re undoing that.”
Jackson added that without federal dollars, “We’re going to be left trying to do a whole lot with a whole lot of nothing.”
The Trump administration has cut grants for maternal health studies and research on health disparities in various populations, including patients of color and LGBTQ people. It has laid off most staff at the federal Division of Reproductive Health, and removed maternal health data from federal agency websites.
It also is considering cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from about $121 billion to about $80.4 billion, according to The New York Times. The administration plans to create a new Administration for a Healthy America, which would focus on maternal and child health, among other issues.
HHS and its National Institutes of Health did not return requests for comment in time for publication.










DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival.


– Tamika Jackson, Michigan mom and maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice


Researchers and advocates like Jackson say that amid the Trump administration’s erasures, their work will continue.
Among those losing grants are nonprofits, health care systems and universities, including the Morehouse School of Medicine, a historically Black medical school in Atlanta, which received a $2.96 million grant for a center to improve the health of Black pregnant and postpartum women. Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation.
“We are reviewing the situation to assess how it may affect our research,” a Morehouse spokesperson wrote in an email. “More broadly, it is important that we all recognize the critical role medical research plays in developing potential life-saving innovation that will mitigate disease and improve the health and well-being of many people.”

The Morehouse center was selected among an initial 10 research centers funded under the NIH’s Maternal Health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone, or “IMPROVE,” Initiative.
Columbia University and community groups throughout New York also received the grants. One goal was to connect postpartum moms with doulas to detect conditions such as postpartum preeclampsia, according to principal investigator Dr. Uma Reddy, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia. Reddy said the grant was developed with communities who voiced their needs.
“We can actually prevent these deaths and these serious complications,” Reddy said. “This is a way to focus on a high-risk population and provide them with the resources that they don’t have available.”

Tufts University maternal health scholar Ndidiamaka Amutah-Onukagha said she’s had several meetings in Washington, D.C., get canceled, and while she’s thankful to have almost completed one federal grant project, there’s uncertainty about other grants she’s applied for, including a Black postpartum support research initiative.
The professor runs the Maternal Outcomes for Translational Health Equity Research (MOTHER) Lab and Center for Black Maternal Health and Reproductive Justice at the Tufts University School of Medicine.
“It not only stalls progress, but it actually actively endangers the most vulnerable among us,” she said. “These policy decisions can cause and will cause lasting harm to people who are already underserved by our health care system.”
Amutah-Onukagha said she is urging researchers and advocates to have “cautious optimism.”
“Most people are in the space of gloom and doom. I do get that, and I’m vastly in and out of that,” she said. “But because of the work that I do in maternal health, we have to remain optimistic. That lens cannot die. If it does, then the communities that we serve are going to be even more disadvantaged.”
Amutah-Onukagha, who recently testified before the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Public Health, said her team will continue to work with organizations around the state, such as Birth Equity & Justice Massachusetts and Resilient Sisterhood Project.
“We’re stronger in numbers,” she said.
Diana Greene Foster, research director in reproductive health at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted the seminal Turnaway Study documenting the harms women suffer from abortion denials.
She was in the middle of another study, funded by a federal grant, tracking post-Roe abortions and the efficacy of health exceptions in abortion ban laws. Her team was interviewing emergency room doctors about whether they could provide abortions amid major pregnancy complications such as eclampsia, a serious consequence of preeclampsia, which is a dangerous form of high blood pressure that disproportionately affects Black mothers.
The administration pulled her grant.
Foster, who is fundraising to continue her study, said she feels the administration’s actions send a message of “turning their back on science, on compassion, on caring about women.”

Tina Sherman, a doula and national director of maternal justice at MomsRising, a nonpartisan women and mothers advocacy group, said she worries about data the administration has removed, including the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
The surveillance system is a comprehensive tool states use to track maternal health and formulate policies to improve it.
“An attempt to erase the data,” said Sherman, “doesn’t erase the harm that has been done and creates additional harm.”
Without data, states can’t target where resources are needed and which communities are disproportionately harmed and how, said Sherman, who co-chairs the North Carolina Maternal Mortality Review Committee.
“We’re going to be going backwards,” she said.
The Trump administration also canceled several grants focused on intimate partner violence, a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death which disproportionately affects people of color.
One such grant was supporting a University of North Carolina project studying intimate partner violence against pregnant women shortly before they give birth.
“The issues remain. The urgency is pressing as it ever was. The reality is this: Black mothers and birthing people continue to carry the weight of a crisis that we did not create,” Amutah-Onukagha said. “We did not create it, but we are leading the fight to solve it and dismantle it, and we know that the systemic barriers existed before this administration.
They will continue to show up — but we will also continue to produce cutting-edge research here at the center.”

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.



The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Vlad Gavrilovic / Norfolk Transit Department)Virginia’s Department of Rail and Public Transportation has just released their draft six- year improvement program for fiscal year 2026, totaling roughly $7 billion. The funds cover both operational costs and larger sums for capital improvement projects statewide. 
The City of Alexandria, for example, will get money to help cover the $200,000  operational cost for their GO Alex program, which is the city’s outreach program to get residents to ride transit, carpool and commute by bicycle. Hampton Roads’ transportation department will receive funds towards replacing two large buses, a project that will total $1.6 million – and that’s just one of their more than 30 plus capital improvement projects. Localities depend on the state money to update the equipment used to serve the public in various regions of Virginia.
“We of course got money to buy new buses. We have a fleet of over 300 buses,” said Ray Amoruso, chief planning and development officer for Hampton Roads Transportation. “The average life of a bus is either 10 or 12 years and at some point they have to be replaced. So every year we ask for bus money.”
 How the six-year funding program works

The Six-year Improvement Program (SYIP) is an annual funding program that both DRPT and the Virginia Department of Transportation administer to help fund rail — including freight – and public transit programs across the state. The different amounts of funding found in the six-year projects is derived by formulas established by Virginia law. Individual projects, which localities apply for, are funded by the SYIP and are evaluated and given scores by DRPT, then approved by the Commonwealth Transportation Board. 
“The state updates their six-year improvement plan every year. So it’s like a moving window. Each year we progress,” said Amoruso. “Sometimes we ask for the same money if they didn’t award it to us [the first time]. Next year, we’ll do this all over again.”
Here’s a breakdown of how the funds will be allocated in the upcoming fiscal year:. 

Public Transportation: $332 million
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA): $442 million
Virginia Railway Express (VRE): $17 million
Rail (DRPT) $20 million
Transforming Rail in Virginia (VPRA) $232 million

Amoruso said the district gets federal operating assistance based on the size of their metropolitan area and the number of people who live in that area. The Hampton Roads Transportation District covers six cities: Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach.
“A lot of folks who aren’t familiar with HRT or don’t use HRT think that the money they drop in the fare box pays for their ride,” he said. 
One capital project that Amoruso is excited about getting funding to build is an off-street transfer facility off Chesapeake Boulevard known as the Evelyn T. Butts Transfer Station, named after a local Civil Rights activist. Since 1999, riders have had to wait on the street to transfer buses.
“It’s not a pleasant environment. Nine routes come together and people run up and down the block along the length of the block to make connections to other routes,” said Amoruso. “It’s the third busiest transfer center we have in terms of moving human beings back in and out every day.”
 Federal funding could be in jeopardy 

Though next year’s state transportation fiscal funding is taking shape, the uncertainty of future federal support weighs heavy on Amoruso, he said. 
President Donald Trump’s administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have committed to cutting over a trillion dollars in government spending they deem wasteful, targeting scores of federal programs with special emphasis on eliminating ones supporting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (DEI). A January executive order by Trump sparked panic with its directives to federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation, to pause millions in federal funds disbursements, including money allotted for capital improvement projects through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and for electric vehicle and clean energy infrastructure development. 
“It’s not just us, every transit property in the country is nervous because the administration is targeting certain discretionary programs that are connected to DEI initiatives, climate change initiatives,” Amoruso said.  “We in the past have been successful in getting grant awards for low-emission, no-emission buses, meaning electric buses.”
Amoruso said HRT had a goal to convert their 300 diesel buses to a 100% hundred emissions-free, all electric bus system by 2045.
“This administration doesn’t look like they have an appetite to support those kinds of investments,” he said. “That’s just one example, but there are other programs that are at risk related to DEI and all the transit properties in the country are nervous about that and [are] watching very carefully these discretionary grants.”
One grant program Amoruso is watching is a capital investment initiative administered through Congress to help build out bus rapid transit, such as Richmond’s Pulse line or other light rail systems. 
“That’s under the microscope of the federal government right now,” said Amoruso, “which is making a lot of people nervous for high capacity transit projects.”
Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has stated to cut federal funding to Democratic-led states and cities, like New York and California, if they don’t release information on transit crime and safety funding, according E&E News by Politico. 
 Public input needed

The public is invited to comment on all the projects that have been recommended for funding in the draft six-year plan. The Commonwealth Transportation Board will host nine meetings across the state from the week of April 22 through May 15. Online comments, email or regular mail are also being accepted. 
The first meetings take place this week, starting in Richmond, followed by a meeting Wednesday in Lynchburg and one on Thursday in Hampton Roads. 
On June 17 staff from DRPT will present the draft, including any changes, to the Commonwealth Transportation Board for approval. On July 1, all the approved funding will become available.

(Ben Cunningham/ Allegheny-Blue Ridge Alliance.)The future of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad Corridor is coming into clearer focus after the Virginia Department of Transportation recently released its highly anticipated rail with trail assessment and completed a series of related public hearings. 
In 2021, the agency completed its first study of Norfolk Southern’s 50-mile corridor, which local leaders and community organizers, who are part of the Friends of the Shenandoah Rail Trail, hope will lead to converting the rail corridor into a trail. 
VDOT’s second corridor review comes after the Shenandoah Rail Corridor Coalition, a smaller group of community members, questioned the possibility of restoring the Manassas Gap railroad and constructing a trail alongside it. 
The rail corridor, first established in the 1850s, runs from Front Royal to the town of Broadway in Rockingham County. As interest declined in freight service, the company began discontinuing sections of the corridor in 1989, moving operations to Norfolk Southern’s Crescent Corridor, which runs east.
Kate Wofford, executive director of the Alliance for Shenandoah Valley, said her group is “eager” to convert the corridor to a trail, a goal shared by their colleagues, the Friends of the Shenandoah Rail Trail.
“We wanted to get going with it years ago,” said Wofford. “So the sooner we can get started with this wonderful project, the sooner it will start bringing benefits to quality of life, local economic development, tourism (and) to the towns.”
Keven Walker, executive director for the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation, part of the Shenandoah Rail Corridor Coalition, was asked for comment, but did not immediately respond.
The foundation is facing a lawsuit from one of its members over plans to restore the inactive Manassas Gap rail line in the Shenandoah Valley. The suit claims the foundation’s involvement strays far from its mission and threatens its federal tax-exempt status.
 The assessment

Phase 1 of the study to assess the proposal for restoring the railroad and constructing an adjacent trail details projected costs, risks, and public feedback.
While the assessment did not provide a precise total cost to taxpayers, state lawmakers stipulated that “up to $35.0 million shall be allocated to the Shenandoah Valley Rail Trail for the purposes of land acquisition, initial planning, and site” development through the 2020-2022 state budget negotiation.
Some of the costs that would need to be considered are $66 million to repair the existing bridges, $4 million to $18 million to bring the rail line up to the FRA Class II standards, and funding to purchase easements and right of way and land acquisitions, given the narrow 33-foot setback from the centerline of the rail.
The study identified several unknown design factors and associated risks compared to the rail-to-trail concept, including the cantilevered trail structures on existing bridges, which would require retrofitting and may present maintenance and trail user safety concerns. 
The agency also received feedback from county administrators and town managers from 12 localities along the corridor; all of them said their communities supported the rail-to-trail proposal.
The consensus among the leaders is that business use of the rail isn’t in high demand. The study stated, “no localities indicated a strong interest from the business community for freight rail service.” 
However, the agency noted that two existing businesses, which were not identified in the study, have shown interest in using rail. Other industries, such as food processing, have indicated that rail does not fit their business model. 
Several economic development offices have received inquiries from businesses that perceive the ability to increase their customer base from trail users, the study found.
 What’s next

VDOT is currently in Phase 2 of the project to assess the corridor. The process will continue throughout the year with experts reviewing how water moves through the targeted area to inform flood prevention plans, assessing the train tracks and bridges and conducting in-person public meetings and an online public survey.
Phase 3 will conclude with a review of ownership and maintenance and a presentation of the cost estimate and assessment report, with public meetings to follow between the winter and spring of 2026.

(Courtesy Virginians For Reproductive Freedom)“Politicians shouldn’t control your body,” reads a billboard that will soon be unveiled in Central Virginia and Hampton Roads as part of a new campaign highlighting an in-progress legislative effort to enshrine reproductive health care options like abortion, contraception and in vitro fertilization into Virginia’s constitution. 
These issues, longtime priorities for Democratic state lawmakers, will likely feature prominently in this year’s House of Delegates elections, where all 100 seats will be on the ballot. 
“It’s going to be in our hands, then it’s going to be in your hands,” Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, said at a press conference earlier this year when touting the amendment. Boysko sponsored the amendment that would cement access to abortion care in Virginia’s code in the state Senate this year, which the legislature advanced. 
As Republican incumbents have opposed the measure, a coalition of organizations have rallied for an ad blitz spotlighting the matter. 
To support candidates who share the amendment’s goal, a cohort has emerged called Virginians For Reproductive Freedom,. The consortium includes Repro Rising Virginia, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia, League of Women Voters of Virginia, and Birth In Color and other organizations. It also includes Virginia’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 
VRF recently announced plans for the billboards to be placed near college campuses in Hampton, Norfolk and Williamsburg and 100 sidewalk decals with similar messaging will be installed in high foot-traffic areas around Norfolk and Richmond. 
Multilingual multimedia content is planned that will break down how the constitutional amendment process works. Having passed the legislature this year, it will need to pass again next year before appearing as a referendum on ballots statewide. 
But that may only be possible if Democrats retain or grow their majority in the House of Delegates this year, as the amendment advanced this year on partisan lines. 
Virginia’s current law allows most abortions up to 26 weeks of pregnancy with limitations and approval required for the procedure to take place later. Many state Republicans have consistently opposed the current law, with some seeking to reduce the limit to 15 weeks, and others having supported near-total bans. This year, Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, introduced a bill that would have specifically protected abortion as a treatment for nonviable pregnancies, but it was never docketed or put up for a vote.
Republican abortion bill banned from Virginia’s 2025 legislative session

“Miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies are nonviable pregnancies, and therefore cannot be confused with elective abortion procedures,” she told The Mercury at the time. “This would have put any doubt about the law to rest.” 
Abortions at or after 21 weeks are rare, making up just 1% of cases nationwide.  When they do occur, it’s often due to severe fetal anomalies that aren’t detected earlier through testing or because of life-threatening complications later in pregnancy. 
If Virginia’s constitution were amended, the three-physician approval threshold for later-stage abortions would be reduced to one. 
Earlier this year, House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah called the resolution a “word salad” designed to “cloud the true intentions” of the amendment. He argued that reducing the current requirement for three doctors to sign off on a procedure to just one would lower safeguards.
“The abortion doctor can do that,” Gilbert said. 
But supporters of the amendment have stressed that it could be particularly critical in rural pregnancy health crises, where patients already have to travel further for care. 
If enshrined in Virginia’s constitution, abortion access and other reproductive rights would become far more resistant to legislative shifts, shielding from the kind of partisan turnover that has shaped abortion laws in other states. But constitutional amendments are hard to undo — and equally hard to pass.
With the resolutions now clearing the legislature for the first time, the real test comes next year, when lawmakers will have to approve them again before voters get the final say at the ballot box.

There are many shortcomings in the new proposed state budget approved by the North Carolina Senate last week – the inadequate pay raises for teachers and state employees, the failure to invest in numerous core public services that have been reeling from staffing shortages, the giveaways to unaccountable special interests.
But if there’s an overarching flaw that lies at the heart of the proposal, it is the plan to plow ahead with new and regressive tax cuts at a time when state economists are warning of significant budget shortfalls in the near future.
Republican Senate leader Phil Berger – a smalltown lawyer with no credentials in economics – says the consensus forecast of the state’s economists is wrong. He claims the state’s fiscal picture will remain rosy even with new corporate and personal income tax cuts taking effect and massive new reductions in federal aid from the Trump administration.
It’s a remarkably oblivious stance.
The bottom line: North Carolina public services are already running on a shoestring and the Senate’s decision to pull that string even tighter is a huge mistake.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Abby L’Heureux, a physician and addiction specialist at the Center for Recovery Management in Manchester, is already worried about some of her patients who have lost Medicaid coverage. Now, as Republicans in Washington, D.C., make massive cuts to the federal budget — which experts say will most likely impact Medicaid — she and her colleagues could see even more of their patients lose coverage for the care they need.
At an event organized by U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan and Elliot Health System in Manchester earlier this month, L’Heureux told the story of a 30-year-old man who started using cocaine, alcohol, and opioids as a teenager and was incarcerated for the first time at 13. She said he has an extensive family history of substance use disorder as his mother died during an overdose and all his parents and grandparents have been incarcerated. On top of that, he has a seizure disorder and was homeless when he first began treatment with the center. While he hasn’t yet achieved stable long term sobriety, she said they were beginning to see success when they got him on a medication regime that includes an injectable.
“He’s just been doing so well and we continue to have little slips here and there, and we’re working on things, but he keeps coming,” she said. “And that’s a win for us, that he keeps showing up, and he keeps trying. And we always have hope that it’s just one step closer to his goal. His goal is abstinence and so, and we’re just gonna keep walking with him, one step closer, one step closer, and we’re gonna have setbacks, and that’s just a part of the process. But, he’s been doing so well, so much better, now that we’ve got him on a medication that works for him.”
L’Heureux said he’s feeling so well that he’s begun working full time again because he “just functions much better when he’s working full time, and really has things to do during the day.” However, this came with a drawback. He just lost the Medicaid coverage he uses to pay for the treatment because he’s now making too much money. She said his injectable alone costs $2,000 monthly without insurance and he has 10 different medications. She said they worry about how the Medicaid change will impact his progress, though he’s worked with a peer support coordinator to find marketplace insurance.
“That’s one of the things that we have to continue to focus on,” Hassan added. “Somebody is getting well enough to work, which is the goal — one of the goals — and then, but we don’t want them to lose insurance in the process. We want them to be able to keep coming here.”
Conversely, L’Heureux spoke of a 37-year-old man who started using cocaine at age 13, opioids at 15, and crystal meth at 22. He began working with her at the Center for Recovery Management and is taking 16 milligrams of a combination product of multiple opioid use medications. Now, he’s been sober since August 2023 and has become an advocate for his peers who speaks at commitment meetings and runs his own sober living facility. She said he even saved somebody from an overdose recently using the emergency medication Narcan. He is still able to use Medicaid for his treatments, which she said has been huge in his recovery.
The April 14 meeting came amid growing fears that Medicaid, the country’s public health care program for those with low income or high needs, could be heavily scaled down in the federal budgeting process. On April 10, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to approve legislation outlining the federal budget. That outline, which was passed 216-214 entirely through Republican support, calls for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to clear the way for President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — which has long been lambasted by the left and economists as disproportionately benefitting the wealthy — to be renewed.
The outline instructs several committees to make varying levels of cuts to different areas of the budget. That includes the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has been tasked with cutting its portion of the budget by $880 billion over 10 years. It doesn’t explicitly specify that these cuts must come from Medicaid, but because the program comprises about $8.2 trillion of the $8.6 trillion the committee can cut from, it would be impossible to do so without reducing Medicaid or Medicare. Some Republican lawmakers have floated the idea of cutting Medicaid by about a third over 10 years.
Meanwhile, Democrats on the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, including Hassan, estimate that roughly 24 million people would lose their health care coverage if this one-third cut went into effect, 10 million of whom would be children. In New Hampshire, that’s 60,000 people and 30,000 children.
Almost 1 million people receive medication treatment for opioid use disorder through Medicaid, according to committee Democrats. Nearly 10,000 of them live in New Hampshire. Of those 10,000, an estimated 70% or more are able to do so only through the Medicaid expansion, which New Hampshire enacted in 2014.
That expansion program is at perhaps the greatest risk in potential Medicaid cuts. This is because in 2018, New Hampshire state legislators (Medicaid is operated and funded jointly by the federal government and states) passed a trigger law which would eliminate that expansion should federal funding for the program fall below 90% of the cost of the program. This would mean an estimated 7,000 New Hampshire residents receiving opioid treatment medication through Medicaid would lose access to it.
At this month’s event, health care providers emphasized that funding substance use disorder treatment doesn’t just help people deal with their drug issues, it also prevents those issues from turning into more costly issues later on.
“People who are not in treatment end up in medical care,” Greg Baxter, president and CEO of Elliot Health System, said.
Meanwhile, fentanyl, a dangerous type of opioid drug, is ravaging communities across the U.S., including New Hampshire. Additionally, New Hampshire was among the hardest hit states in the opioid epidemic that began in the 2010s. From August 2022 to August 2023, over 110,000 Americans died from drug overdoses or poisonings, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency. In New Hampshire alone, there were 483 drug overdose deaths in 2022, the most recent data available, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. That’s 36 per 100,000 Granite Staters.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hassansubstance-1024x638.jpg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

(Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”











I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity



In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing already has made a comeback

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

LINCOLN — An assessment of restoring the historic Mayhew Cabin and John Brown’s Cave site in Nebraska City estimates it would cost in excess of $20 million to make it a viable attraction again.
Most of the cost, the report indicated, would be demolishing several of the seven existing structures on the site, which have been damaged by flooding and neglect.
Building a new museum to interpret the cabin, a site used by escaping slaves on the Underground Railroad during the Civil War, would cost $3 million alone, according to the assessment by the architectural firm, Clark & Enerson.
Back to Square One?
Cathleen Van Winkle, the president of the foundation that owns the Mayhew Cabin complex, said she was not surprised by the expensive repair estimate, given the extensive damage caused by flooding in 2019 and 2013.
Van Winkle, in an email on Friday, said that the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, which paid for the assessment, has told the Foundation that there is “little likelihood” that the Nebraska Legislature will appropriate money to rebuild the museum due to state budget shortfalls.
Still, she said, she’s hopeful something might be done during the current legislative session.

“If funding fails, the Foundation will have no choice but to go back to square one to begin looking for other partners and alternative plans to save the cabin and its rich history,” Van Winkle said.
Another member of the Foundation board, Robert Nelson, an Underground Railroad historian and former columnist with the Omaha World-Herald, said he’s hopeful the cabin can be saved and become part of a historic byway being developed along the “Lane Trail.” That is a Civil War-era pathway from Iowa to Kansas used by escaping slaves as well as Abolitionists — including John Brown — seeking to join the fight against pro-slavery forces in Kansas.
“We’ll do anything to save the (Mayhew) cabin,” Nelson said in an interview. “We’d love it to be as close as possible to this trail.”
Unsuccessful lawsuit
The Mayhew Cabin, which is listed on the National Park Service Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, has been closed since the 2019 flooding. The flooding prompted the Mayhew Foundation to sue unsuccessfully the City of Nebraska City, claiming it was negligent for allowing runoff from the nearby ravine to damage the site and its structures.
Other calamities have damaged the site, including a 2013 flood, a large tree that fell atop a church on the property, and a series of sewage backups at a museum structure, which has a sinking foundation. The museum also has seen two break-ins in recent years.

– Cathleen Van Winkle, president of the foundation that owns the Mayhew Cabin complex


The recent study indicated that the underground tunnel — a “cave” that a Mayhew family member has said was used to store potatoes, not by escaping slaves — was deemed unstable and in need of replacement.
Replacement was also recommended for the museum, which the engineers estimated would cost $100,000 to demolish and $3 million for a new museum.
Also recommended to be demolished and replaced were a railroad depot, a church and a picnic shelter on the property, which are all owned by the Foundation.
Due to a lack of funds, the Foundation has been unable to make any repairs since the site was closed in 2019. In 2023, the Foundation signed a letter of intent to donate the site to the Game and Parks Commission, which led to the site assessment.
Fans have other ideas
Some fans of the Mayhew Cabin site have other ideas. That includes a Peru State professor, Sara Crook, who does historical portrayals of the older sister of John Kagi, an abolitionist who brought escaped slaves to the cabin and was a friend of John Brown.
Crook, who is on the state Hall of Fame Commission, said that in her opinion, only the Mayhew Cabin needs to be saved and preserved, which would reduce the cost of restoring the site substantially.
In an email to the Examiner, Jim Swenson, the assistant director of the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, said that after meeting with the Mayhew Foundation board this week “there may be revisions in scope to reduce the cost.”
Crook also said that the Nebraska State Historical Society would be a more appropriate agency to lead the restoration, rather than the Game and Parks Commission.
Whether the cabin should remain where it is, in a flood-prone location, or moved elsewhere in Nebraska City or Lincoln or another community, is another question.
The site assessment recommended that the cabin — which was moved from its original site due to the widening of an adjacent highway — be relocated onto a more stable foundation.



Spotlight shifts to Mayhews, John Kagi
John Brown’s Cave has served as a tourist attraction since the 1930s. But over the years, the focus of the site has shifted from the cave and any connection to the famed abolitionist John Brown, to the role of the Mayhew family and of one of its relatives, John Kagi.
Kagi, who lived several months at the Mayhew Cabin, helped slaves escape northward from nearby slave states, like Missouri, to reach freedom. He was second in command to Brown during the failed raid on Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia, on Oct. 17, 1859. Kagi was killed during the raid.
Four years earlier, Kagi had lived with his sister Barbara Mayhew and her husband, Allen, at a Mayhew Cabin.
A 2002 article for the Nebraska State Historical Society’s magazine stated that Kagi had once brought 14 escaped slaves to the Nebraska City cabin, who, after eating breakfast, continued on foot northward.
A letter from Edward Mayhew, Barbara and Allen’s son, refuted earlier newspaper accounts that Brown himself had guided escaped slaves to freedom through a tunnel underneath the Mayhew cabin. The son said the cave was dug for storing potatoes, that slaves never used it and that John Brown never visited it.
The cabin was moved to its current location in 1937 to accommodate the construction of Highway 2, which has since been relocated to the south edge of Nebraska City. The tunnel beneath the cabin was dug in hopes of attracting tourists, according to a 2014 article evaluating sites on the Underground Railroad.

More than 1.7 million Michiganders live with a mental illness, yet fewer than two-thirds are getting treatment. The result is felt across emergency rooms, homeless shelters, courtrooms, and schools—places never designed to provide long-term care but now functioning as last resort.
Behind this growing crisis is a system struggling to meet the demand. Providers are overwhelmed. Psychologists, social workers, case managers, and peer specialists are stretched thin and forced to focus on administrative paperwork rather than patient care. Michiganders in all 83 counties are trying to get the care they need in their communities.
Michigan’s behavioral health system is built on a structure it can no longer support. It is fragmented, hard to navigate, and often unfair to the organizations trying to keep it together.
As the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) considers rebidding its behavioral health contracts, the state has a rare opportunity to rebuild a system that is more responsive, accountable, and equitable for everyone.
When people get into the community mental health system, they succeed.
Michigan’s community-based behavioral health system was created to keep people out of institutions and help them thrive in their communities. And when it works, it works well.
But getting into the system—and staying connected to care—isn’t easy.
One of the biggest hurdles is how services are managed and paid for. Michigan’s system is built around 10 regional Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans (PIHPs), which manage Medicaid behavioral health funding. In some regions, those PIHPs are also Community Mental Health Service Programs (CMHSPs), the entities that provide or contract services in the community. Services they can’t offer are given to community-based service providers.
The result is a model in which a single organization often acts as both the funder and the provider of care. This creates deep conflicts of interest, with serious consequences.
When your funder is your competitor, the playing field isn’t level.
Many safety net providers across the state, including those providing mental health services and substance use disorder (SUD) services, are nonprofits and are disadvantaged by the current system of care when their funder is also their competitor. There needs to be a way to create fair competition.
Under the current system, these safety net providers face lower reimbursement rates, lose staff to higher-paying public entities, and often compete for funding from the agencies delivering services themselves.
There’s also the issue of fairness. When the same entity sets the rules, delivers care, and controls the money, there’s little incentive for transparency—or accountability. Rate structures may favor internal programs. Disputes can go unresolved. And smaller, independent providers often operate without the same access to data or decision-making power.
This imbalance doesn’t just hurt organizations—it directly affects access to care. Gaps in funding and staffing mean more waitlists, fewer options, and higher barriers for people trying to get help. In a crisis, those delays can mean the difference between recovery and relapse, between housing and homelessness, or between safety and incarceration.
Administrative barriers drain time and resources.
 Despite shared goals to improve outcomes and ensure transparency, the current model often leads to fragmentation and inefficiencies. Each PIHP can impose its compliance systems, audits, and data reporting protocols. For organizations working across regions, this leads to duplication of effort and a mounting administrative load that does little to improve care quality.
Even within the same state contract framework, the interpretation and application of rules vary widely. Providers suggest aligning administrative requirements with the state’s master contract and streamlining oversight functions could significantly reduce the burden and help stabilize an already stretched workforce.
There is a path forward.
Michigan’s 2026 budget includes funding to expand Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs), higher Medicaid reimbursement rates, and workforce development. But without structural reform, those investments will fall short.
CCBHCs offer a promising model—comprehensive, no-wrong-door care that meets people where they are. However, to fulfill their promise, Michigan must ensure these clinics are accessible to experienced nonprofit providers and protected from the same funding conflicts already plaguing the system.
What’s needed now is clarity and separation of roles. Funders should not be service providers. Oversight should be independent. Every provider—regardless of affiliation—should have a fair shot at delivering care and competing for talent and services.
Why it matters.
Behavioral health reform isn’t just about systems—it’s about outcomes. When people don’t get the care they need, communities absorb the cost. Hospitals fill up. Jails become de facto treatment centers. Families lose hope. And too many Michiganders end up unhoused, unemployed, or worse.
But when the system works—when it’s fair, transparent, and community-based—it saves lives, keeps people out of crisis, and supports recovery, stability, and dignity.
The opportunity before Michigan is not just about fixing what’s broken. It’s about building a system that works for the future—one where every person, regardless of diagnosis or zip code, can access the behavioral health care they need to live a full life.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/behavioral-therapy-mental-health-GettyImages-1140393669-1-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

A larger-than-expected crowd went to the Ohio capitol on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump and the many controversial actions of his young administration. It was one of at least 47 across Ohio and more than 700 across the United States.
Columbus police said that the crowd appeared to approach 3,000. That was smaller than the roughly 5,000 who turned out on April 5, when millions protested nationwide. But with the Easter holiday and fewer sponsoring organizations, smaller crowds were expected on Saturday.
Large crowds also gathered in Cincinnati, rainy Akron, and other cities across the Buckeye State. They were sponsored by the group 50501.

Organizers chose April 19 to protest in part for its symbolic value. On that day in 1775, the first battles of the Revolutionary War were fought in Lexington and Concord, Mass.
Playing off of that theme, many carried signs Saturday denouncing Trump and accusing him of trying to be a king. 
Trump has been raising such concerns in several ways. They include by trying to gut the independent federal antitrust watchdog, and by empowering the world’s richest man to fire tens of thousands from the Social Security and Veterans administrations, the National Park Service, and numerous other agencies.
But perhaps more concerning is that his administration has been invoking a law not used in 80 years, accusing some migrants of membership in gangs, and deporting them to a notorious Salvadorean prison. He has defied court orders — including one to bring back a man whom the administration admitted was deported in error.
The U.S. Supreme Court early Saturday morning ordered a temporary halt to the deportations. So the stage seems to be setting for a confrontation between the judiciary — which has no army to enforce its orders — and an executive who sometimes has been disinclined to heed them.
That was on the minds of many at the Columbus protest. Chuck Ardo of Lancaster said that his family migrated to the United States from Slovakia when he was a child, and that his parents survived the Holocaust.
“Fascism is something I’ve always been aware of,” he said. “Due process and the Constitution, that’s what matters. I don’t know if these people are deportable or not. But they all deserve due process and that’s what’s missing here. They’ve labeled them ‘terrorists,’ but on what grounds? What proof have they shown?”
Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., last week visited the wrongly deported man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, at the Salvadorean prison. He said that if Trump has evidence that Abrego Garcia is in a gang, he needs to present it court — not just claim it on social media.
For Ardo, Trump’s actions have a disturbing historical echo.
“Donald Trump is doing many of the things Hitler did as he rose to power,” he said. “Hitler attacked the courts. He attacked the universities. I’m not accusing anybody of being a Nazi here, but while history doesn’t repeat itself, it rhymes.”
Debbie Wood of Powell said the president has been acting like a king in other ways as well.
“Trump did not win in a landslide,” she said. “More people voted for someone else than for him. He does not have a mandate. Even the people who voted for him did not vote to ruin the VA. They didn’t vote to fire people who do cancer research. They didn’t vote to take food out of the mouths of hungry people. Ruining the national parks. Nobody voted for any of that stuff.”
She added, “People are getting more and more angry. He’s sending people away to concentration camps without due process. Ignoring court orders. Who does that? We would be in jail.”

Gary Bennett of St. Clairsville stood at the base of a monument to former President William McKinley holding a sign that mocked Trump and slammed him for gutting the staff at the National Park Service. He said that’s just one problem among many he has with the new administration.
“We could make signs every day of the week and there would still be signs to make,” he said. “Me and my wife just retired, and we don’t want him to take away our Social Security. That’s just one thing.”
Chris Glass of Delaware said she’s also upset about many things Trump is doing, and that protesting helps.
“There is something very nice about the camaraderie,” she said. “It’s a sense that people do care. I think we represent the country better than our current government does.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250419_124710-1024x626.jpg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

Getty Images.A recent report from an Ohio-based health institute emphasizes the importance of prevention and testing after decades of study and treatment on HIV, calling it a “pressing public health concern in the United States” as the Trump administration proposes eliminating research and programs on the disease.
According to the Equitas Health Institute’s study on HIV research, the pressing public health concern is being faced by young adults the most, with the age group ranging from the early teens to early 30s accounting for 58% of the estimated 32,100 new HIV diagnoses in 2021.
The importance of sex education and awareness of HIV status is always important, researchers said, but in the current political climate, “HIV is often caught in the crossfire of health care debates and shifting policies.”
“Access to funding resources, education and prevention programs is inconsistent and, in many areas, highly inadequate,” the study found. “Navigating sexual health is about building resilience and showing young adults that they are not defined by a diagnosis, the politics surrounding sexual health, or the uncertainty of living with HIV.”
The study comes as the Trump Administration sets its sights on HIV research as part of vast funding cuts within the federal government. Funding is already gone for HIV-related research grants within the National Institutes of Health, including research at U.S. universities and international efforts.
Of the terminated grants, two went to the Ohio State University for studies on “the influence of developmental assets on intersectional stigma and HIV prevention in Black (men who have sex with men)” and a study on “client and clinician priorities” regarding two HIV prevention medications.
Cuts to research and funding
But more chops may be coming as the Trump administration plans to restructure the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services could include elimination of federal HIV prevention and research programs. Those cuts could include the “Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America” initiative, a government move that aimed to reduce new HIV infections by 90% by 2030.
The initiative was started under the previous Trump administration, but the CDC web page on the initiative now mentions a court order requiring the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to restore the website as of Feb. 14. Text at the top of the page then claims any information on the page “promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.”
“The Trump Administration rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children,” the page now states, adding that it “does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this department rejects it.”
HIV is a disease that attacks the immune system by going after white blood cells, which can develop into the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. Symptoms don’t always present with HIV, so testing is necessary to identify it, according to Equitas Health.
AIDS wasn’t formally identified in the U.S. until the 1980s, and even then, researchers said governmental response was “minimal,” and then-President Ronald Reagan wouldn’t use the term until 1985.
Community response came in the form of a grassroots effort called ACT UP in 1987, and in 1990, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program was established for low-income individuals living with HIV, an organization that exists to this day, currently housed under the U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration. The Ohio Department of Health still houses a Ryan White Part B Program for HIV-related services, funded through federal grants, according to the state.
The first treatment method for AIDS was approved in 1996, and cases of the disease began decreasing after the first antiretroviral therapy was released, addressing a disease that was then the leading cause of death for all American adults ages 25-44.
Though the HIV/AIDS epidemic was connected to gay men from the moment it was officially identified, data from the early 1990s showed the disease was present in other groups, including members of various genders, sexualities, races, socio-economic levels and health statuses, according to Equitas Health.
Prevention efforts were started at the local and state public health level, as well as in partnerships between the CDC and national minority organizations.
Testing is an “essential component of HIV prevention, treatment and care,” according to the report, and a lack of awareness about the illness “contributes to the spread of HIV, as individuals who are unaware of their infection statues are more likely to engage in behaviors that can transmit the virus to others.”
“Barriers to testing include stigma, lack of awareness and limited access to testing services,” the report stated. “Stigma may occur within the patient, their community or health care providers.”
Ohio law effective since 2012 requires the Ohio Department of Health to develop and administer AIDS and HIV-related programs, including a system to determine the number of cases, development of counseling and testing programs, risk reduction/education programs to at-risk groups and pilot programs for long-term care.
A treatment now exists to prevent HIV transmission, and the FDA approved the first HIV home-testing kit in 2012, with the CDC funding nearly 2 million tests per year, according to 2021 data.
“Despite medications improving lives and reducing transmission, there is still no cure for the disease,” researchers at Equitas Health stated. “There are two objectives in HIV research: sustained viral suppression without medication and total eradication of the virus.”
Even with improved treatment and testing, HIV rates began to increase during the 2010s, researchers stated, pointing to young adults as a disproportionately affected group.
Sex education
A lack of required sex education also has impacts, according to the report. Sex education in Ohio has been seen as lacking in many ways, with advocates for sex education increasing the push for requirements after Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the 1970s was overturned, and the discussion of reproductive rights and sexual health was put to individual states.
Ohio law regarding education curricula including sex education has been changed numerous times over the years, with the most recent change enacted in October 2024. That change came via the Republican-led Senate Bill 168, which, among other education-related changes, amended references in Ohio law from “venereal disease” education to “sexually transmitted infection” education.
A bill passed last year was harshly criticized for forcing school districts to notify parents if a child identifies as LGBTQ+ and allowing parents to opt out of “sexuality content.” During the committee process in the Senate, however, an amendment was added to the bill to specify that content the bill deemed objectionable was not targeting STI education.
While STI education is in Ohio law, advocates for more sexual education say abstinence-focused instruction and the other provisions currently in law aren’t enough.
The non-profit Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States said Ohio’s sex education curriculum”is not required to be comprehensive, medically accurate or include instruction on topics such as consent, sexual orientation or gender identity, or contraceptive options.”
“This leaves local school districts to decide what sex education curriculum they provide,” the group stated.
The research from Equitas Health recognized the resilience of young adults, despite being a population that is understudied among HIV study.
“Young adults with marginalized identities require diverse and targeted approaches within HIV care,” the report concluded. “However, adults within sexual, gender and racial minority groups are often excluded from HIV discourse. The unique needs of young adults must be considered.”

(Photo courtesy of Maria Wilkinson)In 2015, just four months after graduating from Concord High, I arrived in California to begin a year of service to my country. Not through the military or college, but through AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) — a program that would change my life in ways I never expected.
On our first day, we were told: “You’re not here to help others — you’re here for yourselves.” At first, that felt selfish. But over the next 10 months, I came to understand what that meant. Yes, we were serving others — but through that service, we were also learning, growing, and transforming ourselves.
I was assigned to the West Coast campus and placed on a team with 11 other young people from all across the country. We lived together, cooked together, worked out together — and most importantly, we served together.
In Montana, we helped build homes with Habitat for Humanity. In California, we spent months clearing brush to reduce wildfire risk. In Utah, we served as camp counselors for individuals with disabilities. On weekends, we volunteered in local communities — cooking Sunday breakfasts at churches, planting trees to prevent erosion, cleaning up community gardens.
We lived on less than $200 a month. We didn’t join AmeriCorps for the money — we joined because we wanted to be part of something bigger than ourselves. I wasn’t ready for college right out of high school. I needed to see more of the world first. AmeriCorps NCCC gave me that chance.
This program taught me what it really means to serve my country — not just through military service or government jobs, but through compassion, manual labor, teamwork, and meeting people where they are.
That’s why it’s devastating to see AmeriCorps NCCC being defunded and dismantled. Doing so doesn’t just take away a year of service — it takes away a path of purpose, growth, and opportunity for thousands of young Americans.
Cutting AmeriCorps NCCC isn’t a budgetary win. It’s a national loss.
To the young people who won’t be able to finish their year of service, and to those who will never get the chance to start: I’m sorry. You deserve this opportunity. And our country needs programs like this more than ever.
AmeriCorps Mission Statement:
I will get things done for America — to make our people safer, smarter, and healthier.
I will bring Americans together to strengthen our communities.
Faced with apathy, I will take action.
Faced with conflict, I will seek common ground.
Faced with adversity, I will persevere.
I will carry this commitment with me this year and beyond.

A Republican Ohio Senator wants higher education appropriations to be tied to compliance to Senate Bill 1, the new higher education law banning diversity efforts and regulating classroom discussion that will take effect this summer. 
“We’re not kidding around,” State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said Thursday during a City Club of Cleveland forum. “This law will not be ignored. It will be welcomed. … We’re going to make sure that all the work we’ve done doesn’t go to waste because it’s being ignored. We’re going to make sure it happens and nothing speaks like money.”

The new law will ban diversity efforts, prohibit faculty strikes, regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things.  
Cirino introduced S.B. 1 earlier this year which quickly passed the Ohio Senate and House. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed S.B. 1 into law at the end of March and it will take effect on June 27. Members of the Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association are collecting signatures in the hopes of trying to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot. 
“Opponents of Senate Bill 1 have said it will destroy higher education in Ohio,” Cirino said. “Well, the governor signed the bill a couple of weeks ago, and to my knowledge, higher education is still pretty well intact in the state of Ohio.” 
More than 1,500 people testified against S.B. 1 — including many college students, faculty and staff who said they would leave Ohio if this bill became law. 
“Certainly for some of them that would be OK,” Cirino said. “Some of the ones who came to testify, I will help them pack.” 
The Ohio Capital Journal recently talked to a Cleveland State University student who is transferring to a New York university after spring semester because of the new law. 
Cirino talked about the need for a higher education law like this given “the predominance of left-leaning faculty, which has skewed things on our campuses.”
“Without the very best educational system, we will not have a properly trained workforce, and without a trained workforce, we will not have a robust economy here in Ohio,” Cirino said. “If our universities and community colleges are fixated on DEI, separating students by race and hiring professors who follow a monolithic liberal agenda, we are not preparing our students to learn how to analyze research and come to their own conclusions.”
Cirino said the new law creates more opportunities for speech, reiterated that it’s not anti-union and makes education available to everyone. 
“Some of our universities have been spending tens of millions of dollars on infrastructure for DEI which has become institutional discrimination,” he said. “You can’t solve discrimination by having other discrimination. The best way to eliminate discrimination is to eliminate discrimination.”
The new law also bans faculty strikes, something Cirino said is a student rights issue, not a labor issue. 
“When a student signs up for a semester and pays for it, that’s a contract between them and the university,” he said. “Nothing should interrupt that. Nothing at all.”
Even though the law only applies to Ohio’s public universities and community colleges, private colleges would be required to comply with parts of S.B.1 if they want to continue to participate in the Governor’s Merit Scholarship, according to language from the House’s version of the budget. The budget is now in the hands of the Senate where Cirino is the chair of the Senate Finance Committee.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks, and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel, and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes, and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care, and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia, and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology, and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Yet there U.S. Rep. Ron Estes stood in a picture from the U.S. embassy in El Salvador, lending tacit approval to a mob that has all but condemned Maryland father Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to death, at the behest of a would-be tyrant in Washington, D.C.
The facts of the case are simple and damning. Garcia was sent to a gulag without due proxies of law, and President Donald Trump’s administration has defied a 9-0 Supreme Court order in keeping him there. The White House has attempted to smear the man in absentia, with all the crudeness of those who used to accuse Black boys of taking liberties with white women.
This, apparently, is fine and dandy with Estes.

On Tuesday, Republican Reps. Jason Smith of Missouri and Riley Moore of West Virginia posed proudly in pictures from CECOT — the notorious El Salvadoran mega-prison where the United States has shipped hundreds without due process. Estes did not post such pictures. However, the 4th District congressman stood in a lineup with Smith and Moore in an image posted Wednesday by the embassy, along with Reps. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, Mike Kennedy of Utah, Carol Miller of West Virginia and Claudia Tenney of New York.
Credit must go at this point to independent journalist and Kansas Reflector friend Marisa Kabas, who first reported about the Republicans’ visit. She reached out to the lawmakers for comment, hearing back only from Hearn’s office: “We cannot confirm or comment on the Congressman’s location for security purposes.” Tenney subsequently tweeted that she had also toured CECOT.
I reached out via email to Estes spokesman Roman Rodriguez to ask whether the representative had gone to the prison or was concerned about Garcia’s welfare. He did not respond.

Prison pipeline
We cannot close our eyes to the brutal reality of CECOT or El Salvador’s government.
According to Ana Piquer, Americas director at Amnesty International: “El Salvador is implementing a systematic state policy of massive and arbitrary deprivation of liberty. After three years, more than 85,000 individuals remain behind bars without sufficient admissible evidence, the victims of a judicial system now transformed into a tool for collective punishment and widespread repression. Attempts to export this policy to the situation of Venezuelan migrants and refugees in the United States highlights the lack of protection and the risk that hundreds of thousands of people now face of having their human rights violated by not one, not two, but three different states.”
You can’t confuse this gulag with any kind of American facility. In our country, attorneys and law enforcement must still abide by the law. Not in El Salvador. Conditions there go beyond mere cruelty.
Officials have decided to create a concentration camp, one in which prisoners are denied due process and tortured.
In the words of Human Rights Watch: “People held in CECOT, as well as in other prisons in El Salvador, are denied communication with their relatives and lawyers, and only appear before courts in online hearings, often in groups of several hundred detainees at the same time. The Salvadoran government has described people held in CECOT as ‘terrorists,’ and has said that they ‘will never leave.’ Human Rights Watch is not aware of any detainees who have been released from that prison.”
Juanita Goebertus Estrada, director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, said that while the mega-prison was built more recently than other facilities in the country, he understands that conditions are similar to other prisons in the country.
“This includes cases of torture, ill-treatment, incommunicado detention, severe violations of due process and inhumane conditions, such as lack of access to adequate healthcare and food,” he said.
No one should go to such a facility. Not even the most notorious criminals, of any country or any citizenship status. No one.

Trump temper tantrum
Regardless of pushback from courts at every level, President Donald Trump has persisted in his quest to send immigrants out of this country and to the most brutal and dehumanizing conditions.
No matter their ideology or party, our elected officials must step up and speak out against such authoritarian violence. Estes, during his visit to El Salvador, had every opportunity to do so. He could have joined Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen in meeting with Garcia and urging his immediate release from detention. He could have spoken up for the rule of law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as codified by the United Nations.
Instead, he posed for the picture and made no public comment. He lent his silent assent to a governmental lynching.
Garcia may have been a gang member. He may have beaten his wife. He may have leaked the COVID-19 virus from a lab and caused Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis to bomb at the box office. Any or all of these stories may be true. But he has been convicted of none of them. If the Trump administration actually believes such accusations against Garcia, bring him back and criminally charge him.
Due process of law means due process for everyone, citizens and noncitizens alike. Respect for the rule of law means respecting all court decisions, even those with which you disagree. Without following these precepts, our democratic society crumbles. You support the ruthless mob, willing to hang a man on mere suspicion.
Estes might be OK with that. On his website, he touts support for a bill that would strip power from judges. The same figures tasked with defending the rights of everyone.
Perhaps he has decided to declare fealty to a king rather than support a mere president.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Nebraska’s 13 private colleges and universities might do well to keep an eye on Harvard University’s recent resounding “no” to the president who wants the feds to have a say in the school’s inner workings, including teaching and hiring. 
Harvard’s hard pass meant the federal government froze $2.2 billion earmarked for the nation’s most recognizable university, primarily for scientific and medical research including work in artificial intelligence, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s — areas in which Harvard is recognized as a leader. As of this writing, the president is also threatening to yank the school’s tax exempt status, something he can’t do unilaterally.
What the White House wants is essentially a measure of control at Harvard. It has dressed that demand as a worthy cause: the elimination of antisemitism on campus. In a letter to the Cambridge university, the government accused Harvard of not having the correct “intellectual and civil rights conditions” to allow further federal funds to make their way to the famed campus. 
The letter also demanded that the college name names by reporting to the feds students “who are ‘hostile’ to American values” and require — without explanation — academic departments to be something called “viewpoint diverse” and hire government-approved auditors to see if any programs, policies or departments “fuel antisemitic harassment.”
Harvard stands firm
Whew! And that was only part of the ultimatum. Finding the directives out of line with the mission of the university, Harvard stood firm. The university’s president said, “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach. … The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
Most of Harvard’s massive endowment is earmarked for specific projects. Even so perhaps more than any other private school in the nation, it is financially equipped to meet the challenge of such defunding. Surely, a Creighton or a Midland or a Concordia would have to meet such pressure in another way.
Harvard is one of nearly 60 colleges and universities under scrutiny by the federal government for practices the government alleges might contribute to anti-semitism. Efforts to curb that distemper are smart and justified when and where they are needed. Indeed, some of the five dozen colleges and universities, including Harvard, have made changes toward protecting Jewish students who feel threatened on campus. 
While none of Nebraska’s private colleges and universities made the list, the University of Nebraska at Omaha was notified by the Trump administration last month that it was under investigation for “race exclusionary practices” having to do with the awarding of scholarships to graduate students. UNO had closed its DEI office in February. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln closed its DEI office in August 2024. Even so, a bill in the Nebraska Legislature to outlaw any office of diversity, equity and inclusion on any public college campus in the state hasn’t gained much traction to date.
Part of broader battle
The battle for the soul of post-secondary education, however, is old news. Many on the right see colleges as breeding grounds for what they see as the scourge of “woke” culture, a pedagogical petri dish growing an array of evil anagrams from DEI to CRT to ESG. Campus protests over Gaza since late 2023 have stoked these culture war fires. Two years earlier, eventual vice-president J.D. Vance famously said, “the universities are the enemy.”  
I spent four years as a member of the adjunct faculty and part of the academic support staff at Hastings College, a small private institution in south-central Nebraska. “HC” is a beautiful campus, not unlike a New England setting, nestled in a neighborhood just north and east of downtown Hastings. 
Hastings College is obviously not Harvard, nor is it a big public system such as the University of Nebraska. The task there, however, was similar: train young minds to think critically, research thoroughly and act decisively on the outcome of each. I’m also happy to say that I saw diversity, equity and inclusion — intentional and otherwise — fostered and celebrated. 
The mission of a college is a goal, not always the exact outcome. And individual college experiences don’t always live up to expectations. But when campuses are diverse, vibrant and vital places, when they challenge students and faculty to be the best versions of themselves, when they get it right, when the lights brighten, the research adds up and the solutions solve problems, the rest of the world is better for it … whether it’s Harvard University or Hastings College. 
Hardly enemies of the American people and no place for the feds to interfere.

Photo submitted by Chattahoochee Riverkeeper. Photo submitted by Chattahoochee RiverkeeperRoutine water sampling conducted by the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper as part of a federal partnership revealed alarming levels of bacteria discharged into the river by Fulton County’s largest wastewater treatment plant in 2023.
The Georgia Environmental Protection Division issued several violations and a $300,000 fine against the city of Atlanta for maintenance problems causing numerous illegal discharges of pollution at the RM Clayton Water Reclamation Facility in northwest Atlanta.
Chattahoochee Riverkeeper’s Chris Manganiello considers the Fulton County pollution drama as a reason to sound the alarm over the now-uncertain future of the U.S. Geological Survey’s South Atlantic Water Science Center in Norcross.
The center’s lease recently appeared on the Elon Musk-led U.S. Department of Government Efficiency’s list for possible terminations by the end of 2025, but it’s still unclear what that means for the staff and the program’s mission.
The U.S. General Services Administration, which manages federal property, did not respond to the Recorder’s emailed questions about the terms of the lease and the fate of the staff.
Since the early 2000s, the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper and the federal agency have collaborated on the BacteriALERT program that provides live updates to the public of the amount of E. coli contamination in a river that is a source of drinking water for millions of Georgians.
“Eventually after working with Fulton County, they came to an agreement with us that their plant was not functioning,” Manganiello said. “This is a situation where we’re pretty sure that we wouldn’t have identified this problem without the help of collection from USGS sources.”
Environmentalists and Democratic congressional members are expressing concerns about the planned lease termination, which the DOGE website says will save the federal government more than $1.3 million.
The center is one of more than a dozen government offices in Georgia that could have its leases ended under the Trump administration’s cuts.
Riverkeeper members said that water gauges are essential for maintaining compliance with state and federal permits. The data collected by these gauges tracks flood levels and the National Weather Service contracts with the center to collect rainfall data.
Manganiello, the Riverkeeper water policy director, said that the closure of the Norcross office and potential layoffs could at a minimum disrupt water monitoring for several months, which could lead to a significant decline in water quality and compliance.
“It’s one thing if we all knew they’re going to close this office because they moved into another location, that would be okay,” he said. “But because we don’t know what’s going to happen if the lease is terminated and these people don’t have a place to physically work, that means there’s going to be a disruption in the maintenance of the physical equipment and to data collection and data processing.”
Chattahoochee Riverkeeper Jason Ulseth said the center operates water flow gauges essential for monitoring everything from bacteria to water flooding levels impacting water management in Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
“This science center is critical for many reasons, including the fact that they run all of the flow gauges for Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina,” Ulseth said. “These flow gauges tell us how much water is in any part of the river throughout the system and is essential to municipal water to decision makers, dam operators, (utility) power operators and fishermen.”
The government water monitoring benefits the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, which draws 3.5 million annual visitors.
The scientific water surveying covers a 48-mile stretch between the Buford Dam and Atlanta. The employees also track water levels, flooding and dam releases at the Buford Dam.
“They’re fishing, they’re tubing, they’re kayaking,” Ulseth said. “So the health of the river and the amount of pathogens that are in the river are very important to the people that are going there. With the bacteria alert program, we are able to actually predict the current levels of E. coli and give public health advisories in real time, which is a one-of-a-kind program in the entire country.”
Atlanta Democratic U.S. Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock expressed their concerns about potential layoffs in a letter to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.
The relocation plans remain unclear despite the office lease set to terminate in a few months, the senators wrote Tuesday.
“Staff at the (center) perform water quality testing to ensure the safety of drinking water and maintain water gauges across Georgia, including Lake Sidney Lanier and on the Chattahoochee River, which supplies most of metro Atlanta’s drinking water,” Ossoff and Warnock wrote. “Local officials in metro Atlanta rely on gauges at Lake Lanier to ensure enough water is drawn from the lake to provide water to millions of Georgians every day. These gauges also inform water flows for Georgia’s agriculture industry, nuclear reactors across the state, and Department of Defense installations, among others.”
The potential ramifications of staff layoffs at the Norcross science center is also being watched closely by Suwannee Riverkeeper John Quarterman in south Georgia.
He said his organization relies on the data to predict the risk of flooding in areas like the Skipper Bridge on the Withlacoochee River north of Valdosta.
“It will be a problem for flood preparedness if (flood mapping) goes away, or if either of those gauges does,” Quarterman said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)The environment in Pierre today is “more strident” than it was when David Owen began lobbying South Dakota lawmakers in 1998. Much has changed since then, Owen said, but that’s been the biggest shift.
Owen said Pierre’s deeply divided political environment, particularly among Republicans, is one where policy debates turn personal. He describes it as “a cancer in the system.”
“We used to have battles, take the vote, then go on and see each other at dinner. Those days are gone,” Owen said.  
Owen, 70, is retiring. He’s been president of the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce and Industry for nearly three decades, representing the state’s business interests in and out of the Capitol building. Before that, he worked for various Midwest chambers, including in Kansas and Montana.
Owen’s favorite part of the job has always been explaining the policymaking process, whether to state lawmakers or a boardroom of business leaders. He’s known for his sharp wit and policy knowledge, and has earned a reputation for occasionally breaking from the pack, especially when compromise or principle demanded it.
Ahead of his August exit from professional life, Owen sat down with South Dakota Searchlight to reflect on the art of lobbying, shifts in the Legislature, and what he sees as both the promise and peril of South Dakota politics. 
The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What made you interested in lobbying lawmakers?
I’ve always been interested in policy and politics. So I chose chambers that were involved in those kinds of issues. 
I was going to be a teacher. And what I like about what I’ve done is that I teach every day. 
I teach legislators the perspective of the chamber, which gets difficult at times. And I have to teach my board about the issues and pressures around us. Because my board’s full of really smart people, successful business people, who get frustrated with the ups and downs of politics. 
What is the biggest misconception about lobbying?
There’s this idea that the lobbyists always win.
We do have a tremendous advantage over citizens who come to the Legislature. It’s something I’m uneasy about. A bill has its hearing, and then they vote on the bill. That means a lot of citizens show up to say “Me too” and bring their concerns. They’ve got their piece of paper. They’ve never done this before. They’re really nervous. 
Meanwhile, the paid lobbyists, including the one you’re talking to, already have a pretty good idea what the vote’s going to be, because we’re there all day. We catch legislators in the hall. We don’t bribe anybody, but we’re familiar with them. 
South Dakota is increasingly becoming pay-to-play. They do fundraisers and we have a political action committee, but legislators are independent enough that we don’t have the kind of control over them that the public seems to think. Otherwise, nobody would lose.
This year, I was talking to some of the freshmen legislators who had never served before. 
I heard from like five of them, the same answer that was pretty different than in the past. I asked the question, “What prompted you to run?”
I heard more about concerns about “society” and how they thought they could help straighten out “the culture” by being in the Legislature. That’s a big task. That brings you to introducing things like school vouchers. That brings you to thinking the Ten Commandments in every classroom will help structure a moral code that will solve some of these social problems. 
And there are two influential lobbying groups up there, we’ve got more, but two groups in particular, that have added to the schism: the abortion people and the gun people. They don’t reach across any aisle. 
Other lobbying groups, like the chamber, are involved in all kinds of business. We’re involved in a whole bunch of issues. We’ve got lobbyists that are banging on each other on one issue, working together on another. The abortion people don’t do that. The NRA doesn’t do that. Instead, they send nasty postcards out. 
You used to be a Republican and later registered as an independent. Why?
What finally got me to pull the trigger on leaving the party was Merrick Garland’s proposed nomination to the Supreme Court, him not getting a hearing. Because Republicans were all saying you can’t do this when there’s a presidential election. 
And then, with unbelievable speed, closer to the election than that, Republicans got Amy Coney Barrett confirmed. And that was perfectly OK.
I just thought, “I don’t think we have any principles here.” 
I had run ballot campaigns 12, 13 times in two states by then. I get roughness. I get things getting ugly. But I’d like to think that we have some principles that we will stand by, and that just flushed it out of me. 
How has the business of lobbying itself changed?
My wife, Debra, who had been a lobbyist for the local chamber, was recently terminated. So, she spent some time as a contract lobbyist. 
And I now understand this whole game of contract lobbying better. So, I don’t know if I’m noticing changes or if I’m better educated.
In the world of contract lobbying, you have two camps. You have a camp where people are coming to certain lobbyists because they have a reputation of being very effective. And they charge a certain range, starting around $20,000 and it goes up. And then some people are just starting, kind of looking for clients.
It’s interesting to me the number of out-of-state groups, national groups, that have some agenda and are hiring these contract lobbyists. 
There’s more people with money forming groups, that in turn hire lobbyists to do, quite honestly, some fairly obscure crap. 
For example, another lobbyist reached out to me, and he had a group of trailer manufacturers who wanted to change one of our laws that requires trailer manufacturers to be affiliated with dealerships. 
So, this group in some orbit around some star finds him and says, “Can you help us change this?”
What are the right reasons to want to become a lobbyist? 
I’ve done what I’ve done for 45-plus years, 27 sessions, because I’m called to stand in this scene between business and government. 
I have profound respect for people who work for the public. I have great respect for my members and my board members. They’re two totally different systems. The balance sheet for legislators is how they vote and how they feel. That’s not a balance sheet for a business. 
My advice is to deal with facts. Listen. You can learn a lot. Be yourself, unless you’re an a—–. And know why you’re there, but respect and try to learn why other people are there. 
Every time we find something in the law that looks really stupid, I go back to when it passed. Every mistake we’ve made, we made on purpose. There was a reason that they convinced everybody in 1920 to vote for, I don’t know, tying up horses. 
I think the right reason is to solve problems. If you’re there sincerely, I think that’s the right thing. I don’t like the process when it sinks to the level of win-at-all-costs. I don’t like when it gets abusive – when they’re sending out postcards cards because they found out a lawmaker against their cause was picked up for a DUI when they were 18 years old. 
The wrong reason is just wanting to publicly humiliate those opposing your cause. That makes good people fearful of getting involved. And we’re going through some of that right now. 
The Republican Party is clearly divided into two sides. Right to Life, the NRA, the carbon pipeline people, those groups like to send out nasty cards. I think that’s a cancer in this system. If you’ve got to do that to win, I wish you’d find another occupation. Go be a bartender; leave the state.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EM8A2138-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-04-20 18:04:40.892626

The planned casino will sit near the border of Ada and Elmore counties in southwest Idaho. (Courtesy of the Shoshone-Pauite Tribes)The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes are developing their first resort and casino along Interstate 84 halfway between Boise and Mountain Home.
For decades, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes were the only tribe in Idaho without revenue. But the proposed resort and casino is estimated to generate tens of millions of dollars annually for Idaho’s economy and create thousands of regional jobs. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes also plan to share 5% of their net gaming revenues to support local schools and education programs.
Shoshone-Paiute Chairman Brian Mason said in a press release he dreams of a future where tribal members have the resources, education, health care and employment opportunities they need to sustain their families and preserve their culture.
“Today, we have no meaningful economic opportunities and our community is facing some heavy challenges because of it,” Mason said. “We want to solve our own problems and provide for our people. Tribal gaming will allow us to make these dreams into a reality.”
Shoshone-Paiute Tribes partner with Coeur d’Alene Tribe
The tribes are partnering with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, who has successfully run gaming operations in North Idaho for more than 30 years.
The Coeur d’Alene Tribe is providing a large upfront investment to help with the permitting and development process, and once it is built, the Tribe will enter into a management contract with the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes to help sustain the casino.
Coeur d’Alene Chairman Chief Allan said the tribe is honored to help its “brothers and sisters” secure the same benefits they have experienced from gaming.
“When I was growing up, many tribal members lived in poverty and could not find jobs,” Allan said in the press release. “Today, we have a state-of-the-art medical center, ample employment for tribal members and can financially support every tribal member who wants to earn a college degree. None of this would be possible without tribal gaming.”
Tribal gaming already contributes more than $1.4 billion of annual economic activity to the state, over $47 million in annual tax revenue and it sustains 12,500 Idaho jobs, according to a press release from the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes.
Tribe chairman says casino will provide resources to strengthen community
The Duck Valley Indian Reservation spans about 450 square miles in the southwest corner of Idaho, half split into parts of Nevada.
The tribes, according to the press release, face high rates of suicide and unemployment, and given its isolated location in the high desert, the Shoshone-Paiute community struggles to provide emergency services to its members.
Medical emergencies require lifesaving air transportation to Boise, which takes at least 45 minutes. A typical 911 call can take two hours to be answered because there are no tribal law enforcement officers exclusively dedicated to serving Duck Valley. Education funding is another major issue, and the school cannot attract enough certified teachers because of limited housing and other resources in the area, according to the press release
“The challenges we face daily are not insurmountable. We simply need resources to invest in long-term solutions for our people,” Mason said. “Gaming will give us the tools we need to strengthen our community, grow our infrastructure and provide more opportunities to our youth for generations to come.”
The planned location is where the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes used to live, hunt and care for the natural resources. The planned casino will include gaming machines, luxury hotel rooms, a spa, entertainment center and fine dining options.
To build this project on tribal land outside of the reservation, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes will follow the established process set out by the U.S. Department of the Interior and plan to submit their initial application later this year.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
On March 17, Beson was noticed walking on Village Road near Wayman Lane toward Hwy. 47 on the Lac du Flambeau Reservation.
Six days later, family members reported Beson missing on March 23.
Beson was last seen wearing red sweatpants, a black sleeveless shirt, and a gray sweatshirt. She is a Native American female, 5’7”, with a medium build, brown hair, and brown eyes. She has numerous tattoos on her neck, arms, and legs.
Ground searches began on March 24 and 25, and aerial and underwater drones covered the Bear River in the vicinity where Beson was last seen.
Over 360 surveillance cameras positioned near tribal properties and monitored by full-time police employees had recorded footage reviewed without any evidence of Beson.
Subsequent ground searches were hampered by the heavy snowfall, but since most of the snow has melted, ground searches have resumed.
Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Chief TJ Bill reports that on April 16, a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) plane provided aerial coverage, and he expects the DNR aircraft will again be available on Monday, April 21.
So far, Bill said, searchers have covered over 824 acres of forest.
“We are not saying she is out in the forest, but we need to make sure, and this is why we are doing the searches,” said Bill.
Recently police received reports that Beson was seen in the Wausau area. 
Beson’s mother, Winifred Ann Beson, “Winnie,” told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday, April 8, that her daughter might be with friends and she noted her daughter also likes to travel to other states, but in the past, Beson has always stayed in communication.
“Usually, she calls me if she needs money or is in trouble, but she hasn’t called me,” she said.
“We have been getting numerous reports Melissa is in the Wausau area,” said Bill, “but nothing has been substantiated. We have our officers travelling to Wausau and other areas.”  
Beson’s mother also said she is afraid Melissa might have been kidnapped by human traffickers. Native Americans have been targeted by human traffickers who prey on vulnerable populations where there is poverty and high drug use.
According to the Indian Law Resource Center, Native American women experience the highest rates of sexual assault of any group and are10 times more likely to experience domestic violence than white women. On some reservations, Native American women are murdered at a rate that is 10 times the national average. 
The missing and murdered Indigenous women plus relatives (MMIW/R) movement has strived to raise awareness of the plight of Indigenous people in North America. 
May 5 is Red Dress Day,  a national day of awareness for MMIW/R.
Wisconsin has a MMIW/R Task Force that is part of the Department of Justice, but Wisconsin doesn’t have a full time office as in Minnesota, which monitors  MMIW/R cases, assists families,  coordinates information for r law enforcement agencies and offers rewards for information.
Concerning the search for Beson, Bill said his office has one officer dedicated to the case who is also coordinating the searches with the help of the tribe’s emergency management office.
“Our two detectives are spending the majority of their time on the case, working social media search warrants for cellular telephones (Verizon), Facebook, Snap Chat and Google, working with these entities on past history locations,” said Bill. “If we’re not handling current cases/calls coming into the PD, we are working this case non-stop.”
Bill said the public may be invited to help in the search for Beson, but he is concerned that volunteers stay safe in the large forest where it is easy to become disoriented and lost.
“These areas are dangerous to the novice, and we cannot afford the volunteers to work the swamp and bog areas,” he said. “There is still some ground freeze, but areas of the swamps have thawed areas with deep mud. We got stuck at times [Thursday] in the swamps.  When safe and weather conditions are good, we will ask for volunteer support.”

(John Gray / Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill is pushing forward with her efforts to force Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson to drop a longtime policy that generally prohibits deputies from directly engaging in federal immigration enforcement within the city’s jail.
In legal filings, Murrill claims the policy — which the state characterizes as a so-called “sanctuary city” policy —  is in direct conflict with a newly passed state law that requires state and local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.
“The consent decree now sits fundamentally at odds with state law as applicable to immigration detainers,” Murrill said in court documents filed Friday (April 11).
A federal court will now determine whether to allow the state of Louisiana to join a 2011 federal suit that resulted in the policy and whether to throw out the policy altogether. A hearing has been set for April 30.

The state’s campaign against “sanctuary” policies comes as President Donald Trump is pushing local law enforcement agencies to join the federal government in his promised immigration crackdown. Since his inauguration, Trump has ordered the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to push for more partnerships between local law enforcement units and federal immigration agencies. A few have already signed up. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a longtime immigration hardliner and Trump ally, has worked with Republican lawmakers in the state to enact laws that encourage those collaborations.
As attorney general, Landry criticized a policy adopted by the New Orleans Police Department, under a long-running federal consent decree that blocks officers from enforcing immigration laws.
Neither Murrill’s office nor representatives for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to requests for comment.
In court filings, Murrill said Hutson “does not oppose the [state’s] intervention” in the case.” But a spokesperson for Hutson said that’s not exactly true.
“It’s more accurate that we take no position regarding the state intervention,” a Sheriff’s Office spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
While she has not taken a position for or against increased collaboration with ICE, in an interview with Fox 8 in December, Hutson noted that the jail’s resources were far too stretched to take on immigration enforcement.
“I’m a lawyer. I believe in following the law and court orders and we do that and so that’s what we’re gonna do, continue to follow the law, but I cannot do ICE’s work,” she said. “It’s too big of a load.”
Potential conflict
The sheriff’s policy stems from a 2013 federal court settlement in a civil rights case involving two New Orleans construction workers picked up on minor charges in 2009 and 2010.
Mario Cacho and Antonio Ocampo sued after they were allegedly illegally held in the city’s jail past the completion of their sentences. The two were held at the request of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency issues such “detainer” requests to local law enforcement agencies, asking them to hold onto arrestees who are suspected of immigration violations.
Local agencies are only supposed to honor the hold requests for 48 hours, after which they should let detainees free. But in 2009 and 2010, then-Sheriff Marlin Gusman detained Cacho and Ocampo for months, according to legal filings in their case against the office.
Ocampo and Cacho settled the case with the Sheriff’s Office in 2013, and Gusman agreed to adopt a new policy on immigration investigations. The resulting policy blocks the agency from investigating immigration violations and from detaining immigrants for ICE without a court order, except in certain cases where they are facing charges for a small number of serious violent crimes.
Attorneys for Cacho and Ocampo declined to speak with Verite News on the record. However, filings they submitted to the court last week opposing the state’s intervention in the case argue  that Murrill has “blatantly misrepresented the OPSO policy” by falsely claiming it forces the Sheriff’s Office to disregard all ICE detainers.
The sheriff’s office, like the NOPD, has been under a sweeping federal consent decree for more than a decade. But unlike the NOPD, the jail’s consent decree does not demand that deputies stay away from federal immigration enforcement, only that it release anyone subject to an immigration hold after two days. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, which is a party to both consent decrees, has not entered any filings since Murrill moved to bring the state into the Cacho and Ocampo case.
The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.
The OPSO policy remained in place for more than a decade without any controversy until last spring, when the Louisiana Legislature passed a bill — Act 314 — that blocks so-called “sanctuary” policies prohibiting state and local law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration agencies like ICE.
A sheriff’s office spokesperson spokesperson said the agency’s policy on ICE detainers is “governed” by the consent judgement in the case. She declined to comment further, as the state is currently challenging the policy, but affirmed that OPSO is “in full compliance with all applicable state laws and valid court orders related to ICE detainers.”

OKLAHOMA CITY — On the 30th anniversary of the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history, former President Bill Clinton said Americans must unite despite their differences, and that Oklahomans can help lead the way by serving as that role model for the rest of the nation.
Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.
Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The federal building housed agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995. Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

Where are the 92 percent?
That has been a persistent question since the presidential election, referring to the Black women who overwhelmingly organized and voted for Kamala Harris and then seemingly went dark after November 5. For many of them — who have largely rejected Donald Trump in his three campaigns for president — Harris’ loss felt like a betrayal, and another signal of disrespect from a democracy they have long worked hard to shape.
In the early days of the Trump administration, there have been feelings of anger, resolve, resignation and exhaustion among Black women and many other Americans frustrated with the president’s actions and the current political climate. Earlier this month, millions of protesters took to the streets in cities across the country to make their voices heard as Trump and ally Elon Musk have sought to dramatically remake the federal government, with consequences for real Americans.
The crowds were overwhelmingly White, not the typical makeup of other recent protest movements. Many of the Black women who have been among the leaders of such movements in the past decade, were noticeably — and intentionally — absent.
The Black women I talk to said they are being strategic, pragmatic and creative about what their resistance looks like now, preparing for a long fight ahead, and rejecting narratives that suggest their lack of visibility in this moment translates into inaction.
“People are paying more attention to what Black women are doing because of the impact we had in the election,” said Janai Nelson, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. “We pointed people in the right direction and they did not follow. We may be out of sight to some people, but we’re not checked out by any stretch. The crisis in America is certainly not out of our minds.”

Within weeks of the election, a meme began to circulate of a group of Black women sitting on the roof of a building, sipping their beverages and watching the country burn. The message: Black women would do nothing to help if the democracy they’d tried to save went up in flames.
This month, another image quickly gained traction during the “Hands Off” protests: a photograph of White marchers filing past a restaurant while Black people having brunch looked on, unbothered.
While the idea that Black women deserve rest is showing up in organic social media content, it’s also part of a campaign of misinformation, said Esosa Osa, founder of Onyx Impact, a nonprofit dedicated to researching Black online communities and fighting harmful information that targets Black voters. Emphasizing Black women talking about rest can discourage others in this key Democratic voting bloc from engaging civically.
“We are seeing bad actors trying to influence and suppress Black engagement in a really targeted and hostile way,” Osa said. “We should be cautious of any narrative that’s just, ‘Black women won’t turn out or won’t engage civically.’  Those are the types of narratives that folks working against Black power would want to uplift and amplify. Just because you don’t see your Black friend at a protest doesn’t mean we’re not working or being strategic.”
A lot of that strategy is happening behind the scenes, said Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined the term “intersectionality” and is a leading legal and civil rights scholar at UCLA and Columbia Law School. Crenshaw added that she has been skeptical of much of what she has seen online about Black women “resting.”
“I see a contrast between what’s being given to me on social media and what I’m seeing in the trenches,” Crenshaw said. “Are we tired? Yes. Are we heartbroken? Absolutely. Are we willing to roll over and let this … happen to us without hearing from us? I’m not seeing that, not in the circles I talk to. We don’t have an option not to fight.”

Nelson is among the Black women in the fight now, tapping into LDF’s long history of legal activism to make American democracy live up to its values. The group was among several civil rights organizations that filed a lawsuit earlier this month challenging Trump’s executive order calling for sweeping election changes.
Fatima Goss Graves, head of the National Women’s Law Center, said Black women are leading a lot of the strategy in this time, pointing to colleagues like Alexis McGill Johnson of Planned Parenthood; Melanie Campbell of the Black Women’s Roundtable, a network focused on the political and economic power of Black women; and SEIU President April Verrett. In February, Graves’ organization, a nonprofit advancing gender justice, filed a lawsuit challenging the president’s executive orders that take aim at diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
Asked about this month’s protests, Graves said she was not surprised to see White Americans — who make up the majority of the federal workforce — as the main participants.
“The folks who usually come to the streets first are the ones who see the direct impact,” Graves pointed out. “You haven’t always seen groups like that in the streets. I actually feel good about Black women’s leadership at this time. They understand the assignment fully.”
And there are others, focused on building community, messaging to counteract negative narratives and protesting with the power of their purses.

In the days leading up to Trump’s joint address to Congress, an idea was launched by Black activists, organizers and strategists including Angela Rye, Leah Daughtry and Tamika Mallory to provide an alternative to the president’s speech: a marathon of online programming aimed at educating and empowering Black Americans impacted by the new administration.
“State of the People” streamed for 24 hours and has since evolved into a 10-city tour starting April 26 in Atlanta that will include mutual aid, political education and town halls.
“We have not stopped; we are focused on not just surviving, but making sure we don’t lose ground on what we have achieved as a people in this country,” said Campbell, one of the organizers of the State of the People effort. “This is designed to build a larger, intergenerational movement, showing the potential of long-term, sustained organizing on the ground and online.”
During the Lenten season, Jamal Bryant, pastor of the Atlanta-based mega congregation New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, called for a 40-day boycott of Target after the retailer announced it would scale back its DEI initiatives. The campaign came in the wake of the Trump administration’s executive orders calling for an end to such programs, which the president referred to as “radical and wasteful.” Black consumers, many of them women, make up nearly 9 percent of Target shoppers. While the full impact of the boycott is unclear, the company’s stock price has dropped, foot traffic to stores has slowed significantly and net quarterly sales decreased as a result.
Last month, 100 women did a “buy-in” at a Washington, D.C.-area Costco to show support for the store’s commitment to DEI as part of an annual summit organized by the Black Women’s Roundtable. Campbell said the gathering also included a day on Capitol Hill hosted by Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blount Rochester — the nation’s two Black women senators — focused on federal budget priorities including Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.
Campbell said she has been part of different organizing efforts since the election and strategizing around protecting Black women’s leadership in this moment.
“Part of resistance is self-care,” Campbell said. “That does not have anything to do with not fighting, because we are. We said we were going to take some rest after November 5, but there was never any notion that we weren’t going to fight for our freedom in this country.”

Resistance to the Trump administration, including for Black women, is still taking shape. Campbell said she invites allies whom she felt left down by after the election to step up now. What is clear in this unprecedented moment is that it will not look like it has looked before.
Nelson said Black women’s roles now must be “very targeted, very pinpointed, because we are in a crisis unlike anything we have seen in modern history for Black women.”
“We’re taking it very seriously,” Nelson said. “To the extent people sense silence or reserve, those energies are being put to good use, just in a quiet way.”
When the moment is right, Graves predicted that Black women could also take their protest to the streets.
“That’s part of being a strategist,” she said. “We’ll know when it’s time for us to engage, and that’s OK.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-15-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-20 11:07:07.320676

Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-time, minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa, and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school, or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.”

Using health programs to encourage work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women, and disabled people.
Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school, or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The hunt for results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”
Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia, and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives, and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

They also marched along the sidewalks surrounding the Capitol, joining protests taking place in cities across the country.
The sound of church bells around downtown Lansing coincided with the start of the rally organized by Stand Against Extremism, or  SAGE, and promoted on social media, highlighting their call for freedom, equality, and justice, and their solidarity with nationwide protests organized by grassroots protest group 50501. 
Protests were also held across Michigan, including in Coldwater, Detroit, Flint, Grand Rapids, Livonia, Port Huron, and Portage.
As the first speakers took their positions at the entrance to the Capitol, hundreds more people approached the Capitol grounds with anti-Trump, anti-authoritarianism, and anti-Nazi signs and banners.
“This is the anniversary of the beginning of the American Revolution, and the democratic rights that were established during that revolution, and later confirmed and developed in the American Civil War, are now under attack,” said Tim Rivers, 65, a member of the socialist movement, during his speech.
“Hundreds have already been sent [to the El Salvodoran prison known as CECOT], and now Trump is threatening to take American citizens and deport them to El Salvador,” Rivers added.

On April 17, Juan Carlos López-Gómez, 20, was released after being arrested in Florida by federal immigration agents, despite being a natural-born American citizen. However, Lopez-Gomez was not the only U.S citizen who had an encounter with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Ramiro Martinez, a Mexican immigrant and U.S. citizen, was surrounded and detained by ICE in Michigan earlier this month.
Additionally, concerns about border patrol agents’ actions under Trump’s policies have been fueled by emails sent on April 11, around the country, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to immigrants who entered the country using CBP One, a mobile app developed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with an American citizen in Michigan also receiving those messages.
Around 12:30, the march began on W. Allegan Street and marched once around the Capitol, as protesters chanted against the current administration.

“The purpose of our march was basically to defend our democracy. We wanted people to come out and express their discomfort with what is going on a national scale,” said Daniel Pfau, 37, a volunteer with SAGE. “I hope that people see this event is by the people, for the people. We didn’t need a national organization in charge. We showed up, and we took care.”
After the march, a series of speakers took the microphone to express their concerns to the audience. Among the speakers were community members, social activists, and elected officials who primarily spoke out against the federal government’s targeting of immigrants across the country.
“They are trying to distract us. They want people divided. They want to bring out the worst impulses in many people’s hearts,” said State Rep. Jasper Martus (D-Flushing) during his speech. “We need to think about all those folks who are going to church tomorrow morning and saying they’re okay with deporting people who are here illegally. I’m a believer, but that’s not what I believe in.”
During the speeches, support was given for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident the Trump administration erroneously deported to his native El Salvador, which was echoed and chanted by the audience in favor of his release and return to the US.
Abrego Garcia was arrested March 12 as he drove his 5-year-old son home, and was informed by ICE agents that his status had changed, despite an order that determined it was more “likely than not that he would be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador” if he were returned there, according to court documents.
Although ICE accepted his deportation was due to an administrative error, and the Supreme Court of the United States later ordered his return, on April 14, U.S. President Trump and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele announced in the Oval Office that they would not release Abrego Garcia.
Toward the end of the demonstration, near the Capitol, on the side of North Capitol Avenue, a Trump supporter counter-protested, giving speeches and holding a sign that read “God, put Trump in.” This situation generated tense moments among the protesters, who approached to confront and argue with the lone counter-protestor. 
By the end of the day, no acts of violence or physical confrontations had been reported.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The Trump administration proposed a new rule Wednesday that would rescind widespread habitat protections for species protected under the Endangered Species Act, a landmark law enacted in 1973 to conserve the country’s imperiled animals and plants.
That would open the door for developments across the country to be approved even if they significantly disrupt critical habitat for species listed under the Endangered Species Act. The proposed rule, posted in the U.S. Federal Register by the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service, would “rescind the regulatory definition of ‘harm,’” which is defined as any significant habitat modification or degradation that actually kills or injures wildlife.
Environmental groups lambasted the proposal.
“There’s just no way to protect animals and plants from extinction without protecting the places they live, yet the Trump administration is opening the floodgates to immeasurable habitat destruction,” said Noah Greenwald, co-director of endangered species at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This administration’s greed and contempt for imperiled wildlife know no bounds, but most Americans know that we destroy the natural world at our own peril. Nobody voted to drive spotted owls, Florida panthers or grizzly bears to extinction.”
If approved, he said, the rule would mean endangered species would only be protected from actions that intentionally lead to the harm of a species. “It’s just foundational to how we’ve protected endangered species for the last 40-plus years, and they’re just completely upending that,” Greenwald said.










This administration’s greed and contempt for imperiled wildlife know no bounds.


–  Noah Greenwald, Center for Biological Diversity


Just the day before Wednesday’s proposed rule, the Trump administration put out a rescission notice to roll back a rule that put conservation on equal footing with extractive uses on the nation’s public lands. The two decisions, along with scores of others in recent months since President Trump took office, threaten species and the habitats they depend on across the country, experts and environmentalists say.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not respond to a request for comment.
 What does ‘harm’ mean? 

By law, the ESA prohibits the “take” of an endangered species, which includes actions “to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.” Historically, the “harm” part of this mandate encompasses “any activity that can modify a species’ habitat.”
This interpretation of “harm” has long been used by agencies to extend protections for endangered species to the land or ocean area that it relies on. For example, an oil or gas project may not be able to drill or be forced to modify operations in a certain area that provides habitat for an endangered animal, such as a dune sagebrush lizard. In many cases, the “harm” rule has not blocked projects altogether, but rather resulted in different designs that reduce impacts on endangered species.
In 1995, a group of landowners and timber interests in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast challenged the regulation’s interpretation in a push to log forests where endangered northern spotted owls and red-cockaded woodpeckers lived. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the broad definition of “harm” on the basis of the Chevron Doctrine, a principle that defers to federal agencies’ expertise for carrying out laws. Last year, however, Chevron was overturned, and the Trump administration has seized on that in the new proposed rule.
The new proposal would eliminate this “harm” definition—and the habitat protections that come with it, according to Dave Owen, an environmental law professor at the University of California, San Francisco.
“The shift here would be to say that just habitat modification that is detrimental to a species, even if the detriment is fairly direct, is not encompassed within the word ‘harm,’” Owen said. The majority of habitat protections related to the ESA fall under the “harm” interpretation, according to a 2012 study by Owen. Now, under the proposal, “the word ‘harm’ is essentially going to be read as an inconsequential nullity,” he said.
The Trump administration says that its proposal is more in line with the language in the ESA, arguing that the regulations surrounding the word “harm” should be defined as an “affirmative act directed immediately against a particular animal,” rather than one that could indirectly harm an endangered species’ population, according to the posting of the proposed rule in the Federal Register. However, research shows that habitat loss is a primary driver of extinction in the United States.
In the case of the spotted owl, nests must have a 70-acre circle of land around them protected, even on private lands used for timber. “With this change, they don’t have to do that anymore,” said Greenwald with the Center for Biological Diversity.
The Trump administration’s proposal is the latest in a series of deregulatory moves to undermine the ESA, which Republicans have long attacked for stifling economic development and interfering with states’ ability to manage wildlife. Rolling back its ability to protect species was outlined in Project 2025, the conservative roadmap published before the 2024 elections guiding much of the administration’s actions.
On Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency,” which outlined a process to enable fossil fuel projects to bypass the typical environmental reviews associated with approval, including those required by the Endangered Species Act. The order directed the heads of all agencies and the secretary of the Army to identify projects “that may be subject to emergency treatment” within 30 days. By mid-February, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers marked for review more than 600 permit applications for energy-related projects that could qualify for the fast-pass treatment, though environmental groups argue these efforts would disrupt crucial wetlands.
To support efforts for “unleashing energy dominance,” the secretary of the Department of Interior, Doug Burgum, issued several orders in February that aim to “suspend, revise, or rescind” several ESA regulations enacted during the Biden administration. This new proposal to rescind the harm definition could also pave the way for new energy projects, experts say.
The historic interpretation of the regulation served “as sort of a caution to people not to go down and knock down trees where red-cockaded woodpeckers were nesting. And if you change the definition, I think there’s the risk that people are going to go out and engage in that behavior in the real world,” said Andrew Mergen, the director of Harvard Law School’s Emmett Environmental Law and Policy Clinic. “The rule plays a really important role in preventing people from doing that sort of thing, and at the same time, it has hardly damaged the economy, or made economic progress impossible.”
The public will have 30 days to submit comments on the proposal. Environmental groups like Earthjustice have vowed to challenge the rule in court.
 A series of attacks on conservation

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the administration proposed rescinding the Public Lands Rule—a landmark achievement of the Biden administration that placed conservation on equal footing as extraction across the nation’s public lands following an extensive public comment period. Ninety  percent of comments received supported the rule. Another rule implemented last year that restricts oil and gas development across millions of acres of public lands in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was also rescinded.
“This is not policy—it’s a blatant giveaway to industry that threatens to dismantle decades of conservation progress, shut down public access, harm wildlife and accelerate the reckless sell-off of our natural resources,” said Alison Flint, senior legal director at The Wilderness Society, in a statement concerning the two proposed rescission notices.
Already this year, a series of executive orders and actions by Trump have removed protections across millions of acres in national forests to boost the logging industry, streamlined the permitting process for mines, made the extraction of minerals on public lands with suitable resources the priority use, and targeted national monuments elimination. Staff at national parks have also been gutted.
All of this has come despite polling showing that conserving public lands is universally popular across party lines.
“The Trump administration is just working to undermine all protections for air, for water, for wildlife and climate—systematically and rapidly,” Greenwald said.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)MANSFIELD — When DeSoto Regional Health System took out $36 million in loans last year to renovate a rural hospital that opened in 1952, officials were banking on its main funding source remaining stable: Medicaid, the joint federal-state health program for low-income people and the disabled.
But those dollars are now in jeopardy, as President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress move to shrink the nearly $900 billion health program that covers more than 1 in 5 Americans.
DeSoto CEO Todd Eppler said Medicaid cuts could make it harder for his hospital to repay the loans and for patients to access care.
“I just hope that the people who are making these decisions have thought deeply about it and have some context of the real-world implications,” he said, “because it’s going to affect us as a hospital and going to affect our patients.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
One of the decision-makers is Eppler’s representative in Congress: House Speaker Mike Johnson, who lives about 35 miles north of here. He said he knows the Republican leader and his staff understand hospitals’ plight: The mother of Johnson’s chief of staff is CEO of a rural hospital in the district.
“I’ve never met a congressman yet that wanted a rural hospital in their district to close, and certainly Mike is no exception to that rule,” Eppler said.
Last year nearly 290,000 people in Johnson’s district were enrolled in Medicaid, about 38% of the total population, according to data compiled by KFF, the health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
About 118,000 of them are in the program thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which allowed states including Louisiana to expand Medicaid to cover low-income adults, many of whom were working in low-paying jobs that don’t provide health insurance.
Louisiana ranks second in Medicaid enrollment, at nearly 32% — a reflection of the state’s high poverty rate. As Republicans weigh cuts, their actions could have dramatic consequences for their constituents here. Of the eight GOP-held House districts with the most Medicaid enrollees due to the expansion, four are in Louisiana. Johnson’s largely rural district ranks sixth in expansion enrollees.
Among them is Chloe Stovall, 23, who works in the produce aisle at the SuperValu grocery store in Vivian. She said her take-home wage working full time is $200 a week. She doesn’t own a car and walks a mile to work.
The store provides health coverage, but she said she won’t qualify until she’s worked there for a full year — and even then, it will cost more than Medicaid, which is free.
“I’m just barely surviving,” she said.
In February, Johnson pushed a budget resolution through the House that calls for cutting at least $880 billion over a decade from a pool of funding that includes Medicaid, to help fund an extension of Trump’s tax cuts and his border priorities. Republicans in Congress are now considering where to make cuts, and Medicaid is likely to take a big hit.
Defending the plan, Johnson said that Medicaid is “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Stovall said almost everyone she knows on Medicaid works at least one job. “I don’t even own a TV,” she said.
Contacted for comment, Johnson’s office pointed to his remarks at a conference in Washington last month. “We’re going to be very careful not to cut a benefit for anyone who is eligible to receive it and relies upon it,” Johnson said.

KFF Health News spoke with two dozen Medicaid enrollees in Johnson’s district. Most said they were unaware their congressman is leading the Republican charge to upend the program. Those informed of the Republican plan said it scares them.
Some GOP members of Congress want to eliminate the ACA’s Medicaid expansion funding, which led to 20 million working-age adults gaining coverage and helped slash the nation’s uninsured rate to its lowest level in history. Forty states and the District of Columbia have agreed to the change, which promised extra federal funding in exchange for expanding eligibility.
In this heavily Republican district, where Johnson won with 86% of the vote in November, 22% of residents live in poverty.
Like Trump, Johnson says he wants cuts to Medicaid but hasn’t elaborated other than saying the program should not cover “able-bodied” adults without imposing a work requirement.
“Everybody is committed” to preserving Medicaid benefits “for those who desperately need it and deserve it and qualify for it,” Johnson said at a news conference in February. “What we’re talking about is rooting out the fraud, waste, and abuse.”
Medicaid recipients in Johnson’s district, told about GOP plans to cut the program, said their lives are hard enough in a state where the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Without Medicaid, they said, they couldn’t afford health coverage.
In Vivian, near the borders with Arkansas and Texas, close to half of the 2,900 residents live in poverty. The main-street shops are mostly shuttered, except for a thrift store and a mom-and-pop restaurant that specializes in fried pork chops.
“Most everybody you know is on Medicaid here,” said Doris Luccous, 24.
Luccous said she makes $250 a week after taxes as a housekeeper at a nursing home while raising her 2-year-old daughter in her childhood home. While shopping with her father — who doesn’t work, because of a disability — she said she counts on Medicaid for her bipolar medicines and to pay for therapy appointments.
“I don’t know where I would be without it,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Neither Luccous nor Stovall said they voted in the last election, and neither knew that Johnson is their representative in Congress.
Vivian has few large employers, and most employers pay the minimum wage, which hasn’t changed since 2009. “We are just stuck,” Stovall said.
Still, she said, “it’s a community where everybody knows everybody, and people are always willing to lend a hand because so many are in difficult financial circumstances.”
Willie White is CEO of David Raines Community Health Centers, which operates six outpatient clinics in northwestern Louisiana that serve primarily Medicaid enrollees. He said that Louisiana already ranks among the worst states for people’s health and that Medicaid cuts would only worsen the situation.
“You cannot expect health outcomes to improve if people can’t afford to access care,” White said.
While the clinics provide primary and dental care on a sliding fee scale for uninsured patients, signing them up for Medicaid gives them better access to specialists and brings the health centers revenue to cover the cost of delivering care.

Many of the centers’ patients gained coverage through Medicaid expansion. Afterward, rates of screenings for colon and cervical cancer went from 10% to 50%, White said.
But if Congress cuts Medicaid, the health centers would be forced to cut services, he said.
“Mike Johnson has been here and knows us, and he and his office have been responsive about our issues,” White said. “The message in prior years was, ‘We need additional funding,’ but now it is asking for no cuts.”
Community health centers, which in 2023 provided care nationally to more than 32 million mostly low-income people, have seen funding increases from Republicans and Democrats for decades.
“Everyone is supportive, but the question remains what that support will look like under the current administration,” White said. “If there are to be reductions, they need to be done with a scalpel.”
Expecting cuts, the health centers have already restricted travel and put a hold on filling vacant positions, White said.
Sitting in a David Raines clinic in Bossier City, Benjamin Andrade, 57, said having Medicaid has been a lifesaver since he needed heart surgery in 2020. Andrade is a chef and said he supports his wife and two children on $14 an hour.
He had not heard about any potential cuts to the program. Without Medicaid, he said, “it would be very hard for me to pay for all the medicines I take.”
Dominique Youngblood, 31, who was at the clinic for a dental checkup, said she’s had Medicaid most of her life. “Medicaid helps me so I don’t have to pay out-of-pocket going to the doctors,” she said.
Youngblood, who has two children, makes $12 an hour at a day care center. Asked about GOP efforts to scale back the program, she said, “It’s not fair, because it helps a lot of people who cannot afford medications and emergency room trips, and those are costs you can’t control.”

Back in Mansfield, Eppler’s hospital is more than just a health facility — it’s where many people in town come for lunch. The cafeteria was packed on a recent Friday as workers served boiled shrimp, fried okra, and baked fish.
Eppler said he’s aware Republicans in Congress are targeting a system of taxes that some states, including Louisiana, levy on hospitals and other health providers to draw down more federal Medicaid funding. That money helps finance what are known as supplemental payments to providers. Some conservatives belittle the extra funding as “money laundering.”
But that money accounts for about 15% of the DeSoto health system’s budget, said Eppler, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who has been CEO for a dozen years. “We are using that money to invest in the next 50 years of Desoto Parish, to build a hospital that they can have that will be sustainable,” he said.
The supplemental payments, for example, help pay to provide mental health services at three outpatient clinics. “If that $4 million went away, we would have to limit services — it’s just that simple,” he said.

Recent lawsuits in Arizona, Tennessee and Texas have attempted to slow voter-passed projects.
In Nashville, Tennessee, voters passed a $3.1 billion referendum in November to raise the city sales tax half a cent and fund expanded bus service, pedestrian improvements and 54 miles of “all-access” transit corridors. But a Tennessee court, while upholding most of the project, ruled last week that the city could not use the funds raised to purchase land for affordable housing or parks.
The ruling affects only 1% of the total revenue, the court said. But it was a signal that even well-funded, voter-backed transit efforts are vulnerable to some legal roadblocks.
After voters in Maricopa County, Arizona, last year approved an extension of a half-cent sales tax for transportation, the county GOP sued to try to invalidate the results, arguing the vote didn’t meet a 60% supermajority.
In Austin, Texas, a 2024 class-action lawsuit attempted to block the city from collecting property taxes unless it excludes a tax approved by voters in 2020 to fund Project Connect — a major transit expansion. But a judge dismissed the lawsuit late last year.
Public support for expanded transit is surging across the United States. In 2024 alone, voters approved 46 of 53 transit-related ballot measures, unlocking over $25 billion in new funding for transit projects and improvements, according to the American Public Transportation Association.
But despite support at the ballot box, cities often face legal, zoning and political barriers.
Nashville, in particular, is becoming a case study in both momentum and resistance to transit investment and development, according to researchers at the Urban Institute.
“There’s been a sea change,” said Gabe Samuels, a research analyst in the Housing and Communities Division at the Urban Institute. “Nashville had two failed transit referenda in the past decade. This time, it passed decisively. Voters want alternatives to sprawl and traffic.”
But transit-oriented development — the strategy of clustering housing and businesses near high-quality transit — is often hindered by outdated zoning, Samuels and colleague Yonah Freemark told Stateline.
According to an Urban Institute study, more than 90% of Nashville’s residential land is zoned for single- or two-family homes, a pattern common in Southern and Midwestern cities. That zoning limits the density needed to support high transit ridership, the report said. Currently, only 13% of Nashville’s housing lies within a quarter-mile, what the report calls easy walking distance, of its planned transit corridors.
“You’re investing millions — sometimes billions — into transit systems,” said Freemark. “If you’re not thinking about land use and density alongside that, you’re wasting the opportunity.”

He wants to meet the moment with uncompromising defiance.,"Sen. Chris Murphy was dropped at the L Street entrance of Washington, D.C.’s convention center and hustled through the kitchen to a ballroom where 2,000 progressive activists waited to hear his thoughts on what to do about the 47th president of the United States and the sorry state of the Democratic Party.
The audience was midway through a weeklong, largely off-the-record summit of “America Votes,” the self-described “coordination hub of the progressive community.” It promised “experts, strategists, and renowned progressive leaders to begin writing the next chapter of the American story.”
Among them was Murphy, 51, the Democratic junior senator from Connecticut. Reelected in November to a third term, Murphy is in his third new phase as a senator — the first 10 years building a gun control movement, the last two as a broker of bipartisan deals on gun safety and border control.
“And now I’m trying to convince my party to meet the moment and bash these guys over the head with a baseball bat, metaphorically,” Murphy said.
The moment, as Murphy describes it in increasingly heated terms in person and online, is a campaign by President Donald J. Trump and Elon Musk to undermine the press and bully law firms, universities and business leaders into submission, and the only way it can be met is with uncompromising, if risky, defiance.
“Our democracy isn’t at risk of dying. It is dying as we speak. We are watching it die. It is not too late to save it,” Murphy said in a Senate speech on April 10. “We say that again, it is not too late to save our democracy, but we can’t continue to close our eyes and think that our democracy can survive a coordinated assault on those four key institutions of accountability.”
Murphy is a multiplatform messenger, a believer in repetition. On Thursday night, unshaven and casually dressed after a basketball game with the youngest of his two teenage sons, he delivered a live video briefing on Instagram that repurposed and updated the Senate speech.
“So, I want to go over events that have been developing really, really fast. Trump’s plan is real. He has a plan,” said Murphy, who has 200,000 followers on Instagram and one million on X. “He is implementing it to convert our democracy to some form of autocracy, and that’s the only way that you can get away with the corruption and the thievery.”

Online, where his Instagram remarks got more than 12,000 “likes” by Saturday morning, or the previous week while addressing a live audience in the convention center ballroom, Murphy preaches and teaches the gospel of resistance, rallies and “mass mobilizations” as the counter to Trump’s efforts to quell dissent.
“They’re playing a different game, and whether we like it or not, we have to choose to fight on the terms that they’re setting,” Murphy told the activists. It is time, he said, for Democrats “to take big swings” on both tactics and policies. The message from Murphy is not new, but similar calls are popping up in unexpected places, such as buttoned-down David Brooks calling for an “uprising” on the New York Times opinion page.
As Murphy told the activists, he would have preferred that Democrats boycotted the president’s speech to a joint session of Congress, as he did.
“He has an obligation to give a real State of the Union speech, not run a reality show, not stand up on stage and tell lie after lie after lie,” Murphy said. “He’s not willing to play that on the level. Why are we willing to play that, right?”
Murphy voted to confirm Marco Rubio as secretary of state, but says there will be no more gestures of cooperation, of recognizing institutional norms. If they are a Trump nominee, they are complicit and to be opposed. He wished his Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, had not voted with Republicans for a budget resolution drafted with no Democratic input. Let the government shut down. Let them own it.
Yes, Murphy said, it would have carried a risk.
“For ordinary Americans to take risks, or, for instance, for law firms or universities to take risks and just say no to this guy when he tries to extort them, then political leaders need to be willing to take risks as well. Right?”  Murphy said.
It was an applause line.

Fundraising like Bernie
Murphy entered the ballroom knowing that a campaign finance filing soon would show that his relentless, blunt and occasionally profane critiques of the Republican president and Democratic Party was putting him in a league with Bernie Sanders in the online game of raising money off opposition to Trump.
The report filed Wednesday shows Murphy spent $3.4 million in the first three months of 2025 on online pitches for help supporting “a political opposition movement” that remains a work in progress, so far producing a single town-hall meeting in Warren, Mich., and the promise of two more this week in North Carolina and Missouri. 
The online appeals, buttressed with constant presence on social media platforms and cable television, plus featured turns with everyone from the New Yorker’s David Remnick to the comedian podcaster Hasan Minhaj, brought in an eye-popping $8 million.
“It’s obviously an uncommon amount of money,” Murphy said. “I mean, it was shocking to me. It was shocking to me that so many people were interested in contributing. And I just feel like I have an obligation to put that money on the ground right now. Even though they were contributing to my election funds, they were really contributing as a means to try to help meet the moment.”
After expenses, Murphy netted $4 million for the quarter, adding to the $5.5 million leftover from his easy reelection last year. 
OK, listen, it is scary. I’m not going to tell you it’s not scary.U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.
Among senators not facing reelection in 2026 or 2028, only Sanders raised more in the same period. The independent from Vermont and undisputed leader of the American progressive movement raised $11.4 million, while spending only $1.3 million to prime the pump with digital appeals.
The 83-year-old Sanders has been on the road since Feb. 21 with his “Fighting Oligarchy Tour,” staging 15 rallies in the midwest and west with his 35-year-old ally, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Their stops in Denver and Los Angeles each drew more than 30,000 people.
Sanders figures prominently in Murphy’s retooled messaging: Economic populism should have been the tentpole of Kamala Harris’ campaign, and elements of the Democratic Party owe Sanders an apology for dismissing the two-time presidential candidate as occupying a place on the fringe of politics.

Pugilistic populism
At the America Votes’ summit, which ended as Congress left Washington for a two-week recess on April 11, Murphy insisted the Biden administration, by reinvigorating the Federal Trade Commission and authorizing antitrust actions, had a credible record of standing up for workers and against corporations.
“But Joe Biden wasn’t out there every single day beating the hell out of the tech companies that were poisoning our kids, against the oil companies that were price-gouging us at the pumps, the retail companies that were shipping all of our jobs overseas,” Murphy said. “You have to be engaged in a daily fight with the corporations, the greedy corporations, the price gouging corporations that are screwing Americans.”
Murphy said his new populist rhetoric signifies a change in tone, not philosophy.
“While I’ve always, I think, been a populist, I’m maybe a louder populist,” Murphy said. “I’m maybe more interested in being more pugilistic in my populism.”
During an interview in his office the next day, between speaking at a tax-fairness rally in a park by the Capitol and then giving a floor speech on the mounting threats to democracy, Murphy said a pugilistic populism means naming names, not blandly promising to “fight special interests.” 
“That’s a purposefully cowardly term,” Murphy said. “But when you say, ‘I’m going to attack the way that Amazon is destroying local businesses. I’m going to stop Pfizer and Bristol-Myers from bankrupting families, I’m gonna stop big agriculture from driving up the cost of food’ and tell them how you’re gonna do it, that’s a much more believable populism.”
Stylistically, Murphy runs cooler than Sanders and AOC, who draw energy from crowds. Murphy can sound like he is giving a TED Talk, conversational and informative. On Thursday, after warning that civil disobedience might be necessary sooner than later, he paused and said, “OK, listen, it is scary. I’m not going to tell you it’s not scary.”
Murphy, who managed a congressional campaign when he was 22, always has thought like a political strategist as much as a politician. His rhetoric and fundraising have renewed speculation of presidential ambitions, but some admirers wonder if a better role model would be LBJ, the master of the Senate, not president.
“As long as you are nimble, there are a lot of ways to be continually relevant and make a difference on behalf of things that you care about,” he said, taking break in office. He had just addressed a tax fairness rally outside the Capitol and was about to deliver a speech to the Senate.
He insists his rainmaking, his road trips and his social media are not prepatory to a campaign for higher office. 
“I think part of the reason that my voice is breaking through a little bit right now is that it’s not poisoned by personal ambition,” he said. “I think the reason that I feel and sound a little bit more authentic in my worry about where the country is is because I’m genuinely seized by my worry. And I’m posting videos not to gain followers. I’m posting videos to try to change people’s minds and to try to raise people’s urgency.”
He asserted a strategic role on Nov. 10 with a series of tweets and a 4-minute video in which he delivered a calm if devastating post-mortem of why so many blue-collar Democrats either defected to Trump or didn’t show up.
“We are not listening to the people we claim to represent,” Murphy said in the video. “We claim to be the party of the working class, the party of poor people, and yet we let interest groups and think tanks tell us what those people need. That’s why we end up with these relatively small-ball solutions. Not saying they don’t matter, but more roads and bridges, bulk negotiation of prescription drug prices, little bit bigger tax credit for families with kids, that’s not meeting the moment.”

Spent last week licking wounds. Now it's time to get to work. Some thoughts on the path forward. In short, we need to rebuild the left. No band aids. Admit that our policies don't connect with people emotionally. Stop being so afraid of populist fights. Build a bigger tent. pic.twitter.com/MPNn2mAEFJ— Chris Murphy  (@ChrisMurphyCT) November 10, 2024

That video created an immediate buzz, especially among Sanders supporters who had given up on the Democratic Party, people like Mike Figueredo, the founder and host of “The Humanist Report” podcast. On a show in November, he summarized Murphy’s message as an unexpected validation of Sanders.
“Wow. I’ve got to say I am genuinely shocked to see a sitting Democratic Party senator admit this about the party,” Figueredo said. “I mean, we all know it’s true, but to see them admit it is quite the thing to behold. And of course, he’s exactly right. Democrats shun their working class base because they think that those high income supporters are going to be the ones to carry them.”
Not all of Murphy’s prescription was applauded by Figueredo or others on the left. While pushing the party to be more aggressive and risk-tolerant in fighting Trump, he is also urging it to be less judgmental as a necessary step to reestablishing Democrats as the big-tent party.

On X, Murphy wrote, “You need to let people into the tent who aren’t 100% on board with us on every social and cultural issue, or issues like guns or climate.” In his speech to the activists, Murphy noted he spent the better part of a decade making sure that support for universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons was a litmus test for Democratic presidential candidates.
“I remember patting myself on the back in 2020 when we held a big forum on gun violence in Las Vegas, Nev., and every single Democratic candidate for president was there, right?” he said. “And every single one of them was singing the same tune. Everyone was for a ban on assault weapons and universal background checks. And I was like, ‘Alright, I did my job.’”
Cultural litmus tests have limited the ceiling for Democratic seats in the Senate to 52, Murphy said, and he suggests across-the-board litmus tests might be counterproductive, even on his issue of guns. 
“We maybe should be nominating candidates who believe in the economic populist tentpole but might not line up with us on all of the other cultural, social and hot-button issues,” Murphy said. “That’s a difficult call to make, but I think that might serve two purposes: That might grow the coalition so we win more elections, and that might actually put us in a position to change people’s minds.” 
That was not an applause line, nor did Murphy expect it would be. Murphy was doing his TED Talk thing. He was in teaching mode. 
“Frankly, if you are zeroed in on this question of the billionaire takeover of government, the corporate seizure of our economy, then you can frankly confront the right on their unconscionable scapegoating of gay, transgender kids or immigrants in the exact same sentence in which you are anchoring our message on economic populism, right?” he said.

Distraction and division are elements of Trump’s playbook, he said. Forget about Greenland, the 51st state of Canada and the Gulf of America and keep focused on the real threat of funding tax cuts for the rich by cutting Medicaid, most likely by rolling back the expansion passed as part of the Affordable Care Act. Ninety percent of the expansion is federally funded, and a retreat to the 50-50 state and federal split for the rest of Medicaid would cost Connecticut nearly $1 billion.
“You can say, ‘Listen, the Republicans are corporate shills. They are in the pockets of billionaires, and so they want you to believe that your problems are being caused by gay kids or drag shows or Mexican immigrants,’” Murphy said. “That’s not who’s screwing you, right? Who’s screwing you are unscrupulous insurance companies. What’s screwing you are the tech companies that are poisoning and addicting your kids to their devices. Who’s screwing you is your billionaires who are so rapacious that they’re arguing to cut your insurance off so that they can get another $50,000 tax cut.”
Murphy has been warning about the dangers of disaffection and loneliness since 2022, both in a political and sociological sense. He did so again at the convention center. At a time when the economic metrics were good, he said, too many voters just weren’t feeling it.
“You were seeing epidemic rates of self reported unhappiness in America at a time when unemployment was at a structural low, crime was dropping, test scores were going up,” Murphy said. “And I don’t think you were doing your job as a political leader if you didn’t step back and ask yourself, ‘Why?’ ” 
Democrats didn’t answer that question, at least not in a manner that was heard by disaffected voters, he said. The beneficiary was anyone who practiced the politics of grievance. 
“When you’re feeling powerless, when you’re feeling alone, when you’re feeling empty and devoid of meaning, that’s the moment the demagogues live for, right?” Murphy said. “That’s the moment where somebody who is going to sell a message of division and scapegoating, man, that’s their opportunity.”
Murphy’s higher profile comes at an awkward time. Five days after issuing the election post-mortem, Murphy and his wife, Cathy Holahan, informed friends and, ultimately, the general public of their separation. Five months later, there is no record of either filing for divorce. The topic is one Murphy declines to discuss. 
Last week, the first of the two weeks of the congressional recess, Murphy had no public schedule and spent time with his two sons, who are 13 and 16. Next week, he is going on the road with town-hall meetings in Saxapahaw, N.C., on Thursday and Chesterfield, Mo., on Friday. Both are in Republican congressional districts.

His wingman will be U.S. Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost, an up and coming 28-year-old Democrat who represents the 10th Congressional District of Central Florida. He was with Murphy at his event in Warren, Mich. Elected at age 25, Frost is the youngest and first Generation Z member of the House.
Frost ran with the backing of Sanders, and he appeared on stage with him at the Coachella music festival last week.
“I just think he’s one of a handful of members that is meeting the moment,” Murphy said. “I have a real sense of urgency.

By act of Congress, citizens were asked to turn to their Creator in supplication and meditation. This national day of prayer was to be celebrated in statehouses across the land, with every individual invited to offer hosannas or amens or other holy words of praise. The places of lawmaking were transformed into houses of worship, where the symbols dear to the faithful festooned the galleries and holy banners fluttered from balconies.
When the appointed day arrived, lawmakers made thunderous speeches and pounded their desks in protestations of righteousness. There was no louder din than in the capitol building of an interior province, a region known as much for its piety as for the bountiful harvests of wheat and corn. Under a great copper-sheathed dome, choirs of young people sang the praises of the One who made the sky while lawmakers clustered elbow to bended elbow and murmured their approval.
Few remembered the ancient day when the day of supplication became the law of the land, or the war that had prompted its passage, or the innkeeper and the lawmaker who had championed it. An ambassador of this interior province, was not yet born when the day was proclaimed, but from a dais in the capitol rotunda he addressed the assembled flock.
His face was stern as he clutched his holy book and urged the assembled to celebrate the land’s deliverance from the rule of the godless. At long last the battle for theocracy had nearly been won. The faithful were in power under the great copper dome. It would be a small matter to extinguish the infidels entirely. No true patriot could doubt the land was specially ordained by the Almighty for greatness. Victory was at hand. The ambassador bowed his head and asked the One to bestow wisdom on the leaders of the land. He unashamedly asked this for all in the name of peace and love.
No one could remember a more passionate or powerful sermon.
Then an aged stranger approached. She moved silently down the aisle and mounted the platform, her chalky robe swirling like smoke. Her white hair fell in rivulets to her shoulders. Her face was as pale as those of the statues of long-dead statesmen in the alcoves of the rotunda.
The stranger touched the ambassador on the arm and bid him step aside, which the startled man did. She grasped the lectern with skeletal hands and surveyed the congregation with eyes burning with uncanny light.
“I am sent from the Throne,” she said, her voice solemn and deep. “The One has heard your prayers, and they will be granted — if you wish. But know that for every prayer answered, another must be dashed. Each request for favor brings with it the unspoken plea that another be disfavored. All supplications for earthly power are wishes both selfish and damned.”
Her eyes smoldered.
“You have asked the One for victory,” she said, “so that you might rule this land in the way which pleases you. Very well. I will repeat your prayer, as it falls upon the ears of the One above the clouds.”
There were calls for the capitol guards to remove the stranger, but they stood as transfixed as the crowd.
“Almighty One, grant us the power over our political enemies, so that we may not only exalt You but punish them,” she said, her voice growing stronger. “Let us make laws that take the food from their mouths, the homes of their families, and their ability to pay for medicine and doctors to see them through sickness. Grant us the power to choose in their stead the governing of their bodies and their minds. Allow us to restrict the means of controlling conception and then force women to bear unwanted children, even when violated.”
The stranger paused and clutched the robe to her breast.
“Let us purge from their libraries those books we deem to be improper or impious. Allow us to deny our enemies the ability to seek redress by controlling the manner in which their leaders are selected. Grant us the right to banish from our shores those who utter seditious dissent.”
The crowd grew still.
“Let our enemies live from this day forward with fear in their hearts,” the stranger said. “Let them fear the loss of their positions if they speak of equity or inclusion, make them cower if they dare say azure instead of crimson, allow them pain if they insist on choosing how they shall be called by others. Make their nights sleepless in expectation of a knock at midnight’s door. Grant them freedom of worship only if they worship as we do, deny them public office if they refuse any manner of worship, and enforce the social and marital codes of a society these thousands of years dead.”
The ambassador attempted to mutter “blasphemy,” but the word caught in his throat. The stranger regarded him for a moment with pity, then turned back to the crowd.
“Allow no truth to free a human soul,” the stranger continued. “Shutter the great houses of learning lest a whisper be made against the ambassador or his earthly king. Make a virtue of intolerance and paint it as just. Make retribution the supreme law of the land, power the only virtue, and chaos the only mode. Force them to abandon the sacred civic code that once governed this land, just as we have, and accept in their stead whimsy, nonsense and malice. Allow the land to wither beneath tariffs on foreign things, the fear of strangers, and the rapacious hunger of misers and kings.”
The stranger shook her head and her hair floated cloud-like about her face.
“Finally, Greatest One, ignore the prayers of the meek, the young, the sick and the old,” she said, her voice growing soft. “Comfort not those who pray with pure hearts. Reward not those who thirst for righteousness. Punish those who seek the truth. Banish those who challenge power with fact. All are enemies of the state, Greatest One, and are therefore your enemies. Damn their hopes, dash their dreams, and make their eyes wet with tears. Deny them comfort, afflict their spirits, and fill their hearts with lead. Smite them and their generations to come. Forever make them inequal to us. Grant us the end of history and relieve us of the will to change. This we implore of You, in the name of love.”
The stranger paused.
“This is the prayer of your secret hearts,” she said, her voice a quaver. “If you still desire it, speak! The messenger of the One awaits.”
It was reported afterward that the old woman was a lunatic, because there was no sense in what she said. On the way to the asylum, a copy of Mark Twain’s “The War Prayer” was found in the folds of her voluminous robe.

And for some, the solutions are simple, if impractical.","While I’m on vacation this week I thought I’d revisit a commentary I wrote in 2014. Judge for yourself how little has changed in 11 years.=======================================Everybody loves to complain about our traffic. And for some, the solutions are simple, if impractical. If there were easy answers to our woes, they’d have been implemented by now.
Look… this is really a matter of supply and demand: too much demand (highway traffic) and not enough supply (space on those roads). I think the solution is to manage the demand. But others say it’s a “supply side” issue.


So here are a few of the crazier ideas for fixing our traffic that I’ve seen proposed over the years:
1) Double-deck I-95: Seriously, this was once proposed by the Stamford Chamber of Commerce. Can you imagine the decades of construction and billions in cost, with “upper level” roads having to soar hundreds of feet over existing bridges?
2) Allow trucks on the Merritt Parkway: There are two words to explain why this can’t happen: low bridges.
3) Ban trucks from our interstates: This was once suggested to me by a Fairfield County First Selectman. But as I reminded him… trucks are high-occupancy vehicles delivering goods to the stores where you drive your single-occupancy vehicle to shop. No trucks, no goods, no shopping.
4) Drive in the break-down lane: This was then-Gov. John Rowland’s idea in 2000 and he even wasted a million dollars studying it. But if you think of that far right-hand lane instead as the “emergency rescue lane,” you’ll see why this doesn’t make sense. This plan would also require re-striping the road to create narrower lanes, making driving even more dangerous.
5) Widening I-95 to four lanes: Again, billions in cost and decades of construction. And if you build it, they will come. The immutable law of “induced demand” means that traffic will expand to fill available space. Then what, a fifth lane?
There are better ways to manage congestion, some of them already being implemented:
Operational lanes: Adding a fourth lane from on-ramps to the next off-ramps gives traffic a better chance of merging on and off the highway without blocking the through-lanes.
Widening choke points: For example, the exit 14-15 bottleneck in Norwalk. But this widening project (for less than one mile) cost $50 million and took three years. The I-84 / Route 8 “Mixmaster” rebuild in Waterbury took six years and cost $253 million. Both projects were funded mostly with federal funds, but it’s anyone’s guess what will happen to that money pot under the new administration’s budget cutting.
Add a zipper lane: Sure, this may require highway widening, but just one lane that’s reversible depending on demand, a system that was used successfully on the Tappan Zee Bridge before its reconstruction. By moving the extra lane, capacity can be added to the direction where there’s the most traffic.
Change commuting hours: Does everyone really need to work 9 a.m. – 5 p.m.? How about starting earlier or later and spreading out the traffic? Your employer should understand and you’ll be happier and more productive.
And the very best idea of all: improve mass transit to encourage drivers to  get off of the roads.
As I say, there are no simple solutions to highway congestion. So when anyone says he or she has one, be skeptical. It’s easy to identify the problems. But fixing them will always be hard… and usually expensive.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Traffic-congestion-on-I-95.png,,,2025-04-20 05:00:28.260002

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Major pieces of a $12 billion tax package passed the Washington state Senate on Saturday without a clear sign that Gov. Bob Ferguson supports them.
Democratic senators used their near supermajority to override Republican opposition, approving bills to expand the capital gains tax, increase tax rates on large corporations and big banks, and begin collecting sales tax on an array of services.
Collectively, the legislation would raise around $3.2 billion in the next two-year budget and $5.5 billion over four years, money Democrats are counting on to erase a multibillion-dollar shortfall and enact a balanced budget before the regular session ends next weekend.
The most heated debate Saturday centered on Senate Bill 5814, which produces the most dollars — a projected $2.9 billion in the next budget and $4.7 billion over four years. It would affect an estimated 35,000 firms, according to a Department of Revenue fiscal analysis.
Meanwhile, the House Finance Committee on Saturday advanced the tax package’s other significant components. 
Those measures — expected to receive floor votes Monday in the House — would permanently increase the state’s business tax rate, impose a new sales tax on rented self-storage units, and add a new levy on the sale of electric vehicle credits between automakers. 
The committee also voted out a bill to lift the cap on annual increases in property tax growth. 
Democrats plowed ahead on these multiple fronts without clarity on how Ferguson would respond if the bills reached his desk.
The first-term governor on Thursday called their $12 billion package “unsustainable” and “too risky,” citing unknowns about the economy and the flow of federal funding with the Trump Administration. Ferguson insisted again that a mix of progressive revenue and spending reductions is needed to resolve the budget issue, but stopped short of specifics.
He met virtually with Democratic leaders Thursday, but did not cite any specific taxes in the package he dislikes. 
Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, who took part in the meeting, didn’t speculate on whether the bills passed Saturday would get signed.
“I can’t speak for the governor,” he said. “This is consistent with what we have talked with him about in terms of our approach on revenue.”
Tax time
When the session began, Democrats forecast the need for new and higher taxes to sustain public services at or near or existing levels. Saturday marked the first time any significant tax measure made it to the floor of either chamber. 
Senate Bill 5814, which passed 27-22, produces the most dollars, an estimated $2.9 billion in the next budget and $4.7 billion over four years. It applies the retail sales tax to more services, such as temporary staffing, advertising, security and lobbying.
Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, the caucus leader on finance legislation, described the bill as making the state’s tax code “more appropriate for the 21st Century.”
“Our taxes fund core public services,” she said. “That’s what this is about.”
Sen. Nikki Torres, R-Pasco, assistant budget leader for the Republican caucus, said there is “nothing modern about this bill.”
“This would be an unprecedented increase in the sales tax,” she said. “We were told that the wealthy need to pay what they owe but this bill hurts everyone.”
Democrats also pushed through Senate Bill 5813 to squeeze more money from the capital gains tax. In addition to the existing 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets like stocks, bonds and business interests, the bill tacks on another 2.9% for gains exceeding $1 million. It would bring in $282 million in the coming budget and $561 million over four years, a fiscal analysis found. The bill passed 27-21.
Senate Bill 5794 advanced on a 26-22 vote. It revises or repeals a number of tax breaks. Republicans tried without success to preserve some, including exempting operators of self-service storage facilities from paying a business and occupation tax on the renting or leasing of individual units. Most storage unit users are not homeowners, they argued.
“This is a tax on renters,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia.
‘There’s no need’
Pedersen said budget writers “have scrubbed and scrubbed” and come up with $7 billion in savings through cuts, delays and deferrals. He said bills like those Senate Democrats approved are needed for crucial programs related to health care, housing, child care and schools.
Republicans pushed back hard. 
“There’s no need for any of the tax increases,” said Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, who led a GOP effort to craft an alternative budget proposal that doesn’t rely on tax hikes.
He lambasted a provision that requires businesses with $3 million or more in taxable retail sales next year to make a one-time pre-payment of sales tax to the state. This maneuver would pull more tax revenue into the 2025-27 budget that otherwise would have been due the month after it ends.
“This is completely a budget gimmick that should not be tolerated,” Gildon said.
In mid-afternoon, Senate Republicans attempted to pull their budget bill to the floor through a parliamentary move, but failed.
“It doesn’t play games and use ghost money,” Gildon said. “It is the only budget proposal that lives within its means.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1573-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-19 23:06:37.771023

(Robert Davis for Colorado Newsline)Thousands of Coloradans gathered at the state Capitol in Denver on Saturday to attend the month’s second Hands Off! protest against the Trump administration’s policies regarding immigrants, civil rights and marginalized communities. 
The protest was organized by young people from groups like Women’s Strike, Raise Her Voice, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation, according to co-organizer McKenzie Hales, 20. The Colorado State Patrol estimated about 3,000 people were in attendance as protesters began to march at 1:30 p.m. The previous Hands Off! rally in Denver on April 5 attracted more than 8,000 attendees. 
Similar protests happened in cities across Colorado, such as Boulder, Colorado Springs, Grand Junction and Fort Collins. Similar protests were planned throughout the country.
“We deserve a country that doesn’t just say the word ‘freedom’ but one that practices it,” Hales said.

Mandy Swartz, an organizer with Raise Her Voice, a group that teaches political skills to women and marginalized communities, told Colorado Newsline that including young people in the protest is a way to ensure the momentum continues. 
Swartz said she had several “doors slammed in (her) face” as a young organizer, and she wants to change that dynamic for today’s youths.  
“We need to pass the torch on to our youths,” Swartz said. “When we’re gone, we need our youths to carry this on.” 
  It was the second Hands Off! rally in Denver this month. (Robert Davis for Colorado Newsline)
Protesters started gathering at the intersection of Lincoln Street and East 14th Avenue about 90 minutes before the protest began. Many carried upside-down American flags — a symbol of distress — and homemade signs calling for the protection of due process rights for legal immigrants like Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom the administration of President Donald Trump erroneously sent to prison in El Salvador without allowing him to have a court hearing. 
As the crowd grew, protest songs like “For What It’s Worth” by Buffalo Springfield, “Can You Get to That” by Funkadelic, and “Revolution” by The Beatles could be heard playing through loudspeakers. The smell of burning sage and marijuana hung in the air. Passersby honked car horns in a show of solidarity with the protesters. 
Police officers in unmarked cars drove down Lincoln Street to keep protesters on the sidewalks. Once the crowd became too large, police shut down the intersection and diverted traffic away from Lincoln Street.
Speakers highlighted the deportation proceedings against local labor organizer Jeanette Vizguerra as an example of the unfair treatment immigrants are receiving under Trump. Vizgeurra’s arrest drew widespread condemnation across the country, with Denver Mayor Mike Johnston likening it to “Putin-style political persecution.” 
Some also called on congressional and local lawmakers to repair the social contract for marginalized groups like people with disabilities, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community. Others spoke in opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza and what they characterized as America’s complicity in the conflict. 
“Until we address and rebuild America’s foundation, this house will fall,” said Dr. Robert Davis (no relation to the author), an activist with the Denver Task Force to Reimagine Policing.

Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.

Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s Congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The Federal Building housed federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995. Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

(Photo via FIU)Florida International University’s police chief believes the university community would be best served by the department signing an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, although the faculty is uneasy. 
During a Faculty Senate special meeting Friday, interim President Jeanette Nuñez, the former lieutenant governor, and FIU Police Department Chief Alexander Casas fielded questions from faculty members about what a 287(g) agreement with ICE will mean for students and faculty, particularly ones fearing detainment.
Under the agreement, FIUPD officers could act as immigration enforcement officials to question and detain people they suspect are in the country without authorization.
“If we have to deliver someone, we’re the ones you want to do it, because it will be done in the most FIU way, the most Panther way, we can think of,” Casas said. 
Casas signed the agreement with ICE, as have several other university police departments in the state, and is awaiting a response from the federal agency before officers can begin training. When it’s signed, Casas said, he will choose his “best officers” to be trained. 
“If I don’t sign that agreement, we open the door for other agencies who are on this agreement, whether they’re federal agencies in power to do so or state agencies directed by our governor or local agencies that have agreed,” Casas said. 
Casas told faculty he wants his department to have a say in how immigration enforcement goes at the South Florida institution.
“Once I deliver someone to Krome or turn them over to ICE, you’re right, I lose control. But, absent this agreement, I don’t even have input. At the very least, once they execute it, at least now I have input and my officers do have a little say in what could be the outcome,” Casas said.
“If it has to happen because there’s a warrant in the system, who do you want interacting with you? God, I hope you say it’s me,” Casas said. 
Nuñez said she spoke at length with Faculty Senate Chair Noël Barengo earlier in the week after he reached out. She added that she wants to make sure she is “constantly addressing concerns.”
Faculty Senate members were not so convinced. Florida universities have made national news for signing the agreement with ICE.
Students live in fear for their ability to remain in the United States, faculty members said. One professor shared about a student who is not a citizen who came to him worried after receiving a parking ticket. 
Juan Gómez, director of the Carlos Costa Immigration Human Rights Clinic at FIU, said students have approached him to say they are afraid to look up items on their computer. Some, in abusive relationships, are afraid to call police. 
“I don’t know the status of any of our students. PD does not have access to any of that information,” Casas said, adding that his department has to follow FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

Casas said he did not get a call from the governor encouraging him to seek a 287(g) agreement; instead, he approached Nuñez after conversations with other law enforcement convinced him it “really is with our best interest at heart.”
Faculty senators approved a resolution opposing the agreement, saying it “goes against the university’s values of truth in the pursuit, generation, dissemination, and application of knowledge, freedom of thought and expression, and respect for diversity and dignity of the individual.” The resolution called for the university to withdraw. 
Well into the two-hour meeting, Philip Carter, an FIU professor, remained unconvinced.
“It’s been good to hear you,” Carter said. “I haven’t heard anything that convinces me that this is a good agreement. It still sounds like a really bad agreement. I still worry about the safety of our students on campus who fear for their status and their safety. I worry, frankly, about all of us, I worry about faculty, I worry that there’s a slippery slope beneath us.”
Nuñez stressed that visa revocations and ICE agreements are different but sometimes get conflated. FIU has no control over visa revocations, she said. 
Earlier this week, FIU confirmed to the Phoenix that 18 students have had their visas revoked since Jan. 1. The University of Florida told the Phoenix that eight visas have been revoked; Florida State University, three.
Alana Greer, director of Community Justice Project, said the FIU 287(g) is “deeply unprecedented” and the “agenda behind relaunching these 287(g)’s is specifically engineered to break trust, to tear apart our communities and to get us to see our neighbors, our peers, our students as ‘other.’”
Greer referenced her involvement with a story the Phoenix reported on Thursday, when 20-year-old Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen, was arrested by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper as an “unauthorized alien” and held for ICE.

Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack. 
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said. 
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850. 
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.

Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot. 
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians. 
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s Congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials. 
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed. 
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”

The report, written by longtime natural resources manager John Tubbs, calls the financial implications of federal lands transfer “staggering and disproportionately impactful for a rural state with large swaths of national public lands.”
“The costs associated with maintaining national public lands at the state level — ranging from wildfire operations to the loss of essential federal funding for rural counties — would be far too great for Montana to bear per capita,” the report states. It amounts to an $8 billion “gamble on Montana’s future.” 
Tubbs, who authored the report with support from the Montana Wildlife Federation, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, Mountain Mamas and the Montana Conservation Voters Education Fund, is the former director of the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation under Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock.
The long simmering dispute over whether the federal government should relinquish lands managed by the Departments of Interior and Agriculture to individual states has been turned up at all levels, from the halls of Congress to Montana’s capitol.
The estimated roughly $8 billion increase to Montanan’s balance sheet would be primarily driven by the costs of managing the land, according to the report, including for wildfire, deferred maintenance backlogs, and abandoned mine reclamation.
Citing reports by the Legislative Fiscal Division, the report states that during the last 20 years, Montana has paid more than $2.3 billion in wildfire mitigation costs on federal land — comprising just 25% of total cost, as the federal government covers 75% of costs. 
A transfer of federal lands to state management would shift the cost of future wildland fire suppression to state taxpayers to the tune of $5.5 billion — the bulk of the total.
On a press call about the report, Tubbs pointed to the essential partnerships with federal agencies  — including the large fleets of firefighting aircraft operated by the Forest Service — and the difficulty in replicating that from the state or private industry. 
“That is untenable,” he said.
 Tubbs also focused on Payment in Lieu of Taxes funds the federal government disseminates. The PILT program channels money to rural counties with swaths of untaxable federal land to support vital services such as public safety, housing, social services and transportation. 
In fiscal year 2023, Montana counties received more than $40 million in PILT funds — and another $16 million from the similar Secure Rural Schools program — a loss the state likely couldn’t make up. 
Tubbs said such a loss would result in the largest “unfunded mandate” in state history, and “several of Montanaʼs counties would be bankrupt—- in particular, the 11 counties in which more than half of the acreage is owned by the federal government.”
The report also states that Montana would be on the hook for $623 million in deferred maintenance and repairs on current federal lands; between $474 million and $1 billion for reclamation work on the state’s 5,000 abandoned mines; and a 1,600% increase in grazing fees. 
 “The state simply cannot afford the responsibility of managing such vast swaths of land without significant financial strain,” the report concludes. 
Tubbs said the value of public lands goes far beyond the numbers, and supporters need to strengthen efforts. 
“The core value I think most of us find in public lands is there’s some landscape that means something to each of us,” he said on the press call. 

Discussions about the federal lands transfer came to the forefront in Washington D.C. and nationwide following statements by the Trump administration that federal lands are part of the nation’s “balance sheet” and could be utilized to help pay off the national debt. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate passed a federal budget in a series of late night votes, and one particular budget amendment saw Montana’s two Republican Senators buck their party. 
The amendment, brought by Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado, would have prevented the sale of public lands to lower the federal deficit. 
Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy joined all Democrats in supporting the amendment, but it was defeated 51-49. 
In a similar vein, Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, Montanan’s western representative, reintroduced his “Public Lands in Public Hands Act,” earlier this year with a Democratic senator from New Mexico.
The provision would ban the U.S. Department of Interior and U.S. Forest Service from selling or transferring “most public lands” except in specific circumstances. It also would require Congressional approval for disposals of publicly accessible federal land tracts over 300 acres and for public land tracts over 5 acres if accessible via a public waterway.
“In Montana, public lands are our way of life. It’s not just Yellowstone and Glacier, it’s also the BLM and Forest Service areas where a kid fills their first tag, a lake in the Beartooths that is the perfect picnic spot, and the trail just down the road that helps you clear your head after a long workday,” Zinke, a former Secretary of the Interior during Trump’s first term, said in a press release. “Public lands must remain public, and the federal government has a responsibility to manage and ensure access to those lands.”
Earlier this month, Montana’s eastern representative, Republican Troy Downing, signed on as a cosponsor to the legislation, as did Idaho Republican Rep. Mike Simpson. 
In Helena this legislative session, Montana’s state lawmakers also got to offer their own takes on the issue thanks to a lawsuit filed by the State of Utah against the federal government in favor of land transfer.
The suit, which claimed federally-managed land infringed on the state’s sovereignty and sought a return of millions of acres, was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Despite that, freshman Rep. Tom Millett, R-Marion, introduced a resolution supporting Utah’s position.
While Millett stated House Resolution 24 did not concern Montana’s federal public lands, his comments were broadly applicable to all states. 
“Nothing in the U.S. Constitution authorizes the federal government to hold vast unreserved swaths of unreserved territory in perpetuity over the states’ express objection,” he told the House Energy, Technology and Federal Relations Committee during a hearing. “The U.S. generates significant revenue from these unappropriated lands — millions of dollars annually that would go toward our counties and schools. But instead, we get but a pittance, leftover crumbs from what should be our lands.”
The bill passed out of committee on partisan lines, but saw broad bipartisan opposition on the floor. 
“Montanans have overwhelmingly rejected transfer time and time again,” Rep. Debo Powers, D-Whitefish, told her colleagues during the debate. “In fact, 87 percent of Montana voters considered the conservation — not the transfer, but the conservation — of public land to be influential in their voting decisions. That’s why so many political candidates in Montana from every political party pledged to keep public lands in public hands.”
The bill failed to pass the House floor in a bipartisan 33-66 vote.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/52200523998_54a5016229_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-19 14:04:23.814161

(Adam Wesley/USA Today)ASHLAND, Wis. — In less than 10 years, three catastrophic floods ravaged northwestern Wisconsin and changed the way people think about water. 
The most severe, in July 2016, slammed Ashland with up to 10 inches of rain in less than a day — a month’s worth of rain fell in just two hours. As rivers swelled to record highs, major highways broke into pieces and culverts washed away. It took months for roads to reopen, with more than $41 million in damage across seven counties. 
The Marengo River, which winds through forests and farmland before meeting the Bad River that flows into Lake Superior, was hit hard during these historic deluges. Centuries earlier, the upper watershed would have held onto that water, but logging and agriculture left the river disconnected from its floodplain, giving the water nowhere safe to go. 
Today, the Marengo River stands as an example of a new kind of solution. Following the record floods, state leaders invested in opening up floodplains and restoring wetlands to relieve flooding. As the need to adapt to disasters grows more urgent, the Marengo River serves as an example that there’s a cheaper way to do so: using wetlands. 
“We can’t change the weather or the patterns… but we can better prepare ourselves,” said MaryJo Gingras, Ashland County’s conservationist. 
 This story is part of the series Down the Drain from the Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk, an independent reporting collaborative based at the University of Missouri in partnership with Report for America, with major funding from the Walton Family Foundation.
Wetlands once provided more natural flood storage across Wisconsin and the Mississippi River Basin, soaking up water like sponges so it couldn’t rush further downstream. But about half of the country’s wetlands have been drained and filled for agriculture and development, and they continue to be destroyed, even as climate change intensifies floods.
As the federal government disposes of rules to protect wetlands, environmental advocates want to rewrite the ecosystem’s narrative to convince more people that restoration is worth it. 
Wetlands aren’t just pretty places, advocates argue, but also powerhouses that can save communities money by blunting the impact of flood disasters. A 2024 Wisconsin law geared at preventing such disasters before they happen, inspired by the wetland work in the Marengo River watershed, is going to test that theory. 
“Traditionally, the outreach has been, ‘We want to have wetlands out here because they’re good for ducks, frogs and pretty flowers,’” said Tracy Hames, executive director of the Wisconsin Wetlands Association. “What do people care about here? They care about their roads, their bridges, their culverts … how can wetlands help that?” 
Bipartisan bill posed wetlands as flood solution
Northern Wisconsin isn’t the only place paying the price for floods. Between 1980 and 2025, the U.S. was struck by 45 billion-dollar flood disasters, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with a cumulative price tag of nearly $206 billion. Many parts of the vast Mississippi River Basin receive up to eight inches more rain annually than they did 50 years ago, according to a 2022 analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit organization that analyzes climate science. 
Damaging floods are now so common in the states that border the Mississippi River, including Wisconsin, that the issue can’t be ignored, said Haley Gentry, assistant director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy in New Orleans. 
“Even if you don’t agree with certain (regulations) … we absolutely have to find ways to reduce damage,” Gentry said.
Former Wisconsin state Rep. Loren Oldenburg, a Republican who served a flood-prone district in southwest Wisconsin until he lost the seat last year, was interested in how wetlands could help.
Oldenburg joined forces with Republican state Sen. Romaine Quinn, who represents northern Wisconsin and knew of the work in the Marengo River watershed. The lawmakers proposed a grant program for flood-stricken communities to better understand why and where they flood and restore wetlands in areas that need the help most. 
 
Jennifer Western Hauser, policy liaison at the Wisconsin Wetlands Association, met with Democratic and Republican lawmakers to advocate for the bill. She emphasized problems that might get their attention — related to transportation, emergency services, insurance, or conservation — that wetland restoration could solve. She said she got a lot of head-nods as she explained that the cost of continually fixing a washed-out culvert could vanish from storing and slowing floodwaters upstream. 
“These are issues that hit all over,” she said. “It’s a relatable problem.”   
  State Highway 13, a major north-south route in Wisconsin, collapsed in rural Ashland County in 2016 after a massive rainstorm caused area rivers to swell to record highs. The county used state funds to restore wetlands, hoping to prove that they’re a natural flooding solution.(MaryJo Gingras/Ashland County Land & Water Conservation Dept.)
The bill passed unanimously and was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in April 2024. Evers and the Republican-controlled Legislature approved $2 million for the program in the state’s most recent budget. 
Twenty-three communities applied for the first round of grant funding, which offered two types of grants — one to help assess flood risk, and another grant to help build new wetlands to reduce that risk. Eleven communities were funded, touching most corners of the state, according to Wisconsin Emergency Management, which administered the grants. 
Brian Vigue, freshwater policy director for Audubon Great Lakes, said the program shows Wisconsinites have come a long way in how they think about wetlands since 2018, when the state government made it easier for developers to build in them. 
There’s an assumption that wetland restoration comes only at the expense of historically lucrative land uses like agriculture or industry, making it hard to gain ground, Vigue said. But when skeptics understand the possible economic benefits, it can change things. 
“When you actually find something with the return on investment and can prove that it’s providing these benefits … we were surprised at how readily people that you’d assume wouldn’t embrace a really good, proactive wetland conservation policy, did,” he said. 
Private landowners need to see results
About three-quarters of the remaining wetlands in the lower 48 states are on privately owned land, including areas that were targeted for restoration in the Marengo River watershed. That means before any restoration work begins, the landowner must be convinced that the work will help, not hurt them. 
For projects like this to work, landowner goals are a priority, said Kyle Magyera, local government outreach specialist at the Wisconsin Wetlands Association, because “they know their property better than anyone else.”
Farmers, for example, can be leery that beefing up wetlands will take land out of production and hurt their bottom line, Magyera said. 
In the Marengo watershed, Gingras worked with one landowner who had farmland that wasn’t being used. They created five new wetlands across 10 acres that have already decreased sediment and phosphorus runoff from entering the river. And while there hasn’t been a flood event yet, Gingras expects the water flows to be slowed substantially.
This work goes beyond restoring wetland habitat, Magyera said, it’s about reconnecting waterways. In another project, Magyera worked on a private property where floods carved a new channel in a ravine that funneled the water faster downstream. The property now has log structures that mimic beaver dams to help slow water down and reconnect these systems.

Now that the first round of funding has been disbursed in Wisconsin’s grant program, grantees across the state are starting work on their own versions of natural flood control, like that used in Marengo. 
In Emilie Park, along the flood-prone East River in Green Bay, a project funded by the program will create 11 acres of new wetlands. That habitat will help store water and serve as an eco-park where community members can stroll through the wetland on boardwalks.
In rural Dane County, about 20 miles from the state capital, a stretch of Black Earth Creek will be reconnected to its floodplain, restoring five and a half acres of wetlands and giving the creek more room to spread out and reduce flood risk. The creek jumped its banks during a near record-breaking 2018 rainstorm, washing out two bridges and causing millions of dollars in damage. 
Voluntary program could be of interest elsewhere
Nature-based solutions to flooding have been gaining popularity along the Mississippi River. Wisconsin’s program could serve as a “national model” for how to use wetlands to promote natural flood resilience, Quinn wrote in a 2023 newspaper editorial supporting the bill.
Kyle Rorah, regional director of public policy for the Great Lakes/Atlantic region of Ducks Unlimited, said he’s talking about the Wisconsin grant program to lawmakers in other states in the upper Midwest, and that he sees more appetite for this model than relying on the federal government to protect wetlands.  
And Vigue has found that stakeholders in industries like fishing, shipping and recreation are receptive to using wetlands as infrastructure. 
But Gentry cautioned that voluntary restoration can only go so far, because it “still allows status-quo development and other related patterns to continue.”
Still, as the federal government backs off of regulation, Gentry said she expects more emphasis on the economic value of wetlands to drive protection. 
Some of that is already happening. A 2024 analysis from the Union of Concerned Scientists found that wetlands save Wisconsin and the upper Midwest nearly $23 billion a year that otherwise would be spent combating flooding. 
“Every level of government is looking at ways to reduce costs so it doesn’t increase taxes for their constituents,” Gingras said. 
John Sabo, director of the ByWater Institute at Tulane University, said as wetlands prove their economic value in reducing flood damage costs, taxpayers will see their value. 
“You have to think about (wetlands) as providing services for people,” Sabo said, “if you want to get people on the other side of the aisle behind the idea (of restoring them).” 
And although the Wisconsin grant program is small-scale for now, he said if other states bordering the Mississippi River follow its lead, it could reduce flooding across the region.
“If all upstream states start to build upstream wetlands,” he said, “that has downstream impacts.”

(Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC)Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
‘A gut punch’
Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
Continuing efforts
In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

(Taiwan Office of the President photo)JUNEAU — Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy flew to Taiwan last month to pitch business and government leaders on Alaska’s state-sponsored liquefied natural gas export project.
The same day Dunleavy and other Alaska officials arrived in Taipei on the unannounced trip, his office received an email from China’s vice consul in San Francisco, Ba Yanfeng. The consulate was aware that Dunleavy was leading a trip to the “province” of Taiwan, and Chinese government officials wanted a meeting with his chief of staff, Ba said.
Dunleavy had stepped into a simmering geopolitical conflict — an issue that China’s government describes as the most important and sensitive in its relationship with the U.S.
 
Take a trip to the Asian island that could play a role in Alaska’s future

	China claims Taiwan as its own territory and regularly conducts military drills nearby — including some that have simulated blockades and involved firing missiles over the island. 
The U.S. doesn’t officially recognize Taiwan’s independence. But it’s a longtime ally, sells arms to the government and has committed in legislation to support the island’s defense.

	In a formal follow-up note, the Chinese government said Dunleavy’s trip “sends a very wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces,” and it urged the governor “to correct such mistakes and avoid their recurrence.”
But Dunleavy, in an interview, said he was undeterred. 
“I don’t allow myself to get pushed around by too many entities or people,” he said.
Alaska does significant trade with China, namely in seafood products, though that’s diminished since President Donald Trump began levying tariffs during his first term. Still, Alaska exports more than $500 million in seafood products to China each year.
But amid China’s broader, ongoing trade war with America, experts said it’s unlikely that the country will target Alaska with retaliatory action even if the LNG project moves forward with Taiwanese partnership.
“I think this is probably fairly low on China’s list of priorities. They have a lot on their plate,” said David Sacks, an expert on Taiwan and China and a fellow for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Sacks described the Chinese correspondence with Dunleavy’s office as “pretty pro forma,” even if it sounds strident. He also said there’s nothing unusual about an American governor or legislator traveling to Taiwan — and he noted that other states, like Arizona, have done robust business with Taiwanese firms without prompting a backlash from China.
“I think it would be fairly unprecedented for the Chinese to take aggressive action here that specifically targets Alaska,” he said.
Dunleavy’s trip to Taiwan last month came amid a new push by his administration to recruit investment in the $44 billion LNG development. Top Trump administration officials have also been touting the project to Asian allies, and a private firm, Glenfarne, has taken over leadership of the development from a state agency.
Dunleavy’s trip also included stops in Thailand, South Korea and Japan, where he met with politicians and corporate executives.
But his Taiwan visit garnered the most headlines. In Taipei, Dunleavy met for an hour with President Lai Ching-te and held a lunch with the vice president, according to his schedule. He also met with officials from Taipower, the country’s primary electric utility, and from the state-owned oil and gas company, CPC.

	CPC has signed a nonbinding letter of intent to buy one-third of the LNG produced by the Alaska project, and the letter also contemplates investment in the development, according to a description by officials from the state’s gas pipeline agency. The letter itself is confidential, according to the agency.
Promoters of Alaska’s LNG project, including Dunleavy and Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, say that investment in and purchases of gas from the development can provide Asian allies with a secure source of fuel — with a shorter transit time than shipments from the Middle East. Importing Alaska gas would also lower Taiwan’s trade deficit with the U.S., which could curry favor with Trump.
But it’s still far from certain that the project will be built. Alaska’s government has spent decades studying construction of a gas line, and the current iteration of the project has been dogged by projected high costs.
Taiwanese investment in the project, and any American engagement with the island’s government, also risk pushback from China.
In a prepared statement to Northern Journal, the spokesman for China’s embassy in Washington, D.C., Liu Pengyu, called Taiwan “an inalienable part of China’s territory” and urged “the relevant U.S. side” to cease all forms of official contact with Taiwan. 
“China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the United States and Taiwan, under any pretext or in any capacity,” the statement said.
Dunleavy, in the interview, said he did not know how the Chinese government became aware of his visit to the island. 
They “wanted me to abort the trip, apparently,” he said.
Dunleavy would not directly say whether he recognizes Taiwan’s sovereignty, calling that “the biggest loaded question.”
“These are human beings, 23 million people. They would like to have a great relationship with the United States,” he said. “We want to sell energy. They want energy. I’d love to partner.”
Alaska has a long history of trade with Taiwan, and other state officials have traveled there in recent years, including two state senators in 2024. Former Gov. Frank Murkowski has visited more than a dozen times, including as an observer of one of Taiwan’s presidential elections.
The Chinese response to Dunleavy’s trip, first reported by conservative news site Must Read Alaska, is “pretty boilerplate,” said Sacks, the expert from the Council of Foreign Relations. 
But its “ominous” language could also be an attempt by the Chinese to ward off business dealings in Taiwan by an American official who’s not well-versed in the island’s tense political dynamics, Sacks added, in comments that were echoed by a statement from the U.S. Department of State.
“Around the world, including in the United States, the Chinese Communist Party attempts to leverage economic and diplomatic pressure to try to prevent officials from interacting with Taiwan,” the statement said. “Robust cooperative activities with Taiwan, including by state leaders, are consistent with U.S. policy.” 
The statement added that the letter of intent from CPC “is another example of the longstanding, deep, and growing trade and investment ties between the United States and Taiwan, which create American jobs and mutual prosperity.”
Sacks said he sees the LNG project as being in America’s interests — both because of its potential to reduce Taiwan’s trade deficit and to give its people a more reliable supply of energy. 
But while Sacks described the risk of repercussions to Alaska as low, he also wouldn’t completely rule them out. He pointed to a recent move by China instructing the nation’s airlines to stop accepting deliveries of jets made by Boeing. 
“The context might change now, because the Chinese are looking for ways — in a way that they weren’t before — to punish the Trump administration for the tariffs,” Sacks said. “I wouldn’t foreclose that.”

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Photo by Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.
In Iowa, 14% of the state’s K-12 budget was funded by the federal government in 2022, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, with a total of $1.13 billion.
DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.











There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher



Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Photo by Lanny Hartmann)In 2023, Gov. Wes Moore joined Maryland to California’s Advanced Clean Cars II program, pledging to slash greenhouse gas emissions by phasing out gasoline vehicle sales by 2035. Barely two years later, he signed an executive order delaying penalties for these Zero-Emission Vehicle Goals, blaming insufficient charging infrastructure.
The real culprit? A large portion of Maryland’s public chargers are utility-owned and routinely broken — mocking the drivers who rely on them and the ratepayers who funded them.
Since 2019, the Maryland Public Service Commission has let utilities like BGE, Pepco, Delmarva Power, Potomac Edison and SMECO operate public EV chargers in a pilot program now nearing its end. BGE alone spent $15 million installing chargers at libraries, parks and government buildings.
The utilities vowed these stations would match the reliability of their electric grid. Instead, they’ve delivered a charging disaster. Now, they want four more years — and more ratepayer cash — to keep it limping along.

The utilities’ pitch in 2018 was simple: Give us millions, and we’ll build a dependable electric vehicle network. But drivers know the truth: These chargers are often down. Worse, utilities outsourced most operations to third-party contractors. When a charger fails, EV drivers don’t call BGE for a quick fix — they’re stuck dialing a “network provider,” where complaints vanish into a virtual black hole, sometimes taking months to resolve. This isn’t service; it’s abandonment.
In 2023, the General Assembly demanded accountability, passing House Bill 834, the Electric Vehicle Charging Reliability Act, requiring 97% uptime, backed by quarterly reports and penalties for failure. Two years on, the Public Service Commission has yet to see those reports. Drivers, meanwhile, feel reliability worsening.
Moore’s executive order, citing the very infrastructure utilities failed to deliver, only deepens the distrust — easing pressure on automakers instead of fixing the public charging networks.
Fed up, I joined 12 other Maryland EV drivers to survey every fast charger statewide. Our Maryland Fast Charger Survey visited 304 locations, testing over 1,000 ports.
Tesla, running more than half of Maryland’s fast chargers, delivered 99.6% availability — 541 of 543 ports worked. BGE? A measly 33% (30 of 90 chargers operational). Delmarva Power’s Eastern Shore network was the worst at 31% (4 of 13). These aren’t chargers; They’re proof utilities can’t deliver.
Now, utilities propose bigger budgets for a second phase of the pilot program, funneling more money to contractors for obsolete chargers. Unlike Tesla’s stations—built near 24-hour stores with 8 to 16 plugs pumping up to 325 kW—most utility chargers are stuck at 50 kW, often with just one or two ports. They’re not at vibrant hubs but in desolate corners of parking lots, like behind state office buildings.
Why pour millions into slow, outdated chargers nobody wants to use?
Moore’s order admits the infrastructure isn’t ready, but after six years, that’s no excuse — it’s a failure of leadership. Utilities have had time and money to build a network that works. Instead, they’ve squandered trust and dollars.
The Public Service Commission must end this failed experiment, redirect funds to proven models like supporting commercial charger programs, and demand Moore recommit to Zero-Emission Vehicle Goals with infrastructure that delivers. Marylanders deserve better than broken chargers and weak promises. It’s time to pull the plug.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54447410884_ae7daf624d_k-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-19 09:02:08.318787

(Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)Five years of COVID-era relief for federally-insured mortgages has helped millions of American homeowners retain their properties, while artificially inflating home prices and leading to the potential for Bubble 2.0, insist some experts who are hailing a decision from President Donald Trump’s administration, announced Tuesday, to end one program in September.
The move comes after President Joe Biden, days before leaving office, instructed the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to make the relief efforts permanent.
Critics of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) COVID relief policy, which allows the agency to front payments on behalf of troubled borrowers, say it’s keeping unqualified borrowers in their homes without making a payment for two to three years, and delaying scarce inventory from going on the market.
COVID-era mortgage relief, initiated by Trump in 2020 and extended by Biden in 2021, “has created another subprime housing bubble and put taxpayers at risk. Trump should end it,” says a February editorial in the Wall Street Journal. “Under the guise of Covid relief, the Biden administration masked the growing troubles in the housing market by paying off borrowers and mortgage servicers to prevent foreclosures. Of the 52,531 FHA loans last year that went seriously delinquent within their first year, only nine resulted in foreclosure.”
  Historical foreclosures in U.S. (Courtesy: ATTOM Data)
Nationwide one in every 1,515 housing units had a foreclosure filing in the first quarter of 2025, reports ATTOM Data, a real estate analyst.  Nevada ranked third in the nation for the highest rate of foreclosure filings (behind Delaware and Illinois) with one filing for every 874 housing units.
By comparison, in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, one in 14 Nevada homes received a default notice.
‘Canary in the coal mine’
The national delinquency rate for all mortgages, which topped 10% during the Great Recession, has been rising for more than a year and edged up to 3.53% in February, according to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), a housing finance company.
FHA mortgages, which make up less than 15% of all active home loans, but allow higher debt ratios and smaller down payments than other loans, accounted for 90% of the 131,000 home loans that went delinquent last year, ICE reports.
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, tweeted last month the FHA delinquency rate is “Leading Indicator #2,” behind only consumer confidence on his recession watch, calling it “a proverbial canary in the coal mine…”
“Not that the financial troubles of FHA borrowers are enough to push the economy into recession. Indeed, high and middle-income mortgage borrowers are having no trouble making their payments at this time – the gap between the FHA delinquency rate and those on Fannie and Freddie loans has never been as large,” Zandi wrote. “But if the economy is headed for trouble, it is FHA borrowers who will signal it first. And they are.”
FHA loans, which are targeted to low-credit, first-time buyers, are a popular option for Nevada borrowers. In 2024, FHA served 766,942 new borrowers nationwide, including just under 11,000 in Nevada, according to its annual report.
Additionally, some 3,500 Nevadans have received assistance via federal relief programs in the last three years, according to the website for the Nevada Affordable Home Assistance Corporation’s (NAHAC), which administers relief programs for some 80 lenders.
‘Extend and pretend’ 
The COVID relief program allows FHA to make payments, called partial claims, (‘partial’ because the payment is not covering the entire debt) on behalf of delinquent borrowers, and add the amount fronted by the government to the back end of the loan, interest free. The FHA payments on behalf of borrowers cannot exceed 30% of a loan’s unpaid principal balance.
“Consider a borrower who misses five $4,000 monthly mortgage payments,” says the WSJ editorial. “The servicer will add the $20,000 in missed payments to the mortgage and reduce monthly payments by $1,000 for three years—adding another $36,000 to their mortgage. So the borrower is $56,000 deeper in debt, though with no additional interest.”
Mortgage expert John Comiskey projects the FHA “made ~2.6 billion dollars in mortgage payments from these stand alone partial claims last year.” Records analyzed by Comiskey indicate some borrowers made no payments for several years, with the FHA stepping in to bring their loans current every three to four months.
Comiskey, who calls the effort “an abject FHA loss mitigation policy failure,” tweeted last month that about 70% of some 160,000 FHA Covid relief modifications originated during the past two years are delinquent, and about 55% are seriously delinquent.
“The extend and pretend music is still playing for these mortgages, though that music now has an end date, and when it stops many of these mortgages will head to foreclosure,” Comiskey wrote last month. On Wednesday, the day after HUD’s announcement, he predicted the end of FHA loss mitigation “will start hitting housing transactions in early ‘26 with maybe some precursor effect late this year.”
“Let’s not forget the reason why most of these people are in trouble. It’s not because they make bad decisions like in 2008,” says longtime Las Vegas Realtor Steve Hawks, referring to borrowers who purchased multiple properties with no-money-down loans. “They’re in trouble because they can’t afford the cost of living. The home they bought for $300,000 is now $550,000. Their property taxes and home insurance have gone up. The cost of maintenance has gone through the roof. They’re using credit cards for everyday expenses.”
It’s unknown how many Nevada homeowners will be affected.
“FHA does not have publicly available information on its home retention solutions by state or dollar amount,” a HUD spokesperson said via email.
Hawks projects Nevada’s phantom inventory of homes with non-performing loans, but no public record of default, could be in the tens of thousands.
“It’s not rocket science,” he says, adding the writing was on the wall when home prices soared and inventory dropped in 2021 and 2022. “A lot of people that were going to sell took their houses off the market,” and opted for loan modification and forbearance programs.

FHA officials contend the relief has worked, and maintain it is fronting payments on behalf of a small percentage of borrowers. The measures “have proven to be effective in helping struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and reduce losses,” FHA Commissioner Julia Gordan said just days before Biden left office.
From April of 2020 through September 2024, some 1.7 million FHA borrowers took part in COVID-19 forbearance, according to the agency’s 2024 annual report to Congress. Of those, 77% were able to get back on track, either paying off their loan or becoming current on their mortgages. Some 371,000 borrowers (22%) remained in delinquency or forbearance.
As of September 2024, FHA held active mortgage insurance on 7.81 million single family mortgage loans. The share of FHA borrowers who are seriously delinquent stood at 4.15% in September 2024, a slight increase from a year ago but consistent with rates seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Of some 425,000 loss mitigation actions reported by FHA to Congress in its 2024 annual report, just under 324,000 were partial claims.
Loan servicers receive a monetary incentive for participating in the relief program – between $500 and $1,750 every time the FHA steps up on behalf of borrowers.
“The FHA made 556,841 ‘incentive payments’ to servicers over the past year to prevent foreclosures—nearly as many as the new mortgages it insured,” says the WSJ editorial. “Government-backed mortgage relief has become a cash cow for servicers, some of which originated the risky loans they are paid not to foreclose. Moral hazard, anyone?”
Las Vegas real estate expert Tony Ricco says he contacted an FHA lender in an attempt to buy delinquent loans but was turned down. “Why would they sell them? They’re getting paid by the federal government on non-performing loans.”
Ricco says the level of manipulation in the housing market is preventing “true price discovery” and “is skewing housing to be unaffordable.”
The end of FHA loss mitigation could see “some additional homes entering the market from the seller’s side as either those borrowers are forced to sell to avoid foreclosure or once the foreclosure is complete,” says Nicholas Irwin, Research Director at UNLV’s Lied Center for Real Estate. “The tricky part is that foreclosed homes become HUD homes and I don’t know how quick the process is from foreclosure to on the market.”
Additional housing supply results in downward pressure on prices, Irwin says. “How much of an effect will depend on how many folks are impacted in our area.”
Unlike 2008, when most properties were privately held, government-sponsored entities such as FHA, the Veterans Administration, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, have skin in the game on about half of all mortgages.
“The government’s not going to foreclose on these people just to put them on another relief program,” Hawks said. “That’s why they’ve been letting them go for this long.”

Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, said after the bill’s passage that it potentially violates children’s constitutional rights, particularly free speech.
“When you start talking about fundamental rights. I think that’s going to be something that’s going to be challenged in courts too, in terms of whether or not — the constitutionality of — can you make kids listen to that on a daily basis, who may not want to and refuse,” Singleton said.
He also opposed making it a constitutional amendment, saying it would be “a forever permanent piece of law,” which he said was unnecessary. He said lawmakers should instead be focused on creating jobs and improving education in the state.
“I, too, am America, but do I have to love something that talks about me and the history of my slavery, that degrades me and my people? No, I don’t. So why make children have to sing that in school?” Singleton asked.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.












The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology




Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Photo courtesy of Washington State Department of Transportation)A creative plan in the Washington Legislature to raise billions of dollars to pay for the court-ordered removal of fish passage barriers appears to be a pipe dream, for this year at least. 
With just over a week until the scheduled end of the legislative session, the state Senate’s bipartisan proposal to borrow up to $5 billion to eliminate culverts faces, well, barriers on several fronts. 
Cities and counties fear missing out on state dollars for water, sewer and other projects that would be diverted to repay the culvert-removal bonds. 
And the governor’s office says the plan is coming at a bad time, given broad economic uncertainty.
The measure looked to help fulfill the state’s obligations under a 2013 federal injunction that the U.S. Supreme Court later upheld.
A judge found the state violated tribes’ treaty fishing rights by installing poorly designed and maintained culverts, typically pipes under roads or other infrastructure meant to allow water to flow. The judge’s order forced the state to pay to correct these barriers that impede salmon and steelhead migration in western Washington. 
The target has been to open up 90% of the habitat that culverts have long blocked by 2030. 
The state’s transportation department has estimated needing to address another 300 barriers to hit the benchmark. The most expensive remaining culvert projects range from $80 million to $240 million.
So last year, state officials returned to court to acknowledge they couldn’t meet the goal, as project costs have skyrocketed, and new barriers have been found.
The state and the 21 tribes that brought the original lawsuit are now going to mediation to potentially figure out a new path, recognizing Washington’s financial reality. 
Lawmakers hoped the cash infusion would show a good-faith effort to comply with the order as mediation begins. But opposition to the bond proposal appears insurmountable. 
“The state obviously has an obligation to meet,” said Rep. Steve Tharinger, D-Port Townsend, the House’s capital budget lead. “The question is how.”
The maneuver
The state’s transportation budget has traditionally paid for culvert projects. 
But like the state’s operating budget, transportation faces a major shortfall over the next few years. And the capital budget for construction projects is healthier, so senators moved the culvert funding over. 
This allowed the Senate transportation budget writers to cut in half their projected $8 billion shortfall over the next six years.
The transportation budget proposal from House Democrats does not include such a funding flip, instead earmarking more than $5 billion over the current budget and the next three budget cycles to pay for barrier elimination. The two chambers are currently negotiating over transportation funding.
The $5 billion in new bonds included in Senate Bill 5804, unveiled late last month, wouldn’t have to go toward state culvert removals specifically. The money could be used for both local and state projects identified as necessary through mediation. 
Even after the state removes its culverts, other downstream and upstream barriers continue to block fish passage and thwart Washington’s progress. 
Lawmakers looked to repay the bonds with revenue from an existing tax on electrical utilities that usually goes toward grants and loans for local public works departments. 
Enter the first concern: Local governments worry the redirection would threaten ongoing state money specifically set aside for their public works projects.  
The proposal’s supporters take issue with that critique. 
Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, said “some people are screaming wolf,” noting the capital budget proposal he helped write backfills the hole in public works money with $150 million in other bonds, for a total earmark of $250 million.
But Gov. Bob Ferguson has also snubbed the scheme. 
A letter from his budget director tells lawmakers that “given market uncertainty and volatile interest rates, this is not the time to explore a novel form of bonding outside of the state’s constitutional debt limit.”
The bonds the bill authorizes are separate from the “general obligation” bonds the state otherwise commonly uses. The usual bonds have low interest rates because they’re backed by the “full faith, credit, and taxing power of the state,” under the state Constitution. The proposed bonds are not, so they would carry higher borrowing costs.
The input disappointed Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma. 
“My hope would’ve been that the governor would’ve been more enthused about this path forward,” she said, noting Ferguson was attorney general when the court case was decided.
Estimates from the state treasurer’s office also raised doubts that the utility tax could even generate the revenue necessary to service $5 billion in new debt.
Schoesler said he’s waiting for his colleagues to offer an alternative solution to what he described as “one of the biggest financial challenges” facing the state. 
“Show me a better idea,” he said.

 Some of the donations are connected to companies that will be policed by the agency Long has been nominated to run.
According to recently filed financial disclosures, which were first reported on by the investigative journalism site The Lever, Long only raised roughly $36,000 in the last two years. 
He was named as President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the IRS in December, and in January received $137,000 in donations. He then paid back the remaining $130,000 in debt from a $250,000 loan he made to his unsuccessful 2022 U.S. Senate campaign.
The donations, and their timing, have renewed criticism of Long’s appointment, which still awaits Senate confirmation. Senate Democrats have already called for a criminal investigation of firms with ties to Long that they allege are involved in fraudulent tax credit schemes. 
Among the donors to Long’s campaign are financial advisers from some of those firms.
“When they told Billy he’d be in charge of revenue collection, did they forget to tell him that meant for the American people, not his own bank account?” said Sean Nicholson, a longtime progressive activist and campaign consultant in Missouri. 
Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for the liberal watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the timing of the donations and the “explicit knowledge that they’d end up directly in Long’s bank account, it’s hard to see them as anything other than an attempt to curry favor with the future head of the IRS.”
Long did not respond to a request for comment. 
Billy Long, Trump’s nominee to lead IRS, touts credential tax experts say is dubious

After a career as an auctioneer and conservative radio host, Long served six terms representing a Southwest Missouri congressional district. He gave up his seat to run for U.S. Senate in 2022, losing in the GOP primary to now-Sen. Eric Schmitt. 
Long then worked for Lifetime Advisors and earned at least $5,000 in income from White River Energy. Both companies have drawn scorn from Senate Democrats, and intense media scrutiny, over their involvement in controversial tax credit programs. 
In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a limit on the amount of post-election funds a candidate can use to pay back personal loans. The majority found the limit an unconstitutional restriction on the freedom of speech, while the dissenting justices argued removing it would pave the way for political corruption.  
“Even if our broken campaign finance system allows this behavior,” Libowitz said, “it raises serious questions about future conflicts of interest and needs to be addressed in any hearings (Billy Long) has before Congress.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/candidatefilingday02222022000026-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-19 07:05:57.798734

Yet, all children and families are stretched thin, doing their best in systems that weren’t built for everyone to succeed—especially those who have been historically left behind.
Child maltreatment is a preventable, solvable, public issue when we invest in support and services for families when they need them. But for every $10 the U.S. spends on child welfare, only $1.50 goes toward primary prevention. That means most funding goes toward reacting after abuse or neglect has already happened—when investing earlier could strengthen families and give all children the nurturing, positive childhoods they deserve.
April is Child Abuse Prevention Month and it’s a time to promote the positive solutions that strengthen families and build strong foundations for children. This year’s campaign theme is Powered by Hope, Strengthened by Prevention. HOPE stands for Healthy Outcomes from Positive Experiences. Positive Childhood Experiences (PCEs) are experiences in childhood that build a child’s sense of belonging and connection. Studies indicate that the absence of positive experiences has a bigger impact on our health and wellbeing than the presence of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).
And we do feel hopeful this Child Abuse Prevention Month.
North Carolina Governor Josh Stein recently proposed over half a billion dollars in targeted tax relief to help working families cover the high costs of child care and other essential expenses that come with raising children, including:

Working families tax credit – 20% of federal Earned Income Tax Credit, worth up to $1,600
Child Tax Credit – Up to $300 for family of four
Child & Dependent Care Tax Credit – up to $600 for family of four
Back to school tax holiday

These proposals from the Governor are aligned with Positive Childhood Alliance North Carolina’s policy priorities and the positive experiences we hope to grow for all North Carolina children and families.
Just like no family can do it alone, neither can one single organization or agency. We urge the community to let your legislators know how these investments can strengthen families and prevent child abuse. It takes all of us—families, communities, policymakers, and organizations working together in partnership by:

Focusing on community-based solutions, such as local organizations like Family Resource Centers supporting families where they live.
Connecting families with support systems and building networks to support families and strengthen communities.
Advocating for policy change with programs and policies that help all children and families thrive– like affordable childcare, paid leave, and financial stability.

When parents and caregivers are overloaded with stress from financial insecurity, lack of health care, unstable housing, or the high cost of childcare, it’s like a car carrying too much weight—eventually, it breaks down. That overload of stress can then lead to a cascade of other problems including substance use, depression, and mental illness, some of the other major risk factors for maltreatment.
We must advance policies and practices that create the conditions proven by research to reduce the risk of maltreatment—because responding after harm has occurred is not enough. Addressing root causes by providing concrete support for parents is one of five protective factors proven to lower the risk of child maltreatment. Solutions such as paid family leave, housing assistance, and affordable childcare lightens the load and better equips parents to ensure their children’s well-being.
In addition, research shows that for every $1,000 that states invest in families living in poverty, Child Protective Service rates, foster care entries, and child fatalities drop. To reduce the number of children entering our child welfare system, which is also stressed and overloaded, we must invest in creating positive environments and experiences for families so that their children can thrive.
The bottom line: financial stability is foundational. By ensuring all families have access to support before challenges become crises, we can create a future filled with hope and opportunity.

Therefore, the relevant question we must ask ourselves writ large is this: is our goal as a society true justice or simply punishment? 
Research by pioneering psychologists like Erikson and Piaget is so respected that it is routinely taught in psychology textbooks. Although not indicated by name, that foundational research and the court’s indication that the neuroplasticity of a developing brain before the age of 25, as well as relevant case law, was instrumental in the decision to disallow the affected age group to be automatically sentenced to life without parole for first degree murder (building on the 2022 decision regarding 18-year-olds).  
Utilizing prevailing research as a component of legal decision-making is a win for logic, reasoning, and science but the dissenting opinion of the decision cannot be ignored. The dissent, penned by Chief Justice Clement, indicated that first degree murder is a grave offense, and, a “…punishment of great severity is therefore proportionate,” while also indicating that the majority decision focuses on examining the offender and not the offense.  
Therein lies the issue with what we tell ourselves, as a society, about how and why we incarcerate and hints at the reasoning behind the United States leading all developed nations in per capita prison populations.  Especially in Michigan. 
This is all rooted in the notion that we, as a society, view ourselves as a rehabilitative one that values change and personal responsibility… in theory. Faith-based and popular media stories routinely feature redemption arcs of men and women that have committed heinous crimes and acts but can find a place in society through change and sacrifice.  
The belief in these redemption arcs seem to end with Michigan’s prison population wherein, much like the dissenting opinion, a blanket punitive sentence is applied regardless of the rehabilitative potential of the offender. In large part based off the “tough on crime” rhetoric of the 1990s, the state is left with a prison population serving long sentences far greater than the majority of other states. The Council on Criminal Justice (2023) indicated that 66% of Michigan’s prison population is serving 10+ years based on 2016 releases and the average sentence is 20 years, which is much higher than most other states.  
It appears that we have not only given up the idea of rehabilitative incarceration but moved in the exact opposite direction. To date, the youngest ‘juvenile lifer’ in the state was Dontez Tillman. He was sentenced in 2011 at the age of 17 to life without parole for participating in the murder of a homeless man with friends where he was first arrested and in the system at 14. In 2025, he is now 30 years old. While Tillman was subsequently resentenced in 2015 to a term of 32-and-a-half to 60 years in prison, the earliest he could be set free is 2041.
If we continue to apply that blanket approach to sentencing and noting that only these long sentences can keep our communities safe, then are we to throw out the entirety of research on the matter, our purported belief in the ability for one to redeem themselves, and basic common sense? 
Although I have never met Mr. Tillman, I have encountered and worked in an academic and forensic setting with many men and women who are currently serving very long sentences for crimes committed in their youth. I would hazard that Mr. Tillman is a functionally different person than he was when he was in his adolescence. Recrimination and remorse are routinely part of an incarcerated person’s daily existence, but the system that we have in place does not have a mechanism to recognize that. If one can grow, learn, and become fundamentally changed in one environment, then that should apply to all environments… including our prison system. 
In addition, think of the standard brain development the court used to base the recent decision on. Brain development and socialization are not standardized, of course, but Piaget, Erikson, and others have mapped out general stages. However, some differences are common. This is under the assumption that development and socialization take place in an average society. What if, like Mr. Tillman and many others, that development takes place in a prison environment? 
There are no predictors on what incarceration does on brain development for adolescents, but the effects of incarceration on adults are startling. A rehabilitant society would never entertain the thought of allowing young people who have made terrible mistakes and choices to simply rot and, essentially, grow up in one of the most violent and hopeless landscapes imaginable.  
Yet, fear still pervades our societal view, and that fear means we must do whatever possible to ensure our safety. Just as long as that safety does not involve investing in the future of groups of people that we have already labeled as ‘monsters’ or ‘evil’. The use of those terms is low-hanging fruit for fearmongers, allowing an arbitrary, and largely fantastical, definition of a word to become the reasoning for disallowing a person to grow beyond what is ofttimes a single, horrible decision on a single, horrible day.  
As it stands, long prison sentences do nothing to actually make Michigan safer. They are not a deterrent to crime, quite obviously, and only function to punish without recourse. We only talk the rehabilitative game. 
Kudos to the Michigan Supreme Court for the current decision, but it does little to address the larger, systemic issues in sentencing in Michigan. As a society, allowing this decision to alleviate whatever pangs of guilt are felt whenever we see that our courts, much like an overzealous bartender, over serve justice to the cheers of voters is dangerous. I fear most people would agree with Chief Justice Clement’s dissent.

Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's pick for HHS secretary, appears at his nomination hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Jan. 29, 2025. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)After the Senate voted to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary, supporters of his “Make America Healthy Again” movement cheered at having a champion in the federal government.
Now the grumbling has begun. Some of Kennedy’s allies say he’s become almost inaccessible since his confirmation and complain that he’s made glacial progress advancing MAHA goals, such as halting mRNA-based COVID shots and removing fluoride from drinking water.
The fractures underscore the clash between Kennedy’s movement and President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agenda. Kennedy is pulled between his supporters who want swift action to disrupt traditional health care and Trump, who is focused more on tariffs and increasing deportations than on disease, according to four people close to Kennedy who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. Many of the priorities driving Kennedy’s MAHA program are not top priorities of his boss.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Kennedy’s capacity to navigate those tensions has been further strained by a measles outbreak and the threat of a bird flu pandemic, the people said.
Some of his deputies are still being vetted and other key positions remain unfilled. That, along with resignations of top HHS leaders and sweeping staffing reductions, has created a gap in expertise. Kennedy sometimes calls close informal advisers on the run before meetings, and the crises have put him in a reactionary stance, working on weekends and marshaling staff for Sunday meetings, according to the people.
More churn is coming because of an HHS reorganization set to eliminate about 20,000 jobs, including a 19% cut to the workforce at the FDA, which oversees food, nutrition, and vaccines.
HHS spokespeople didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.
To be sure, Kennedy’s ascendance represents a breakthrough for the MAHA movement, a broad collection of gadflies, groups, and wellness influencers who extol raw milk, metabolic health, and sustainable farming while lambasting Big Pharma, vaccines, and processed foods.
The coming months will test Kennedy’s ability to juggle the challenges and achieve Trump’s goals without losing the support of MAHA adherents, especially special interest and advocacy groups that helped him reach his influential perch overseeing one of the nation’s largest federal agencies. HHS, with a budget of almost $2 trillion, includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
But the MAHA goals aren’t top agenda items for GOP voters, who tend to be focused more on the price of eggs than whether they’re organic.
The MAHA faithful “expect action” but their to-do list is not necessarily a high priority for voters or lawmakers, said Robert Blendon, a professor emeritus of health policy and political analysis at Harvard. “And should there be a big measles outbreak or avian flu, it would hurt the White House if there was a big conflict over vaccines going on,” he said.
An additional challenge for Kennedy is that not all MAHA and MAGA goals overlap. Trump wants to slash the workforce, which Kennedy has embraced. But fulfilling MAHA wishes will require more regulation, which runs counter to MAGA dogma favoring a smaller federal government.
MAHA wants fluoride out of water because followers say it leads to lower IQ levels in children, as well as arthritis and bone cancer. Kennedy said on X that fluoride is dangerous and that the Trump administration would recommend it be removed from America’s drinking water. Fluoridated water is credited for vastly reducing rates of tooth decay in the U.S. In 2015, the CDC called water fluoridation one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century, and only 15% of Americans think fluoride is harmful or detrimental to the public, based on a poll in January by market research company Ipsos.

MAHA adherents believe in the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, and Kennedy just tapped a vaccine opponent to work on a study on possible connections. In fact, HHS has launched an effort that Kennedy said will determine by September what has caused the “autism epidemic.” Many autism researchers say this timeline sows doubts about the study’s seriousness. Most voters support vaccines and believe in their benefits. Eight in 10 parents with children under age 18 say they normally keep them up to date with recommended childhood vaccines, according to a KFF poll in January.
And MAHA wants to replace seed oils, which the movement’s followers claim without evidence are unhealthy, with animal fats such as beef tallow, which is high in saturated fat, which can contribute to high cholesterol and heart disease. Only 13% of Americans believe seed oils are unhealthy to consume, based on a poll by the industry-backed International Food Information Council.
Perhaps no goal is more important to many MAHA followers, however, than banning the mRNA technology behind covid vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer.
“The big threat is that we still have covid-19 vaccines on the market,” said Peter McCullough, a former cardiologist who has been criticized for spreading covid misinformation and has informally advised Kennedy. “It’s horrendous. I would not hesitate; I would just pull it. What’s he waiting for?”
The FDA says COVID shots are safe. They are credited for saving millions of lives worldwide during the pandemic, and two NIH-funded scientists who advanced mRNA technology were awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2023.
Yanking authority for mRNA-based covid vaccines could backfire because Trump sees “Operation Warp Speed,” the federal effort to develop the shots, as one of his signature achievements, according to one of the people close to Kennedy. And it would have been impolitic to take action before the confirmation of an FDA commissioner, the person said. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins University researcher, was confirmed on March 25 to the post.
Kennedy also isn’t calling all the shots. He was initially unaware of the appointment of Gerald Parker, a veterinarian who recently chaired an NIH advisory board, to head the White House’s pandemic office, according to one of the people.
Kennedy did choose Susan Monarez, a former deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, as acting CDC director. Trump nominated her for Senate confirmation to lead the agency on March 24. Kennedy felt she had worked well with Trump’s job-cutting Department of Government Efficiency and did a great job in her acting director position, one of the people close to him said.
Kennedy is also in a difficult position regarding Trump’s Make America Healthy Again commission, which Kennedy chairs. The panel’s charge to investigate and deliver an action plan on the nation’s decades-long increase in chronic illness, with a special emphasis on children, is a clear pitch to the MAHA movement. But Trump has told Kennedy, according to one of the people, that he wants to see measurable progress in a year to 18 months — which is hard both to define and to achieve.
While Kennedy is a scion of the country’s most famous Democratic family, he is widely distrusted in the medical community because of his fringe views on vaccines and his rejection of established science. Since taking office, he has tried to cultivate relationships with MAGA-leaning state officials, including West Virginia’s governor, Republican Patrick Morrisey. And his alliance with Trump is new. When Kennedy was running for president in 2024, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to say, “Kennedy is a Radical Left Democrat, and always will be!!!” — though Trump’s administration includes other onetime adversaries such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Many of Kennedy’s nutrition and health goals would require regulation, which clash with Trump’s anti-regulatory agenda and his focus on a lean federal government.
Meanwhile, he’s relied on his principal deputy chief of staff, Stefanie Spear, a longtime Kennedy aide who has taken on the role of traffic cop in the department. He’s also leaned on HHS chief of staff Heather Flick Melanson for expertise. She was a senior adviser to former HHS Secretary Alex Azar in Trump’s first term.
Kennedy’s close circle of informal advisers includes nontraditional doctors, fellow vaccine opponents, media personalities, and self-appointed health gurus. Some have gained unprecedented influence and access to the innermost workings of federal health agencies.
Calley Means, for example, is a Kennedy ally whose business sells wellness products such as saunas and supplements. His statements have dismayed some scientists, such as when he called covid vaccine mandates for children a “war crime” and said without evidence that “metabolically healthy” people don’t die from covid. In March, Means joined the White House as a special government employee and MAHA adviser.
Others in Kennedy’s orbit include Del Bigtree, a television producer who founded the anti-vaccination group Informed Consent Action Network, and some officials from the previous Trump administration. Aaron Siri, a lawyer for Kennedy, is no longer involved in vetting candidates for HHS positions, one of the people said.
“‘Nontraditional’ as a description for these people is not enough. We’re talking about beyond the outer fringes of medicine,” said Irwin Redlener, senior adviser for the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, of Kennedy’s inner circle. “This faux expertise is really dangerous.”
Even as some MAHA adherents press for swifter action, Kennedy’s recent comments and actions suggest public health ideas once dismissed as fringe or unscientific now have an advocate at HHS.
Kennedy claimed without evidence that cod liver oil is an effective treatment for measles. He’s suggested letting the bird flu virus rip unchecked through infected chicken flocks even though scientists say that could unleash dangerous mutations.
And he’s backed cellphone bans in schools, saying phones cause cancer in kids. Most studies have found no such link.

Matthew Ariwoola, 32, was a fourth-year doctoral chemistry student at USC, scheduled to graduate in December. But on April 8, USC staff informed Ariwoola he could not continue studying and teaching due to a change in his immigration status.
U.S. District Judge Jacquelyn Austin granted a temporary order late Friday to prevent Ariwoola’s detention or deportation while the case makes its way through the court system.
In the order, which applies for two weeks, the judge wrote the government should not stop Ariwoola from “continuing to pursue his academic and employment pursuits that he is authorized to pursue.”
Ariwoola is one in a wave of more than 1,000 international students at colleges nationwide suddenly facing the possibility of arrest and deportation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the Trump administration terminated their student visas.
In South Carolina, at least a dozen USC students, a pair of Furman University students, and some students at Clemson University have had their student visas revoked or records terminated without warning, according to Allen Chaney, the legal director of the ACLU of South Carolina who is representing Ariwoola. (Chaney said those are the students his organization knows about; there could be more.)
“Matthew is yet another victim of the Trump administration’s haphazard and flagrantly unconstitutional dragnet of our international students,” Chaney said. “It’s hard to see how ejecting a hardworking and law-abiding doctoral student is anything but the product of an unmasked hatred of non-Americans. No one is better off if Matthew is deported, no one.”
U.S. Senate GOP wants mass deportations to ‘start early’ next year, Graham says

International students enter the United States most commonly through the F-1 student visa program and are monitored through a federal database, known as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).
Once a student is granted a visa and residency status, they can typically stay in the U.S. even if that visa expires as long as they remain enrolled full time in school and aren’t convicted of a violent crime. There are also restrictions on off-campus jobs they’re authorized to take.
Ariwoola was researching ways to make medications more effective and teaching four chemistry courses at USC. He had been supporting his family through the stipend he receives from the university. Now he won’t be able to pay rent and could end up homeless, the ACLU of SC wrote.
Chaney said the federal immigration agency gave his client no warning that it intended to terminate his record.
The only reason listed in the federal database: “OTHER – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.”
“There’s no process, no notice, they’re just shipping them straight to termination,” Chaney said.
Ariwoola has never been convicted of a crime.
Police arrested him in 2023 on a warrant out of Georgia for alleged “theft by deception,” a crime which can involve the use of in-person or cyber scams to steal from a victim. But according to the ACLU, Ariwoola had never contacted the accuser and the prosecutor had dismissed all charges.
Historically, students whose visas were revoked or expired have not lost their legal residency status and could stay in the U.S. to finish school. It only prevented their leaving the U.S. and returning without reapplying.
In a similar case in Michigan involving four students from the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, lawyers from the government leaned into this, arguing in court documents filed this week that “terminating a record within SEVIS does not effectuate a visa revocation” because students can apply to have their status reinstated.
But immigration lawyers have questioned why Homeland Security terminated the records at all if it did not intend to revoke the students’ legal status.

Chaney also said applying for reinstatement involves a new set of arguments and assumes the student’s records were rightfully terminated in the first place.
“If ICE believes a student is deportable, it has the authority to initiate removal proceedings and make its case,” the ACLU of South Carolina wrote in court documents. “It cannot, however, misuse SEVIS to circumvent the law, strip students of status, and bully them into self-deporting without any process of law.”
The ACLU also argued in court documents that universities themselves could lose the ability to host any current or future international students if they fail to comply with federal regulations by allowing a student with a revoked status continue to attend.
This creates a self fulfilling prophesy, leading to visa revocation if a student can’t remain enrolled.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SC25-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-19 06:03:08.463442

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Nearly every country in the world has a central bank — a public institution that manages a country’s currency and its monetary policy. And these banks have an extraordinary amount of power. By controlling the flow of money and credit in a country, they can affect economic growth, inflation, employment and financial stability.
These are powers that many politicians — including, currently, U.S. President Donald Trump — would seemingly like to control or at least manipulate. That’s because monetary policy can provide governments with economic boosts at key times, such as around elections or during periods of falling popularity.
The problem is that short-lived, politically motivated moves may be detrimental to the long-term economic well-being of a nation. They may, in other words, saddle the economy with problems further down the line.
That is why central banks across the globe tend to receive significant leeway to set interest rates independently and free from the electoral wishes of politicians.
In fact, monetary policymaking that is data-driven and technocratic, rather than politically motivated, has since the early 1990s been seen as the gold standard of governance of national finances. By and large, this arrangement, in which central bankers keep politicians at arm’s length, has achieved its main purpose: Inflation has been relatively low and stable in countries with independent central banks, such as Switzerland or Sweden — certainly until the pandemic and war in Europe began pushing up prices globally.
In comparison, countries such as Lebanon and Egypt, where independence was never extended, or Argentina and Turkey, where it has been curtailed, have experienced more bouts of high inflation.
But despite independence being seen to work, central banks over the past decade have come under increased pressure from politicians. They hope to keep interest rates low and reap voter gratitude for a humming economy and cheap loans.
Trump is one recent example. In his first term as president, he criticized his own choice to head the U.S. Federal Reserve and demanded lower interest rates. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that tariffs are “highly likely” to trigger inflation, Trump lashed out on April 17, 2025, in an online post in which he accused Powell of being “TOO LATE AND WRONG” on interest rate cuts, while suggesting that the central banker’s “termination cannot come fast enough!”
As political economists, we are not surprised to see politicians try to exert influence on central banks. Monetary policy, even with independence, has always been political. For one thing, central banks remain part of the government bureaucracy, and independence granted to them can always be reversed — either by changing laws or backtracking on established practices.
Moreover, the reason politicians may want to interfere in monetary policy is that low interest rates remain a potent, quick method to boost an economy. And while politicians know that there are costs to besieging an independent central bank — financial markets may react negatively or inflation may flare up — short-term control of a powerful policy tool can prove irresistible.
 
Legislating independence
If monetary policy is such a coveted policy tool, how have central banks held off politicians and stayed independent? And is this independence being eroded?
Broadly, central banks are protected by laws that offer long tenures to their leadership, allow them to focus policy primarily on inflation, and severely limit lending to the rest of the government.
Of course, such legislation cannot anticipate all future contingencies, which may open the door for political interference or for practices that break the law. And sometimes central bankers are unceremoniously fired.
However, laws do keep politicians in line. For example, even in authoritarian countries, laws protecting central banks from political interference have helped reduce inflation and restricted central bank lending to the government.
In our own research, we have detailed the ways that laws have insulated central banks from the rest of the government, but also the recent trend of eroding this legal independence.
 
Politicizing appointees
Around the world, appointments to central bank leadership are political — elected politicians select candidates based on career credentials, political affiliation and, importantly, their dislike or tolerance of inflation.
But lawmakers in different countries exercise different degrees of political control.
A 2025 study shows that the large majority of central bank leaders — about 70% — are appointed by the head of government alone or with the intervention of other members of the executive branch. This ensures that the preferences of the central bank are closer to the government’s, which can boost the central bank’s legitimacy in democratic countries, but at the risk of permeability to political influence.
Alternatively, appointments can involve the legislative power or even the central bank’s own board. In the U.S., while the president nominates members of the Federal Reserve Board, the Senate can and has rejected unconventional or incompetent candidates.
Moreover, even if appointments are political, many central bankers stay in office long after the people who appointed them have been voted out. By the end of 2023, the most common length of the governors’ appointment is five years, and in 41 countries the legal mandate was six years or longer. Powell is set to stay on as Fed chair until his term expires in 2026. The Fed chair position has traditionally been protected by law, as Powell himself acknowledged in November 2024: “We’re not removable except for cause. We serve very long terms, seemingly endless terms. So we’re protected into law. Congress could change that law, but I don’t think there’s any danger of that.” But Trump’s firing of leaders of other independent federal agencies has set up a legal challenge that could affect the Fed, too.
In the 2000s, several countries shortened the tenure of their central banks’ governors to four or five years. Sometimes, this was part of broader restrictions in central bank independence, as was the case in Iceland in 2001, Ghana in 2002 and Romania in 2004.
 
The low inflation objective
As of 2023, all but six central banks globally had low inflation as their main goal. Yet many central banks are required by law to try to achieve additional and sometimes conflicting goals, such as financial stability, full employment or support for the government’s policies.
This is the case for 38 central banks that either have the explicit dual mandate of price stability and employment or more complex goals. In Argentina, for example, the central bank’s mandate is to provide “employment and economic development with social equity.”


Conflicting objectives can open central banks to politicization. In the U.S. the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. These goals are often complementary, and economists have argued that low inflation is a prerequisite for sustainable high levels of employment.
But in times of overlapping high inflation and high unemployment, such as in the late 1970s or when the COVID-19 crisis was winding down in 2022, the Fed’s dual mandate has become active territory for political wrangling.
Since 2000, at least 23 countries have expanded the focus of their central banks beyond just inflation.
 
Limits on government lending
The first central banks were created to help secure finance for governments fighting wars. But today, limiting lending to governments is at the core of protecting price stability from unsustainable fiscal spending.
History is dotted with the consequences of not doing so. In the 1960s and 1970s, for example, central banks in Latin America printed money to support their governments’ spending goals. But it resulted in massive inflation while not securing growth or political stability.
Today, limits on lending are strongly associated with lower inflation in the developing world. And central banks with high levels of independence can reject a government’s financing requests or dictate the terms of loans.
Yet over the past two decades, almost 40 countries have made their central banks less able to limit central government funding. In the more extreme examples — such as in Belarus, Ecuador or even New Zealand — they have turned the central bank into a potential financier for the government.
 
Scapegoating central bankers
In recent years, governments have tried to influence central banks by pushing for lower interest rates, making statements criticizing bank policy or calling for meetings with central bank leadership.
At the same time, politicians have blamed the same central bankers for a number of perceived failings: not anticipating economic shocks such as the 2007-09 financial crisis; exceeding their authority with quantitative easing; or creating massive inequality or instability while trying to save the financial sector.
And since mid-2021, major central banks have struggled to keep inflation low, raising questions from populist and antidemocratic politicians about the merits of an arm’s-length relationship.
But chipping away at central bank independence, as Trump appears to be doing with his open criticism of the Fed chair and implicit threats of dismissal, is a historically sure way to high inflation.

Garmatz U.S. Courthouse in Baltimore. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Education argued Friday that the department’s “Dear Colleague” letter criticizing some diversity, equity and inclusion practices was merely a reminder to schools that existing civil rights law protects white children from discrimination just as much as children from a minority group.
But to opponents, the letter represents a significant change in policy, which compels teachers to restrain their speech about diversity for fear that their schools could lose access to critical federal funding.
The arguments were part of wide-ranging hearing in U.S. District Court for Maryland over a lawsuit by the American Federation of Teachers, its Maryland chapter and the American Sociological Association seeking to block enforcement of the Feb. 14 letter, which says schools that do not comply with civil rights law “face potential loss of federal funding.”
“The government is saying, with its power of the purse: ‘We don’t like diversity, equity and inclusion,’” said Brooke Menschel, a senior attorney at Democracy Forward, who was representing the plaintiffs.
U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher did not rule Friday on the request for a preliminary injunction that would prevent the government from enforcing its “Dear Colleague” letter, but said she plans to issue a written ruling in the days ahead. A similar case is unfolding in New Hampshire, where a federal judge heard arguments Thursday from the government, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Education Association. That judge is also yet to rule.
On Friday, Gallagher peppered each side with questions on a number of grounds. Did teachers have standing to challenge rules directed at school districts and states? What type of action exactly did the letter constitute? And therefore, what procedural rules did the government have to follow in order to issue it?
At one point, Gallagher probed about how the “Dear Colleague” letter may be enforced, asking whether a school could come under investigation simply because one student reported feeling troubled by classroom discussions about the historical actions of a particular racial group.
“Some people are more sensitive to discussions in a classroom setting than others,” Gallagher said. “Where does that line get drawn?”
Brown joins another lawsuit against Trump administration, taking on Education Department

Abhishek Kambli, a Justice Department attorney, said the letter was not meant to police such classroom discussions. It was meant to address situations in which students are classified based on race, he said. He highlighted “privilege walks,” wherein participants are categorized based on advantages and disadvantages they’ve faced because of their backgrounds.
He argued that the Civil Rights Act already disallows such activities because they are discriminatory, even though the discrimination may victimize students who comprise a majority group rather than a minority.
“It’s highly unlikely that they’re going to go after a school because they taught a certain book,” Kambli said. “All this letter does is just clarify what the existing obligations are under Title VI [of the Civil Rights Act].”
“They’re trying to make the letter into something that it’s not,” Kambli said of plaintiffs.
But Menschel said that the department, through the letter, was “putting its thumb on the scale of a particular perspective,” causing reasonable teachers to fear reprisal because of particular classroom lessons, and thereby creating a chilling effect on school speech.
One passage in the letter says that “educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices.” Menschel also pointed to the department’s creation of an online portal titled “End DEI,” through which community members can report instances of discrimination.
“The name of the portal itself points to exactly their perspective, and they are trying very hard to coerce people into sharing their views — and doing so under threat of withholding funds,” Menschel said.
But Kambli argued the portal’s name was just evidence that the department has a new priority in enforcing existing civil rights law: Rooting out discrimination occurring under the guise of “DEI.”
“It is perfectly allowable for the government to have a portal that’s aimed at that particular enforcement priority,” Kambli said.
A portion of Friday’s hearing focused on whether the teachers’ groups and the American Sociological Association had legal standing to file suit and seek a preliminary injunction.
Kambli argued that the Department of Education does not directly regulate individual teachers or school administrators, but rather school districts. The teachers would have to show that they sustained a direct harm from the Feb. 14 letter in order to have standing in court, he said.
But the department has yet to open an investigation focused on something like classroom speech, Kambli said, so the educators’ fears are only hypothetical in nature.
“If they’re censoring based off of something that the DCL [Dear Colleague letter] does not say is disallowed, then that harm is self-inflicted,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In March, the department announced that it had opened investigations into dozens of colleges and universities stemming from the Dear Colleague Letter. A department news release said 45 of the schools came under investigation because they were participating in “The Ph.D Project,” which the release called “an organization that purports to provide doctoral students with insights into obtaining a Ph.D. and networking opportunities, but limits eligibility based on the race of participants.”
Six schools came under investigation for “allegedly awarding impermissible race-based scholarships,” and one is being investigated for “allegedly administering a program that segregates students on the basis of race.”
Although none of those investigations focus on classroom speech in particular, Menschel said they provide a “relevant and important backdrop” for assessing teachers’ concerns that their own classroom conversations about diversity could result in their schools being penalized by the department.
To combat claims that the issuance of the Feb. 14 letter may have violated procedural rules, including by not offering an opportunity for public comment before implementation, Kambli argued that the department only issued the letter as a courtesy to schools. The department could have started investigating instances if considered problematic applications of DEI under existing law, he said.
“We didn’t have to provide any of this anyway,” Kambli said. “We did that to put the schools on as much notice as possible.”
But, Menschel asked, if the Dear Colleague letter didn’t represent a change in policy, why did the department pull “hundreds of pages” of prior civil rights guidance documents from its public-facing website?
Kambli argued that new presidential administrations are allowed to rescind Dear Colleague letters from prior administrations, calling it a “common practice.”
Menschel also said the department’s requirement that school systems certify their compliance with the letter indicates that it is a policy change. The plaintiffs asked\ Gallagher to pause enforcement of the letter as well as the certification requirement.
Gallagher said the latter request gave her pause, because the certification process was not mentioned in the plaintiffs’ original complaint, which focused entirely on the letter because the certification process had yet to be issued by the department.
“I’m struggling with the fact that I am being asked to enter a preliminary injunction with something that is not mentioned anywhere in the complaint,” Gallagher said.
But Menschel pushed back, arguing that the certification process is a continuation of the letter itself.
“The department is just recycling the letter, in a way, and taking another step toward implementation,” Menschel said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7527-1024x860.jpg,,,2025-04-19 05:00:42.067631

(Photo by Petty Officer 1st Class Luke Pinneo/U.S. Coast Guard)Officials at the state Department of Information Technology pushed back on a new audit that raises questions about how much progress has been made on issues found in earlier reviews.
The new report updates a 2024 review that cited more than a dozen concerns, including some redacted cybersecurity issues, at the department. While some progress had been made on those issues, auditors said the department “had not resolved some or all of the recommendations” from the earlier report.
But agency officials said they had fully implemented corrective action on four and were working on others. When auditors disagreed, Acting DoIT Secretary Melissa Leaman wrote in a response letter that “there are many factual inaccuracies in the draft report that we hope are addressed prior to OLA finalizing the report.”
It is common for auditors to share a draft copy of a report with department heads so that they can respond before an audit is released to the public.
The audit team said it stands by the accuracy of its report.
“DoIT’s response notes pervasive disagreement with our conclusions and several assertions that our comments were factually inaccurate,” Legislative Auditor Brian S. Tanen, wrote in the audit. “We reviewed DoIT’s responses and stand by the facts presented … which were factually accurate based upon documentation DoIT was able to provide during our fieldwork.”
The tug-of-war comes as lawmakers in Annapolis have taken a renewed interest in DoIT, following audits and concerns that the agency is not properly overseeing major and expensive technology projects. One top lawmaker characterized the agency’s efforts as a money pit.
The March 25 review by the Office of Legislative Audits looked at November 2024 to January 2025 and found that the department “had not resolved some or all of the recommendations in the 10 non-cybersecurity related findings” in a March 2024  report, that “concluded that DoIT’s accountability and compliance rating was unsatisfactory.”
The latest review showed many the earlier recommendations still unresolved, Tanen wrote in a letter to the legislative Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee.
DoIT claimed it had corrected concerns with ensuring major projects remained on time and on budget, evaluating outside project managers hired by contractors, and providing support documentation for costs in annual reports sent to the governor and legislature.
Auditors, in the most recent review, disagreed saying the efforts were “in progress.”
In another instance, auditors raised concerns about $25 million in cybersecurity remediation work orders. The auditor said the department had not done enough to ensure that nearly $12 million in work invoiced by the vendor related to those work orders.
The department reported to auditors that the issue had been corrected. Auditors, in their report, said corrective efforts were “in progress.”
The department also did not provide any updates on a nearly $589 million technology project called MDThink. Auditors said the recommendations from an earlier audit were not fully implemented.
The department has become a source of frustration for some lawmakers, including Sens. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery) and Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore).
Both lawmakers said the agency’s “lack of clarity, authority and management and oversight really has led to poor project management, cost overruns and failures.”
One of those failures, according to Hester, was an 80% cost overrun on the MDThink project proposed by Gov. Larry Hogan (R). The senator called the resulting $588 million cost “pretty sad.”
Hester and Hershey sponsored a bill this year imposing more oversight over the agency.
The department also caught the attention of Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard). He called the agency “a mess.” He added money for IT projects has been “going down a hole in many ways and in many projects. And it’s really a shame.”
The chair at the time vowed that the situation “has got to get handled, and it’s going to get handled.”
The General Assembly passed identical bills — House Bill 738 and Senate Bill 705 — aimed at refocusing the department on major projects and ensuring compliance with recommendations from the auditor. The bill now awaits action by Gov. Wes Moore (D).
Hester and Del. Anne Kaiser (D-Montgomery), sponsor of the House bill, are co-chairs of the Joint Committee on Cybersecurity and Information Technology.
The legislation as passed imposes new oversight and reporting requirements.
A key part of the bill expands and defines the responsibilities of the department secretary on oversight of major IT projects. The bill also prohibits contracting for IT services or products that are not consistent with its master plan.
The secretary must also meet quarterly with the chief information officer of agencies or departments with planned or ongoing IT projects.
It also sets up an expert panel to advise the legislature on IT issues and requires the Senate Budget and Taxation and House Health and Government Operations committees to convene a work group to evaluate the bill and other potential changes. The work group will also determine if other actions are needed to resolve issues raised by the auditor.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1126510-newsletter-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-04-19 05:00:42.067631

(Diana Robinson Photography/Getty Images)Many Nebraskans are feeling pressure right now. Whether you’re a working parent in Scottsbluff, a small business owner in Omaha or one of the many farmers like myself in between, one word sums up the current economic mood: uncertainty.
Everyone’s watching their budgets a little more closely, wondering if they can still afford the same basic things they could a year ago.
That’s why we need our leaders in Washington, D.C., to step up. The people we elected to represent us were supposed to focus on lowering prices and making everyday goods more affordable. Instead, we’re dealing with another round of tariffs.
Just one set of tariffs, announced by President Donald Trump on April 2 — what he called “Liberation Day” — will cost the average American household about $2,100. If all of his proposed tariffs for 2025 go into effect? That number jumps to $3,800.
Pain is real
Nebraskans certainly didn’t vote in 2024 to have nearly four grand pulled out of our pockets.
The concern about costs isn’t a Republican issue or a Democrat issue: It’s an everybody issue.
Poll after poll shows the majority of voters are worried about prices. Even Trump’s own pollster found cost of living is the top concern for his supporters and swing voters. Nebraskans voted for policies that would ease inflation and let us keep more of what we earn. What we’ve gotten instead is the opposite.
The tariff-heavy approach doesn’t reflect the message many sent at the ballot box.
Inflation is already projected to go over 4% this year, and after the April tariff news, the stock market had its worst week since the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumer confidence has been dropping every month in 2025. It’s now the lowest it’s been since late 2022.
The hit to Nebraskans’ wallets is only part of the story. New tariffs are also hurting the backbone of Nebraska’s economy: agriculture.
We’re the Cornhusker State for a reason. Our corn production brings in more than $8 billion each year. But now our top export is at risk. In 2024, more than 90% of Nebraska’s corn exports went to Canada, Mexico and China, the countries being hit the hardest by these tariffs.
Agriculture always pays
This isn’t a new kind of pain for Nebraska’s farmers. Back in 2019, the Nebraska Farm Bureau said tariffs cost us $1 billion. That’s a tough pill to swallow, but for many farmers, it’s just more of the same.
Paul Krueger, a corn and soybean farmer from Bladen said it best: “Any time our country gets involved with any sort of tariffs that affect the agriculture industry, every farmer just kind of groans about that. We’re powerless to do anything except take what comes out in the wash.”
He’s right. And it’s not just farmers. It’s business owners across Nebraska who feel forgotten. While tariffs grab the spotlight, other policies that could actually help drive down costs are being pushed aside.
Take the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which would extend tax cuts that spurred the economy during the president’s first term. This key legislation still hasn’t been extended. Policies that would cut red tape to empower small businesses are also on the backburner. Crucial industries like manufacturing, which is huge for our state, seem to be being ignored.
Tariffs can have a purpose. But the way they’re being used right now doesn’t match what voters asked for. Even some of President Trump’s former advisors have said we should’ve gone with tax cuts before tariffs.
It’s not too late
That said, it’s not too late. There’s still time to put working families first, to make the economy more affordable and to follow through on the promises that got officials elected.
Nebraska’s own U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., is moving in the right direction. He introduced a bill in Congress to give more say back to Congress on trade policy. He put it simply: “The Constitution is clear … Congress has the power of tariffs and taxes and we gave some of that power to the executive branch. … In hindsight, that was a mistake.”
It’s that kind of thinking we need. It shows he’s looking out for Nebraska families, farmers and workers who just want relief from rising costs.
We don’t need more economic strain. Nebraskans voted for lower prices and a better standard of living.
It’s time for our leaders to deliver.

(Pool photo by Trent Nelson/The Salt Lake Tribune)Is Utah’s “school choice” program unconstitutional? A year after Utah’s largest teacher union sued the state over that question, a 3rd District Court judge ruled that the program known as “Utah Fits All” violates the state constitution.
The Utah Education Association had argued that the Utah Fits All program violated articles III and X of the Utah Constitution because it was a “program within the public education system that is not free and is not ‘open to all the children of Utah,’” and diverts constitutionally appropriated funds from already underfunded public schools. 
The Utah Fits All program was established in 2023, providing up to $8,000 in scholarships per eligible student to cover private schools, or homeschool curriculums. In 2024, the Utah Legislature doubled the initial appropriation of $42.5 million in ongoing income tax revenue by adding an additional $40 million. And this year, that number grew $40 million more.

The money was enough to pay for the vouchers of 10,000 students — about 80% of them are homeschooled. But, with a waitlist of 17,000 and other irregularities in the expenses reported by parents, the Legislature this year approved a series of reforms, reducing scholarship amounts of homeschooled students to $4,000 a year for students ages 5 to 11 and $6,000 for ages 12 to 18. Those attending private schools can still receive $8,000 a year.
Lawmakers also prohibited some expenses like ski passes, furniture and musical instruments, and established a cap of 20% per scholarship for extracurriculars and physical education, an unpopular move among Utah Fits All parents.
In the decision, the court explained why its interpretation of the constitution sided with the UEA, especially highlighting a past Utah Supreme Court ruling that decided that the Legislature’s authority in establishing and maintaining the public education system is limited. “The legislature, for instance, cannot establish schools and programs that are not open to all the children of Utah or free from sectarian control,” the court wrote then.
The UEA celebrated the decision, describing it as a significant victory for public education. 
“This decision protects the integrity of public education, ensuring critical funding remains in schools that serve 90% of Utah’s children and prioritize equitable, inclusive opportunities for every student to succeed,” the union wrote in a statement. “It reinforces the belief that public education is a cornerstone of opportunity for all, regardless of background or circumstance.”
Utah’s largest teacher union files lawsuit against Utah Fits All school choice voucher program

However, Republican leaders in the state lamented the decision and said they intended to continue the legal fight. House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, called the ruling “a devastating setback for Utah families.” 
“We’re unwavering in our commitment to ensuring that every Utah student, irrespective of zip code or income, has equal access to the educational opportunities they rightfully deserve,” Schultz said in a statement. “We will vigorously pursue every avenue, including the Utah Supreme Court, to overturn this decision and restore hope for Utah’s students and families.”
Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and Gov. Spencer Cox expressed the same disappointment, with Cox adding in a social media post that the state “will be reviewing the ruling with our attorneys and preparing to appeal.”
However, the strongest reaction came from Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, who sponsored the legislation that created Utah Fits All. She called the decision “judicial activism.” 
“It is not the job of judiciary to set policy on the bench and infuse personal opinion and ideology into their decisions. We are not done fighting this fight and will appeal this decision to the Utah Supreme Court,” she wrote in a statement.
Here’s why the court said the school choice program is unconstitutional:
Utah’s Education Article
“Utah’s Education Article does more than simply articulate a policy or aspiration, leaving the legislature with plenary authority to determine how best to accomplish it. It is a direct command to the legislature to perform a single duty: establish and maintain ‘the state’s education systems,’” Judge Laura Scott wrote in the decision. That includes a public education system open to all children of the state and a higher education system “free from sectarian control.”
The state had rejected that argument stating that the program “is expressly not part of the public education system.” 
However, the court said that the elementary and secondary schools funded through the program are not open to all, since all of them have some sort of application process with assessments, interviews or tests to determine if the student is “fit.” 
While private schools are prohibited from discriminating against students based on their race, color and national origin, “they are not prohibited from discriminating against students based on gender, religion, socio-economic status, disability, sexual orientation or political affiliation.” 
With reduced scholarship for homeschool students, Utah Fits All update poised to become law

Not only can schools deny admission because of these factors, the opinion reads, it also divides children into groups or classes — children attending public schools and children attending private schools — and “provides additional benefits to private or homeschooled children that may not be available to children attending public school, such as funds for computers, test prep courses, private tutoring,” among others.
Amendment G
In 2020 Utahns voted to pass Amendment G, which changed the Utah Constitution to allow intangible property or income tax revenue to support systems of higher education “and to support children and to support individuals with disabilities.”
While Utah GOP leaders said that the amendment allows them to run programs that are designed to support children, the UEA rejected that argument, stating that Amendment G was meant to allow using income tax to fund certain mental health and disability programs, which according to the court, is what the voters who approved the amendment understood with the language. 
That interpretation of Amendment G could also be attributed to the legislative debates on it. 
“No legislator ever mentioned ‘school choice’ or vouchers for children who do not have disabilities. No legislator ever suggested that Amendment G could be used to divert income tax revenue from public schools to private schools,” according to the opinion. The debates, instead, highlighted that the ballot question “would address budgetary constraints by allowing income tax revenue to fund certain social services programs” and “would strengthen public education funding.”

The Department of the Interior said it will soon release a new five-year national plan for offshore oil and gas leasing in federal water, and it will include a new High Arctic planning area. Details will be provided in an upcoming notice in the Federal Register and in information posted on the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s website, the department said in its statement.
“Launching the process to develop the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Program marks a decisive step toward securing American Energy Dominance,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in the statement. “Through a transparent and inclusive public engagement process, we are reinforcing our commitment to responsible offshore energy development—driving job creation, bolstering economic growth and strengthening American energy independence. Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, we are unlocking the full potential of our offshore resources to benefit the American people for generations to come.” 
Further information was not provided by the department.

	Most federal Arctic waters were previously put off-limits to oil leasing by former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.
President Trump attempted in his first term to open Arctic areas that Obama had withdrawn from the leasing program, but that attempt was struck down by a federal court.
A more recent Trump attempt to open withdrawn waters to oil leasing is now being challenged, as the first attempt was. A coalition of environmental groups sued the Trump administration in February over his efforts to overturn protections in the Northern Bering Sea and areas of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Environmentalists on Friday criticized the newly announced plans for more offshore oil leasing, including in the Arctic.
“Drilling in the Arctic is a disaster waiting to happen. There’s no way to clean up an oil spill there and it will harm polar bears and bowhead whales. Oil companies should think twice about drilling in the Arctic, as it has been plagued with challenges,” Natalie Jones of the Center for Biological Diversity said by email.
The Center for Biological Diversity is one of the environmental groups that sued the Trump administration in February.
Despite some sporadic attempts to explore for oil in federal Arctic waters off Alaska, there has never been any commercial oil production there or in any federal waters off Alaska, except for a small portion of the Hilcorp-operated Northstar field, which lies mostly on state territory.

Shell determined later that it could not salvage the Kulluk, and the company scrapped its Beaufort drilling plan that year. In 2015, it abandoned its entire Arctic offshore drilling plan.

	The field that was expected to become the first producing site located entirely in federal waters off Alaska, the Liberty project, has languished for decades without development. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. discovered it in the 1990s and drew up two separate development plans but wound up dropping those. Hilcorp acquired full ownership of Liberty in 2020, but its lack of progress on the project led to expiration of the leases earlier this year.
The last oil exploration attempt in federal Arctic waters was a Royal Dutch Shell campaign abandoned in 2015 after the company spent over $7 billion on it.
That campaign was beset with trouble — most notably, the wreck of a mobile drill rig that escaped its tow and grounded during a storm on Dec. 31, 2012. The rig, the Kulluk, had been used for Shell’s exploration in the Beaufort Sea, the portion of the Arctic Ocean east of Point Barrow. Shell used a separate drill ship in the Chukchi Sea, west of Point Barrow and north of the Bering Strait. That ship, the Noble Discoverer, also had numerous operational and environmental problems.
Shell wound up completing just one well, which was in the Chukchi, and the company concluded that it found too little oil there to justify further development.

This story was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.
Facing the continued collapse of Chinook salmon, officials today shut down California’s commercial salmon fishing season for an unprecedented third year in a row.
Under the decision by an interstate fisheries agency, recreational salmon fishing will be allowed in California for only brief windows of time this spring. This will be the first year that any sportfishing of Chinook has been allowed since 2022.
Today’s decision by the Pacific Fishery Management Council means that no salmon caught off California can be sold to retail consumers and restaurants for at least another year. In Oregon and Washington, commercial salmon fishing will remain open, although limited.
“From a salmon standpoint, it’s an environmental disaster. For the fishing industry, it’s a human tragedy, and it’s also an economic disaster,” said Scott Artis, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Association, an industry organization that has lobbied for river restoration and improved hatchery programs.
The decline of California’s salmon follows decades of deteriorating conditions in the waterways where the fish spawn each year, including the Sacramento and Klamath rivers.
California’s salmon are an ecological icon and a valued source of food for Native American tribes. The shutdown also has an economic toll: It has already put hundreds of commercial fishers and sportfishing boat operators out of work and affected thousands of people in communities and industries reliant on processing, selling and serving locally caught salmon.
California’s commercial fishery has never been closed for three years in a row before.
Some experts fear the conditions in California have been so poor for so long that Chinook may never rebound to fishable levels. Others remain hopeful for major recovery if the amounts of water diverted to farms and cities are reduced and wetlands kept dry by flood-control levees are restored.

This year’s recreational season includes several brief windows for fishing, including a weekend in June and another in July, or a quota of 7,000 fish.
Jared Davis, owner and operator of the Salty Lady in Sausalito, one of dozens of party boats that take paying customers fishing, thinks it’s likely that this quota will be met on the first open weekend for recreational fishing, scheduled for June 7-8.
“Obviously, the pressure is going to be intense, so everybody and their mother is going to be out on the water on those days,” he said. “When they hit that quota, it’s done.”
One member of the fishery council, Corey Ridings, voted against the proposed regulations after saying she was concerned that the first weekend would overshoot the 7,000-fish quota.
Davis said such a miniscule recreational season won’t help boat owners like him recover from past closures, though it will carry symbolic meaning.
“It might give California anglers a glimmer of hope and keep them from selling all their rods and buying golf clubs,” he said.










It continues to be devastating. Salmon has been the cornerstone of many of our ports for a long time. 


– Sarah Bates, commercial fisher based in San Francisco



	Sarah Bates, a commercial fisher based at San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf, said the ongoing closure has stripped many boat owners of most of their income.
“It continues to be devastating,” she said. “Salmon has been the cornerstone of many of our ports for a long time.”
She said the shutdown also has trickle-down effects on a range of businesses that support the salmon fishery, such as fuel services, grocery stores and dockside ice machines.
“We’re also seeing a sort of a third wave … the general seafood market for local products has tanked,” such as rockfish and halibut. She said that many buyers are turning to farmed and wild salmon delivered from other regions instead.
Davis noted that federal emergency relief funds promised for the 2023 closure still have not arrived. “Nobody has seen a dime,” he said.
Fewer returning salmon
Before the Gold Rush, several million Chinook spawned annually in the river systems of the Central Valley and the state’s northern coast. Through much of the 20th century, California’s salmon fishery formed the economic backbone of coastal fishing ports, with fishers using hook and line pulling in millions of pounds in good years.
But in 2024, just 99,274 fall-run Chinook — the most commercially viable of the Central Valley’s four subpopulations — returned to the Sacramento River and its tributaries, substantially lower than the numbers in 2023. In 2022, fewer than 70,000 returned, one of the lowest estimates ever.

About 40,000 returned to the San Joaquin River. Fewer than 30,000 Chinook reached their spawning grounds in the Klamath River system, where the Hoopa, Yurok and Karuk tribes rely on the fish in years of abundance.
The decline of California’s salmon stems from nearly two centuries of damage inflicted on the rivers where salmon spend the first and final stages of their lives. Gold mining, logging and dam construction devastated watersheds. Levees constrained rivers, turning them into relatively sterile channels of fast-moving water while converting floodplains and wetlands into irrigated farmland.
Today, many of these impacts persist, along with water diversions, reduced flows and elevated river temperatures that frequently spell death for fertilized eggs and juvenile fish.
The future of California salmon is murky
Peter Moyle, a UC Davis fish biologist and professor emeritus, said recovery of self-sustaining populations may be possible in some tributaries of the Sacramento River.
“There are some opportunities for at least keeping runs going in parts of the Central Valley, but getting naturally spawning fish back in large numbers, I just can’t see it happening,” he said.
Jacob Katz, a biologist with the group California Trout, holds out hope for a future of flourishing Sacramento River Chinook. “We could have vibrant fall-run populations in a decade,” he said.
That will require major habitat restoration involving dam removals, reconstruction of levee systems to revive wetlands and floodplains, and reduced water diversions for agriculture — all measures fraught with cost, regulatory constraints, and controversy.

	State officials, recognizing the risk of extinction, have promoted salmon recovery as a policy goal for years. In early 2024, the Newsom administration released its California Salmon Strategy for a Hotter, Drier Future, a 37-page catalogue of proposed actions to mitigate environmental impacts and restore flows and habitat, all in the face of climate change.
California Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Charlton H. Bonham said the decision to allow limited recreational fishing “brings hope. We know, however, that this news brings little relief” to the industry.
He said salmon “are still recovering from severe drought and other climate challenges and have not yet benefitted from our consecutive years of wet winters and other actions taken to boost populations.”
However, Artis of Golden State Salmon Association said while the state’s salmon strategy includes some important items, it leaves out equally critical steps, such as protecting minimum flows for fish. He said salmon are threatened by proposed water projects endorsed by the Newsom administration.
“It fails to include some of the upcoming salmon-killing projects that the governor is pushing like Sites Reservoir and the Delta tunnel, and it ignores the fact that the Voluntary Agreements are designed to allow massive diversions of water,” he said.
Experts agree that an important key to rebuilding salmon runs is increasing the frequency and duration of shallow flooding in riverside riparian areas, or even fallow rice paddies — a program Katz has helped develop through his career.
On such seasonal floodplains, a shallow layer of water can help trigger an explosion of photosynthesis and food production, ultimately providing nutrition for juvenile salmon as they migrate out of the river system each spring.
Through meetings with farmers, urban water agencies and government officials, Rene Henery, California science director with Trout Unlimited, has helped draft an ambitious salmon recovery plan dubbed “Reorienting to Recovery.” Featuring habitat restoration, carefully managed harvests and generously enhanced river flows — especially in dry years — this framework, Henery said, could rebuild diminished Central Valley Chinook runs to more than 1.6 million adult fish per year over a 20-year period.
He said adversaries — often farmers and environmentalists — must shift from traditional feuds over water to more collaborative programs of restoring productive watersheds while maintaining productive agriculture.
As the recovery needle for Chinook moves in the wrong direction, Katz said deliberate action is urgent.
“We’re balanced on the edge of losing these populations,” he said. “We have to go big now. We have no other option.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Endowments have been around for a long time. Many universities have had them for decades and are major revenue generators. Have you ever heard a threat to overdraw an endowment fund? Probably not, because they are set up precisely to prevent that from happening. Unfortunately, our current Permanent Fund structure has a gaping hole in it that allows for all sorts of overdraw shenanigans to take place. Many would like to keep this topic as confusing as possible, but really it is quite simple and comes down to this: Would you rather have a portion of our largest savings account continually exposed to ill-advised ideas or would you rather have it all locked up and only allow a known amount to be drawn each year? I realize there are several iterations of how folks want to address this issue but if we are attempting to change the constitution, there is only one responsible way to do it: Move the entire fund under the constitutionally protected corpus.
Let’s start by discussing how the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. views all the unwise ideas the Legislature has proposed to overdraw the fund. The APFC’s only concern is how much cash they need to keep available in case an imprudent idea passes. Legislation that causes uncertainty and thereby impairs the APFC’s ability to invest that cash has a profoundly deleterious impact on overall returns for the fund. 
There are two past examples which expose the need to protect the Permanent Fund from bad ideas. First, a few years ago the House was once again tied up in knots trying to balance their budget. To break the logjam, an amendment was introduced by a member to fund the entire budget, federal funds and all, from the earnings reserve account. I recall this would have amounted to a $12 billion draw. Fortunately, it failed.
Another example occurred when an overdraw of over $5 billion to back-fund PFDs actually passed due to a member being absent. The APFC had to take defensive measures and be prepared to have this additional $5 billion available for distribution.
What the funds were to be used for in either example is not relevant to this discussion even though the PFD continues to be a third-rail item. What is critical to understand is that the APFC had to keep cash available in case either idea passed. This prevents the APFC from keeping that money invested at a much higher rate than holding cash.
Let’s go over the Permanent Fund’s setup once more so we are all clear why the endowment plan is critical to the long term health of the fund. A noble goal espoused by many is to grow the fund to $100 billion, although we seem to have been stuck at about $80 billion for the past few years. We currently have a constitutionally protected portion — known as the corpus — which as of the end of February was about $60 billion of the $80 billion total. This cannot be touched without a constitutional amendment. The other $20 billion, or 25%, is in the earnings reserve account in various forms and is only statutorily protected. As an example, the PFD is also statutorily protected, and we have witnessed how closely that statute is followed. 
These past, real attempts to raid the fund demonstrate the exact reason an endowment is needed to protect the entire fund moving forward, so that future generations can enjoy the same benefits we have all enjoyed for the past four decades. Currently, it is too easy for individual legislators to introduce massive overdraw amendments. All that cash available with a mere majority vote is too tempting. The temptation will only worsen as oil prices drop.
If a constitutionally protected endowment is in place, the APFC would have the comfort and knowledge that a certain percentage of the fund — let’s use the current 5% — and only up to that amount would be required each July 1. Without getting into the more complex draw equation to minimize the annual changes to the draw, the draw of 5% would equate to about $4 billion.
Some might argue that goal is far too aggressive based on historical returns. History demonstrates that mistaken argument is based on the APFC having to sit on far too much cash in case the Legislature or executive branch takes action to overdraw the earnings reserve account. If this option is removed, the APFC would be able to be more aggressive in their investments. Loosening this restraint, even just a bit, could result in a percentage point or two increase in their annualized returns, leading to a real path toward $100 billion and beyond.  
I’ve heard so-called experts over the past few months misleading folks into believing the endowment plan is meant to expose the corpus to spending. Those same folks even suggest the fund will be drained. As a former APFC trustee, I know the endowment concept is to protect the fund for future generations. The concept is simple: Move the statutorily protected — in reality unprotected — earnings reserve account into the constitutionally protected corpus and allow for a known draw for years to come, thereby eliminating the opportunity for decision-makers to even introduce amendments to overdraw the fund. Anything other than moving the entire fund into a constitutionally protected status is not acceptable. The flexibility of always having the earnings reserve account there to overdraw as a “backup plan” has allowed decision-makers to kick the can down the road and not make the tough decisions that will benefit future generations.
The Legislature once again is wrapped around the budgetary axle as they engage in their annual battle on how to fund an ever-expanding government. There are too many variables at their disposal to distract them, such as the earnings reserve account,  oil prices and PFDs. As legislators continue to view the PFD as the main variable, this trainwreck will only get worse. I’m like many others who wish the PFD issue had been addressed when the percentage-based draw took effect several years ago. But it wasn’t, so here we are. Currently the debate is over how much money should be disbured through the PFD and how much new money should be directed to education.  
A constitutionally protected endowment fund producing a fixed, known amount at the beginning of each session coupled with a fairly known, but dwindling, oil revenue projection would take the PFD variable off the table. I’m not proposing anything when it comes to the future of the PFD. This is all about stabilizing the revenue streams we currently enjoy. Introducing income or sales taxes to fund our ever-expanding wish list is for another column.  
We will not be able to have an honest, educated discussion on future revenues and expenditures or the future of this great state until this issue is resolved and the ability to overdraw one of the last few accounts is removed as an option.

State legislators are beginning to recognize this with the introduction of bills like HB 2049, which proposes new revenue streams for education and creates a K-12 Funding Equity Work Group seated at the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.  
State leaders are using this moment to ask themselves how education funding should be more fairly and effectively allocated. But this will not be the first time the Legislature has asked that question or even created a work group to explore it. In fact, over the past 16 years, seven legislatively directed reports have explored and provided recommendations on various aspects of our K-12 funding system. (2009, 2009,  2010,  2012, 2012,  2019, and  2022). Unfortunately, these past reports have all fallen short in identifying an approach to resourcing schools that is consistent with the range of supports and services schools currently provide to students.  
Much has changed since our current approach to funding was established in 2010, and especially since the pandemic. There has been a significant shift in the depth and diversity of student needs. Whether it’s supporting mental health, addressing food and housing insecurity, or helping families navigate public systems, schools today are doing far more than delivering instruction. 
Schools have learned that when students’ basic needs are met, they can more effectively engage students in learning, so many districts have responded by working beyond their means to meet a growing diversity of student needs. This evolving role for schools has created a misalignment between what schools need to engage students in learning and how the state provides funding to schools. One of the key reasons this misalignment persists is that previous work groups and funding studies have failed to put the voices of historically marginalized communities at the center of their decision-making, especially students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, and those from families navigating systemic barriers. 
If Washington is serious about creating an education system rooted in equity, that commitment must be reflected not only in our funding formulas but also in how we define the problem and who gets to shape the solutions. Otherwise, we risk continuing the cycle: one where well-intentioned reforms claim equity as a goal but fail to deliver because they were built without the input of those most affected.
The lived experience of students and families is not anecdotal; it is expertise. When we not only invite but center that expertise in the decision-making process, we gain a more honest and accurate picture of what schools need. As we look to improve how we resource public K-12 education, we must use every tool available to design an education system that delivers the learning environments, supports, and opportunities all students deserve. 
If there was ever a moment to assemble a diverse working group focused on reassessing K-12 funding, it is now. We must ask ourselves: how will this be different? How will we ensure that students furthest from educational justice are at the forefront of this process? As funding decisions move forward, these must be the guiding commitments to ensure that real change is achieved.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/school-classrom-k-12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 21:01:12.089651

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.



The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Hatch United States Courthouse is pictured in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, April 9, 2025. (McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Eight international students in Utah whose permits to study in the country were revoked have sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the “unilateral” and abrupt termination of their legal status in the country, forcing them to lose school time and jobs while subjecting them to detention and deportation. 
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed the lawsuit in federal court in Utah on behalf of the students on Friday, asking for a temporary restraining order halting the removal of the individuals’ records from Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS), a database that tracks their visa compliance and allows them to stay in the country while they complete their studies, or in the case of recent graduates, maintain an early career job.

That, after more than 50 students were reported to be impacted by status revocations in Utah, many without any type of notice. Some of them didn’t have links with protests or a criminal background, generating confusion on campuses. 
According to the suit, the Department of Homeland Security action violated the students’ rights for due process since they didn’t get a chance to contest the decision. It also alleges that erasing the SEVIS records was against federal law and violated the Constitution. 
“(The students) were following all their visa requirements and had committed nothing that should have changed their status,” Aaron Welcher, communication director for the ACLU of Utah, said on Friday.
The ACLU declined to release some details about the students to protect their privacy. However, the organization said they are from China, Nigeria, Mexico and Japan and are attending different universities across the state, including the University of Utah, Brigham Young University and Ensign College. A ninth student from BYU-Idaho was also included in the complaint. 
Cox asks for clarity from Trump administration on revoked student visas

The students have been experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety after learning about their status terminations, and are uncertain about their futures, including fears of being labeled a national security or foreign policy threat, forbidding them from reentering the United States or other countries.
“The abrupt and unexplained termination of these students’ lawful SEVIS registration is profoundly concerning. These students now face deportation or worse, placing their education and futures in jeopardy,” Tom Ford, staff attorney at the ACLU of Utah, said in the release. “Coordinated attacks on due process are paving the way for the kind of tyrannical government our Constitution was meant to prevent — and the ACLU of Utah is taking action to stop that abuse of power and keep rights intact for all of us.”
The termination of SEVIS records effectively ends the students’ permits to be in the country. While the students have the option to apply for reinstatement of status with USCIS, according to the lawsuit, the federal government has informed multiple schools that they will deny all reinstatement applications for students in this specific situation.
The new process of removing SEVIS records was also criticized in the suit.
“If ICE believes a student is deportable for having a revoked visa, it has the authority to initiate removal proceedings and make its case in court,” the lawsuit reads. “However, it cannot misuse SEVIS to circumvent the law, strip students of status, and drive them out of the country without process.”

Black maternal health advocates and researchers worry about federal funding cuts. (Courtesy of Birthlooms)Before everything went black, Tamika Jackson felt like she was drowning. While in labor giving birth to her baby boy, her body felt heavy and her breaths shallow.
“I can’t breathe,” she croaked to the anesthesiologist.
“If you couldn’t breathe, you wouldn’t be able to speak,” she recalled the doctor telling her, dismissing her as having a “panic attack.”
Minutes later, the 37-year-old’s lungs gave out. Her heart stopped beating.
Clinicians were able to resuscitate Jackson. Her baby boy was born via C-section, and the Michigan mom lived to tell her story of giving birth to Cree, who’s turning 3 next month.
Jackson is now a maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based nonprofit. She spoke with Stateline while on a bus to the Michigan Capitol, where she participated in a Black Maternal Health Week panel and pushed for a legislative package — nicknamed the Michigan Momnibus — which aims to increase obstetric patient protections and improve care for moms of color.
The Michigan Senate passed the package Thursday, and it now heads to the House.
Black moms like Jackson are three times more likely to die than white mothers and suffer higher rates of pregnancy-related complications.
But in its bid to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives, the Trump administration has terminated community health grants and closed federal offices that support state efforts to tackle racial health disparities. Experts say the moves will hinder efforts to improve Black maternal health.
“DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival,” Jackson said. “This is about community-based solutions — and they’re undoing that.”
Jackson added that without federal dollars, “We’re going to be left trying to do a whole lot with a whole lot of nothing.”
The Trump administration has cut grants for maternal health studies and research on health disparities in various populations, including patients of color and LGBTQ people. It has laid off most staff at the federal Division of Reproductive Health, and removed maternal health data from federal agency websites.
It also is considering cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from about $121 billion to about $80.4 billion, according to The New York Times. The administration plans to create a new Administration for a Healthy America, which would focus on maternal and child health, among other issues.
HHS and its National Institutes of Health did not return requests for comment in time for publication.










DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival.

Researchers and advocates like Jackson say that amid the Trump administration’s erasures, their work will continue.
Among those losing grants are nonprofits, health care systems and universities, including the Morehouse School of Medicine, a historically Black medical school in Atlanta, which received a $2.96 million grant for a center to improve the health of Black pregnant and postpartum women. Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation.
“We are reviewing the situation to assess how it may affect our research,” a Morehouse spokesperson wrote in an email. “More broadly, it is important that we all recognize the critical role medical research plays in developing potential life-saving innovation that will mitigate disease and improve the health and well-being of many people.”

The Morehouse center was selected among an initial 10 research centers funded under the NIH’s Maternal health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone, or “IMPROVE,” Initiative.
Columbia University and community groups throughout New York also received the grants. One goal was to connect postpartum moms with doulas to detect conditions such as postpartum preeclampsia, according to principal investigator Dr. Uma Reddy, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia. Reddy said the grant was developed with communities who voiced their needs.
“We can actually prevent these deaths and these serious complications,” Reddy said. “This is a way to focus on a high-risk population and provide them with the resources that they don’t have available.”
Maternal death reviews get political as state officials intrude

Tufts University maternal health scholar Ndidiamaka Amutah-Onukagha said she’s had several meetings in Washington, D.C., get canceled, and while she’s thankful to have almost completed one federal grant project, there’s uncertainty about other grants she’s applied for, including a Black postpartum support research initiative.
The professor runs the Maternal Outcomes for Translational Health Equity Research (MOTHER) Lab and Center for Black Maternal Health and Reproductive Justice at the Tufts University School of Medicine.
“It not only stalls progress, but it actually actively endangers the most vulnerable among us,” she said. “These policy decisions can cause and will cause lasting harm to people who are already underserved by our health care system.”
Amutah-Onukagha said she is urging researchers and advocates to have “cautious optimism.”
“Most people are in the space of gloom and doom. I do get that, and I’m vastly in and out of that,” she said. “But because of the work that I do in maternal health, we have to remain optimistic. That lens cannot die. If it does, then the communities that we serve are going to be even more disadvantaged.”
Amutah-Onukagha, who recently testified before the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Public Health, said her team will continue to work with organizations around the state, such as Birth Equity & Justice Massachusetts and Resilient Sisterhood Project.
“We’re stronger in numbers,” she said.
Diana Greene Foster, research director in reproductive health at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted the seminal Turnaway Study documenting the harms women suffer from abortion denials.
She was in the middle of another study, funded by a federal grant, tracking post-Roe abortions and the efficacy of health exceptions in abortion ban laws. Her team was interviewing emergency room doctors about whether they could provide abortions amid major pregnancy complications such as eclampsia, a serious consequence of preeclampsia, which is a dangerous form of high blood pressure that disproportionately affects Black mothers.
The administration pulled her grant.
Foster, who is fundraising to continue her study, said she feels the administration’s actions send a message of “turning their back on science, on compassion, on caring about women.”
To close racial gap in maternal health, some states take aim at implicit bias

Tina Sherman, a doula and national director of maternal justice at MomsRising, a nonpartisan women and mothers advocacy group, said she worries about data the administration has removed, including the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
The surveillance system is a comprehensive tool states use to track maternal health and formulate policies to improve it.
“An attempt to erase the data,” said Sherman, “doesn’t erase the harm that has been done and creates additional harm.”
Without data, states can’t target where resources are needed and which communities are disproportionately harmed and how, said Sherman, who co-chairs the North Carolina Maternal Mortality Review Committee.
“We’re going to be going backwards,” she said.
The Trump administration also canceled several grants focused on intimate partner violence, a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death which disproportionately affects people of color.
One such grant was supporting a University of North Carolina project studying intimate partner violence against pregnant women shortly before they give birth.
“The issues remain. The urgency is pressing as it ever was. The reality is this: Black mothers and birthing people continue to carry the weight of a crisis that we did not create,” Amutah-Onukagha said. “We did not create it, but we are leading the fight to solve it and dismantle it, and we know that the systemic barriers existed before this administration.
They will continue to show up — but we will also continue to produce cutting-edge research here at the center.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)A stalemate over property tax relief in both Montana Legislative chambers continues with little end in sight as disputes and heated floor sessions continue. 
Montana Senators left a marathon session on the floor without any property tax relief on Thursday after voting down two major pieces of legislation — House Bill 155 and House Bill 231.
In another twist, the House Taxation Committee on Friday morning amended Senate Bill 542, originally a two-year freeze on property taxes, into HB 155 and HB 231. House Bill 155, as amended, would reduce tax rates on residential and agricultural property.
“I think I’m optimistic it’ll be the vehicle,” Rep. Mark Thane, D-Missoula, who sponsored HB 155 said on Friday morning.
The Senate indefinitely postponed HB 231 on Thursday night, but HB 155 in amended form is technically still alive in the chamber. HB 231 was the preferred bill from the governor, and it would have shifted some tax burden onto those with multiple homes.
The 69th Legislative session began with a mandate — both self-imposed by legislators and by the Governor — to develop property tax relief. While movement has been slowly made on the issue, neither chamber has pushed through expansive property tax relief to the executive branch.
The House has had long discussions over the merits of Senate Bill 90, legislation that would take tourism tax dollars and use them for tax relief. That bill has yet to technically see the House floor, but has been discussed for around an hour total during failed blast motions on Wednesday and Thursday.
SB 90 and House Bill 924, legislation that would create a large trust, are also connected.
The discussions on the major bills have been occasionally emotional and often frustrated. It’s also been repeated many times in the hallways, in committee meetings and on the floor that Montanans will hold their elected officials accountable if they don’t pass real tax relief.
In the most recent reappraisal cycle, property taxes increased significantly, even leading to a lawsuit against the state. The worry for many Montanans? Being priced out of their homes with no place to go. Legislators on both sides of the aisle promised property tax help this session.
In the background, deals and arguments over what type of assistance is right for the state reign supreme. But the session is days from concluding and there is no consensus. 
“I think that this is going to be changing every five minutes for the next week,” Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale said on Friday.
 ‘A thoughtfully developed solution’

Even before the session started, Gov. Greg Gianforte formed a task force to help, and from the beginning of the session this year, he looked to push and prod the Legislature to pass property tax reform, specifically in HB 231.
But both political parties are split into their own factions, responding to different political pressures and interests, and a majority has yet to coalesce around HB 231 or any other proposal. 
Some are interested in giving property taxpayers cash in the form of a credit or rebate, some want structural relief, some don’t understand why Montanans can’t have both, and some worry that plans to help residential payers will just hit industry instead.
That impasse has yet to be fully resolved.
There has been some friction between the branches, with legislative Republicans going so far as to issue a press release after the governor made comments about the slow pace of property tax legislation in March.
“The Governor understands the legislative process and should have submitted his proposals earlier if he wanted them enacted more quickly,” the press release stated.
In the meantime, legislators are cobbling together ideas. HB 231, brought by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, was recently described as a “Frankenstein” bill by Senate Taxation Committee Chairman Sen. Greg Hertz and has faced significant scrutiny.
For Hertz, who represents part of the Flathead, second-homes, including rentals, are common in his district and HB 231 would tax those at a higher rate.
He also said Jones had taken control of the finance and claims process, as well as the budgeting process.
“Now I believe he’s gotten himself into trouble,” Hertz said. “Because now we can only control the budget, but he has no balance over here to allow conservative Republicans to readjust the budget that happens this session.”
During a Thursday press conference, Gianforte reiterated his support for the Homestead exemption in House Bill 231.
“I continue to urge the legislature to keep its focus on Montanans who live in their primary residence, the place that they call home, and not on those who only live here part of the year,” Gianforte said. “Our homestead rate cut was a thoughtfully developed solution and a result of a diverse, bipartisan effort.”
 ‘Why can’t we do both?’

Republican Senate President Matt Regier has pushed Senate Bill 90, a tax rebate proposal.
Hertz has also said he’s in favor of SB 90, as are some House Republicans, including Billings Rep. Katie Zolnikov.
She brought the first motion to bring the tabled bill to the House floor and said the conversation around the legislation has become convoluted, challenging and difficult.
“The most frustrating part of the discussion is that most of the arguments against the bill basically utilize the assumption that this is the only property tax bill that we’re going to pass,” Zolnikov said in an interview. “And so it’s talked about as if it’s this mutually exclusive thing … SB 90 or nothing.”
She also said people then criticize the bill as not being meaningful reform.
“Of course it’s not meaningful reform,” she said. “You’re comparing apples to oranges here. But why can’t we do both?”
Some Democrats have also supported SB 90, including a cohort who has voted in favor of blast motions to move it to the House floor.
That coalition seems to have taken cues from House Minority leader Rep. Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, who has voted in favor of bringing SB 90 to the floor twice.
But her caucus has not completely followed her lead. Sullivan had no comment on SB 90 when reached through staff.
For Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, who has been against SB 90, it’s a general fund issue. He’s concerned the rebate will just eat up more of the fund over time, and that it’s simply not enough relief.
“To me, it’s almost an insult to my constituents,” Karlen said. “If I’m like, ‘Hey, you know, guess what, the rates are still going to be the same, residential property taxpayers keep paying more and more of the total tax share. But don’t worry, we’re gonna give you $250 bucks.’”
When asked if he’d consider rebates as a property tax relief option, Gianforte said, “We’ve been pretty clear we need permanent, meaningful relief.”
 ‘The unique issue of Billings’

Local government policies are playing a role too.
A cohort of representatives from Montana’s largest city have an interest in avoiding the potential legal and constitutional issues related to language in HB 231 and HB 155. 
Under both bills, cities with a charter that has specific stipulations around how many mills they can levy without voter approval could stand to lose millions. This has Billings legislators on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers looking for answers.
“We feel that the unique issue of Billings needs to be taken into consideration when trying to come to a final resolution on property taxes,” Rep. Denise Baum, D-Billings, said in a Thursday text message. “We are hoping that SB 90 will become part of the solution in conjunction with an overall property tax reform.”
There’s also worry about the constitutionality of legislation surrounding solutions proposed for “the Billings problem,” something Hertz has repeatedly said in committee meetings.
During an impassioned Senate floor discussion on HB 231 on Thursday, Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, pushed back against the idea the potential city charter fixes would be unconstitutional. Fern was carrying the bill in the Senate. Karlen had similar thoughts on Billings Friday morning.
Charters were a problem with HB 155, too, and an amendment was added to that bill to address the issue.
“What I would say to folks in Billings is: You’ll be included in long term property tax relief,” Karlen said in an interview. “It’s just a little bit wonkier in how that happens.”
One of the proposed solutions is reimbursing local governments impacted by the issue with state money, an idea Gianforte indicated he wouldn’t support.
“The other hard line we’ve drawn is that we do not think we should take someone’s income tax dollars and use it to backfill local spending,” Gianforte said. “So that’s something we will not do.”
 ‘Plenty more work to do’

Galt also had a two year-property tax freeze bill he described April 3 on the Senate floor as a “backstop” and “Plan D.” 
It’s now dead, he said on Friday.
Some Republicans had considered the idea as an option — and not just as a last-ditch attempt to show the Legislature did something on property taxes.
“We’re looking at two weeks, if even less, and being out of here,” Regier said on Tuesday. “And so when things come together and come together fast, and that’s obviously one piece that needs to be talked about.”
But all language regarding a tax freeze was cut out, and while Galt’s name is at the top of House Bill 542, it’s a very different piece of legislation. The House Taxation committee approved a large amendment on Friday morning that creates a $400 tax credit for 2024 taxes paid and takes parts from other pieces of tax legislation. 
Residential rates in HB 542 for 2025 mirror language in House Bill 155, starting at 0.76% rate for residential properties. The calculation for 2026 rates are similar to what’s in HB 231. There’s also a fix in HB 542 for Billings and other cities where there has been conflict between bill language and a charter, though its legality is unclear.
House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage said in the House Taxation committee on Friday morning that it was a good amendment and a step toward how the legislature is going to address property taxes.
“This amendment here kind of has a lot of fixes in it for a lot of different concerns that we’ve heard in the last 78 days,” Ler said.
Other supplementary property tax legislation beyond direct relief has passed out of the Legislature.
SB 117, which is on the Governor’s desk, will allow property taxes collected on new development to be used to offset taxes paid by existing homeowners and businesses. Regier has mentioned it several times as part of a fix for property taxes, and sponsor Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, said he was pleased it passed.
“We’ve got plenty more work to do on property taxes before we wrap up the session, but SB 117 is an important structural reform that will help contain property tax increases heading into the future, and we got it across the finish line,” Sen. Zolnikov said in a press release. “This is a long-term solution to a long-term problem of endless government growth.”
While bits and pieces of property tax legislation have gone through both chambers, no final long-term solution has gathered enough support to get it to the governor’s desk.
“A lot of times you don’t feel like you actually have input,” Rep. Zolnikov said. “Because things have been decided prior. Prior to a committee meeting, prior to a floor vote, prior to the session in general.”
What may have been decided remains to be seen as frustration mounts.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/property-tax-task-force-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 20:07:15.493540

Free bus passes
Sean Tommany, principal of University High School of Science and Engineering in Hartford, remembers how he scolded a student who came into school late. The student insisted that the bus he’d tried to board was packed. “The bus was so full, he couldn’t get on,” Tommany told the Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee on Thursday.
Tommany was speaking in favor of SB 1243, a bill that would set up a state program allowing school districts to apply to the Department of Transportation for bus passes, which the schools could either distribute to students for free or sell to them at a low cost.
Last year, the state of Connecticut granted Hartford Public Schools $175,000 for a pilot program to give students free bus passes. Tommany said that the first month, students rode the bus about 4,500 times.
Oluwaseyi Oluborode, said that her high school has a dual enrollment program with the University of Hartford. Since many of the classes take place after school, students often can’t attend without bus passes. She also recounted her own experience of losing transportation when her parents’ work schedules changed. “I would hesitate to commit to things after school, and I dropped out of volleyball,” she said.
The bill would require the school districts to pick up any additional costs that the reduced or free passes would put on the state. It’s not clear how much the passes would cost each municipality.

PURA ordered to turn over records
A New Britain Superior Court judge this week ordered the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to turn over certain records to Avangrid’s two gas utility companies in their appeal of regulators’ decision to cut gas rates.
In February, those utilities requested discovery of documents relating to their claims that PURA Chair Marissa Gillett bypassed other members of the commission by issuing unilateral decisions during the rate case, and that she secretly helped review an op-ed published in The Connecticut Mirror by two lawmakers critical of the utilities. (Both lawmakers have denied that Gillett helped write the piece).
Attorneys for PURA objected to the motion, arguing that it was premature and part of a larger campaign by the utilities to discredit PURA and Gillett.
In his decision on Wednesday, however, Superior Court Judge Matthew Budzik wrote that there was some merit to the utilities’ request and ordered PURA to hand over documents detailing the agency’s decision-making procedures in rate cases, as well as any documents related to the “drafting or authorship” of the op-ed. Those records must be turned over in 15 days, Budzik said.
Bodzik denied a third request for discovery regarding allegations of ex-parte communications between Gillett and a PURA staffer about language that appeared on the agency’s website.
In January, Avangrid and Eversource both sued PURA making similar claims that Gillett was wielding unilateral control over the agency. That case has yet to be decided.Representatives for PURA did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.

The planned casino will sit near the border of Ada and Elmore counties in southwest Idaho. (Courtesy of the Shoshone-Pauite Tribes)The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes are developing their first resort and casino along Interstate 84 halfway between Boise and Mountain Home. 
For decades, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes were the only tribe in Idaho without revenue. But the proposed resort and casino is estimated to generate tens of millions of dollars annually for Idaho’s economy and create thousands of regional jobs. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes also plan to share 5% of their net gaming revenues to support local schools and education programs.
Shoshone-Paiute Chairman Brian Mason said in a press release he dreams of a future where tribal members have the resources, education, health care and employment opportunities they need to sustain their families and preserve their culture. 
“Today, we have no meaningful economic opportunities and our community is facing some heavy challenges because of it,” Mason said. “We want to solve our own problems and provide for our people. Tribal gaming will allow us to make these dreams into a reality.”
 Shoshone-Paiute Tribes partner with Coeur d’Alene Tribe

The tribes are partnering with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, who has successfully run gaming operations in North Idaho for more than 30 years. 
The Coeur d’Alene Tribe is providing a large upfront investment to help with the permitting and development process, and once it is built, the Tribe will enter into a management contract with the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes to help sustain the casino. 
Coeur d’Alene Chairman Chief Allan said the tribe is honored to help its “brothers and sisters” secure the same benefits they have experienced from gaming. 
“When I was growing up, many tribal members lived in poverty and could not find jobs,” Allan said in the press release. “Today, we have a state-of-the-art medical center, ample employment for tribal members and can financially support every tribal member who wants to earn a college degree. None of this would be possible without tribal gaming.”
Tribal gaming already contributes more than $1.4 billion of annual economic activity to the state, over $47 million in annual tax revenue and it sustains 12,500 Idaho jobs, according to a press release from the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. 
 Tribe chairman says casino will provide resources to strengthen community

The Duck Valley Indian Reservation spans about 450 square miles in the southwest corner of Idaho, half split into parts of Nevada.
The tribes, according to the press release, face high rates of suicide and unemployment, and given its isolated location in the high desert, the Shoshone-Paiute community struggles to provide emergency services to its members.
Medical emergencies require lifesaving air transportation to Boise, which takes at least 45 minutes. A typical 911 call can take two hours to be answered because there are no tribal law enforcement officers exclusively dedicated to serving Duck Valley. Education funding is another major issue, and the school cannot attract enough certified teachers because of limited housing and other resources in the area, according to the press release
“The challenges we face daily are not insurmountable. We simply need resources to invest in long-term solutions for our people,” Mason said. “Gaming will give us the tools we need to strengthen our community, grow our infrastructure and provide more opportunities to our youth for generations to come.”  
The planned location is where the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes used to live, hunt and care for the natural resources. The planned casino will include gaming machines, luxury hotel rooms, a spa, entertainment center and fine dining options. 
To build this project on tribal land outside of the reservation, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes will follow the established process set out by the U.S. Department of the Interior and plan to submit their initial application later this year.

,Kansas Reflector,2025-04-18 23:03:48+00:00,Kansas Reflector,Kansas abortion clinics saw sizable majority of clients from out of state in 2024,Anna Kaminski,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/briefs/kansas-abortion-clinics-saw-sizable-majority-of-clients-from-out-of-state-in-2024/,A Planned Parenthood clinic that opened in August in Pittsburg marks Kansas' fourth clinic and has increased access to abortions for the region(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector),"TOPEKA — More than 70% of abortions performed in 2024 in Kansas were for out-of-state residents, according to monthly estimates of clinician-provided abortions in states without total bans.
Overall, Kansas was among the top five states in the country with the most substantial increases in abortions performed between 2023 and 2024, with about an 18% increase.
That increase was driven by non-Kansans seeking care, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a health policy research and advocacy organization, that released a report of monthly abortion estimates on April 15.
The report found that clinicians provided more than 1 million abortions in the United States in 2024, an increase of less than 1% from 2023.
Across the country, fewer people generally traveled across state lines seeking abortions in 2024 than in 2023. However, Kansas was an outlier.
Kansas clinicians provided more than 16,000 abortions to out-of state residents in 2024, a 3,300-case increase from 2023. Those abortions accounted for 71% of all abortion performed in the state.
“The latest abortion travel data are a clear reminder that the impact of a state’s abortion policies extends far beyond its borders,” said Kimya Forouzan, the institute’s principal state policy advisor.
The report specifically called out Kansas and Virginia as states with substantial abortion growth driven by out-of-state residents.
“This increase in travel from other states was the main driver of increased abortion counts overall in both states, although other factors like expanded clinic capacity also may have increased access for state residents,” the report said.
Emily Wales, the CEO and president of Planned Parenthood of the Great Plains, said the increase was expected.
Planned Parenthood’s clinics saw people seeking miscarriage management, victims of sexual assault and pregnancies with fetal anomalies. All were in need of care in Kansas because restrictions in their own states were too narrow.
“Too often those patients are being turned away,” Wales said.
Kansas has been a “critical point of access,” she said. Planned Parenthood opened a fourth clinic in August in Pittsburg, creating further regional support. 
People living in states with total bans have few states to choose from, Wales said, so proximity to a major highway or airport and travel affordability become major factors in the decision to seek out-of-state care.
An inflow of more than 5,800 Texans, almost 3,000 Oklahomans, 2,860 Missourians, about 520 Arkansans and 150 Louisianans visited Kansas for an abortion in 2024. States with fewer than 100 people seeking care in Kansas were not identified in the report. Most of those who traveled — more than 14,500 people — received care at a Planned Parenthood clinic, Wales said.
While federal and state restrictions continue to settle, Wales believes people are still frustrated and paying attention to government’s involvement in private health care decisions.
“But also,” Wales said, “I do think people have been somewhat removed from how emotional it can be to get in your car and drive 12 hours to access care.”
The uptick in abortion access comes on the heels of the Kansas Legislature’s 2025 session, during which Republicans made several, mostly unsuccessful, attempts at clamping down on reproductive health care access.
“The data reflects that Kansans were more empathetic and insightful when they voted on this issue than the Legislature seems to be,” Wales said, referring to the 2022 ballot question attempting to limit abortion access, which Kansas voters rejected.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Planned-Parenthood-Pittsbgurg-2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-18 19:07:12.963053

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) As Republicans in Congress consider cutting the federal share of Medicaid funding, states are weighing numerous options to scale back their programs. But voters in three states have significantly limited those options by enshrining Medicaid expansion in their constitutions — creating a potential budget disaster and a political challenge for the GOP.
Over the past several years, voters in conservative Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have amended their state constitutions to require their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the age of 65 who earn equal to or less than 138% of the federal poverty level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Those states are among the 40 plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost.
But much of that federal funding could soon vanish. Republicans in Congress are debating several options to achieve $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. One proposal would slash the 90% rate to the lower match rates states get for the traditional Medicaid population, mainly children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Those percentages range from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.

If Congress goes that route, states would have to come up with $626 billion over the next decade to keep the roughly 20 million people in the expansion population on the rolls.
Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have laws on the books that would automatically roll back Medicaid expansion if the federal funds dip. Some states are considering requiring people to work, go to school or volunteer in order to receive Medicaid benefits, a condition that would trim the rolls and save money.
But because Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have put Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, they can’t easily take those steps.

“Legislators cannot change that law without going back to voters for a whole other campaign to change the constitution,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit that helped put the constitutional amendments on the ballot in all three states.
“Even if the federal government cuts their contribution towards funding Medicaid expansion, those three states do not have the option to reduce eligibility or benefits for the Medicaid expansion population,” she told Stateline. “They will have to find those resources.”
Medicaid is a huge component of state budgets. Including the federal matching money, states spend an average of nearly a third of their budgets on Medicaid. And the program is also the single largest source of federal funds for states.
Missourians voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid in August 2020. When state lawmakers refused to fund the expansion, residents sued the state’s Department of Social Services. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had to find the resources for Medicaid expansion — a huge win for progressives.
For 2025, Missouri allotted $18.2 billion for Medicaid, with the federal government covering $12.7 billion of that, or about 70%. If Congress cuts the federal share of Medicaid funding by $880 billion over the next decade, it would leave Missouri with a budget hole of around $1.7 billion next year, according to research from nonprofit group the Commonwealth Fund. That would force the state to come up with some options to avoid fiscal disaster.
Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, told Stateline that these include raising taxes, cutting enrollment for other Medicaid populations, diminishing reimbursements to providers, getting rid of optional medical services such as dental care or ceasing payments for equipment like wheelchairs.

Raising taxes is not a likely or popular choice in Republican-leaning Missouri, McBride noted, while adding that cuts to providers would further endanger struggling hospitals.
“We lost 10 hospitals in Missouri in the last few years. And if you start cutting their payment rates, that’s going to just put them at risk,” McBride said. “The real money is in the disabled and the elderly populations. And so if you really wanted to quote-unquote save money, that’s probably where you’d have to look. But that’s really controversial.”
The state budgetary implications of a potentially sharp decline in federal Medicaid funding have influenced some prominent opponents of Medicaid expansion to have a change of heart. U.S. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018 when he was Missouri’s attorney general. Now, Hawley has said he would refuse to vote for any Medicaid cuts.
“I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts, benefit cuts. Work requirements are fine. But 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. That’s a lot of people,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill in February.
Republicans in the closely divided U.S. Congress might have trouble pushing through Medicaid cuts if other conservative lawmakers from Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota follow Hawley’s lead.
Oklahoma voters expanded Medicaid via a constitutional amendment in 2020. South Dakota followed suit in 2022. Republicans in all three states want to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, but doing so would not save enough money to make up for the loss of federal dollars.
South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson said he respects that voters chose to expand Medicaid, and added that the state has “faithfully” implemented it. But the decision to amend the state constitution “can only be described as a foolish decision,” he said in an interview.










Now, as we're staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid … our state is hamstrung.


– South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson


“A constitution is not meant to be a flexible document that you change annually or even every other year,” Mortenson said. “And so now, as we’re staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid, including for the expansion population, our state is hamstrung in that we cannot effectively respond to those changes.”
Mortenson is one of the lead sponsors of a bill that would ask voters to consider a ballot measure in the next general election to amend the constitution again, this time conditioning Medicaid expansion on the level of federal assistance. The measure has passed both chambers of the legislature.
But some of the supporters of the original constitutional amendment say they would fight any attempt to change it. Any restrictions, including work requirements, would severely harm working-class people, said Doug Sombke, head of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Sombke told Stateline that most farmers in the state struggle to make ends meet and certainly cannot offer high wages or health care benefits to their workers.
“There’s just no extra income,” Sombke said. “And, in South Dakota, we’re a right-to-work state, so you can get fired for any reason. As a worker, you really don’t have a lot of choice.”
Hall, of the Fairness Project, said amending the constitution is the most effective way to expand Medicaid in states where conservative-leaning lawmakers have been reluctant to do so. She said she suspects that voters in other states might pursue the constitutional amendment strategy if their state lawmakers try to roll back expansion.
“I do think that it’s possible that if we see these cuts move forward in D.C., and states are making highly unpopular choices to cut benefits for people, that we will see this issue back at the ballot box,” Hall said. “But for right now, I would say we’re seeing the power of constitutional amendments to protect benefits in action in real time.”

But during busy summer weekends, turning traffic backs up on the Banks Lowman Road, forcing drivers to wait extended periods of time to turn left onto Idaho Highway 55 and return to the Treasure Valley.
Idaho Transportation Department officials said the new, interim traffic signal will provide safer, more predictable turning options for drivers during busy times.
“The new signal will help mobility and safety at this historically busy summer SH-55 river access intersection,” Dan McElhinney, ITD chief deputy and chief operations officer, said in a written statement. “This signal will provide a turning solution for those drivers on Banks Lowman Road, which will help reduce long lines and delays.”
As of Friday, crews were finishing installing the traffic signal poles and making final preparations to activate the traffic signal, ITD officials said. 
Transportation officials said the new traffic signal was based on a study and public feedback. 
In addition to activating the new interim traffic signal, Idaho Transportation Department officials are working on a long-term intersection widening project to meet the growing traffic throughout the region and along the river.
In the past, traffic got so bad at the Bank Lowman Road intersection on summer weekends that the Idaho Transportation Department deployed flaggers to manually direct traffic.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Senate voted down a resolution Thursday that related to mandated reporting requirements for public officials, a proposal prompted by the sex crime conviction of former Sen. Ray Holmberg.
The North Dakota Young Republicans proposed House Resolution 3037 after reading a sentencing memo filed by a federal prosecutor last month that alleged Holmberg had a pattern of exploiting boys and young men. Holmberg, a Grand Forks Republican, pleaded guilty to traveling to Prague with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minors and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison.
The resolution urged the 2027 Legislature to consider making public officials mandated reporters. North Dakota law requires mandated reporters to report abuse, neglect and exploitation of vulnerable people to local authorities or law enforcement. 
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, said the resolution seemed like a “political knee-jerk reaction” that does not accomplish anything of substance, only to ask future lawmakers to think about crafting a new law.
Former ND Sen. Ray Holmberg sentenced to 10 years in prison for sex crime

“I just want to remind this body today as we consider this resolution that we are working on these things and we’re doing fruitful things on these things,” said Myrdal, who highlighted other legislation that aims to protect children from exploitation. 
Myrdal acknowledged that people were horrified to learn about their legislative colleague’s behavior. But she said many of the positions that require mandated reporting are for positions that work directly with children, which lawmakers do not generally do.
Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, said she is a mandated reporter as a nurse but worries that if the requirement was expanded to include lawmakers she would need to report testimony she receives as chair of the Senate Human Services Committee that may have already been reported.
“Are we going to end up creating a system in which we are bogging down our system and pulling away people who are doing the really, really important work, those child protection workers?” Roers said. She added the Legislature may not want to insert itself into a system that is working well today.
Mandated reporters are required to get updated training, said Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo.
“People need training,” Mathern said. “It’s not that simple to differentiate these cases.”
The Senate killed the resolution on a majority voice vote.
The resolution passed the House unanimously on April 7.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Research from The Nature Conservancy found current clean energy tax credits, if kept in place through 2032 would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa. 
Some folks fear the tax credits will be slashed by congressional leaders as they stare down hefty budget cuts and eye Biden-era environmental policies, but advocates of the clean energy credits say they are essential to reaching American energy dominance.
The study looked at clean energy tax credits impacting transportation, power generation, industry and buildings. Those categories comprise sectors from renewable vehicle fuels, to carbon sequestration, to home solar installations and electric vehicles. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Amber Markham, director of external affairs and climate for The Nature Conservancy, said most of these tax credits were established with bipartisan support, but are under attack by Republican officials because they were extended by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. 
“Rather than just lumping them all together and throwing them out, because somehow it seems like it’s an environmental thing … we need to really, take not a sledgehammer approach, but a scalpel approach, and go in and look at each of them and their impact and what makes the most sense to keep and support.” 


The tax credit programs analyzed in the study include: 
Power:

45Y: credits for energy generated with little to no greenhouse gas emissions. 
48E: a tech-neutral credit for energy generated with little to no greenhouse gas emissions.
45U: credits for nuclear energy facilities with zero emissions.

Industry: 

48C: credits for projects that expand clean energy manufacturing or recycling.
45X: credits for solar and wind energy components.
45V: credits for clean hydrogen production. 
45Q: credit for projects that sequester carbon dioxide by injecting it into underground geological formations. 

Buildings: 

25D: credits for residential clean energy updates like solar panels, wind turbines, etc.
25C: credits for residential energy efficiency updates like new windows, doors or insulation.
179D: credits for energy efficiency updates to commercial buildings.
45L: credits for building or reconstructing energy efficient homes.

Transportation:

45Z: credits for domestically produced fuel, including sustainable aviation fuel, with lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions below a certain level.
EV tax credits: credits for individuals who purchase electric plug in or fuel cell vehicles.



According to the study, the tax credits in the power category, followed by the industry category, account for the greatest share of annual economic value added to Iowa. 
Markham said cutting the tax credits now would be like “pulling the rug out from under” the individuals, business owners and industries that have already invested in this technology with the expectation of the tax credits. 
Monte Shaw, executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said this is true for ethanol facilities in Iowa, which he said have invested “tens of millions of dollars” to be able to receive 45z tax credits for manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel. 
“That is why we’re fighting so hard to push back against the people who (want to) rip it out,” Shaw said. “These facilities made good faith investments based on the law of the land.”
Conversely, opponents of the carbon pipeline projects in Iowa are gathering signatures on a petition, specifically urging Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley to cut the 45Q tax credits, which incentivize the carbon sequestration pipelines. 
IRFA and other commodity groups associated with the ethanol industry have been pushing for final guidance on the 45z program, which Shaw said would said is “the best tool” to “maximize the Midwest contribution to American energy dominance.”
A comment period for 45z guidance closed April 10. Shaw said the association asked for a long term extension of the program and for the inclusion of the climate smart agriculture practices. He said the climate smart agriculture practices program would help the ethanol facilities meet the low emission standards it needs to qualify for 45z, and it would allow farmers to compete in a global market by quantifying the carbon impacts of regenerative farming practices. 
Shaw said it seems like the president doesn’t care about the impacts these tax credits have on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but he should care about the economic benefits they represent to the country. 
“If you want to get to American energy dominance, this is a tool that’s right here, in law, that can be implemented aggressively, that will achieve your American energy dominance goals,” Shaw said, speaking specifically about 45z. 
Another study, released by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, found that residential energy prices in the U.S. would increase by nearly 7% in 2026 if the tax credits were done away with. 
Markham with TNC said renewable energy needs to be in the mix to meet American energy demand, which is expected to increase by at least 2% each year in 2025 and 2026. 
“We know that more energy is needed across our nation, so it’s not an either or, it’s an all of the above approach that we need to be taking,” Markham said. 
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa is one of a group of GOP lawmakers advocating for the energy tax credits. Miller-Meeks testified in favor of the credits, in the House Ways and Means Committee, urging her colleagues to develop an “any of the above” strategy to meet energy demands.
“Our energy sector faces significant challenges that demand bold action,” Miller-Meeks said.  
She noted the Inflation Reduction Act of the previous administration created some “important energy tax credits that are already driving transformative investments across the U.S. energy sector.” 
Miller-Meeks, along with 20 other Republican lawmakers wrote to the House Ways and Means Committee Chair, Rep. Jason Smith, R-MO, asking that any changes to energy tax credits be done in a “pragmatic fashion” without “undoing” programs that are already promoting energy innovation and lowering utility costs. 
Markham said the environmental group was grateful for the support of the Iowa representative.
“We need more Republicans to stand up and support these clean energy tax credits, specifically because they are bipartisan, they always have been, until now,” Markham said. 
The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a budget resolution April 10, just before leaving for a spring recess, that will allow both chambers to work on a reconciliation package upon their return. Per the adopted resolution, Congress must make $1.5 trillion in cuts to federal spending.

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia has filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of a Marshall University graduate student whose visa was “unlawfully” revoked as a part of an immigration crackdown by President Donald Trump’s administration. 
More than 1,000 international students at 160 colleges and universities across the country have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since March, according to a report by the Associated Press.  That includes students at colleges and universities in West Virginia. 
The Marshall student, identified in a Friday news release as S.V., was one month away from graduating when his visa was revoked, according to the ACLU-WV. The student received an email stating that his F-1 visa was being revoked and later learned that he was “identified in a criminal records check,” the news release said.
S.V., 28-year-old data science student originally from India, was sentenced to probation in 2020 in Indiana for operating a vehicle under the influence, a misdemeanor, according to the release. He left the United States and returned in 2023 to study at Marshall. 
ACLU-WV legal director Aubrey Sparks said that having been identified in a criminal record check is not legal ground for terminating a visa.  
“Our client was not convicted of a crime of violence, nor was he convicted of a crime for which the potential sentence is more than one year, meaning that he categorically is not subject to termination of his F-1 status on those grounds,” Sparks said. 
According to the ACLU, S.V. disclosed the previous charge when re-applying, satisfied all requirements, and was permitted to re-enter the country under the new visa. The student was  in the process of applying for post-graduate work in the United States when he received the  email ending his visa.  
The situation caused chaos for his education and career plans, he said. 
“I desperately want to complete my graduate degree and pursue work in the United States,” he  said in the news release. “It is clear this wasn’t a decision based on my circumstance or experience — this was a predetermined outcome and they just said whatever needed to be said to justify it, even when it  didn’t apply to me.” 
The ACLU-WV filed the lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The complaint names Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Todd Lyons, acting director of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. 
Across the country,  lawsuits have been filed and rallies held in response to the student visas being revoked. 
Government officials have not specified the reasons the administration has canceled visas, but U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month that participating in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza will not be tolerated.
“They’re here to go to class. They’re not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine our universities. I think it’s lunacy to continue to allow that,” Rubio said. 
In the news release, ACLU-WV executive director Eli Baumwell said international students and scholars are a vital part of the nation’s universities, economy and communities.
“Unfortunately, it has become increasingly clear that the Trump administration is simply taking the law into its own hands in its crusade against noncitizens,” he said. “Never before has a president taken such sweeping actions to revoke student visas, and that’s why we need the courts to step in and protect their rights to due process under the Constitution.”

Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)WEST YELLOWSTONE, MONTANA — Tchotchke shop owners are busy stocking shelves with Old Faithful shot glasses, stuffed teddy bears and Yellowstone hoodies. Motel managers are hiring their last employees as the summer tourism season begins with the opening of Yellowstone’s West Entrance today.
After park crews plowed a winter’s worth of snow from roads, visitors are now motoring to Old Faithful, Canyon and Norris, marking the unofficial start to the summer. This year, fewer of those tourists, ogling at “red dog” bison calves, delighting in a geyser’s eruption and soaking up spectacular mountain views, will likely be international travelers.
Overseas travel to the U.S. nosedived 11.6% in March, reflecting jitters over Trump administration tariffs, stock market turmoil and foreign bitterness toward the country’s altered relationship with the rest of the world.

Several data points reveal a sluggish start to the summer tourism season.
The International Trade Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce, reported the 11.6% drop in overseas visitation in March. (The figure, compared to the same month last year, does not reflect travelers from Canada and Mexico.)
“U.S. Economy to Lose Billions as Foreign Tourists Stay Away,” Bloomberg headlined an April 14 story.
Mike Gierau, a Wyoming state senator, restaurant owner and co-chairman of JH AIR, a nonprofit business consortium that coordinates service to Jackson Hole, sees the tide. “International travel is dropping like a stone based on all the stuff coming from Washington,” he said.
Moreover, at the South Entrance to the world’s first national park, the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce reports a dip in the 60-day outlook for already booked hotel rooms compared to 2024.
Rick Howe, the chamber’s president, said June and July “are not as strong as we would expect — they’re not picking up as quickly as they [usually] do.”
That 60-day outlook, released March 31, shows about 54% of coming days falling shy of last year’s numbers based on bookings at 16 hotels.
“It’s not going to be a record year,” Howe said.
 Not giving up hope on tourists

In 2024, travel spending in Wyoming amounted to $4.9 billion, according to the Wyoming Office of Tourism. Travel and tourism supported 33,610 jobs, generated $278 million in tax receipts and resulted in 8.8 million overnight visitors, the office said in a review of last year.
Tourism, Gierau said, is the second-largest revenue-generating industry in the Equality State behind energy development. “In tourism, everything you do is taxed,” he said, “everything we buy, everything we sell.”
Despite the data dips, industry officials hope and believe in redemption. If overseas visitors aren’t coming to the U.S., Americans could forego foreign travel as well, spending their time vacationing closer to home instead.
“One door closes, another opens,” Gierau said.
Also, the outlook for visitors to Jackson Hole, while not yet documented by the chamber, is upbeat for August and September, Howe said. Overall, “we’re pretty much on par with last summer — for the moment,” he said.
  A March 31 graph of the 60-day outlook for 2025 hotel room bookings at 16 Jackson Hole inns. (Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce)
At Yellowstone’s East Entrance near Cody, lodge owners have seen “a little bit of a drop,” in reservations, said Jennifer Thoma, the executive director of the Cody Country Chamber of Commerce. There’s now a glimmer of relief.
“It seems like reservation numbers are back up,” she said.
In addition to tariffs, market turmoil and foreign enmity, DOGE cuts to the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service have rattled travelers. Those indiscriminate firings and resignations have sparked worries that campgrounds won’t open and toilets won’t be cleaned.
Tourism industry leaders seek to assure potential customers that DOGE disorder won’t affect their vacations. Yellowstone National Park Lodges General Manager Mike Keller acknowledged in an email that Park Service “staffing uncertainty” has generated worries.
“We are here to assure you that our operations are unaffected and we are ready to welcome you to a memorable Yellowstone experience this spring and summer,” his email reads. “The park remains open, the views are as breathtaking as ever, the wildlife is flourishing, and the sense of wonder that Yellowstone National Park evokes is unchanging and eternal.”
 COVID redux?

For Howe at the Jackson chamber, the season could mimic the surge in RV campers and regional travel that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. “People are not worried services won’t be available,” he said.
“We are not hearing the concerns that we were two to three weeks ago,” Howe said. “Those calls are not happening anymore.”
He also asked innkeepers a month ago to report whether they’re getting calls from people cancelling reservations because of economic hardships. “The answer is ‘no,’” he said.
Reflecting information from airlines, Gierau predicted “a good summer,” but also one that’s “just different.”
There will be fewer bus tours filled with foreigners and, instead, more people “on the senior circuit,” he said.
The next Jackson chamber 60-day outlook through mid-June, compiled by consultants DestiMetrics, publishes April 20. A crash is “not a major concern at the moment,” Howe said. “It’s kind of a moving target,” Howe said of the summer forecast. “With all the things going on, things changing rapidly, it’s hard to know.”

(Photo courtesy New Mexico Wild)New Mexico Democrats U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich and U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez on Friday announced the reintroduction of the M.H. Dutch Salmon Greater Gila Wild and Scenic River Act, which would designate approximately 450 miles of the Gila and San Francisco Rivers and their tributaries “wild and scenic rivers.” That designation would protect the area under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The bill has been introduced three prior times with support from the entire delegation.
“The Gila and San Francisco Rivers are among the last wild, free-flowing rivers in the Southwest— vital to the region’s wildlife, communities, and culture. To truly safeguard the Gila’s wild character, we must also protect its rivers,” Heinrich, ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement.
Vasquez, who held a news conference with members of the Wild Gila River Coalition in Silver City on Friday, called the Gila River “a symbol of everything we love about New Mexico—wild, beautiful and full of life. This legislation is about protecting that legacy for future generations.”
Reintroduction of the bill came with support from a myriad of sources, including New Mexico Wild Executive Director Mark Allison, who said the bill “honors the original vision of Aldo Leopold and river champions like the late Dutch Salmon, without whose efforts this river we love would have been greatly diminished. The legislation also aims to preserve sites held sacred to communities that have called the Gila region home for centuries. New Mexicans know how irreplaceable our natural and cultural heritage is and overwhelmingly support this effort.”
(For more on Leopold and the Gila, be sure to read his 1921 essay “The Wilderness and Its Place in Forest Recreational Policy.”)
Fort Sill Apache Tribe Chairwoman Jennifer Heminokeky noted in a statement that “much of the Gila and San Francisco rivers are located within the Fort Sill (Chiricahua-Warm Springs ) Apache Tribe’s original 14-million-acre homeland that our ancestors were removed from by force. The Gila River and its tributaries provide a cultural roadmap to our ancestors who thrived in the surrounding lands for centuries. This legislation reflects my belief that it is our responsibility to protect these cultural and natural resources for future generations, just as our ancestors cared for these lands and rivers before us. We will continue to stand with others in this community to protect the Gila and San Francisco rivers.”
Residents and local governments also commended the legislation and remarked on its importance. “Each member of this community has a different story of their experience and connection to the forest and the river, but protection of the Gila is extremely important to all of us,” Silver City Councilor and Mayor Pro Tem Guadalupe Cano said in a statement. “As our community continues to grow and evolve, our love of the Gila is the one thing that stays the same.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gila-River-Middle-Fork-Sara-Bergthold-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 18:07:53.748274

(Murray State photo)Another international student’s visa has been revoked in Kentucky, this time at Murray State University.
According to local news reports, Murray State shared information about the student’s visa being revoked by the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday. A university spokesperson declined to give further information to protect the student’s privacy. 
The news comes amid Trump administration efforts to ramp up deportations. Inside Higher Ed reported that as of Friday, more than 1,550 international students and recent graduates have had their legal status changed by the U.S. State Department. 
Murray State College Democrats penned an open letter criticizing the university administration for not alerting students sooner to the visa revocation and asking for clearer information about the university’s response. “To be clear, we are not asking that personal information be released, just notification of when law enforcement is present and/or actively targeting students on campuses,” the letter says.
The College Democrats said students and their families choose colleges like Murray because they trust they will be safe there and that Murray “boasts about having international students from over 50 different countries.”
“Every student that seeks to learn at MSU has the right to do so without fear of persecution,” the letter reads. “Actions taken by administration are the only way to prove that the university cares about and will protect those rights.” 
A Murray spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment Friday afternoon. 
Earlier this month, the University of Kentucky reported a “small number” of graduate students had their visas revoked by the Department of Homeland Security.

Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A North Dakota federal judge ruled this week that a group of Catholic employers do not have to follow new federal regulations meant to protect workers’ access to abortion and fertility treatment, and to shield LGBTQ employees from discrimination.
The order, released Tuesday by Judge Daniel Traynor, relates to two documents issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year. One is a rule implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and the other updated non-binding guidance on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlaws workplace discrimination.
The Diocese of Bismarck and the Catholic Benefits Association took issue with both of the regulations, arguing in an August federal court complaint that they force Catholic employers to go against their religious beliefs.
Bismarck Diocese Bishop David Kagan said in a statement the diocese is thankful for the verdict.
“The Court has upheld our religious freedom rights and that is all we ever wanted,” he said.

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022, requires employers to provide workplace accommodations for pregnant and postpartum mothers — like food, water and bathroom breaks, reduced physical labor and medical leave.
The EEOC was tasked with implementing the law through an administrative rule, which was finalized last spring.
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act does not specifically say employers must accommodate employees who seek abortions or infertility treatments. The rule does, however — which prompted the Diocese of Bismarck and Catholic Benefits Association to sue.
The plaintiffs alleged that in including protections for employees who seek abortions and infertility treatments, the EEOC went against the will of Congress. They also called the rule a violation of their religious freedoms, since the Catholic Church opposes abortion and certain kinds of fertility procedures.
The EEOC’s rule doesn’t include blanket exemptions for religious employers, though the agency has said religious exemption claims will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Laura Bakst, an attorney for the Department of Justice, said at a September federal court hearing that this allows the federal agency to handle cases more fairly.
The plaintiffs argued it’s unfair for employers to only be able to request an exemption when they’re already facing enforcement action.
The lawsuit also took aim at updated workplace harassment guidance published by the EEOC last year. It states that harassment based on reproductive health care decisions — including abortion, fertility treatments and contraception — as well as sexual orientation and gender identity may now be considered sex discrimination under Title VII. 
It lists refusing to use transgender people’s preferred pronouns or not allowing them to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity as examples of possible discrimination, for example.
Plaintiffs claimed this guidance would restrict them from following the Catholic Church’s religious teachings on reproductive and LGBTQ issues.
The guidance “effectively requires Catholic employers to use false pronouns, to avoid speaking the truth regarding human sexuality around certain employees, and to permit opposite-sex employees to intrude into private spaces reserved to those of the other sex,” their complaint states.
Title VII does include an exemption for religious employers, but the Diocese of Bismarck and Catholic Benefits Association said the new guidance flouts this exemption.
Employers who don’t comply with the regulations can face enforcement action from the EEOC. They can also be sued by their employees.
At the September hearing, an attorney for the plaintiffs argued his clients will be forced to choose between accommodating practices they consider immoral or being accused of workplace discrimination.
“We’re living in fear that we’ll go through thousands of enforcement actions,” Andrew Nussbaum said during the hearing.
The EEOC has said that it considered public comment, the intent of Congress and guidance from the courts in writing the regulations. It also rejected the notion that either the rule or the guidance would infringe on employers’ ability to practice their faith. 
Traynor last fall temporarily blocked the EEOC from requiring Catholic Benefits Association members to comply with the challenged portions of the regulations. Tuesday’s ruling made those exemptions permanent.
In his September order, Traynor found that the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act rule and the Title VII guidance “place a substantial burden” on the plaintiffs’ ability to practice their religion.
He also wrote that the federal agency did not show it has a compelling interest in leaving the regulations in place, or that the rule and guidance sufficiently minimize the burdens they place on religious organizations.
Traynor was appointed a federal judge in 2020 by former President Donald Trump. He served on the board for the North Dakota Catholic Conference from 1999-2001, according to a questionnaire for judicial nominees.

Spencer Cox says he’s working on issuing an emergency declaration. 
Despite northern Utah seeing average snow this year, counties in the south are exceptionally dry. Cox said he’s currently working with local officials on the declaration, which could extend to a handful of counties in the southwestern corner of Utah that have seen a meager snowpack this winter. 
“We feel really good about where we are,” Cox said about water conditions on Thursday during his monthly PBS Utah news conference, calling it a “pretty normal year for most of the state.” 
“However, I will say it wasn’t a great year for all of the state. And southern Utah, especially southwestern Utah, was well below average and they are seeing some elevated drought conditions there. I would say, yes, there is a very real possibility; in fact, we’re working on it right now, of an emergency declaration,” the governor said. 
Statewide, the snow water equivalent — which is basically the amount of water currently in the snowpack — is at about 78% of normal, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service, or NRCS, which tracks the snowpack at sites around the state. Much of northern Utah is between that or higher, with Snowbird’s site at 96%, and a site in Big Cottonwood Canyon at 115%. 
But many NRCS sites in southern Utah are below 50% of the median snow water equivalent, some with just 1%, even 0%. Much of Washington and Iron counties are currently in extreme drought, according to the Utah Division of Water Resources, while swaths of Beaver, Millard, Juab, Tooele, Uintah, Grand and San Juan counties are in severe drought. 
The rest of the state is either in moderate drought or abnormally dry, except for a sliver of northwestern Box Elder County and the high elevation portions of Salt Lake, Utah, Morgan, Wasatch and Summit counties.

“The Drought Response Committee has been meeting more regularly to address concerns in drought-impacted areas,” said Candice Hasenyager, Utah Division of Water Resources director, in a statement Friday. “Many state agencies are coordinating their response to drought conditions that will likely intensify heading into summer.”
Hasenyager reminded Utahns to hold off on irrigation until “your landscape needs it.” 
“Most of northern Utah can hold off on irrigating until Mother’s Day or until temperatures are in the mid-70s for several days,” she said. 
The state’s reservoirs somewhat mirror the snowpack, with northern Utah looking good and southern Utah falling behind. In the north, the larger lakes and reservoirs — Strawberry, Bear Lake, Jordanelle, Flaming Gorge, Utah Lake, Deer Creek, Starvation and Pineview — are all above 75% capacity, with some hovering just below 100%.
But south of Price, all but five reservoirs — Huntington, Joes Valley, Otter Creek, Quail Creek and Sand Hollow — are above 75%. Some, like Yuba Reservoir or Panguitch Lake, are below 50%. 
The outlook is particularly bad for the country’s second-largest reservoir, Lake Powell, which is federally controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. As of Friday, the reservoir was at about 32% capacity.

According to the Utah Rivers Council, Lake Powell is about 70 feet above the minimum level for the Glen Canyon Dam to generate hydroelectric power. That level will continue to decline into the summer and fall, the council said, pointing to an “increasingly dire runoff future.” 
“The countdown can start on Utah having to cut its portion of Colorado River water,” said Zach Frankel, executive director of the Utah Rivers Council. “Other states in the basin are putting odds on how soon that will happen and it’s definitely coming, alongside the shutdown of Glen Canyon hydropower.”
During the news conference on Thursday, Cox said he is “always worried about Lake Powell,” and has been for years, with the Colorado River plagued by drought and decreased flows.
“The good news is that Lake Powell, that water going into Powell does not come from the southwest side of the state,” said Cox, referring to the source of the Colorado River, which is in alpine areas of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. “The water content in the mountains is a little bit better there.”
The governor can declare a state of emergency in response to natural disasters or public health threats. However, after tension brewed between the Legislature and former Utah Gov. Gary Herbert over his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers passed a law in 2021 limiting emergency declarations to 30 days. 
The Legislature could extend that emergency declaration if lawmakers pass a joint resolution. 
Cox hinted that lawmakers could convene in May for a special session — so if he issues an emergency declaration this month, he’ll have the opportunity to work with legislators to extend the declaration, since it’s likely drought conditions will worsen during the spring and summer months. 
Although he didn’t elaborate on what the order will entail, Cox issued executive orders related to drought in 2021 and 2022. Both orders allowed drought-effected communities and agricultural producers access to state and federal emergency resources.

(Courtesy of The Playing Field)Federal payments to Wisconsin’s Head Start programs in the first three and a half months of 2025 are half what they were a year ago, exacerbating worries about the future of the program that provides child care and early education to low-income families.
The Office of Head Start’s payments to Wisconsin program operators from Jan. 1 through April 15 of this year were down by $35 million from the same period in 2024, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) said this week.
Nationwide, Head Start program operators have received $943 million less during that period this year compared with the period a year ago, according to Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington), who published a table of calculations comparing disbursements for every state in a press release. The table shows Wisconsin disbursements of $34.5 million as of April 15, compared with $69.5 million in the 2024 period.
Baldwin contrasted the potential impact with the pledge by the White House and the Republican majority in Congress to extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump’s first term.
“The idea that the president is actively working to give the biggest corporations and wealthiest Wall Street guys a new tax break while taking away preschool and child care from Wisconsinites is beyond the pale,” said Baldwin, vowing to fight actions of President Donald Trump she described as “defunding Head Start.”
The calculations in Murray’s table are based on Head Start disbursement data that Senate Democrats pulled from the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System (TAGGS) website at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
While most states in Murray’s table had lower disbursements compared with a year ago, Alabama, Delaware, New Jersey, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia all showed increases.
The calculations put the big-picture numbers on funding disruptions that Head Start providers have been experiencing in the last three months, said Jennie Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association.
Those disruptions first surfaced after Trump took office, with delays of up to two weeks in late January and early February for Head Start programs seeking authorized payment for their expenses.
More recently, the disruptions have continued as providers who have submitted the required documents for payment have been confronted with unexpected demands for “more information” Mauer said Friday.
“The [federal] administration is really messing around, pulling out the foundational blocks of grant operation,” Mauer said.
In order to get approved for a grant, recipients must provide a detailed accounting of how it will be spent, she said. To get payment, providers must submit detailed documentation that the expense it covers has already been incurred. 
“This is a highly regulated system,” Mauer said. “There’s a very rigorous initial grant application process, and then on an ongoing basis grantees are demonstrating, ‘We told you what we’re going to spend the money on. Now based on what I told you, I’m asking for that money.’”
The disclosure of the drop in Head Start funding comes a week after a published report raised the possibility that Head Start will be zeroed out of the next federal budget.
It also comes as some providers wait for information about their upcoming grant replenishments, Mauer said.
Head Start grants are provided under multi-year contracts signed with providers. The money itself, however, does not come to providers in large lump sums but in smaller amounts paid upon the submission of documented expenses, Mauer said.
Every six months, an allotment from the provider’s grant is made available, she said. Those funds are not paid directly to the provider, however. The money is set aside for the provider to draw on after submitting expense documents through the federal online payment system.
Providers’ grant cycles start on the first of the month. In Wisconsin, providers whose grant cycle started Nov. 1 have now received confirmation of their next grant allotment for the six months starting May 1, Mauer said Friday.
But with the previous funding access problems and then the sudden closing three weeks ago of half of Head Start’s national offices, including the Chicago Region 5 office that served Wisconsin and five other states, providers were apprehensive.
“The level of uncertainty and chaos is so dramatic,” Mauer said — in contrast not only to the Biden administration, but also the previous Trump administration. Until this year, “these kinds of questions and uncertainties didn’t exist.”
Three providers whose grant cycle started Dec. 1 are waiting to learn whether their next allotment will become available starting June 1 as scheduled.
Mauer said the Senate Democrats’ calculations appear to be “showing the cumulative effect” of the access to HHS funding streams by the team working for DOGE, an agency directed by billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk.
DOGE is the acronym for the Department of Government Efficiency, although the office is not a cabinet department, and many of its claims of government savings have been questioned.
The hold-up on information is having “a tremendous negative effect on our programs and it’s alarming,” Mauer said. “When we think of what are the impacts of Region 5 closing and that we continue to have very, very minimal and slow communication from the Office of Head Start — they need to start communicating with grantees in a much more substantive way.”
The Wisconsin Examiner contacted the federal Department of Health and Human Services using the HHS website for journalists’ inquiries and has not yet received a response. This report will be updated when a response is received.

As United States immigration officers called out countries, more and more of the crowd gathered in the University of Northern Iowa Mauker Union ballroom stood up. There were 25 countries represented among the almost 70 immigrants attending their naturalization ceremony Friday, having come together to complete their journey to becoming a U.S. citizen.
Family, friends and members of the UNI community cheered as participants received their certificates of naturalization and shook hands with Judge Mark Roberts, who presided over the ceremony. Chance Amani, a 21-year-old from Tanzania celebrating her naturalization, said her little sister was watching in the crowd and she had more family waiting at home in Cedar Rapids to congratulate her.
“I’m so happy,” Amani said, clutching her documents and a small American flag.

During his remarks, Roberts said despite having the honor of presiding over several ceremonies like Friday’s every year, he still gets emotional when he gets to be the first person to tell candidates they are U.S. citizens. Every single person, the youngest being 20 years old and the oldest 74, should be proud of what they accomplished and aware of what it means to be a U.S. citizen, he said.
“We hear a lot these days about what rights we have, but maybe we don’t speak enough about what we owe,” Roberts said. “With the benefit of citizenship comes responsibility of citizenship.”

Those receiving their naturalization certificate Friday were led through the Oath of Allegiance, in which they renounced allegiance and fidelity to any foreign land and pledged to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and law and bear arms, participate in military service and “perform work of national importance under civilian direction” when required.
Other duties U.S. citizens are responsible for include paying taxes, voting for leaders whenever they have an opportunity and following the law, Roberts said.
This was the first in-person naturalization ceremony held at UNI since before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago, and university professor and political science department head Scott Peters said it was wonderful to invite people back again to celebrate together.
The ceremony was sponsored by the new UNI Center for Civic Education, Peters said, as it aligns with the center’s goals of enhancing civic education on campus, expanding public outreach and broadening civics education for K-12 students throughout the state.
Seeing all of the people come together for an occasion like this is “an amazing feeling,” Peters said, and it helps remind him not to take what he has for granted.
“I just feel privileged that I even have the opportunity to have a small part in this day that I know is so important for them,” Peters said.
Chelsea Galoni, an immigrant from Canada who earned her citizenship while her wife, daughter, mother and grandmother cheered from the crowd, said she’s been waiting 14 years for this moment. She moved to the U.S. in 2011 to pursue her PhD from Northwestern University and now works as a business professor at the University of Iowa.

During the ceremony, Galoni’s daughter ran about in an empty area between rows of seats, an American flag from her mother waving in her hand. Having her family right there to share in the special moment with was an important aspect of the ceremony that Galoni said she may have missed if it was online.
“There’s an element of humanity that happens when they’re in person that’s nice,” Galoni said.
Ramon Pellizzaro, who moved to the U.S. with his mother and sister from Brazil when he was 11 years old, has Galoni beat for waiting for this day to happen — 22 years. His sister completed her citizenship process during the COVID-19 pandemic, Pellizzaro said, and it felt less formal. Pellizzaro enjoyed having a special event to commemorate this milestone, as it is a big undertaking.
One of the reasons Pellizarro was able to stay in the country for as long as he did before becoming a citizen was his participation in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. He said the program allowed him to “create a life here,” leading to him meeting his wife and working as a data and analytics project manager at John Deere.
“It’s a good country,” Pellizzaro said. “Don’t take it for granted.”

After a number of revisions to the summary language, the board, which is made up of two Democrats and two Republicans, voted unanimously to approve the proposal language and the form. 



The final language approved by the board reads:
“Constitutional amendment to: add requirement to verify citizenship by showing a birth certificate, passport and/or other documents for voter registration; eliminate affidavit alternative for those without photo ID when voting; add requirement to provide photo ID or driver’s license or partial social security number to receive our vote in absentee ballot; require Secretary of State to review voter rolls to verify citizens and remove non citizens using documents and government records; prohibit counting ballots from voters without citizenship documents and photo ID unless voters show documents within six days after election; require hardship program for obtaining required documents at state expense.” 



The proposed amendment mirrors an effort introduced by state Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) after a Chinese citizen attending the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor cast a ballot in the previous election.When Posthumus’ proposal was put forth in December, an organization called the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights launched a website proposing a petition drive to get an amendment on the ballot if lawmakers do not take up the proposal.
While Posthumus reintroduced the proposal in January, the effort has yet to come up for a vote on the House floor, with Democrats calling its provisions akin to a “poll tax”. Meanwhile, the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights has moved forward with a ballot proposal effort. 
In order to appear on the 2026 ballot, the committee must gather 446,198 signatures within 180 days and file them with the Secretary of State. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
During the meeting, the board’s Democratic members as well as representatives from several voting rights groups argued the initial summary, as well as edits proposed by the group sponsoring the proposal, failed to capture the full impact of the amendment. 
Alongside concerns that the proposal would disenfranchise married women, low-income individuals, seniors, people living in rural communities and people who are homeless and cannot access the documents needed to prove their identity, board members and opponents raised concerns about how the proposal would impact individuals who have signed up to vote absentee in every election, as well as what documents could be used to prove citizenship. 
Democrat Mary Ellen Gurewitz, the board’s vice chair, specifically raised concerns about birth certificates being listed in the summary, as married women who change their names would be required to submit both a birth certificate and a marriage license to verify their identity, though Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights attorney Charles Spies said this process was not unique to voting alone. 
  Mary Ellen Gurewitz, vice chair of the Michigan Board of State Canvassers during an April 18, 2025 meeting | Screenshot.
Gurewitz further argued that the proposal would strip voters of their rights, pointing to Proposal 18-3 and Proposal 22-2, where Michigan residents voted to expand voting rights to include no-reason absentee voting, nine days of early voting, use of a photo ID or signed affidavit to verify their identity, placement on a permanent absentee voter list and access to ballot drop boxes. 
However, Spies argued the proposal was not removing any right, but rather was protecting the rights of Michiganders to “not have their votes diluted.” 
While noncitizens are not eligible to vote in federal, state or most local elections, some municipalities do allow them to vote in their elections.
Instances of noncitizen voting are exceedingly rare, with Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson issuing a press release on April 3, noting that the state saw 16 credible cases of noncitizen voting in the November 2024 election out of more than 5.7 million total votes cast, though several members of the public who spoke up at Friday’s meeting argued that any instance of noncitizen voting watered down their right to vote.

Paul Cordes, one of the board’s Republicans members, also argued that any number of voters cast illegally within the state is a problem with the system.
Heather Cummings, the other Democrat on the board, concurred with Gurewitz, arguing that characterizing the proposal as an effort to protect voter rights is misleading. She later questioned how the proposal would impact the ability for Michigan residents to register to vote online. 
Charles Thomas Jr., the founder of the voter rights organization When You Vote – I Win, testified on his own behalf pointing to discrepancies between his and his father’s name on his birth certificate, his name on his driver’s license and his name on his passport. 
“I’m a junior. I love the fact that you know, you all asked me to spell my name. On my birth certificate. I found that my father’s name is spelled C, H, A, R L, E, Y. My name is spelled C, H, A, R, L, I, E. On my license is C H A R L, E, S.  I got a passport, C, H, A, R, L, E, S.  I’m not sure which one would count if I had to produce information to say who I was in order just to be able to obtain the right to vote,” Thomas said. 
Erica Peresman, the Senior Advisor for Promote the Vote, which successfully backed both the 2018 and 2022 voting rights amendments, told the Michigan Advance that these difficult-to-correct discrepancies should not be a barrier to voting. 
While the proposal would have the Legislature craft a program to ensure citizens facing hardship have the documents needed to cast their ballot, the way that program would operate remains up in the air, Peresman said, predicting that state officials would not be the ones helping residents from out of state retrieve their birth certificates from the place where they were born. 

“They’re just going to pay the cost of it, the legwork and dealing with the bureaucracies in these various states, that all has to be done by the individuals.…Our concern is always that people might just give up. They might not have the time, the energy, the resources to be able to run down all of these things, even if the actual cost of the document itself is being covered by the state,” Peresman said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/election-2022-voter-scaled-e1667935206448-1024x7681671667081-1.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 18:07:53.748274

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A new superintendent at Edmond Public Schools will start his tenure with a higher base salary than the retiring district leader he will replace.
Josh Delich will earn a base salary of $236,903 when he takes office July 1, along with a $20,000 relocation stipend to move to Edmond from Minnesota, where he is an associate superintendent in the state’s largest school district.
Delich will succeed Superintendent Angela Grunewald, who earned a base salary of about $221,000 in 2024 and in 2025 received a total compensation of $248,144 when factoring in the total value of her benefits as well as her base salary, state records show. Grunewald is retiring after four years in charge of Edmond schools.
After hiring Delich on Monday, the district released his contract Friday afternoon to Oklahoma Voice, showing the incoming superintendent’s salary, benefits and additional stipends.
It’s unclear how much Delich’s total benefits will cost on top of his base salary. His contract states the district will cover the full price of premiums for his health, vision and dental insurance, and it will pay both the employer and employee’s portions of his contribution into the state’s Teacher Retirement System. He also will receive $500 per month as an automobile allowance.

In addition to his relocation stipend, the district will pay Delich $3,000 per month for up to six months to maintain his home in Minnesota until it is sold.
Delich will earn $987.10 per day for an expected 23 days for work completed before he takes office as superintendent. A temporary contract lasting until June 30 states he will consult with district officials as he transitions into the administration, including assisting with new employee hires, budget work, facility planning and opening, strategic planning and other tasks deemed necessary. 
Because Delich will be working with Edmond schools during the transition, he will forgo compensation from the Minnesota district, the contract states. His Edmond contract includes a buyout stipend of no more than $18,000. The final amount of the buyout stipend is still to be determined, according to the contract.
Once he takes office, he will be subject to a yearly performance evaluation after which the school board could agree to raise his base salary, which is a common practice for district superintendents. His salary could only decrease through a mutual agreement, according to the contract.
Delich will be near, if not among, the top 20 highest-earning Oklahoma superintendents when he becomes the chief executive in Edmond, the state’s fourth-largest district with 25,700 students.
Norman Public Schools Superintendent Nick Migliorino tops the list with $411,955 in annual salary and benefits, according to compensation data the Oklahoma State Department of Education compiled. 
The state agency’s list, though, doesn’t include Jamie Polk, who leads the state’s second-largest district, Oklahoma City Public Schools. At the time Polk was hired last year, her contract set out a $250,000 base salary, not including benefits and a potential performance bonus.
Like Polk, Delich is a first-time superintendent. He has 21 years of experience in education as a teacher, coach, principal and district administrator. He was an assistant superintendent in St. Paul Public Schools in Minnesota before joining Anoka-Hennepin Schools, Minnesota’s largest district.

While introducing him as the district’s next leader, Edmond school board President Courtney Hobgood praised Delich’s experience, his heart for education and his “passion for continuing the forward progress in Edmond and building on our history of success.”
Delich said Monday he is “blessed and humbled” to become the superintendent of Edmond, which he called a destination district with an “immense amount of excellence.” He and his wife, Desirae, will have their two daughters start school in Edmond in the coming year, according to a letter he penned to district families.
“I want to infuse myself and integrate myself into (the) system to best learn what is going on with Edmond in terms of the excellence that’s happening and also look at the areas that we need to improve and advance while at the same time giving a sense of calm to a district that I know, when you have a new leader, there’s that sense of anxiety,” Delich said while speaking with news media Monday.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington began to offer Medicaid-like health care coverage last year for thousands of low-income immigrants living in the state without legal status.
Now, with talks over the next two-year state budget in their final stages, lawmakers are looking to maintain the expansion. But enrollment in the program remains capped based on available funding and legislators are not on track to change that this year.
Rep. My-Linh Thai, D-Bellevue, introduced a bill early in the session that would have opened the program to all immigrants who meet the income eligibility guidelines and other requirements. 
Her bill, which would have created additional costs for the state at a time when lawmakers are trying to solve a budget shortfall, never got a hearing. Thai also said there was controversy about language referring to noncitizens as “Washingtonians.” 
“We cannot just keep paying for emergency room visits, no coverage,” said Thai. “Charity can only extend for so much, right? I mean, this is responsible governing.” 
Federal law largely prevents noncitizens from accessing benefits through Medicaid, but states can use state dollars to create programs for this population. 
Medicaid, known as Apple Health in Washington, provides health care coverage to people with lower incomes. In Washington, about 1.8 million residents are covered by Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program.
On July 1, 2024, Washington launched a program to offer Apple Health benefits to immigrants in the U.S. without legal authorization who meet certain eligibility guidelines. But the program, which is designed to mirror Medicaid, only had enough funding to cover up to 13,000 people. 
Within the first 48 hours, all slots were filled, and an additional 17,000 people signed up to be on the waiting list, according to Sasha Wasserstrom, policy director at the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network. 
Funding for the program is currently around $76.8 million a year. House-approved budget legislation would provide funding in line with that amount. The Senate’s operating budget bill would commit less — $67.5 million and $64.6 million in the next two fiscal years. But the Senate plan banks on changes that would achieve savings in costs for care.
The Apple Health Expansion program, as it’s known, operates only using state funds, as opposed to the traditional Medicaid program, which relies on a combination of federal and state dollars.
Advocates say that since the expansion took place, people have been able to access cancer and dialysis treatments that have extended their lives. 
“It sounds so extreme, but it’s genuine, that people will die as a result of not receiving health care access,” said Kaitie Dong, a policy analyst at the Washington State Budget and Policy Center. 
Republicans argue that the state needs to be careful with its spending during a year with a substantial budget deficit and that the state shouldn’t be giving services to people who are noncitizens while cutting services for others. 
“We should have compassion, but we should also make sure we follow the rule of law,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia. 
In Washington, immigrants without legal authorization to work in the U.S. contributed nearly $1 billion to state and local taxes in 2022, according to estimates from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
“The dominant narrative is that people don’t believe that undocumented immigrants pay taxes, but they’re actually some of our greatest tax contributors and economic drivers,” Dong said. 
Expanding health care coverage to noncitizens can also save the state money by reducing emergency medical care costs, said Wasserstrom. 
“We know that providing preventative medical care is more beneficial to the individual and to the system as a whole, and that causes less strain on the system as a whole,” they added.
Federal law requires emergency rooms to treat people regardless of immigration status. But a lack of health insurance often leads to people waiting until their health concerns worsen to seek care, and they then end up in the emergency room. This can contribute to emergency rooms becoming overwhelmed. 
“It’s hard to actually see emergencies when you’re really stuck seeing people who can’t access primary care because they don’t have insurance or feel safe,” said Dr. Shaquita Bell, a pediatrician and director at Odessa Brown Children’s Clinic in Seattle.  
At the clinic where Bell works, some of her patients have parents who lack legal status. During her time as a pediatrician, there have been instances where a parent has expressed their own health care concerns. When this happens, she will either connect them with a social worker who will help them or if someone’s in urgent need of care, she will try to help. 
Advocates hope that the funding cap for the Apple Health program is removed so that anyone who qualifies, regardless of their immigration status, can have access. 
“Caring for immigrants helps everyone, and it’s the right thing to do,” Bell said. “These are people, and every person deserves health care.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0211-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 18:07:53.748274

Patrick Morrisey, seen giving his State of the State address on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025, cut millions of the state budget with line item vetoes before signing the bill into law. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed the budget bill Thursday night, but not before slashing millions of dollars in funding through his line-item veto power. The Republican governor’s cuts were wide sweeping across state programs, and services for vulnerable children were among those surprisingly hit.
“When I took office, I inherited a $400 million structural budget gap in the upcoming fiscal year, which would grow to nearly $600 million in the years ahead if it was not immediately addressed,” Morrisey said in a statement released by his office. “The fiscally conservative budget I signed tonight makes progress tackling structural gaps and begins to place us on a pathway toward financial stability in the future.”
The 29 separate line-item vetoes included slashes in funding for roads, school safety and tourism projects. There were also millions of dollars in cuts to programs that serve foster kids, families impacted by substance abuse and sick children. 
Morrisey cut $250,000 in funding for Lily’s Place, a nonprofit organization in Cabell County that provides treatment for newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome and support for families dealing with substance use disorder. West Virginia has the highest rate nationally of infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome amid the state’s ongoing substance abuse crisis.
House Finance Chairman Vernon Criss, R-Wood, called it one “the most insulting” of Morrisey’s line-item vetoes. 
“This one should be right at the top — to be able to take newborns that are drug-afflicted and be able to help them,” Criss said. “[It] seems to have a very high success rate of helping newborns getting off the drug situation.” 
Morrisey also decreased funding for the Ronald McDonald House in Morgantown and In-Home Family Education, a parent and child support program in West Virginia.
  W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
“It’s almost like you’re picking on kids who can’t speak up for themselves,” said House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell.
The legislative session adjourned with little action on the state’s abundant foster care issues despite bills introduced to address a myriad of problems, including too many foster children living in hotels. 
Lawmakers wanted to give $1.1 million in state funding to West Virginia’s Court Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA, a program that helps foster children in the court system.
Morrisey cut 75% of that funding in his line-item veto. His office did not respond to an email from West Virginia Watch seeking information about the funding decrease. In his veto message, the governor said the program relies on grants and could seek additional grant funding.  
Shanna Gray, executive director of West Virginia CASA, said she was grateful to the Legislature for creating a dedicated line item for the program. 
“We could not be more appreciative of our state lawmakers for prioritizing support for children in foster care,” she said. “Albeit significantly reduced, the governor‘s final allocation of $300,000 establishes a crucial foundation of state support. We remain optimistic about this initial investment and thankful for the state’s recognition of CASA’s essential role in ensuring children’s best interests are represented and heard.”
In total, Morrisey cut $800,000 in foster care funding. 
“The fear is that we’ve got programs out there right now that we do not know if they’ll be able to continue because the federal dollars are going to dry up,” Criss said. “[Morrisey] needs to be able to take a very hard look at all the programs.”
In a news release on Friday, the West Virginia Democratic Party called on the governor to “reconsider these harmful decisions and focus state resources on supporting vulnerable citizens and vital community programs.”

Disagreement among GOP supermajority about budget 
The Republican-led House and Senate passed their $5.3 billion general revenue budget bill last week.
Morrisey’s line-item veto messages used similar language often, saying, “it is imperative that a cautious and prudent approach be taken” while citing concerns about future uncertainties, like the federal stock market fluctuations and federal uncertainty. He also said that there are “ongoing budget challenges.”
The spending vetoes also included $500,000 reduction to Mountwood Park in Wood County for Jeep trails, and a $187,000 reduction to the more than $11 million allocation to the state Veterans Nursing home, and a $250,000 cut for a nursing program at West Virginia State University.
“He decided nursing programs are not where he wants to spend money,” Criss said. 
There was a $25 million reduction to the State Road Fund; Criss said that funding cuts may damage the state Division of Highways’ ability to draw down federal funds for projects. 
Morrisey eliminated $250,000 allocated for the West Virginia University College of Law but did not touch the $1.5 lawmakers gave the university to build a civics learning center overseen by a political appointee. Lawmakers passed a bill mandating the center, but it hasn’t yet been signed by the governor. 
He slashed more than $110 million approved in three surplus funds, which included the funding for Lily’s Place. Morrisey said those funds may be needed for anticipated gaps in Medicaid, Public Employees Insurance Agency and federal changes. 
Morrisey is a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump; Hornbuckle said the governor’s decision to slash state spending because concerns about Medicaid and federal changes showed, “Even the governor doesn’t believe his good friend is going to be able to help West Virginians.”  
“We might have to fill back in dollars to Medicaid or PEIA,” Hornbuckle continued. “People need to be really paying attention to what’s going on there, and he doesn’t trust the Trump administration.”
Hornbuckle added that Morrisey’s line-item vetoes showed disagreement among the state’s GOP-supermajority in power. 
Criss continues to refute Morrisey’s projected $400 million structural deficit.
“I am the last finance chairman still in place from the previous administration, I take that a personal cut,” he said. “[Morrisey] doesn’t understand how we have been budgeting and doing the budget process for the last seven years when we’ve tried to keep our ‘operating portion’ of our budget.” The House wanted the state to have surplus money in the back of the budget that could be used for one-time projects.
Senate Finance Chairman Jason Barrett, R-Berkeley, wasn’t available for comment. 
Funds slashed for safe schools, educational programs 
Morrisey’s line-item vetoes included several education-related projects, including funding decreasing to the Mountain State Digital Literacy Program, a math education program and computer science education. In a veto of $200,000 in funding for Safe Schools, Morrisey said it is, “imperative that we limit new spending.” 
West Virginia’s public schools can’t afford to implement millions of dollars in safety upgrades, including secure front entries and weapon detection systems. There are more than $200 million in school safety requests in need of funding.
“How can we in good faith cut money to safe schools and that is something that goes to all of our public education when we are pumping millions of dollars into the Hope voucher program?” Hornbuckle said. 
The budget passed by the Republican-led Legislature opted to put away about $33.6 million from general revenue to the state Personal Income Tax Reserve Fund. That money, Criss said, can be allocated by the Legislature at any time. The fund has more than $500 million in it, drawing frustration from Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, during budget debate since other programs had gone unfunded. 
The budget didn’t include $100,000 for clean drinking water in Wyoming County. Funding was cut for the state’s Jobs and Hope Program.
Hornbuckle voted against the budget when it passed the House, citing concerns about a lack of funding for child care. 
“I didn’t think it had a lot of fiscal logic and appropriate the dollars that we do have to public education or child care,” he said. “I’m also confused why we went further down the hole right now in making the current cuts that we did.”
In a statement on Thursday, Morrisey said that “much work remains in the next fiscal year to address budget shortfalls.” 
“ … I applaud the Legislature for sending me a budget that closely resembles my original proposal and begins to address long term issues while funding West Virginia priorities,” he said.

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)A bill to create an exemption for cigar rooms from the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act is headed to the House floor — and legislation to strengthen the Act by including e-cigarettes and vape pens in the definition of smoking is headed to the governor’s desk.
Senate Bill 150, sponsored by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, is an attempt to help the hospitality and tourism industry in the state by allowing places where cigar aficionados can legally smoke indoors.
Galt said cigar bars are legal in many states, and a supporter representing the hospitality industry said the lack of an exemption here means Montana is at a competitive disadvantage.
In a statement Friday, Galt said he’s pleased with the progress the bill has made.
“Adults over 21 years of age would have the option to enjoy a cigar in a contained location that meets proper ventilation requirements separate from an established bar or restaurant,” Galt said.
Opponents of the bill argue it undercuts an agreement made decades earlier among legislators, some health advocates and the Montana Tavern Association to put the Clean Indoor Air Act in place in 2005 but allow four years for bars to comply.
The Department of Public Health and Human Services describes it as “one of the most important public health policies in state history.”
Montana Tavern Association spokesperson John Iverson could not be reached for comment Friday.
However, at a hearing in March, Iverson told the House Committee on Business and Labor that his board had a robust debate about the bill and didn’t support it because it undercuts the Clean Indoor Air Act.
“It does that by exposing employees to smoke in their workplace,” Iverson said. “For a long time now, our employees have not been exposed to smoke in their workplace.”
But Iverson said the organization would support the bill if it was amended to prohibit employees from entering the room where patrons are smoking and the room had separate ventilation.
This week, the committee voted on an amendment that changed the venue from “cigar bar” to “cigar room” and said employees can’t enter the room while smoking is taking place unless there’s an emergency.
As currently drafted, the bill would allow smoking of premium cigars in “cigar rooms,” separate enclosed spaces on premises that have a license to serve alcohol.
Patrons wouldn’t be able to smoke anything but premium cigars in those rooms, as the bill is written. So no marijuana or cigarettes.
The bill requires a cigar room to be enclosed and have “a solid door” and a ventilation system that doesn’t send exhausted air to nonsmoking areas.
Thursday, the committee approved the bill on a 12-8 party line vote.
In a phone call Friday, CB Pearson, a public health advocate, said the legislation is worse than originally drafted for the health of workers.
“It is the biggest intrusion into the Clean Indoor Air act and the biggest threat that we have faced over the last 20 years,” Pearson said.
Pearson said one reason he believes the current draft is worse is the original bill required a cigar bar to be a separate, standalone structure, and the amended version allows for a separate room in a building.
But he said rooms leak toxic particulates, such as when someone opens a door.
The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers’ position is that even when “all practical means of separation and isolation of smoking areas are employed, adverse health effects from exposure in non-smoking spaces in the same building cannot be eliminated.”
It also means an employee who enters the room after hours to clean is exposed to particulates because they fall on the floor and stick to the walls, Pearson said.
“There is no way to have a facility that can protect workers if they have to go in and clean up or attend to a site,” Pearson said.
Before it was amended, Galt told the House committee he had been running a version of the cigar bar bill since he first started in the legislature in the House.
“We have continued working on it, trying to tweak it where we can,” Galt said.
Friday, Galt said the idea the bill is worse for public health than when it started is incorrect because it bans employees from entering those rooms.
“During the legislative process, the bill was amended to be contained to a single room in which employees aren’t permitted to enter,” Galt said. “While this wasn’t my original language, it is the result of the legislative process, and I am glad to see it one step closer to becoming law.”
The bill will head to the House floor as amended.
Another bill that affects the Clean Indoor Air Act is Senate Bill 390, sponsored by Sen. Willis Curdy, D-Missoula. It regulates vapes and e-cigarettes.
It passed out of the Senate on Tuesday on a bipartisan 34-16 vote after being amended in the House.
Rep. George Nikolakakos, R-Great Falls, carried the bill in the House, and he said he’s generally a fan of vices.
However, he said he believes there’s a social contract that needs to be honored when it comes to freedom and vices, and the deal includes regulation.
He said Montanans support the Clean Indoor Air Act — a poll said as much as 89% — and Montana has the second highest rate in the nation of vape use, and four times the rate of smoking among adolescents.
“E-cigarettes came into the market just after we passed the Clean Indoor Air Act, so honestly, they probably would have been included had this been on the market at the time,” Nikolakakos said.
The Governor’s Office did not respond to a question Friday about whether Gov. Greg Gianforte would sign SB 390, which is headed to his desk, or if he would have any concerns about an exemption to the Clean Indoor Air Act in SB 150.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos01-scaled-e1731707160413-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

(Photo via Google Earth)  Catholic Health Initiatives-Iowa has dropped its argument in a medical malpractice case that the loss of an unborn child does not equate to the death of a “person” for the purpose of calculating damage awards.
The nonprofit, tax-exempt entity is one of several defendants in a Polk County malpractice case involving the death of an unborn child.
Last month, attorneys for CHI and MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center argued an unborn child should not be considered a “patient” for purposes of calculating damages in the case. They also argued that “finding an unborn child to be a ‘person’ would lead to serious implications in other areas of the law.”
That position appeared to clash with CHI’s mission statement and ethics guidelines, both of which are based on the concept that human life begins at the moment of conception.
In Iowa, court-ordered awards for noneconomic losses stemming from medical malpractice are capped at $250,000, except in cases that entail the “loss or impairment of mind or body.” Initially, CHI and MercyOne argued the cap on damages applied in cases where the “loss” was that of a fetus or an unborn child.
However, during a court hearing on Friday, an attorney for CHI and MercyOne, Christine Conover, informed the court it was withdrawing from the motion to cap damages in the case on that basis.
“We are a Catholic hospital and obviously the Catholic faith believes that life begins at conception,” Conover told Polk County District Judge Scott J. Beattie.
“To be honest, I had wondered about that stance,” Beattie told Conover, referring to the hospital’s previously filed motion seeking to cap damages. “It seemed like kind of an odd stance,” he added, noting that it seemed to contradict the position that CHI had taken in other legal matters.
In a written statement issued Friday, Bob Ritz, president and CEO of MercyOne, stated “we are heartbroken that our belief that human personhood begins at conception would ever be called into question. As a Catholic health system, the sanctity of life is not just a belief we hold; it is the foundation of every action we take.
“While the motion (to limit damages) was accurate from a purely legal standpoint, it has caused confusion and concern. That is why we have asked our counsel to withdraw the motion with respect to MercyOne. No courtroom argument should ever cast doubt on the deeply held Catholic values that guide MercyOne.
“At MercyOne, our Catholic identity is not something we set aside. It is central to who we are. It shapes how we serve and care for people in their most sacred and vulnerable moments. We are more than a health system. We are a health ministry. Our commitment to respect the dignity of every human life, from the very beginning, is unwavering. And it will continue to guide us in everything we do.”
The question of whether the cap on damages would apply in the case is still an issue for other defendants in the case, including Pella Regional Health Center.

Lawsuit stems from 2021 incident
The lawsuit involves the treatment provided to Miranda Anderson of Poweshiek County. Anderson was 34 weeks pregnant when, on April 13, 2021, she arrived at Pella Regional Health Center for evaluation due to elevated blood pressure, headaches and edema.
Citing concerns that she was experiencing preeclampsia — a condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby and may require early delivery — Anderson was transferred to MercyOne’s Obstetrics Emergency Unit via ambulance.
According to the lawsuit later filed by Anderson and her husband, Landen, Miranda Anderson was discharged after two days of monitoring and testing. After further evaluations over the course of the next several days, she was again discharged to her home — until, during an April 21 evaluation, her doctor was unable to detect any fetal heartbeat. The next day, she underwent a cesarean delivery of a nonviable baby girl, Eloise.
The Andersons’ lawsuit seeks damages for negligence, alleging CHI, MercyOne and its physicians failed to recommend early delivery of the baby while it was still viable and Anderson showed evidence of preeclampsia. The defendants have denied any wrongdoing.
Citing the state’s $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages in malpractice cases — a cap that was approved by state legislators in 2017 — the defendants have argued that while the cap on damages includes an exemption for cases that entail the “loss or impairment of mind or body,” that exemption should not apply to a case where a fetus or unborn child is lost.
They argue the Iowa Legislature did not intend for the loss of a baby prior to delivery to be included within the exemption. As evidence of this, they cite the fact that in 2023 — two years after the Anderson pregnancy — state lawmakers explicitly added “loss of pregnancy” to the exemption on the cap for damages.
Attorneys for Anderson argue the 2023 change was enacted merely to clarify the scope of the 2017 statute, not to expand the exemption on the caps for damages.
The case is scheduled for trial on May 12, 2025.
At Friday’s hearing, Beattie indicated he will rule on the question of damages, as well as other unresolved pretrial disputes, as quickly as possible.

Maddock had been given two parking spots in the garage as he normally drives a large truck, Gideon D’Assandro, spokesman for Republican House Speaker Matt Hall said in a statement. However on Thursday, Maddock drove a different car and parked it between one of his spots and Brixie’s.

Maddock reacted to the incident on the social media platform X throughout the day saying security footage would be released to the police this week, adding Brixie “keeps trying to get my attention and I keep telling her im married.”
Maddock’s wife, former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Meshawn Maddock, chided Brixie on X for saying that the car her husband had taken to work, which was her car, had the engine running and hood open, when in reality she had tampered with it.
“Rep Brixie makes a false statement otherwise known as a LIE in the presence of the entire Michigan House, after wrapping my car in plastic wrap like a 13 year old girl. Democrats arent just soft on crime, like Brixie, they are crime,” Meshawn Maddock wrote.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-18 20:56:39+00:00,CT Mirror,"For $2.4 billion, this bill aims to lower CT electric bills. Why are both parties split?",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/18/ct-electric-rates-2025-bill/,"The bill, raised by Sen. John Fonfara, would have CT borrow $2.4B over the next three years to pay off a chunk of residents’ electric bills.","Following months of public angst over Connecticut’s high energy prices, both Republicans and Democrats this week rallied behind what many saw as an audacious proposal: Have the state borrow $2.4 billion over the next three years to pay off a chunk of its residents’ electric bills.
The proposal, Senate Bill 1560, is the work of state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, a veteran lawmaker who serves as co-chair of the legislature’s Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
During a press conference Wednesday, where he was flanked by leaders from both parties, Fonfara said his bill would immediately cut electric costs up to 20% by removing the controversial public benefits charge from customers’ bills and paying for it through state-issued bonds. The public benefits charge covers the cost of state-mandated energy-efficiency programs, clean energy investments and support for low-income ratepayers.
Additional provisions of the bill would save ratepayers even more in the long run, Fonfara said. Those include revamping the process through which the utilities purchase power for their customers, mandating variable time-of-use electric rates, eliminating certain solar credits and the sales tax on electricity bought by commercial and industrial users, along with other changes. The combined savings could be as much as 40% of customers’ current bills, the senator said.
“There are certain fundamental truths that we must acknowledge and act on if we want to reverse the path we are on,” Fonfara said. “If we choose to do nothing, electricity costs will continue to increase.”
Almost immediately, however, members of both parties began to question Fonfara’s promises of savings and the wisdom of borrowing what would amount to nearly one-third of the state’s annual bond cap — which is currently $2.5 billion — exclusively for this purpose.
Others pointed out that Fonfara is at the center of controversy surrounding a deal with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office to place him on a vacant seat at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, which is in charge of approving electric rates. After that deal was announced last month, press reports revealed that Fonfara owned a company which racked up more than $1 million in fines and late fees from PURA.
In a statement released Tuesday, a spokesman for Lamont said the governor was open to considering some aspects of the bill such as improving the energy procurement process and addressing variable demand for electricity at different times of day.
But the spokesman, Rob Blanchard, made it clear that the governor does not view the creation of a new government entity or more borrowing as viable solutions to the state’s energy affordability issues.
“Rather than putting annual expenses on our ‘credit card’ or crowding out bonding for municipal parks, roads, and school construction with items in the public benefits charge, as proposed, the Governor would prefer we explore ways to reduce [public benefits] charges that may be outdated or unnecessary,” Blanchard said in his statement.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, was similarly skeptical of the amount of new debt proposed in the bill and whether it would be paid back with taxpayer funds or revenues drawn from utility bills.
“If there’s state general fund contributions, we can’t afford it,” Ritter said. “If it’s something about the ratepayers paying it back over 30 years as opposed to three, I mean, I’d look at that.” 
Despite those concerns, the bill gained traction this week with the backing of a bipartisan slate of key lawmakers including Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, and House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford.
Candelora said that his caucus had been discussing the bill with Fonfara over the last six or eight weeks. In March, Republicans were angered when Democrats on the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee opted not to go forward with any of the Republicans’ proposals to reduce residents’ electricity bills.
“This piece of legislation does that, and we look forward to that bipartisan conversation that is so needed to try to address the concerns of our business community and our residents and the impacts that high electric costs have had on the state of Connecticut,” Candelora said.
Fonfara has until April 24 to schedule a vote to advance his bill out of the committee he chairs. 
Utilities weigh in
In his comments to the press Wednesday, Fonfara outlined two key pillars of his legislation that he said would work to reduce electricity costs.
First, it would remove portions of public benefits charge from customers’ bills and shift those costs onto the state through new bonds issued over the next three years. Those bonds would be capped at $800 million a year, for a total of $2.4 billion.
Secondly, the legislation would create a new quasi-public agency known as the Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority that would be work with electric utilities, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and local electric cooperatives to create a new method of purchasing electric power supply at lower rates for customers. 
The switch, Fonfara said, would in essence take the utilities’ job of buying power and turn it over to public officials who could work year-round to find the best deals on wholesale electric market, rather than than the competitive auctions the utilities currently participate in twice a year.
“The utilities are being taken out of the procurement business,” Fonfara said. “They’re going to say ‘thank you,’ because it’s a thankless job for them. They make no money on it. They get criticized when rates go up and they don’t get any recognition when rates go down. I’m no apologist for them, but that’s the reality.”

Under Connecticut’s deregulated energy system, customers’ bills are split into four parts: the cost to procure power supply, the transmission and distribution of that power and a public benefits charge.
The utilities must pass on their supply and public benefit program costs to their customers without any markup. The companies earn profits only on the transmission and distribution of the that electricity.
During a public hearing on the bill Wednesday, representatives from United Illuminating and Eversource did, in fact, praise Fonfara’s legislation, which they said offered solutions to reduce customers’ bills while focusing on those areas where they don’t earn a profit. 
“We are hopeful that the concepts in this bill would turn into a reality where we would end up seeing some significant reductions in perhaps the supply charges and other areas that are meant for grid modernization,” said Christie Prescott, the director of wholesale power contracts at United Illuminating. 
Both of the utilities also supported another provision in the bill that would limit the amount of credits that customers with solar panels could earn on their bill by sending excess power back into the grid.
As more customers install solar panels and purchase less electricity from the grid, utility officials said the cost to maintain transmission wires, utility poles and other infrastructure has shifted onto customers without solar panels. The amount of electricity Eversource sold to its customers last year — about 20,000 gigawatt hours — was roughly the same as in 1993, according to data presented to lawmakers from the utility. 
“We have this predicament and it’s not specific to Eversource,” said Doug Horton, the utility’s vice president for distribution rates & regulatory requirements. “The fact of the matter is that we have a declining sales base and a need to continue to invest in the system.”  
That same proposal, however, drew a sharp response from environmental advocates and the solar industry. Both groups said it would dismantle solar incentives while placing further strain onto the grid.
“Energy efficiency and solar have been essential for keeping costs down for customers, because you have to think about the investments in distribution and transmission systems that otherwise would of had to be made over the those 20 years,” said Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney for Save the Sound, a local environmental group. 
Other critics raised concerns that the cap of $800 million a year on the bonds would not be enough to cover the full cost of public benefit programs — which is currently more than $1 billion a year — leaving the future of those programs in doubt.
Claire Coleman, the head of the Office of Consumer Counsel that advocates on behalf of ratepayers, submitted written testimony to Fonfara’s committee stating that those costs can also shift largely from year to year, making it difficult for officials to know how much money they would have to borrow ahead of time to pay for the programs.  
“Even if it were permissible and the proposed bill was amended to increase the bonding limits to reflect the necessary expenditures, it is not clear that state bond process is best suited to fund the programs indicated in the proposed bill,” Coleman said.
Fonfara said the intent of the bill was to give ratepayers a three-year window of relief. Meanwhile, lawmakers, in conjunction with the new Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority, would determine whether the programs under the public benefits charge are necessary and whether the costs to run those programs should be borne by the state or by ratepayers through their electric bills. If they’re determined not to be necessary, he said lawmakers could opt to discontinue them.
“That’s for the legislature to decide,” he said. “But it will be a prudent decision, with a lot more information.”
Party infighting
The top two Democrats in the Senate, Looney and Duff, had previously pledged their support for another bill addressing electric prices — Senate Bill 4 — that is still being drafted by members of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. When asked during Wednesday’s press conference whether the Fonfara legislation had supplanted that effort, Looney said there was no competition between the two bills.
“Eventually, they will all go into the hopper and provide something that I think the people of Connecticut will recognize as a legitimate response to the crisis that we face,” Looney said.
Within a matter of hours, however, tensions between the two committees and their leaders flared into the open.
About midway through Wednesday’s hearing, Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, the leader of the Energy and Technology Committee, began questioning Horton, the Eversource executive, about a section of the bill dealing with the securitization of storm costs that he said closely resembled a proposal pitched by the utility following Tropical Storm Isaias in 2020. “I just want to be clear where a lot of this comes from,” Needleman asked, when Fonfara interjected.
“Senator, where it comes from is this person right here, it’s my bill,” Fonfara said. 
After more back-and-forth with Horton, Fonfara eventually cut off Needleman’s line of questioning saying that he had surpassed the committee’s five-minute time limit.
“I hope this bill comes to our committee where it belongs and we have a robust conversation about this,” Needleman responded. “This is not the way to solve these problems.”
When asked later about the spat, Looney issued a statement through a spokesman saying that such disagreements are part of the normal legislative process. 
“Forging consensus is a difficult process, but one that is necessary for any bill to become law,” Looney said. “Sometimes we do not know how issues will be framed and resolved until late in the session, whether they are merged into one bill, run separately, or have elements combined into a different vehicle altogether. Unlike the Republicans, we are not free to merely complain and offer unworkable pie-in-the-sky proposals.”

Candelora, the House Republican leader, blamed Needleman’s committee for blocking a number of proposals put forward by Republicans, including a plan that would have made the public benefits charge an annual expense, paid for out of the state’s budget. 
Speaking to a reporter later, Candelora clarified his support of Fonfara’s bill as “a work in progress,” and said he believes some public benefits programs, such as funding for electric vehicle charging stations, are appropriate bonding expenses while others should be budgeted for.
“What has been frustrating about this entire process is that you have a completely dysfunctional energy committee that has made all of these issues highly partisan and highly toxic,” Candelora said.
No Senate Republicans were present at Wednesday’s press conference with Fonfara. The day before, members of that caucus publicly accused Fonfara, their fellow senator, of being complicit in a scheme to provide political support for Lamont’s reappointment of PURA Chair Marissa Gillett in exchange for a job as one of five commissioners at the authority.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, told reporters he believed that deal likely violated the state’s bribery statutes. But in the same press conference, Harding did not discount the idea of working with Fonfara on energy policy.
“We will do anything possible to reduce people’s electric bills in the state of Connecticut,” Harding said. “We don’t care who we have to work with.”
Later in the week, Harding and a top Republican on the Energy and Technology Committee, Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, said there are “several concerning aspects” of S.B. 1560 and that they would not support the bill in its current form. 
Specifically, Fazio said that Fonfara’s proposed Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority would have overlapping duties with existing state agencies. He also said a proposed fund administered by that authority to adopt smart metering technology and other infrastructure upgrades would result in the creation of what he called a “mini public benefits charge” that would still appear on electric bills.
Still, Harding and Fazio said they welcomed Fonfara’s efforts to address the issue.
Harding said he, too, was concerned with the creation of the new quasi-public authority, which he said he sees as a potential landing ground for Fonfara amid the scrutiny into the senator’s bid to obtain a seat on PURA. “It is quite suspect,” he said.
Tom Swan, the executive director of Connecticut Citizen Action Group, called Fonfara’s promises to save residents money “horribly dishonest,” and he said he thinks the legislation raises several “ethical red flags,” given the senator’s business ventures in the energy industry.
“There is absolutely no trust for Sen. Fonfara to be playing a role in this,” Swan said.
Fonfara told reporters on Wednesday that he has no interest in serving on the new authority. He did not respond to additional requests for comment about the legislation this week. 
A third bill addressing electric prices, drafted by members of the Government Administration and Elections Committee last month, would have prohibited Eversource and United Illuminating from owning both electric and gas utilities, and it imposed new qualification requirements for members of PURA’s board. Ritter, the House speaker, said this week he does not expect that legislation to move forward.
“That was not rightfully raised, and it will crumble,” Ritter said. 
But with respect to the other two bills, Ritter said both have the potential to produce worthwhile ideas. “I think you have two major pieces of energy legislation: S.B. 4 and Sen. Fonfara’s bill,” he said. “My thing would be, let’s put them all together and get a great bill.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4441-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

Our team is proud to be recognized for helping make the voting process more accessible, approachable, and inclusive for everyone in our community.”
The election division wrote in its award entry that the program substantially increased confidence and participation in the election process. It also had benefits for election officials by “reducing the need for last-minute accommodations and increasing overall efficiency.”  
The lieutenant governor’s office earned its award for its “12 Days of Election Improvements,” or “Votemas,” a social media campaign nodding to “12 Days of Christmas” traditions, highlighting new voting technologies, procedures and laws in Utah elections. 
“While election-related posts tend to flood social media in the weeks leading up to Election Day, after the dust settles, it’s easy for people to forget that election work continues year-round. Voter records need constant upkeep, and preparation for future elections never stops,” the office wrote in its award entry. “Our goal with Votemas is to remind voters that the work doesn’t end with Election Day — every year is an election year.”

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Christina Gill says life continues after losing someone to gun violence, but the pain remains and her experience of joy is different.
Gill lost her 39-year-old son Joseph Aieloo on Oct. 4, 2021, after Jay Wagers, 29, shot him in the Santa Fe neighborhood where Aieloo grew up.
Gill, a member of Moms Demand Action, said she still lives in that same neighborhood, because her son was such a dynamic person “there’s no place I can go in Santa Fe that I’m not reminded of his presence.”
Gill spoke on Wednesday morning at an event organized by New Mexico Democrat U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich’s office outside of Robert F. Kennedy Charter School’s middle school campus just outside the Albuquerque city limits, near the South Valley. They were joined by students from the middle school, from the advocacy organization Students Demand Action, and from ACE Leadership High School.
A week earlier, Heinrich re-introduced two pieces of legislation in Congress intended to address gun violence: the GOSAFE Act, which would regulate the sale, transfer and manufacture of gas-operated semi-automatic firearms; and the BUMP Act, which would ban the sale of “bump stocks” and other devices or modifications that convert semi-automatic firearms into fully automatic ones.
“It is not only our right but our duty to advocate for gun safety laws,” Gill said. “I ask you to stand with me today in urging our legislators to pass GOSAFE, to protect our communities and children from the tragedy of gun violence, to protect not just the rights of those who champion the Second Amendment, but to acknowledge their duty as elected officials to pass legislation that protects the equal rights of all of their constituents, especially children, to feel safe in our communities.”
Heinrich said Wednesday that the previous assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, prohibited things that were “purely cosmetic,” while the true deadliness of some firearms comes from the mechanisms they use to quickly load a new round after firing the first one.
“It won’t change things overnight but it would move us on a trajectory where there would be far fewer of these weapons of war on the streets over time,” he said.
Gill said Heinrich’s legislation targets particular and especially lethal gas-operated semi-automatic firearms, leaving numerous options for people to buy other kinds of guns to hunt, compete or protect their families
The legislation would require that if a firearm is gas-operated — meaning it uses the gas expended by the first fired round to quickly cycle the firing mechanism and load the next one — it must have a magazine that is not detachable and only holds 10 rounds, Heinrich said.
“We know time and time again that the moment that these mass shootings actually come to an end is when the shooter has to stop, take stock and get reloaded without being able to just slide another high-capacity magazine in,” Heinrich said.
Ken Jones, a hunter and firearm owner, said large magazines are not needed for target practice or self-defense.
“To solve the gun crisis in our country today, in my opinion …we need to have better access to mental health care, we need strong red flag laws and yes, we need to keep the most violent criminals off our streets and out of our communities,” Jones said.
Monicia Henley, senior vice president of corporate affairs with Everytown for Gun Safety, said Heinrich’s bill will prevent more mass shootings, and she called on his colleagues in Congress along with New Mexico state lawmakers to join him.
“This isn’t about taking away our rights, it’s about saving lives,” Henley said. “We need to make a special session happen in Santa Fe, and focus on preventative measures that will save lives.”
Miranda Viscoli, co-president of New Mexicans to Prevent Gun Violence, said Heinrich’s legislation represents “the first critical steps to remove weapons of war from our civilian population, weapons that never should have been available to any of us in the first place.”

‘My life would be different’
Gill on Wednesday talked about the other people who were hurt in the shooting that killed her son, and the people left to live with his absence.
She said he volunteered for tenant advocacy group Chainbreaker Collective, she said.
“He helped people get off the street,” she said. “He really cared about people who are marginalized. So I am much more empathetic and compassionate as a result of this loss in understanding why he cared so much for people who struggled.”
Gill said Wagers “went on a rampage,” shooting another random victim through the eye who survived with permanent brain damage, injuring another with shattered glass and traumatizing two more people by barely missing them with bullets.
Wagers ultimately pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Aieloo’s shooting death, and also pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder; two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; and shooting from a vehicle in the same incident. A state district court judge sentenced him to 30 years in prison.
Gill read from 15-year-old Landon Garcia’s victim impact statement in the case.
“Joey was, and still is, a very important person in my life,” Garcia wrote. “The night I found out he died, I bawled my eyes out. I cried and cried. He was one of my role models and my friend. If this man would not have murdered him, my life would be different.”
Gill told reporters that it’s her duty to do anything that might prevent a similar tragedy from affecting anyone else.
“I stand here for my son, all the Landons and community members, families and friends whose lives would be different if not for the devastation of gun violence,” Gill said. “We’re always going to have conflict, but it doesn’t mean we have to have violence.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250418_141509-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

You can also listen to a version of this interview on our new podcast The […],"University of Louisiana System President Rick Gallot speaks at the Baton Rouge Press Club (Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator) This is an interview with University of Louisiana System President Rick Gallot that took place earlier this month about how the legislative session and federal changes will impact higher education in Louisiana. It has been edited for length and clarity.
You can also listen to a version of this interview on our new podcast The Light Switch.
Piper Hutchinson: What do you think is coming for higher education this session? 
Rick Gallot: I think certainly starting with a standstill budget is always better than starting with a proposed cut. So, you know, we’re certainly very grateful for that. I think there’s a lot of uncertainty, coming out of Washington and with the constitutional amendments that did not pass, obviously that has created some angst in terms of what do we do now, right? And so I think there is, again, just an overall level of uncertainty that we’ll see it … kind of play out over time. 
I think if you look at the increased revenue from the sales, sales taxes and other things, we’re certainly not in a real bad spot right now as a state in terms of our finances. So I’m still optimistic that we will work through the challenges in the session, and we will come out good on the other side. 
Hutchinson: Looking at the bills that we have so far, what do you think is going to be the most impactful for higher education?
Gallot: It’s hard to say, and when you look at what’s filed versus what ultimately makes it through the process; all bills filed on the front end don’t always make it. Rep. (Emily) Chenevert has come back with another diversity, equity and inclusion bill. We will certainly have to see how that plays out. The bill she had last year started one way and ended up another. … Certainly with all other higher ed leaders, she was very receptive to meeting with us and working through some of those challenges last year. At the end of the day, I think the budget is always going to be the main focus that could impact the trajectory going forward.
Hutchinson: There’s one bill that’s going to have a big impact for your system, talking about transferring UNO back to the LSU System. What should we expect on that front? 
Gallot: For me personally, it’s a full-circle moment. I was in the house when UNO was transferred from LSU to the University of Louisiana System. You know, I just want what’s best for the students, for the campus community at the University of New Orleans. It is a legislative prerogative. They have the authority to transfer universities from one system to the other. So if this legislation is successful, we will certainly do our part to ensure that it is a seamless transition. We will work with LSU, with Board of Regents and with the legislature to ensure that the transition is as smooth as it could possibly be. 
Hutchinson: What’s that like for you [as a former legislator] during the legislative session, being kind of outside the rails?
Gallot: Well, I certainly have a lot of respect for our legislators and the sacrifices they all make in serving. I’m a huge fan of Stephen Covey’s “Seven Habits,” and one of those is: “Seek, first to understand then to be understood.” And so I think that’s helpful to understand the pressures that our legislators are under, knowing that there’s a lot that they have to balance. I think it’s helpful, quite frankly. And I don’t think I burned any bridges while here. 
I mean, I did oversee redistricting, so maybe I did [burn] one or two. But for the most part, I still have good relationships with many of my former colleagues … who are still there. I’m grateful to have the opportunity to be a part of the process but from this side. 
Hutchinson: There has been a little bit of controversy in the LSU System lately, that’s reignited these conversations about curbing tenure. What are you hearing on that front, and what would that mean for higher education as a whole if they did take an axe to tenure? 
Gallot: Going back to COVID, and you think about faculty members, who go through the process of, not only a bachelor’s and a master’s and a terminal degree. You know, they get hired, they’re on a tenure track, they’re researching, they’re writing, they’re building their portfolio, and at the appropriate time they apply for tenure. I think we have to respect that process. 
I think it is one that is deeply rooted in higher education, and so I think we certainly have to respect faculty and that they have earned this. 
Now, having said that, it’s always one or two bad apples that will spoil the barrel, as they say. I don’t know that simply doing away with tenure is the answer. 
If the legislature passes something, then we, as a state system, will certainly abide by whatever changes may be made. I think we want accountability at all levels, that we want our students to be in the best position to learn. We want our faculty to be in the best position to teach, and that our students would graduate and go out and make a difference in society. So we’ll certainly be watching it closely, and hopefully we will see thoughtful debate throughout the process. And again, with whatever the ultimate result is, we will work with it.
Hutchinson: I can’t not talk about what’s going on at the federal level. We’re talking about cutting research funding. There are concerns about immigration and graduate students, and certainly tariffs could increase expenses for higher education. How is the UL System adapting to all of this? 
Gallot: Right now there’s so much uncertainty just across the board. Whether it’s the potential loss of research funding and indirect cost, for instance, universities build their budgets based upon what they believe the revenue stream will be from these research grants. I’m hopeful that we will sort of get through this period of uncertainty, and we will see things sort of settle down to be a little more predictable. But you know, at the same time, we will have to adjust if the rules are changed. If the funding formulas are changed, we will just have to adapt. We always have and we always will.

(Courtesy NPS)More than 85,000 out-of-state hunters descend on the Treasure State each year for the chance to take a shot at a Montana elk, antelope, bear or bird.
To pay for that opportunity, they fork over $15 as a base license fee, in addition to buying a tag — ranging from $5.50 for a college student migratory bird license to $1,250 for a moose or bighorn sheep. 
But the Montana Legislature has approved a bill that will increase the base license fee for nonresidents to $100 — a 566% increase. 
The change is expected to bring in an additional $7.2 million in revenue according to the bill’s fiscal note, of which $6.8 million will be allocated to the state’s block management program. 
“The idea of identifying these dollars to go to block management is a concerted effort to try to open up more lands for the public in Montana,” sponsor and Rep. Gary Parry, R-Colstrip, told the House Fish Wildlife and Parks Committee earlier this session. 
The state’s block management program was developed 40 years ago as a way to increase access to private land and isolated parcels of public land through voluntary contracts with private landowners. It provides financial incentives for landowners to allow hunters on their property. 
Between 2001 and 2011, land owners enrolled more than 8 million acres in the program, earning up to $12,000 from enrollment fees and compensation based on hunter-day counts. Since 2011, the number of acres enrolled has steadily declined, despite efforts by the state to bolster the program by increasing the compensation cap for landowners to $25,000 in 2021 and $50,000 in 2023. 
In 2024, 1,314 landowners enrolled fewer than 7 million acres costing Montana FWP more than $12 million. 
Boosting payments could be a way for the department to offer more incentives for landowners to participate in the program, according to Quentin Kujala, FWP chief of conservation policy. 
Kujala told lawmakers at a House committee hearing that the staff who work on block management say the biggest reason for loss of access in the program is land sales, and while there are many motivations for selling land, money is certainly a factor. 
Opposition to Parry’s bill came from the Montana Outfitters and Guides Association, where one lobbyist, Scott Boulanger, said the increase was “drastic.” Representatives of the outfitters association told lawmakers that they would support a more modest increase to $50.
But Frank Szollosi, with the Montana Wildlife Federation, told Senate lawmakers that surrounding states already charge much higher rates for nonresident hunters.
In Idaho, nonresident hunting licenses cost $185; in Utah they cost $144, and in Oregon, $160. 
“We’ve got better hunting than they do,” Szollosi said. 
Wyoming is similar to Montana, charging nonresident hunters a base application fee of $15, and a bill introduced to the legislature earlier this year seeking to increase that to $75 did not advance. 
Parry said that $100 fee is “lint in the pocket” for many out-of-state hunters, who come specifically for the state’s big game and often are hiring outfitters and guides, as well as spending money on their travels to the state to begin with. 
“These folks do come here to hunt in our places. If it’s too much, they can stay in their own states. We need to look out for the people of Montana, and this bill pushes that forward.”
The bill is headed to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/51326841831_adf49d4ff0_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

The news was first reported by The Providence Journal, and confirmed to Rhode Island Current Friday afternoon by Greg Paré, a spokesperson for Ruggerio.
Paré was unable to confirm what date Ruggerio was readmitted to Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, but said it was due to a reaction to a treatment he was undergoing for his cancer diagnosis.
“They’re working to help him regain his health,” Paré said.
Senate President Ruggerio takes more time off to focus on ‘rebuilding his strength’

The news comes five weeks after Ruggerio, 76, was last released from the same hospital’s rehabilitation center after a bout with pneumonia. The North Providence Democrat has been absent for a majority of the 2025 sessions, attending just four of the 17 regularly scheduled Senate gatherings since January. He last presided over the chamber’s regular session on March 25. Ruggerio declined recent interview requests about his health, though Pare said he was doing better, with plans to focus on “rebuilding his strength” ahead of the final stretch of the session.
An email sent from Ruggerio’s Senate email address to lawmakers at 1:39 p.m. Friday, and obtained by Rhode Island Current, stressed the need for the chamber to address the primary care doctor shortage, noting recent actions by insurance companies and Gov. Dan McKee. The email is signed “Donny, Val and David,” referring to Ruggerio, Sen. Majority Leader Val Lawson and Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian. 
Less than 90 minutes later, Paré sent another email to senators letting them know Ruggerio was back in the hospital ahead of the news being publicly reported.
Ruggerio originally planned to return to the chamber following its April recess this week. Paré was unsure when asked Friday whether that was still the plan, given his hospitalization. 
Additional information regarding his condition from Fatima hospital was not immediately available.

(Photo by Ruth Conniff/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction rejected the Trump administration’s request to certify compliance with a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion in K-12 public schools. 
State Superintendent Jill Underly said in a statement that Wisconsin schools are following the law. 
“We’ve put that into writing to the USDE,” Underly said. “We believe in local control in Wisconsin and trusting our local leaders – superintendents, principals, educators – who work together with parents and families every day to support students. They know their communities best. Washington, D.C. should not dictate how schools educate their kids.” 
The U.S. Department of Education sent a letter earlier this month to state agencies across the country requesting that agencies check with local school districts to ensure they don’t have diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. 
The federal administration is trying to apply the U.S. Supreme Court’s Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard decision, which said race-based programs in higher education violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, to K-12 education. The administration said state agencies needed to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Supreme Court decision. 
Wisconsin is one of several states, mostly led by Democrats, that have pushed back on the request. The Trump administration, which has been targeting diversity efforts in K-12 schools as well as in higher education and other sectors, has threatened that it could pull funding from states that don’t comply with the request.
Wisconsin schools receive $841.9 million from the federal government, making up about 8% of the total funding for schools across the state. Funding from the Department of Education makes up $568.2 million of that, and according to DPI, this is equivalent to 6,106 educator jobs. 
According to the letter, DPI provided the Department of Education with copies of previous certifications of compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
The agency said that its repeated requests for additional information about the new certification request went unanswered. In an April 9 letter, DPI asked for clarification on why the federal government was requesting another certification and asked the Department of Education to answer questions including whether the requested certification seeks to enforce any requirement beyond what is required by federal law and regulation and what legal authority the Education Department is using to make the request a condition of federal aid. 
“If the certified assurances are insufficient to meet the conditions of federal funding imposed by USDE, please articulate the basis in law for imposing these conditions, as well as an explanation as to why these assurances do not fulfill those requirements,” DPI General Counsel Benjamin Jones wrote to the Department of Education.
Underly said the new certification is a way for the federal government to “directly control the decisions in our schools by conditioning federal dollars. This is a serious concern – not just for the DPI, but for anyone who believes in lawful, transparent government.”

Goodwine reflected on her life of overcoming obstacles when speaking Friday, and promised to carry “the importance of faith and education and perseverance” with her in the future. 
Trailblazer: A conversation with Kentucky Supreme Court Justice-elect Pamela Goodwine

“I always say I don’t give up on my dreams when life gets hard, I simply work harder to make my dreams come true,” she said. “If there is one philosophy and action I would like to be known for and for you all to recognize and live by as well, that is it. No matter what life brings your way, keep dreaming, keep working for your goals.” 
Goodwine spent time in foster care as an infant and was later adopted by her foster parents, the Lantern previously reported. The Youngstown, Ohio, native and high school valedictorian gave up a college scholarship to support her adoptive father who was dying of lung cancer. About six months after her father was diagnosed, he died. After his death, his brother killed her mother. 
At 24, she was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, an incurable bowel inflammation condition that can be painful and disruptive to life. After that diagnosis, she spent two  months hospitalized and had to re-learn how to eat and walk. 
She began working in the courts  as a legal secretary and court stenographer. She earned undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Kentucky and in 1994 entered private practice with the firm Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs until her appointment to the district court bench in 1999. Goodwine won her circuit judge seat in 2003. She became the first Black woman to serve on the Kentucky Court of Appeals after being elected in 2018.
“I have often been called a trailblazer,” Goodwine said. “More important than achieving any individual accomplishment, I have always believed that it is each of our responsibility to live and serve in ways that make the world a better place for generations that follow us.”

Praise for Goodwine 
During her investiture, Goodwine’s fellow justices praised her for her tenacious character and long career of firsts. They also applauded her for making history yet again in officially donning her Supreme Court robes and inspiring broader trust in the court
Justice Angela McCormick Bisig said race and gender aren’t usually part of the discussions justices have about cases on their docket. 
Reflecting on her mountain roots, Debra Lambert takes public oath as Kentucky’s chief justice

But, she said, “for this court to do that very important work, it is best to have all lived experiences and points of view at the table, because we can all strive to be compassionate and understanding, but we really can’t know what it’s like to be someone else.” 
Gov. Andy Beshear said Goodwine’s win is a “cause for celebration” but “it’s also a reminder of our reality, that nearly 250 years into the history of this great country, we are still recognizing firsts.” 
“Because of Justice Goodwine’s tenacity, pushing through personal tragedy, struggle and, yes, discrimination that still exists in our world, we are closer to the promise of our country that every child no matter their circumstances can dream of being a Kentucky Supreme Court justice,” Beshear said. “I’d like to thank her for making us a little bit better here in the commonwealth today.” 
Chief Justice Debra Lambert called Goodwine’s presence a “gift to our court” and “a reminder that the court should be principled and deliberate and deeply human.” 
While judicial races are nonpartisan, both Goodwine and her opponent received partisan support. Democrat Beshear’s political committees contributed $510,000 to help Goodwine win. Her donors also included former Democratic Govs. Steve Beshear and Paul Patton, as well as some Democrats in the legislature.
Goodwine won her race for the 5th District seat in November, becoming the first woman and fifth person in history to serve at every level of the judiciary. The Kentucky Supreme Court also has a majority of women now, for the first time ever. Goodwine’s investiture was originally scheduled for January but was delayed because of weather. 
During the ceremony, Fayette County District Judge Melissa Moore Murphy led the crowd in singing “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Black National Anthem.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Jaimie Bartmann planned to quit her job in education.
She loved being a paraprofessional in the Montrose School District in southeastern South Dakota, but after nine years assisting teachers and students, she wanted to make a bigger impact.
“I felt limited,” Bartmann said. “A family trusts you with their child — whether you’re a paraprofessional or a teacher. But as a ‘para,’ you only assist them. I couldn’t make suggestions or make changes I thought would help them.”
A day after she made up her mind, but before she submitted her resignation, her district emailed her with an opportunity: the South Dakota Teacher Apprenticeship Pathway.
The 3-year-old state program allows full-time paraprofessionals to pursue a teaching degree online through Dakota State University in elementary or special education, or through Northern State University in secondary education at a steep discount while retaining their position.
The program’s mission is filling teaching vacancies in school districts across the state, which have worsened in recent years. More than 350 positions were unfilled in July 2024, weeks before the school year started, according to the Associated School Boards of South Dakota. There were 256 the same time in 2023, 225 in 2022 and 174 in 2021.










The solution was to identify a group of people who otherwise wouldn’t get into the profession who belong in it.


– South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joe Graves


South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joe Graves is optimistic that the apprenticeship program will help.
“I’m hoping this year, because we’ve already graduated seven out of the program and believe we might be able to see another 56 to 60 graduate this spring, that would take a large whack out of the shortage,” Graves said.
All seven graduates, including Bartmann, are working in classrooms as teachers or have contracts to begin teaching in a South Dakota school district in the fall.
The program does not contractually require graduates to stay in the teaching profession or in South Dakota. The assumption is that paraprofessionals who’ve worked in the profession for years care about the children in their school, and have built their lives in the community where they work. 
“The solution was to identify a group of people who otherwise wouldn’t get into the profession who belong in it,” Graves said.

The state Department of Education accepted Bartmann in its first cohort of 90 participants in 2023. Another 70 enrolled in the 2024 cohort. Up to 50 more will enroll in the next cohort this year.
Bartmann moved from the Montrose School District to the nearby Canistota School District in the fall to teach special education for fifth through seventh graders. She taught her students under an advanced teaching certificate before earning her degree in December.
Now she teaches 18 children. She works with two other special education teachers at the elementary and high school levels, and nine paraprofessionals.
Her background is a strength, since “paras are the heart” of special education. She knows the challenges paras face, and listens to them because she understands they see a different side of a student.
“I’m passionate about making sure that I’m fully taking care of a student emotionally and socially, while making sure I see them academically,” Bartmann said.
Graves, with the state Education Department, said the future of the program is uncertain. It was originally intended as a one-time effort, using $815,000 in federal funds and about $446,000 in state funds. 
The program launched its second cohort under the state Department of Labor and Regulation in 2024 due to demand after the Legislature appropriated $800,000 of state funds for the program. The second cohort cost another $410,000 in funding from the department and $9,000 from the federal government.

A spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor and Regulation said the third cohort will be funded with a combination of federal and state grants, though she said the exact amounts will be determined after the apprentices start their coursework. The federal funding will come from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Apprenticeship Building America grant. School districts pay $1,000 a year per employed apprentice.
If federal funding is cut, Graves said, the program would end or universities might take it over. The department lost $58,178 in funds last month intended for the program, after the federal Department of Education dissolved approved extensions of COVID relief funding. South Dakota lost more than $5 million intended for several education programs.
Graves questions whether the program should continue indefinitely, saying it could be abused to avoid a traditional, more expensive college education.
State cancels teacher trainings for new social studies standards due to federal funding cuts

Students are responsible for up to $1,000 a year in tuition, books and state assessments. Bartmann completed 81 credits of classes within 15 months, costing her a total of $1,500. Sometimes she took more than a full course load in a semester while working full time and raising one of her four children who’s still at home.
“I’d go to school, come home, stay up until 2 a.m. studying and doing homework, sleep until 6 a.m. and then go back to work,” Bartmann said. “Weekends were focused on studying to get done faster.”
Instead of discontinuing the program entirely, she wonders if it could be limited to paraprofessionals who’ve been in the field for a few years. Experienced paras would be less likely to use the pathway as an alternative to the traditional college courses, she said, and the people who would apply would be committed, yet could be financially limited and likely to have obligations — such as children — that might prevent them from pursuing a traditional degree.
Less than four months after earning her degree, Bartmann is already considering earning another degree or certification to improve her teaching. After most workdays, she walks through the school hallways, looking at the colorful student artwork on display and feeling grateful for the new life breathed into her career.
At 46, she has colleagues her age who’ve been teaching for two decades and are planning ahead for retirement.
“I have to pack all those years of experience and impact they made into the years I’ve got left,” Bartmann said. “I want to reach as many students as I can.”
 



 State efforts to address South Dakota’s teacher shortage

Aside from the Teacher Apprenticeship Pathway, the state Department of Education and school districts have made other investments to alleviate the teacher shortage in the state, according to Secretary Joe Graves. 
Paying student teachers and making them the teacher of record
South Dakota lawmakers and the governor approved $500,000 for the creation of a statewide student-teacher stipend program this session. The state Department of Education can use the money to provide grants of up to $5,000 per school district, for payment to one or more student-teachers. The program is intended to keep South Dakota school districts competitive with other states.
“Where you begin your teaching profession is often where you continue it,” Graves said.
School districts can also establish student teachers as the “teacher of record,” meaning the student is the main teacher for a classroom, developing lesson plans and instructing students. If a student teacher becomes the “teacher of record,” a district is required to pay them, Graves said. Student teachers who are paid and regarded as an official teacher of record, he added, are more likely to commit to the district after they graduate, Graves said.
Employing international teachers
School districts across the state are increasingly employing teachers from different countries under working visas. The state Department of Education offers an International Exchange Teacher Permit. About 50 public school districts had international teachers on staff in 2024, according to the department.
Setting a minimum teacher salary and mandating annual increased compensation
The department was a major player in passing legislation in 2024 requiring school districts to meet a minimum teacher salary and increase teacher compensation yearly based on increased funding in state aid.
“We saw immediately that a bunch of school districts moved their minimum teacher salary up, even though the requirement is not going into effect until next year,” Graves said.
Mentoring new teachers
The state department’s mentoring program connects a veteran educator to a new teacher to help guide them through challenges in their first few years of the profession. The first five years is “really the test,” Graves said. When new teachers are mentored, there’s a 15% increased chance they’ll stay within the profession.
Supporting a high school teaching career interest
Educators Rising is a career interest group working to entice high school students to become South Dakota educators. The group holds a “sign up day” similar to athletes for high school members dedicated to earning their teaching degree. The South Dakota Board of Regents approved a program last year to give high school students a jump-start toward their teaching degree by taking career-specific dual credit courses that will count toward a college degree and high school graduation.
Streamlining state reciprocity
Graves said the department has worked to streamline the teacher certification reciprocity process, getting out-of-state teachers employed at local school districts more quickly.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/591A9467-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 16:07:21.155793

(Photo provided by Wells County Emergency Management)The North Dakota Senate this week added funding to a budget bill to help communities that lost federal grants for infrastructure projects.
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, who introduced an amendment to House Bill 1577 on the Senate floor Thursday, said he’s noticed some “hiccups” involving federal fund distribution.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency canceled about $20 million in grants designated for North Dakota projects. The pulled federal grants announced earlier this month were from FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, designed to help state and local governments with projects that reduce risks to hazards.
Loss of $20 million in FEMA infrastructure grants ‘devastating’ to North Dakota communities

“They had gotten these grants and they were ready to build their projects and the money was pulled out from under them,” Magrum said.
The amended bill authorizes the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to issue up to $9.7 million in loans through the Department of Environmental Quality for wastewater projects affected by the funding cuts. Two wastewater projects that lost funding are a $7.8 million wastewater treatment project in Lincoln and a $1.9 million wastewater lagoon erosion project in Fessenden.
The bill directs the Department of Environmental Quality to seek state funding in 2027 to repay the loans. If federal funds are restored to the projects, the bill requires those funds to be used to pay back the loans.
The bill does not address the other FEMA grants that were cut, which included $7.1 million for a water intake project in Washburn. Lawmakers plan to add funding for the Washburn project in another bill, said Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, told lawmakers that backfilling the projects with state-backed loans is a major decision to help those communities. He pointed out that the state Department of Health and Human Services also lost federal funding that has not yet been replaced by the state.
“Get prepared for a special session because there will be a load of these,” Mathern said.
The bill also includes the option for the interim Legislative Management Committee to conduct a study on the potential creation of a wastewater project fund for the state. The study would be presented during the 2027 legislative session and include input from cities, counties, townships and water resource districts. The bill returns to the House.

Tony Evers after signing the 2023-25 budget bill with 51 partial vetoes on July 5, 2023. (Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)A split Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto in the last state budget extending school funding increases for an additional 400 years was within his constitutional powers. 
The executive partial veto powers granted in the Wisconsin State Constitution are uniquely expansive, though they have been limited in the past through Supreme Court decisions and constitutional amendments passed by the Legislature and approved by voters.
In the 2023-25 state budget bill, Evers used his partial veto power striking two digits and a dash from the years to extend the annual increases through 2425, saying the action would help provide ongoing financial support to schools. The initial bill had included a $325 increase to schools’ revenue limits for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years.
Justice Jill Karofsky wrote in a majority opinion that the partial veto was within the power given to Evers in the state constitution, which says “appropriation bills may be approved in whole or in part by the governor.”
“We uphold the 2023 partial vetoes, and in doing so we are acutely aware that a 400-year modification is both significant and attention-grabbing,” Karofsky wrote. “However, our constitution does not limit the governor’s partial veto power based on how much or how little the partial vetoes change policy, even when that change is considerable.”
The case challenging the partial veto was brought by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce on behalf of two Wisconsin taxpayers, Jeffery A. LeMieux, a retired professor, and David T. DeValk, a Fox Valley substitute teacher — arguing that the action was unconstitutional and undemocratic. 
WMC Executive Vice President of Government Relations Scott Manley said they were disappointed by the ruling, and that Evers “exceeded his authority at the expense of taxpayers, and now our great-great-great-great-grandchildren will still be paying the price for his reckless disregard for the law.”
Karofsky laid out several options that lawmakers could take if they want to address the issue further, including by addressing it in a future budget — such as the 2025-27 budget that is being worked on now, by passing a constitutional amendment or by drafting bills separate from appropriation bills to avoid the governor’s partial veto or trying to anticipate how the power might be used. 
Lawmakers have introduced a couple of proposed constitutional amendments. One, which passed last session, would bar the governor from using the veto power to create or increase any tax or fee. Another introduced in January would replace current language that says a partial veto may “not create a new word by rejecting individual letters in the words of the enrolled bill, and may not create a new sentence by combining parts of 2 or more sentences” to say the governor may “only reject one or more entire bill sections.” 
Those proposals have to pass in two consecutive sessions of the Legislature before they could go to voters for ratification. 
Karofsky wrote that the Court “takes no position regarding these measures. We merely outline them to illustrate legislative alternatives to the action before us.”
The three conservative justices on the Court slammed the majority opinion, saying that by upholding the veto the Court has given the executive the power to make law separately from legislators.
“How does a bill become a law?” Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote in the dissenting opinion. “According to the majority, one option looks like this: The legislature passes a bill in both houses and sends it to the governor. The governor then takes the collection of letters, numbers, and punctuation marks he receives from the legislature, crosses out whatever he pleases, and — presto! — out comes a new law never considered or passed by the legislature at all. And there you have it — a governor who can propose and enact law all on his own.” 
Hagedorn wrote that the majority’s opinion makes “a mockery of our constitutional order. This is a mess of this court’s making, and it is long past time for us to fix it.” 
In an opinion concurring with the majority, Justice Rebecca Dallet said the precedent set forth in other cases before the court have “emphasized that a partial veto may affirmatively change the policy of the original bill.” Dallet said that she is “open to revisiting” that, but “this case is not a ‘clear opportunity’ to do so.”
“Petitioners do not ask us to overturn any of our prior decisions, let alone reimagine completely our approach,” Dallet wrote. 
Republican leaders and Evers react to decision, upcoming budget
Republican leaders were critical of the decision, saying that the Court had granted the governor unchecked power and that the decision would lead to tax increases for Wisconsinites.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said that the decision was evidence of the Court being partisan and “should worry every Wisconsinite.” 
“Is any Wisconsin citizen surprised that the liberals on the Wisconsin Supreme Court are now a rubber stamp for liberal ally Tony Evers?” Vos asked. “The liberal Justices’ decision itself describes the effects of this decision as ‘significant and attention-grabbing.’ Modest words for a tortured reading of our Constitution that will hurt Wisconsin taxpayers for hundreds of years to come, all in the name of supporting their ally in the Governor’s office.”
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said that the Court “proved again that they will rule based on partisanship and politics rather than the rule of law” and that the veto was “an unprecedented overreach that will impact generations of Wisconsin taxpayers.”
Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said that the state cannot afford to provide money for the increases, calling it “wildly unrealistic” and “fiscally unsustainable,” and that increases would be felt by property taxpayers. 
The partial veto applied to increases to schools’ revenue limits, meaning that school districts will have more leeway to bring in funds through property taxes or state funds. The partial veto did not allocate additional state dollars for the increases, though lawmakers could decide to provide state funds for the increases. The partial veto also did not automatically mean school districts would raise taxes, though they would have the option.
Wisconsin has limited school districts’ ability to raise funds through property taxes since 1993. Schools originally received regular adjustments to their limits on an inflationary basis, but that was eliminated in 2009 and since then increases have relied on lawmakers or school districts going to taxpayers for permission to increase taxes.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s via property taxes or income taxes, this money is going to come out of the pockets of Wisconsinites from Tomahawk to Racine,” Felzkowski said. She called on Evers to “come to the table to find a solution to this problem that he created, otherwise average Wisconsinites will be forced to take on the financial burden that he has put on them.” 
Evers said in a statement that schools deserve “sustainable, dependable, and spendable state support and investment” and said the decision was great news.  
“For over a decade, the Legislature has failed to meet that important obligation. Importantly, this decision does not mean our work is done — far from it,” Evers said. “Today’s decision only further underscores the urgent need for Republican lawmakers to approve the K-12 investments I’ve proposed to ensure our kids and our schools have the resources they need now and into the future.”
Evers has called for an additional $3 billion in investments for the state’s K-12 schools, funded with the state’s $4 billion budget surplus. Lawmakers have said the decision would be influential in the shape of education funding in the 2025-27 state budget. 
Department of Public Instruction Superintendent Jill Underly echoed Evers’ sentiment, calling the decision a win.
“The broader need remains: real, usable investments in our schools. That means fair special education reimbursement, meeting the mental health needs of our kids, stronger support for our educators, and access to nutritious school meals at no cost for every child,” Underly said. “These priorities must be reflected in the upcoming state budget. Without meaningful investment and an aid commitment from our Legislature, the burden continues to fall on local property taxpayers.”

(Photo by Carmen Murillo/Getty Images)I am a retired public health nurse with 27 years experience in communicable disease surveillance. I hunted down scary diseases to prevent others from getting sick. I worked with dreaded diseases such as meningitis, tuberculosis, measles, and syphilis. I witnessed the suffering and death of infectious diseases. But good things happened, too. With awe and amazement, I watched vaccination programs eliminate common diseases.
When I became a nurse in 1982, the most common form of infant meningitis was from a bacteria called Haemophilis influenza type b, or HIB. HIB disease causes severe infections, hospitalizations and death. If the baby survived, they were often left with neurological problems. Introduced in 1987, the HIB vaccine virtually eliminated this condition. Medical schools lamented that their interns would complete their entire training without ever having the chance to treat a case of HIB meningitis! 
I worked in the Texas School for the Blind, which cared for children damaged by rubella. Mexico did not have the rubella vaccine until 1985. If contracted in the first sixteen weeks of pregnancy, rubella causes severe birth defects such as profound intellectual impairment, blindness and deafness. The kids I saw in Texas had microcephaly, or abnormally small heads. It marked me forever to sit in a room full of disabled children knowing it was only lack of political will which sealed their fate.
The public health laws are effective! School vaccination requirements have given us a society where we are not afraid of dying from a plague. Polio has become a distant memory in our grandparents lives. Congenital rubella is very rare. Measles was eradicated from the US in the year 2000.
But this can break down if we are not vigilant. Measles is burning through the country. We have handicapped ourselves by firing the people who respond to public health emergencies. We need epidemiologists and nurses on the ground coordinating efforts.
Success of public health victories means that people have forgotten the horrors of disease. No one has seen the lockjaw of tetanus, or infants choking from pertussis, or malformed skulls of congenital rubella. Our very success has opened the door to complacency. Parents are misled by conspiracy theorists. Pockets of susceptible populations combined with malpractice of cutting our essential public health programs puts our country in a precarious position. It is just a matter of time before measles comes to your day care, your school, your church.
This comes at a time when access to health care is being curtailed. Cuts to Medicaid will leave children and pregnant women uninsured. Rural hospitals will be forced to close. Clinics will be shuttered. Nursing Homes will be emptied. This administration is taking us backwards to an unkind past.
An example of what we should not do is from the state of Idaho. A new law prohibits publicly funded medical services to undocumented persons. The law forbids prenatal care, immunizations, and communicable disease testing to “illegals.” This is in direct contradiction to the guidelines of the CDC. The cruel law makes Idahoans less safe, and thereby, surrounding states such as Utah less safe.
By not immunizing everyone, you create a reservoir of susceptible people where measles can thrive. By prohibiting communicable disease testing, you hamstring public health investigators who seek out deadly diseases like tuberculosis. I was a TB nurse for eight years. We treated people who had been contagious for months before diagnosis. A single case of TB can infect hundreds of others. By refusing prenatal care, women can die from gestational diabetes or eclampsia, a dangerous complication of pregnancy. Idaho will have blood on its hands.
We need a coherent, comprehensive public health policy. The drastic cuts to the CDC, NIH, and the safety net programs will adversely affect us all. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has turned his back on expert advice of the public health pioneers who have wrought health victories that were unimaginable to our grandparents. We must demand that our legislators carry out their responsibility to provide essential services to their constituents.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hands.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 16:07:21.155793

The child’s vaccination status “has not yet been verified,” according to the press release.
The child, who is not a Missouri resident, was visiting Taney County and was diagnosed “soon after arrival,” Lisa Cox, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release. 
Taney County is in southwest Missouri, and its largest city is Branson. 
“Exposure is believed to be limited, and known contacts have been identified and contacted,” Cox said, adding that the state is supporting Taney County’s health department to investigate possible exposure. 
The case is “associated with recent international travel,” Cox said.
Measles is a highly-contagious virus the country declared eliminated 25 years ago, but that has resurged with falling vaccination rates. 
“For those unvaccinated or those unsure of their vaccination status, now is the time to review records and get caught up if needed,” Dr. George Turabelidze, state epidemiologist with DHSS, said in the press release.
The percent of Missouri kindergarteners fully vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella has declined over the last several years, from 95% in the 2019-2020 school year to 91% in the 2023-2024 school year, in public schools, per DHHS data. In private schools, the drop has been even larger, from 92% to 85% in the same period.
Nationally, there are at least 800 reported cases of measles across 25 states, according to Center for Disease Control data as of Friday. That doesn’t include Missouri’s case, Cox said, because the state received lab test results Thursday night, after the federal reporting deadline for this week. 
That is the highest number for a single year since 2019 and is still growing.
The majority of measles infections nationally have been reported in a West Texas outbreak. There have been two confirmed deaths, both in Texas. 
Kansas has reported 37 cases, possibly linked to the Texas outbreak.
There are outbreaks in Canada and Mexico, too, and several states have reported isolated cases as the result of international travel.
At the same time, the federal government has cut grant funding set aside for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services to encourage vaccinations, according to St. Louis Public Radio.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)A federal judge brought up the arrest in Leon County of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen born in Georgia, during a hearing Friday in which she extended her block of the new Florida immigration law until April 29.
U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams expressed frustration about the arrests of Lopez-Gomez and others, said an attorney representing the immigrants and groups suing the state.
At issue is Williams’ April 4 order temporarily barring enforcement of a law passed during a special session earlier this year making it a first-degree misdemeanor to illegally enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
A Florida Highway Patrol trooper’s arrest of Lopez-Gomez on Wednesday prompted national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reports that he was set to remain in jail because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had placed a 48-hour hold on him — even after a Leon County judge determined there had been no probable cause for the arrest.
Lopez-Gomez was released from Leon County jail on Thursday evening. The 20-year-old held his mother in a tight embrace and wept when they reunited.
“We appreciate that the federal courts have seen through this blatantly unconstitutional law, but the reality is that, without enforcement, it seems that local law enforcement and Florida Highway Patrol are continuing to ignore the judge and order,” said Miriam Fahsi Haskell, an attorney for Community Justice Project representing the plaintiffs, in a phone interview with the Phoenix. “The reality is that once a person is arrested under SB 4C and booked into jail, that person risks then having an ICE hold on them.”
Community Justice Project, the ACLU of Florida, Americans for Immigrant Justice, and Florida Legal Services attorneys are representing the plaintiffs: the Florida Immigrant Coalition, Farmworker Association of Florida Inc., and two women without permanent legal status.
David Matthew Costello, lead attorney representing Attorney General James Uthmeier, declined to comment, and a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office did not respond to the Phoenix’s questions. The other defendants are the statewide prosecutor and state attorneys.
Binding?
During the hearing at the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida in Miami, attorneys representing the state argued that law enforcement is not bound by Williams’ order, Fahsi Haskell said. Another hearing is set for April 29.
“The Court enters a [temporary restraining order] prohibiting Defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person who are in active concert or participation with them from enforcing SB 4-C,” Williams’ order states.
Two other men were with Lopez-Gomez when the trooper stopped the car because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report. The driver, Estiven Sales-Perez, and another passenger, Ismael Sales-Luis, were also charged with illegal entry as “unauthorized aliens.” The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

The Nebraska Department of Labor on Friday announced March’s 2.9% preliminary, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, noting that it tied Nebraska for the fifth-lowest unemployment rate in the country. The state’s unemployment rate, however, is up from the 2.6% reported a year ago for March 2024. 
Nebraska Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber, in a news release, said the state’s overall labor force reached a record high of over 1,080,000 in March.
“The number of employed workers in the labor force also reached a new high statewide, driven by record highs in the Omaha and Lincoln metro areas,” she said.

The number of employed and unemployed people in the labor force are based on a U.S. Census Bureau survey on employment status. Individuals who are claiming unemployment benefits and those who are not claiming the benefits can be counted as unemployed based on their survey responses.
Those not working or seeking a job are not considered part of the labor force and are not included in the unemployment rate calculation.
Labor data released Friday showed that Nebraska private industries with the most growth over last year were public education and health services and construction and mining.
Nationally, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for March inched up to 4.2%, compared to the February rate of 4.1% and 3.9% the year before in March 2024.
Nevada, with 5.7%, reported the highest unemployment rate, followed by the District of Columbia, Michigan and California.

Arkansas became the first state in the nation to prevent healthcare conglomerates from operating drugstores here when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 on Wednesday.
State law already regulates what pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) pay to reimburse independent pharmacies, but pharmacists have complained that the companies violate the law. The state has also fined four PBMs a total of $1.47 million for paying Arkansas pharmacies below the legally required amount for prescription drugs.
PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.
HB 1150 headed to Sanders’ desk April 9 after clearing the Senate with a bipartisan 26 votes, six days after it passed the House with 89 votes. The bill generated hours of discussion and public comment in the House and Senate committees on Insurance and Commerce this month.
“These massive corporations are attacking our state because we will be the first in the country to hold them accountable for their anticompetitive actions,” Sanders said in a statement Wednesday.
CVS Health issued a statement last week urging Sanders to veto HB 1150, calling it “misguided policy.” The organization, which includes the CVS Caremark PBM, issued another statement Wednesday afternoon.
“CVS Health welcomes a good faith discussion with policy makers in Arkansas and across the country on ways to make medicine more affordable and accessible,” the statement said. “Unfortunately, HB1150 is bad policy that accomplishes just the opposite: it will take away access to pharmacy care in local communities, hike prescription drug spending across the state by millions of dollars each year, and cost hundreds of Arkansans their jobs.”
Arkansas has 23 CVS pharmacies that CVS and other opponents of HB 1150 said will be forced to close under the new law. Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said this is not true and pharmacies can still operate if they detach from PBMs.
Sanders, Vinson and other supporters of HB 1150 have said a lack of sufficient regulation of PBMs has allowed them to monopolize the pharmaceutical industry by setting their competitors’ prices.
OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — the three largest PBMs — are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.
 
The legal landscape
 


Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018 prohibit PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their competitors, locally owned independent pharmacies. PBMs routinely break these laws, said Vinson and HB 1150’s Republican sponsors, Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton and Rep. Jeremiah Moore of Clarendon.
PBMs have allegedly also violated Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs. Pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) thousands of complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, independent pharmacists and AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year.
This led the Arkansas Legislative Council to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs. The panel approved the rule a day after its Administrative Rules subcommittee rejected it.
Hammer told the Senate Insurance committee April 8 that the Legislature should not be “rewarding” violators of state law “by letting them stay in business.”
“Congress is pursuing this issue. Why? Because states like Arkansas are not sitting on the sidelines and being quiet about it,” Hammer said. “[If you say], ‘Let’s sit back and wait for Congress,’ like sitting back and waiting for the Lord to come, it ain’t going to happen soon enough.”
After more than a century serving Hammer’s constituents in Benton, Smith-Caldwell Drug Store closed in August 2023 due to financial insolvency and transferred its clients to Walgreens, a national chain that isn’t part of a PBM.
Brad Lawson, a Little Rock-based healthcare supervisor for Walgreens, told lawmakers in December that unfair PBM reimbursements have forced the company to close several locations and plan further closures nationwide.
Walgreens declined to comment Thursday on HB 1150.
 Opposition

In an April 4 interview with the Advocate, CVS leaders said the Caremark PBM not only complies with Arkansas law but also reimburses independent pharmacies at a higher rate than its own chain pharmacies. They also said employers whose health insurance plans include CVS will face higher costs.
“Patients are choosing us, they have a choice, and I think we’re not allowing patients to have a choice in this bill,” Chief Pharmacy Officer Lucille Accetta said.
When asked about HB 1150’s potential financial impact on CVS, Accetta and Vice President of External Relations David Whitrap said the losses of pharmacists’ jobs and patients’ access to medication are higher priorities than money.
CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 and 900 more stores between 2021 and 2024.
CVS District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis spoke against the bill at both Insurance and Commerce committee meetings, saying she and her colleagues would lose their jobs if HB 1150 becomes law.
Ellis lives in Greenbrier, represented by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View. Irvin was in the minority of Senate committee members to vote against HB 1150, and she said she would not vote for a constituent to lose her job.
Hammer said the potential loss of CVS employees’ jobs is “a lie.”
“If they want to argue these local [corporate] pharmacies shouldn’t be going out of business because they get paid adequately, fine,” he said. “Put your money where your mouth is. Prove it. Start paying yourselves like you’re paying these others.”
Several lawmakers said this month that they supported HB 1150 partly because they received emails urging them to vote against it that appeared to be from constituents but turned out to be from lobbyists opposing the legislation. Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, told the House Insurance Committee that CVS clients in his district had not consented to their names being used for this purpose.
Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, told the equivalent Senate committee that he received similar misleading emails.
“This is not grassroots opposition to this bill,” Johnson said. “This is astroturf.”
Besides CVS Health, opponents of HB 1150 included the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, the Navitus Health Solutions PBM, and the Omnicare and Accredo pharmacies.
Omnicare is owned by CVS Health, and Accredo is a subsidiary of Express Scripts.
 Mail order concerns

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding.
Opponents of HB 1150 said it would reduce patients’ access to specialty drugs, some of which might only be accessible via mail-order services — including for military members and veterans who receive pharmaceuticals via the Tricare insurance program’s partnership with Express Scripts.
HB 1150 allows the State Board of Pharmacy to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Hammer told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.
Despite being a veteran on Tricare, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s pharmacy services have been moved from one provider to another by PBM interference, he said in January at a news conference announcing HB 1150. He also said he would defend the legislation in court if it were challenged.
On Monday, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in HB 1150 to be enacted federally.
Griffin sued Express Scripts and OptumRX last year, alleging that they used data from drug manufacturers and distributors to maximize their financial gain instead of using it to mitigate the opioid addiction epidemic.
 
‘Winners and losers’
 


Irvin was one of nine senators, mostly Republicans, to vote against HB 1150 last week. She disputed the claim that PBMs have a monopoly in the pharmaceutical industry, saying this is only an opinion without a court’s declaration.
Senate Minority Whip Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, was the chamber’s only Democrat to vote against the bill. Love’s district does not have any local independent pharmacies, and his constituents will lose access to medications if corporate pharmacies like CVS close, he said.
“They’ve been talking to me saying, ‘Guess what? This will hurt us,’” Love said. “So we’re going to manufacture a pharmacy desert in southwest Little Rock? That’s not good for my people.”
Irvin also took issue with a statement April 8 from Greg Reybold, vice president of Healthcare Policy at the American Pharmacy Cooperative, that HB 1150 will “take the ball away” from PBMs in Arkansas’ pharmacy industry.
“We’re using the government to say, ‘We’re getting rid of your competition,’” Irvin said. “…It says that we’re denying a permit to be approved for you, but not for you. You’re picking winners and losers.”
GOP Sen. Justin Boyd, a Fort Smith pharmacist and the vice chairman of the Senate Insurance committee, argued that PBMs’ ability to set their competitors’ prices is actually “picking winners and losers.”
Another 2025 Arkansas law that supporters said will increase patients’ access to medication is Act 52, which removed the state’s ban on nonprofit hospitals holding pharmacy permits. The bill, co-sponsored by Irvin, initially failed in the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee but later passed after being amended.
The Arkansas Pharmacists Association opposed Act 52 before it was amended. Vinson told the Senate Insurance committee that Act 52 will create new pharmacy jobs that could make up for any job loss brought about by HB 1150. Both laws will go into effect in August.

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — Opposing attorneys laid out starkly different portrayals Friday of campaign mailers sent during the 2020 election that a Nebraska legislative candidate alleged were defamatory and damaged her business, marriage and reputation.
The attorney for the candidate, Janet Palmtag of Nebraska City, told jurors during closing arguments that the Nebraska Republican Party showed a reckless disregard for the facts in sending out the fliers, which he said falsely stated that she had broken the law and lost her license to practice real estate.
The attorney, David Domina, asked jurors to award Palmtag $4.25 million for the loss of real estate listings and damage to her standing in her community and damage to her relationship with her family.

“Other than to call her names, there’s really no defense here,” Domina said.
The attorney for the Nebraska GOP portrayed the mailers as largely true and said the content had been checked against available public records. It was only later, lawyer Kamron Hasan said, that the party learned the back story about the disciplinary steps taken against Palmtag’s real estate firm by the Iowa Real Estate Commission.
He termed it “an honest mistake.”
“The First Amendment and free speech protects honest mistakes … it protects Democrats, it protects Republicans, it protects other political affiliations,” Hasan said.
The closing arguments came at the end of a weeklong trial in Lancaster County District Court over the defamation lawsuit filed by Palmtag against the Nebraska GOP.
A jury of seven men and four women (One juror didn’t return after being picked to serve.) must decide, by clear and convincing evidence, if the statements made in the campaign mailers were false, that the GOP knew they were false and published them with a reckless disregard for the truth.
Verdict as early as Friday
If the jury cannot reach a verdict by 4:30 p.m. Friday, deliberations will continue Monday, according to the trial judge, Lancaster County District Judge Andrew Jacobsen.
The case raises issues of how far political speech can go during a heated campaign and hinges on whether the political party issued the mailers recklessly or with malice, a legal term that essentially means intentionally.
Palmtag lost the 2020 race for the Nebraska Legislature in southeast Nebraska against the then-incumbent, State Sen. Julie Slama.
The race pitted two Republicans against each other, with Slama being backed by then-Gov. Pete Ricketts, who appointed Slama to her post, and the state party. Palmtag, a longtime state GOP volunteer, was supported by former Gov. Dave Heineman, then-U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, among others.
Palmtag filed her lawsuit three months after the election.
Testimony at trial indicated that Palmtag had called the then-executive director of the state GOP after the initial mailer was sent out on Oct. 8, 2020. The mailer stated that Palmtag had “broke the law” and “lost” her real estate license, which Palmtag said was a lie and needed to be corrected.

Instead, the GOP executive, Ryan Hamilton, refused and instead sent a second mailer to 3,200 households stating that Palmtag was “too irresponsible” to serve as a legislator. That piece cited a 2017 civil fine levied by the Iowa Real Estate Commission paid after one of Palmtag’s agents had failed to obtain all the required signatures for a transfer of an earnest deposit on the sale of a home.
Domina, during his closing argument, said the Nebraska GOP was “reckless” in the campaign flyer because Palmtag never “lost” her license — she voluntarily gave up her personal and the firm’s corporate licenses in 2019 due to a lack of Iowa business after flooding — and because her consent agreement with the Iowa commission admitted no violation of law.
“(The consent agreement) doesn’t end with a license revoked, suspended or lost,” he said. Palmtag and her firm were still in “good standing” for two years afterwards, when the licenses were not renewed, Domina said.
GOP says ads based on public documents
But, Hasan, the GOP attorney, told jurors that what the party sent out was “at least substantially true,” because the consent order read that Palmtag’s real estate firm, J.J. Palmtag, did not contest the “alleged violation” of Iowa law.
“It was a violation. The law was broken,” he said. “You don’t have to admit to being guilty of a crime for it to be true.”
Hasan said that when Hamilton looked up the status of J.J. Palmtag’s Iowa license in 2020, he found that it was listed as “canceled.”
“You don’t have to overthink this,” he told jurors. “Just read the words.”

But Domina said that if Hamilton had researched the Iowa commission’s website further, he would have discovered that Palmtag’s individual license had become “inactive” in 2019, and the company’s license had been listed as “canceled” because that’s how corporate licenses are listed when not renewed.
Palmtag, Domina said, only agreed to pay a $500 fine to resolve the matter, which she testified stemmed from a mistake by one of her salesmen, who was gravely ill.
Domina said Palmtag was being “responsible” for resolving the matter, calling it “preposterous” that she had been “irresponsible” as claimed by the GOP.
Hasan, meanwhile, said that as the supervising agent, it was her mistake that caused the fine.
“Janet is J.J. Palmtag and J.J. Palmtag is Janet,” he said.
The case took so long to get to trial because initially, the judge had granted a summary judgment filed by the GOP, thus dismissing the case.
Domina appealed to the Nebraska Supreme Court, which ruled in his favor that a jury, and not the judge, needed to make that decision, which led to this week’s trial.
This is a developing story.

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Earlier this week, health officials urged parents to consider seeking one dose of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine for infants aged 6-11 months who live in Doña Ana County — the fourth and latest New Mexico county with cases — or who will be traveling to either Doña Ana or Lea counties, where the bulk of the state’s cases have thus far taken place. 
Normally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  recommends infants receive the first dose at 12 to 15 months and a second dose between 4 to 6-years old. Dr. Jana Shaw, a State University of New York professor of pediatrics, notes that babies gain some antibodies from measles when the mother is vaccinated, so the recommendation is often to wait until 1 year of age for the most effective protection. 
Except when there’s an outbreak. 
“If the risk is increased, vaccinating children less than one year of age is recommended; it’s safe,” Shaw told Source. And with no antiviral therapies to treat measles, “the only preventive tool we have is vaccination,” she said. “Once your child is infected, our tools are pretty limited in terms of what we can do to treat, support and help your child to heal.”
New Mexico’s cases as of April 18 stood at 63, with no new cases reported on Friday, according to a Department of Health spokesperson. The bulk of those cases —59 — occurred in Lea County. Of the total cases, 46 afflicted non-vaccinated people; six were vaccinated; and 11 had unknown vaccination statuses. In nearby West Texas, where New Mexico’s outbreak likely began, the health department on Friday reported 597 confirmed since late January, an increase of 36 since the April 15 update.
Nationwide, according to the CDC’s most recent figures, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases have been reported by 25 jurisdictions. The 2019 series of outbreaks totaled 1,249 measles infections, and were the largest in the U.S. since the CDC declared measles eradicated in 2000. 
Shaw praised the strong responses from local health departments and vaccination strategies for bringing that outbreak under control, but expressed concern about misinformation’s impact on public health.
“It was through vaccination how we stopped [the 2019] outbreak,” Shaw said. “Unfortunately, we don’t have such a strong intervention in place now, and certainly doesn’t seem to be very coordinated. I’m concerned this will continue to spread.”
Public health authorities warned about the threats of vaccine safety misinformation even before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the concerns have accelerated since then, according to Jagdish Khubchandani, a public health professor at New Mexico State University. 
Khubchandani co-authored a 2021 paper on vaccine hesitancy during the pandemic and is currently funded by the National Science Foundation grant to further study misinformation impacts on public health. 
“It’s a complicated problem, and I think it needs urgent action at the local, regional and global levels,” he told Source. “We have seen, in the meanwhile, that the rise of misinformation and vaccine hesitancy proliferates at a faster rate than awareness campaigns for vaccination.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-462294288-1024x706.jpg,,,2025-04-18 16:07:21.155793

Credit: Getty ImagesIn 2018, the Florida Legislature reacted to the mass shooting in Parkland by passing major safety regulations. Chances for a such a response to Thursday’s shootings at Florida State University are slim.
That doesn’t mean legislators are ignoring the politics of guns.
Start with Miami Republican state Sen. Illeana Garcia, who joined with three Senate Democrats in a committee vote last month rejecting a proposal sponsored by then-GOP Sen. Randy Fine (SB 814) to allow concealed weapons on college and university campuses.
“I have zero regret,” Garcia said on X late Thursday night about that vote, in which she joined with Democratic Sens. Jason Pizzo, Mack Bernard, and Carlos Guillermo Smith in opposing the proposal. Two other Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee were absent for the vote.
“Proud to have voted against your moronic campus carry bill, that didn’t have a house companion,” Garcia said, referring to Fine. “This decision wasn’t about partisan politics; it was rooted in common sense. The incident at FSU was tragic, but the real issue lies not with the firearm itself, but with the factors that led to it. The individual involved was the child of a deputy sheriff and had knowledge of weapon handling, yet chose to act recklessly.”
Fine noted the vote in a posting on X on Friday, where he included an excerpt of his speech in the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 25.
“There is no magic force field that keeps guns from coming onto our college campuses,” he said. “Less than one month ago, in my last bill presentation as a Florida Senator, I attempted to give adults the same right to protect themselves on campus as they have off. My four-minute closing speech is below. For the first and only time in 8.5 years in the Legislature, I failed. By a vote of 3-4, with two absent, the committee voted to keep universities ‘gun-free zones.’ An offensive name given what happened yesterday. The no vote included all three Democrats plus one so-called Republican. I am incredibly grateful to the law enforcement who ran into the gunfire yesterday to subdue the gunman. But in the time that took, this murderer was able to shoot seven people, two of whom have died. Today, I wonder if one of those seven had been able to defend themselves, the outcome would have been different. In any event, I will continue praying for all.”
Following the Parkland school shooting in February of 2018, within weeks the Florida Legislature and then-Gov. Rick Scott came together to pass the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public High School Safety Act, a comprehensive measure that included numerous provisions regarding firearms and school safety, plus community mental health resources.
There have been attempts over the past three legislative sessions to repeal a provision of that law that bans individuals under 21 years of age from purchasing rifles and shotguns, and prohibiting licensed firearm dealers, importers, and manufacturers, from selling them to people of that age. Those measures have passed the House in 2023, 2024, and this year. In the past two years, the Senate did not pass a companion measure, and a similar measure has yet to advance in the 2025 legislative session.

The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

 DEI-related cuts

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
 Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
 Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.
Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas formally appealed on Friday the federal government’s denial of funds to aid recovery from March 14-15 storms and tornadoes.
In a letter to President Donald Trump and FEMA Regional Administrator George Robinson, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders asked the administration to reconsider its rejection of her requests for disaster declarations for individual assistance and public assistance.
“Arkansas communities are still recovering from this spring’s tornadoes, as the sheer magnitude of this event resulted in overwhelming amounts of debris, widespread destruction to homes and businesses, the tragic loss of three lives, and injuries to many others,” Sanders said. “To relieve the burden on these counties, cities, and towns, I am appealing FEMA’s decision to deny Arkansas’ Major Disaster Declaration request.”
Sanders originally sought the major disaster declaration on April 2; FEMA issued its denial on April 11.
Sanders’ letter notes that “without the support of a Major Disaster Declaration, Arkansas will face significant challenges in assuming full responsibility and achieving an effective recovery from this event. I
have determined that the severity and magnitude of these storms exceed the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to respond adequately. As such, supplemental Federal assistance is crucial.”
The state’s request includes Baxter, Stone, Sharp, Hempstead, Independence, Randolph, Nevada, Jackson, Clay, Woodruff, Greene, Hot Spring,  Izard and Lawrence counties.
Trump earlier this year called the Federal Emergency Management Agency “a disaster” and suggested it “might go away.” He said states could take care of disaster responses on their own and convened a group to review the agency and recommended changes.

The grant terminations came after President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order to “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and “environmental justice” offices and positions.” 

Of the 19 grants terminated in Connecticut, 17 were designated to Yale and two to UConn.
In 2024, the Yale School of Medicine received more than $598 million in NIH funding. The cancelled grants were originally for more than $42 million combined. Slightly more than $11 million was unspent when the awards were terminated.
At the University of Connecticut, the grants totaled $1.7 million, with $1 million left unspent when they were terminated, according to the tracker maintained by Noam Ross of rOpenSci and Scott Delaney of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
According to the NIH grants policy statement, grant payments are usually awarded as advance payments. “The intent is that recipients draw funds on an as-needed basis —specifically, no more than 3 business days before the funds are needed,” the policy states.
Most of the research cut for both schools were of research projects that dealt with mental health and LGBTQ+ issues. Words like “sex,” “transgender,” “mental health” and “minority” were among the most commonly used words in the titles of the grants.
Some of these projects supported research on AIDS prevention and HIV, alcohol use, and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
These awards support departments such as internal medicine, public health and preventive medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, emergency medicine, social sciences and engineering. 
While most grants supported research projects, there were also other activities supported by the cut grants.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OSg3M-most-of-yale-s-terminated-grants-were-for-its-medical-school-1024x649.png,,,2025-04-18 15:10:12.027806

Green International Airport. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The deadline to obtain a REAL ID is less than a month away, yet more than one-third of Rhode Islanders still haven’t made the switch to the license required for air travel.
Starting May 7, 2025, travelers 18 or older nationwide must present either their U.S. passport or the REAL ID cards marked with a gold star in the top right corner to board domestic flights or enter federal buildings. International travel will still require a passport.
President George W. Bush signed a law mandating REAL IDs in 2005 in response to the security concerns raised by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The original compliance deadline was in 2008, but has been delayed by the federal government several times. 
This time, federal officials say enforcement is really happening. About 81% of U.S. air travelers now have a REAL ID-compliant or otherwise acceptable form of identification, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

But Rhode Island still lags behind, with just under 62% of credentials issued by the state Division of Motor Vehicles meeting the federal standards. The state began offering REAL ID-compliant licenses in 2018.
On Friday, DMV spokesperson Paul Grimaldi said the state was averaging 268 daily REAL ID reservations across its six offices. The DMV will issue a temporary paper ID, but it may not be accepted at Transit Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints.
Worried about potential delays at airports, U.S. Sen Jack Reed (D-R.I.) wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Thursday asking what federal officials will do to process travelers who arrive at airport security checkpoints without REAL ID.
The TSA in January said it would conduct “phased enforcement” over two years, with the ability to issue warnings to people without Real IDs to avoid operational disruption.
“TSA will implement REAL ID effectively and efficiently, continuing to ensure the safety and security of passengers while also working to minimize operational disruptions at airports, including at Rhode Island T.F. Green airport,” agency spokesperson Daniel Velez said in an emailed statement Friday.
Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Rhode Island Current Friday that the department will “ continue to collaborate with state, local, and airport authorities to inform the public, facilitate compliance, curb wait times and prevent fraud.”
Rhode Islanders who plan to travel after May 7 are advised to schedule their DMV appointments four to six weeks before flying in order to ensure getting their REAL ID mailed in time.
REAL ID appointments are also available at local AAA branches for members. First time applicants will be required to provide one proof of identity document such as a birth certificate, proof of Social Security, and two proofs of Rhode Island residency such as a utility bill.
If your name has changed, you’ll need to provide official documentation, such as a government-issued marriage certificate, divorce decree, or adoption paperwork.
Travelers applying for a REAL ID within their renewal period, which is the 90 days before a license or ID expires, don’t have to pay any additional costs. Outside that renewal period, it will cost $27.50 to upgrade to a REAL ID.

Jared Polis speaks at the state Capitol on March 13, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis vetoed his first bill of this year’s legislative session, rejecting a bill that would have changed the state’s open records law.
“It would certainly be convenient for the Executive Branch to agree to weaken CORA, but as a representative for the people of Colorado, I support more, not less, openness and transparency,” the Democrat wrote in his Thursday veto letter, referring to the Colorado Open Records Act.
Senate Bill 25-77 was a bipartisan measure that would have extended the timeline that a records custodian has to respond to a CORA request, except for requests from journalists. It also would have given entities more time to respond to a request if they decided the request was for financial gain, like obtaining information on a large group of people in order to solicit  business.

The bill was sponsored by Sen. Cathy Kipp, a Fort Collins Democrat, Sen. Janice Rich, a Grand Junction Republican, Rep. Matt Soper, a Delta Republican, and Rep. Michael Carter, an Aurora Democrat. Kipp and Soper ran a similar bill last year that died in a Senate committee.
“I was really hoping that he would decide not to veto it,” Kipp said. “I think it is a very fair bill that we worked for a couple years on in order to get it into a good place. We have several elements of the bill that are good for both requestees and for requesters, and I think it would make things easier.”
The bill passed on a 45-19 vote in the House and a 27-6 vote in the Senate, which would satisfy the two-thirds requirement to override a veto if the Legislature pursues one. The lawmaking session ends the first week of May.
Kipp said sponsors are having conversations about pursuing a veto override.
Polis took issue with allowing public officials to make those determinations on who the requester is and what their motives are.
“The bill leaves the custodian with far too much power to define who is and is not a member of the media, and what is and isn’t news,” he wrote. “For instance, a public official may deem a request from a media outlet focusing specifically on climate change as not meeting the statutory definitions of ‘newsperson’ or ‘mass medium’ given the perspective of some elected officials that climate change is categorically not news.”
The bill relied on existing definitions of “mass medium” and “newsperson” found in state statute related to courts and court procedures.
Polis also objected to the creation of different CORA response timelines for different types of requests, ranging from three days for journalists and 30 days for businesses seeking records for financial gain.
“A newsperson, a member of the public, and a person seeking financial gain may all request the same information and, under this bill, get access to that information on different timelines,” Polis wrote. “To ensure fairness and confidence in public transparency, all legitimate requests for public transparency under CORA should be treated equally under the law, without preference for some requestors over others.”
But to Kipp, the bill’s intention is for the government to not conduct “market research” for businesses on the same timeline and cost for others seeking public records.
The bill’s bipartisan group of sponsors and supporters had argued that the bill was intended to give public officials a reasonable amount of time to respond to an increasing volume of requests.
“People should be able to get information that they want to get. So what we’re mostly doing with this bill is trying to clarify the processes for requesters, and to give those public entities and records custodians just a little bit more time to fulfill those requests, because it’s become just an overwhelming burden,” Kipp said.
The Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition’s advocacy committee had asked Polis earlier this month to veto the bill, arguing in a letter that it would create unnecessary barriers “for people seeking to gain a better understanding of state and local government activities in Colorado.”

U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) raised more than any U.S. House candidate in Pennsylvania in the first three months of 2025. From the beginning of January to the end of March, Fitzpatrick raised $1.22 million and spent just under $275,000.
Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Bucks County serving his fifth term in Congress, also holds the most cash on hand of any incumbent candidate in the commonwealth. Campaign finance records show he entered April with $5.37 million, a significant amount more than other GOP lawmaker who will likely face high-priced reelection bids.
At this point in the previous cycle, Fitzpatrick’s campaign had just $1.91 million cash on hand.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Four of the top five fundraisers in the commonwealth’s congressional delegation in Q1 are being targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) as seats to flip in 2026. Pennsylvania is the only state that the DCCC is targeting more than 3 GOP held seats in its initial list of targets for the next election.
Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House, flipped two seats in Pennsylvania during the 2024 election.
Berwood Yost, the director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll, told the Capital-Star it’s no surprise Republican incumbents are among the leaders in fundraising for Q1, since they are the most competitive seats in the state.
“They will attract the most interest, particularly to hold the Republican majority,” Yost said. “I mean, if you lose those four seats, you’ve got issues nationally.”
While Democrats are placing a high priority to be on offense in Pennsylvania, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), did not include any Democratic held seats in its initial 2026 target list.
U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District), who defeated incumbent Democrat Matt Cartwright for the seat in 2024 by roughly 1.5 points, raised the second highest in the state’s congressional delegation for Q1. The GOP freshman raised just under $835,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March, while spending $170,000. Bresnahan’s campaign entered April with $715,000 cash on hand.
Another Republican freshman member of the state’s congressional delegation finished Q1 with the third highest haul. U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District), who unseated incumbent Democrat Susan Wild in 2024 by 1 point, raised just under $675,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March and spent roughly $165,000. His campaign entered April with $615,000 on hand.
  Rep. Scott Perry talking to reporters at the Capitol Sept. 19, 2023 (Jennifer Shutt/ States Newsroom)
U.S. Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District), who is coming off of his closest race for reelection since winning a seat in the U.S. House in 2012, raised $565,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March and spent just under $95,000. Perry’s haul was the fifth highest in the state’s congressional delegation.
Perry’s campaign entered April with slightly less than $555,000, which is more than he had at this point in the previous cycle when his campaign had just over $360,000.
Yost said he imagines that there’s going to be “ample donors” for challengers in those competitive seats, since it is being targeted by the DCCC.
“It’s a little too soon to make any judgments about Democrats’ interest or enthusiasm, simply because you don’t really have candidates doing that fundraising yet,” Yost said.
“The normal ebb and flow is the incumbents are going to do what they can to solidify their donor base if they are expecting a challenge,” Yost said. “And we’ll know more about how competitive those races will be once we have declared candidates with the infrastructure that they need to report the fundraising.”
The only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation to not raise more than every Democrat is U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-16th District), who raised just over $125,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March.
Although the 2026 midterm elections are 21 months away, national ratings outlets indicate that the races Democrats are targeting in the state should be competitive. The Cook Political Report rates Mackenzie and Perry’s bid for reelections in the 7th and 10th Congressional Districts, respectively, as “toss-ups.”
They also rate Bresnahan’s bid for a second term in the 8th Congressional District as “lean Republican,” and Fitzpatrick’s quest for another term representing parts of suburban Philadelphia as “likely Republican.”
The only Democrat on the radar of that national ratings outlet is U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-17th District) – a race they describe as “likely Democratic.” Deluzio raised just under $250,000 in Q1, which is more than any other Democratic incumbent in the state’s congressional delegation.

Democrats begin lining up for competitive House races
While the primary election for the House is still one year away, a few candidates have already entered the 2026 race.
Bucks County Commissioner Bob Harvie, a Democrat, announced earlier this month that he’s seeking his party’s nomination to face Fitzpatrick. Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure, a Democrat, declared his entrance into the race against Mackenzie for the 7th Congressional District in February.
As of April 18, no Democratic candidates have filed to run for the 8th and 10th Congressional Districts to challenge Bresnahan and Perry, although rematches for both races could happen. Cartwright told the Scranton Times-Tribune in January that he might run for the 8th Congressional District again in 2026, while Janelle Stelson, the Democrat who lost to Perry by 1.2 points last year, said last month that she is “seriously considering” a second run for the 10th Congressional District.
Yost said it’s too soon to tell how these races are going to shape up, but said he thinks “we can probably suggest” that the Democratic candidates “will be pretty well funded in all of these races,” as well as the Republican candidates, unless a weak candidate makes it through the primary election.
Due to the potential implications of the majority of the U.S. House being on the line, Yost thinks Democratic donors from across the country could weigh in on these battleground races. 
Evans’ future?
U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District) is the only member of the state’s congressional delegation to raise less than $100,000. The Philadelphia Democrat raised just under $40,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March. His campaign spent about $50,000 in Q1, which is more than it brought in during that time period.
Evans is also the only member to have less than $100,000 in his account. Entering April, his campaign had just under $65,000 on hand. The next lowest is U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District), a potential candidate for governor, who has $206,000 on hand.
  U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District)
Evans suffered a stroke in May 2024 and was reelected to another term in November. Following his illness, he did not vote for several months as he recovered. Multiple Democrats, according to a Philadelphia Inquirer report in December, would be interested in running for the seat, should Evans not seek reelection in 2026.
The names the Inquirer mentioned as potential candidates included state Sen. Sharif Street, Pennsylvania’s Democratic Party chair, state Rep. Morgan Cephas, the Philadelphia Delegation chair in the Pennsylvania House, and state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia). Dave Oxman, a physician, has already filed to run for Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District.
Rabb set up an exploratory committee in October 2023, but decided against joining the race.
The link to donate to Rabb’s exploratory committee is still active on ActBlue, although he told the Capital-Star that he set it up for the 2024 election cycle “based on persistent rumors that Rep. Evans might not run for reelection. When his name appeared on the ballot, I had no desire to run against him.”
When asked by the Capital-Star if he was actively considering a run for the seat in 2026, he said it was “too soon to say.”
A spokesperson for the Evans campaign told the Capital-Star on Friday that he “has every intention to run for re-election at this time” and “is working hard at fundraising and plans for a successful Q2.”
Evans, after a long tenure in the Pennsylvania General Assembly, defeated indicted incumbent Congressman Chaka Fattah in the Democratic Party primary in 2016 to win a seat in the U.S. House. He’s coasted to reelection since winning a seat in Congress and according to national ratings outlets, represents a safe Democratic district.
Yost said since it’s not a competitive district, “the impetus for him to raise money is not the same as it is for, say, Fitzpatrick or these other candidates that are in competitive districts.”
“That’s just the reality,” Yost said.
Fetterman posts lowest quarter since entering Senate
U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), raised an impressive $73.9 million during his successful 2022 campaign over Republican Mehmet Oz.
Although he’s not up for reelection until 2028, his campaign raised the lowest amount in a full quarter since he declared for the seat in February 2021.
Fetterman’s campaign raised just over $395,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March and spent a little more than $415,000. 
In 2024, Fetterman raised $1 million in two-consecutive quarters to end the year. His lowest haul last year was $881,000 in the first three months of 2024.
Prior to this past quarter, Fetterman’s lowest total for a three-month stretch was $720,000 from the beginning of April to the end of June in 2023.

Over the past few months, Fetterman has faced pushback from Democrats and other progressives over a number of his statements, votes, and positions, including backing multiple cabinet selections in President Donald Trump’s administration. But, he holds a positive approval rating, according to data from early this year.
Yost said there’s no doubt that there are a number of Democrats who supported Fetterman in 2022 that have “soured” on him due, in part, to some of those recent votes.
Since Fetterman isn’t up for reelection until 2028, Yost believes “he’s got plenty of time to raise money, but you can’t ignore” the pushback he’s receiving from some in his own party.
“Maybe this is an early sign that he could have trouble raising money from traditional Democratic sources,” Yost said. “It’s worth following that to see if it’s just a blip, or if this is an early indicator that he may have trouble raising money like he did in 2022.”

(Photo courtesy Candice Kutrosky, NM Forestry Division)A wildfire in Valencia County destroyed three structures yesterday evening, according to a New Mexico state Forestry spokesperson. Efforts to contain the wildfire remain ongoing.
The Rio Grande Fire was detected around 4 p.m. on Thursday west of Bosque Farms. High winds and dry conditions pushed the fire east across the Rio Grande into the village Bosque Farms, state Forestry spokesperson George Ducker said. 
The fire, which started on Bureau of Indian Affairs jurisdiction is currently 10% contained, Ducker said. 
The fire spans roughly 60 acres, or less than a tenth of a square mile, and the structures burned may have been homes, Ducker said, , but a damage assessment is being conducted today. 
Fuels for the fire include grass, brush and other plants along the bosque. High winds and prolonged drought made fire risk high in the area and across the state Thursday. The fire also caused evacuations but those have since been lifted, Ducker said. 
The cause of the fire is still under investigation, Ducker said, though some online wildfire databases say it was “human caused.”
Crews worked through the night to contain the fire and have since established divisions on the north and south sides of it to try to contain it further. Crews will look to increase containment and extinguish hotspots within the bosque today, Ducker said. 
Winds in the area are expected to decrease, and scattered rain showers are expected tonight. Still, the eastern two-thirds of the state, including Bosque Farms, are under a Red Flag Warning, according to the National Weather Service.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rio-Grande-Fire_Candice-Kutrosky-e1745000802891.jpg,,,2025-04-18 15:10:12.027806

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry, a conservative Republican, drew praise from liberal Democrats after he railed against large corporations and called for stricter regulations on the insurance industry — an uncommon spectacle that suggested the governor is staking his political fate on lowering policy rates.
Testifying in a nearly two-hour exchange Wednesday with lawmakers on the House Insurance Committee, Landry urged his fellow Republicans to break from their traditional alignment with insurance companies and vote in favor of House Bill 576, a Democrat-backed proposal that’s part of an agenda Landry has described as a “balanced approach” to the decades-old rate debate between personal injury lawyers and the insurance companies they sue. 
Louisiana pollster John Couvillon said Landry can’t really afford not to take on the insurance issue because policy premiums are by far the most overwhelming concern of voters and likely outweighs any risk associated with bipartisanship.
“If he can bend the cost curve on insurance rates, that’s something he can take credit for,” Couvillon said. “Who he works with to do it is much more insider baseball. I don’t know if that kind of perception would matter with the average Louisiana voter who’s really more concerned with high insurance rates.”  
Landry has included multiple bills on his agenda that target both insurance companies and trial lawyers, but House Bill 576 could be part of a larger political calculation that affords him more opportunities for reward than risk. 
Cosponsored by moderate Democrats Robby Carter of Amite and Chad Brown of Plaquemine, the bill would give the state insurance commissioner the power to prohibit any insurance rates considered “excessive” during any market conditions. Currently, the commissioner can only exercise that power after holding a public hearing in which someone proves that the insurance market lacks competition. 
The bill applies to all lines of insurance, though Landry has focused his attention mostly on auto and property insurance rates. Spikes in homeowner premiums occurred after a series of destructive storms starting in 2020 and have been mostly limited to the coastal regions. Premiums for auto insurance have long been elevated across Louisiana, and lawmakers have struggled to identify a clear reason why, believing the problem is rooted in policy decisions. 
Landry and Brown sat shoulder-to-shoulder Wednesday as they presented the measure, which includes an amendment the governor said he wrote himself and modeled after a law in Mississippi. Louisiana’s neighbor has average auto insurance rates that are nearly half the amount of Louisiana’s, according to U.S. News & World Report.
Brown’s bill cleared the committee in a 13-4 vote but still has a ways to go before final passage, and Landry’s office would not say if the governor will continue to shepherd the bill over each subsequent hurdle.  
“It certainly helped that the governor was there to support it,” Brown said in an interview, adding that he hopes Landry will testify at subsequent hearings. He thinks the governor has sent a clear enough message to Republican lawmakers about what they need to vote for.
Landry paired his appearance with rhetoric that potentially puts him at odds with his own party, which has traditionally favored pro-capitalist narratives.
Louisiana lawmakers dissect personal injury laws as attorney-legislators protest

“We’re losing sight of something that’s been going on in this country for quite some time, and that is consolidation … That is exactly why we need this law,” Landry said, “because we have allowed corporations to control large market shares in violation of Sherman [Antitrust Act] again and again.”
Congress passed the Sherman Act in 1890 to establish rules for competitive trade and prevent unfair monopolies. 
Rep. Edmond Jordan of Baton Rouge and New Orleans Reps. Matt Willard and Mandie Landry, all Democrats, thanked the governor for putting effort into the issue and trying to hold insurance companies accountable. They joined Landry in arguing tort reform legislation, which is based on the idea that trial lawyers have an unfair advantage in court, has not worked.
One of the four Republicans who voted against the Brown bill, Rep. Jay Gallé of Mandeville, told his colleagues it would undermine “all free market principles” of supply and demand and ultimately discourage new insurance companies from coming to Louisiana. He argued it would give the insurance commissioner sole authority to arbitrarily decide rates. 
Brown clarified the commissioner would only be able to approve or reject rates, not set them. The governor argued Louisiana could never have a “free market” for insurance because the law requires drivers and homeowners to have coverage.  
“The free market rules do not apply when the consumer is mandated to buy something,” Gov. Landry said.
In a later interview, Gallé said he was in an uncomfortable situation having to choose between supporting his party leader versus following his conscience and beliefs. 
“When it is a quote-unquote ‘governor’s bill,’ the pressure is already on you, and when he takes the time to come and sit in the room that adds a little more pressure,” Gallé said. “I hated to go against the governor, but at the end of the day I had to go with what’s best for my district.”
Whether the Brown bill would even have an impact on insurance rates is questionable. Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple, who is opposed to it — and in a public feud with the governor — has said actuaries in his office have reviewed high policy rates in Louisiana and found them to be justified based on losses insurers have accrued in defending lawsuits. 
The governor’s bill would back the commissioner into a corner, forcing him to choose between rates based on market data or rates artificially suppressed for political reasons, Temple said. 
The governor has cast suspicion on Temple’s opposition to the bill, repeating an argument Rep. Mandie Landry made earlier in the hearing when she asked the governor if he ever knew of a politician who shied away from having greater control. 
“I’ve never seen a politician not want more power,” the governor said.
At the same time, some claim the governor is focused on Brown’s proposal because he hopes giving more power to Temple would allow him to blame the commissioner if rates fail to improve. Temple’s office pointed to Gov. Landry’s April 9 discussion with conservative radio host Moon Griffon in which the governor suggested as much.
“If we … implement that here, giving our insurance commissioner those tools, and if the rates don’t go down, it’s on him,” the governor told Griffon. 
But according to Couvillon, deflecting blame away from the governor would be a more difficult task than most people realize. Voters are much more familiar with the governor than the insurance commissioner, so it would take a very effective messaging strategy to deflect any blame. 
“Voters tend to hold the governor accountable for things like high insurance rates whether it is a deserved measurement or not,” Couvillon said.
If Gov. Landry’s agenda has little effect and coverage premiums remain about the same, there’s enough time to try to recast his political fate and convince voters to overlook it before his re-election bid in 2027. The greatest risk in the governor’s calculation lies in the possibility that insurance rates continue to increase, which would be a much bigger problem for Gov. Landry, Couvillon said.
On the other hand, the insurance commissioner has said repeatedly previous reforms have started having an impact on homeowner coverage lines. On Wednesday, Temple told the committee eight insurers have filed rate decreases for 2025. 
“It is working,” Temple said. “Rates are coming down.”
House Bill 576 will next move to the House floor for consideration.

SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois chapter of AARP played a role in the Trump administration reversing itself and allowing Social Security beneficiaries to have the option of filing for benefits over the phone.

The continuation of phone-based filing is an about-face of a plan set forth in mid-March by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to restrict telephone services for beneficiaries nationwide. Nearly 100,000 Illinoisans mobilized against the plan by writing to Congress during the month of March. Nationally, AARP members sent more than 2 million emails denouncing the proposed changes.

In response to the widespread pushback, the SSA issued a series of updates on X, formerly Twitter, withdrawing its previously announced plan and reinstating phone services for all claim types—including those applying for retirement, Social Security disability insurance (SSDI), Medicare and supplemental security income (SSI).

The new plan now requires in-person claims processing and identity proofing only for calls flagged as potentially fraudulent, according to a press release Monday from Illinois AARP. “This is great news for older Americans,” said Ryan Gruenenfelder, senior director of advocacy and outreach at AARP Illinois.

New rule caused web crashes, service disruptions

AARP Illinois and its members came to the Illinois state Capitol on April 10 to express their frustration with the recent federal actions and call on lawmakers to strengthen SSA customer service. Members have reported significant disruptions in service in recent months, including long wait times at SSA field offices, frequent website crashes and an increase in calls getting disconnected due to a lack of available representatives.

“As a retiree, I count on my Social Security benefits, and they actually provide more than half of my monthly income,” said Sandra McAvoy, an AARP member and volunteer with the Illinois state legislature. “That income has enabled me to live independently and very comfortably.”

In Illinois, about 2.3 million people receive some form of Social Security benefits. More than 40% of Illinois residents age 65 or older rely on Social Security for at least half of their income, while around 20% rely on it for at least 90% of their income, according to AARP.

The SSA was planning to end phone-based claims as an anti-fraud measure, saying the move would strengthen fraud prevention by forcing individuals to go online or visit local field offices to prove their identities and file for benefits.

AARP said this would have made it difficult for older adults, people with disabilities and those in rural areas to access their benefits.

“The proposed changes were unacceptable,” said Gruenenfelder.

About 140,000 people age 65 and older in Illinois live more than 45 miles roundtrip from the nearest Social Security office, according to an April 8 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Once there, individuals report having to wait for hours in long lines to see an available customer service agent.

The only alternative to in-person and phone services — the SSA’s online portal system — is not a reliable option for many beneficiaries. Roughly 28% of households in Illinois do not have subscriptions to high-speed internet, according to a 2024 report from the Benton Institute for Broadband and Society.

Some callers to SSA waited hours to get help

These challenges were in place long before the now-rescinded changes. But AARP said there has since been a recent “rapid deterioration” in customer service that has resulted in callers waiting hours at a time to get connected with an available representative.

According to SSA data, the agency had a busy rate of 0% in 2024, meaning no callers received a pre-recorded message when trying to reach a service agent over the phone. But in March, that number spiked to 28.4%, indicating nearly 1 in 3 callers received a message saying the office’s lines were too busy to take their call.

The sudden disruption to customer service came after the agency’s announcement in February of a 12% target reduction of the SSA workforce and permanent closure of six of 10 regional offices by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These workforce reductions were announced despite promises by President Donald Trump not to cut or disrupt Social Security payments with his policies.

In his first speech since leaving the White House on Tuesday, April 15, former President Joe Biden spoke out against the Trump administration’s latest actions on Social Security, including sweeping workforce cuts, permanent closures of regional offices and the current customer service crisis.

“In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage,” the former president said in Chicago, according to the AP. “They’ve taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration.”

AARP celebrates the SSA’s decision to walk back its proposed changes to phone-based services, but Gruenenfelder said more oversight and resources are needed to improve the agency’s customer service moving forward.

“We’re urging Congress consistently, and the White House consistently, no matter who’s in the White House, to take actions to prioritize Social Security and protect it for the long term,” Gruenenfelder said.

Symptoms typically appear 7 to 14 days after exposure and can include a high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, white spots inside the mouth, and a distinctive rash, writes guest columnist Noreen Womack. (Getty Images)Montana health officials have announced five confirmed cases of measles in Gallatin County.

The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services along with the Gallatin City-County Health Department in Bozeman confirmed it’s the first instance of the highly infectious disease since 1990.
The individuals are children and adults who were exposed to measles while traveling outside of Montana. The cases reside in Gallatin County and are currently isolated at home. All five individuals are unvaccinated, or vaccine status is unknown.
The Gallatin City-County Health Department continues to assess any potential exposures while the individuals were contagious and are contacting the people who may have been exposed, commonly referred to as “contact tracing.” People potentially exposed are being provided with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for.
The Gallatin health department has determined that there are points of exposure to the general public. Potential exposures to the public can be found on the GCCHD website and will be updated as needed or as more information becomes available. The spread of measles can occur before people know they have the disease, and before any rash appears. The times listed on the website include the period when the exposure occurred and two hours after.
 People without prior measles infection, vaccination have 90% likelihood of contracting disease if exposed

Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.
“While it is unfortunate to have cases of measles after 35 years of disease inactivity in Montana, we have been working diligently with our local partners to prepare,” said DPHHS Public Health Physician Dr. Maggie Cook-Shimanek. “We are confident that our public health and clinical partners will work together and address this situation as quickly as possible. It is important for everyone to know their vaccination status and to visit with their health department or health care provider if they are unsure.”

If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:

Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
Check your home state immunization registries.

Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
“Measles is highly contagious and highly preventable with vaccination, and ensuring people are immunized remains our best defense. If people are unable to find their vaccine records, there are no contraindications to receiving an additional dose,” said Dr. Peter Bulger, Gallatin City-County Health Department medical director.
Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.
The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.
If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, call your primary care physician as soon as possible.
“We are actively working with individuals who are experiencing symptoms,” said Lori Christenson, Gallatin City-County Health Officer. “We greatly appreciate the cooperation of those involved in helping mitigate further exposures. We encourage anyone who is not vaccinated or unsure of their vaccination history to consider vaccination and to contact your health care provider or GCCHD. By getting vaccinated we protect ourselves and others around us from infection.”
There is no cure for measles once the outbreak has started. It’s a virus, and medical professionals treat the symptoms related to the infection.
For more information about measles and the measles vaccine, visit the state health department’s website. Additional information can also be found on the CDC’s website.

Last week, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer requested an emergency declaration from President Donald Trump for the state, 12 counties and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians following the historic ice storm that hit northern Michigan.
If granted, up to $5 million from the federal government would be made available to help northern Michigan clean up and recover.
Local, tribal and state entities and utilities have been responding to the storm for weeks, clearing roads, cleaning up debris and repairing power lines. Whitmer also called in the National Guard to help. The state estimates that costs for responding to the storm already exceed $7 million.
Officials have said federal assistance is central to recovery in the region. U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman, a Republican, and Sens. Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin, both Democrats, supported that request.
In a news release from the governor’s office, Col. James F. Grady II, director of the Michigan State Police, said approval of the emergency request “would bring critical federal resources to support local response operations that are still ongoing. This is a necessary step while we work toward the broader disaster declaration that will bring additional relief.”
But how does the process actually work?
 Disaster relief starts locally

After a disaster hits, local, tribal and state governments will typically be the first to respond. If they don’t have enough resources to deal with the aftermath, governors and tribal governments can request assistance from the federal government, which the president has to sign off on.
Disaster declarations are structured through a law called the Stafford Act.
“There are incidents that obviously the state needs help dealing with, because no state or community can take care of it on their own, and that’s when federal aid is designed to kick in,” said Anna Weber, a senior policy analyst for climate adaptation at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.
Weber spent a decade working on federal contracts related to water infrastructure and environmental health.
There are two types of federal disaster declarations. One is an emergency declaration, which the president decides on and which doesn’t have to meet any threshold.
The other is a major disaster declaration, which often requires a damage assessment to determine if an area is eligible. (In situations where it’s clear that federal assistance will be required, officials don’t have to wait for a damage assessment to request federal assistance.)
The state of Michigan will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, and the Small Business Administration to assess whether the region is eligible for that assistance.
 Whitmer requested emergency assistance from the president. What’s next?

It’s up to President Trump to decide whether or not to grant that relief, which usually goes to local entities to help with cleanup and recovery.
In an emailed statement to IPR, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, “The Trump administration is closely tracking the situation and is working with state and local officials to assess what next steps are needed.”
Emergency declarations are typically processed pretty quickly because they don’t need to meet any specific criteria. The goal is to get aid to the area quickly.
And that can also be a stopgap to give FEMA time to assess the damage to see if more assistance is needed.
If that is the case, the governor can request a major disaster declaration which would unlock additional federal dollars.
And unlike the initial emergency declaration, in a major disaster declaration FEMA considers a range of criteria, such as a state’s financial capacity and resources.
Those assessments begin next week.
“There’ll actually be people out there driving around to areas that they can reach, you know, going looking at things with clipboards, writing down the kinds of damages that we’ve seen in these areas, how much money it costs and how many additional resources the state might need in order to address it,” Weber said.
If the region is eligible for major disaster relief, other forms of aid can then come into play — such as cash payments to individuals and public assistance for more long term recovery like repairing infrastructure.
Rep. Bergman is urging counties to assist in those assessments.
“For us to have a chance at securing Individual Assistance and Public Assistance, we need to take an all-hands-on-deck approach,” he wrote in a newsletter from his office on Thursday. “I encourage our leaders in all 12 counties to support this effort as we work together to secure help for our communities.”
These relief efforts kick in after events like the ice storm, but federal hazard mitigation grants have also aimed to reduce the impact of future disasters.
 An uncertain future for FEMA

Uncertainty surrounds FEMA amid the Trump administration’s efforts to cut costs and reshape the federal government. Trump and those in his administration have said they want to drastically reduce – or even eliminate — the agency.
The situation has been constantly changing, but Weber said there have been concrete impacts: “What we have seen is that staff and programs at FEMA are being eliminated, and aid is being slower to arrive even if it’s already been approved.”
Those cuts have reached efforts to prepare for disasters as well. For example, Grist reported earlier this month that FEMA plans to dismantle a program, passed under the first Trump administration, to help communities prepare for disasters before they hit.
FEMA didn’t respond directly to IPR’s questions this week about criteria for a major disaster declaration in northern Michigan or what the damage assessment consists of.
Still, Weber said the big takeaway is that federal aid is meant to supplement what’s already being done, so people can look to local governments and organizations for information and help.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Broken-pole-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 14:10:27.278002

(Photo by Patrick Semansky-Pool/Getty Images)On April 18, 1775, Paul Revere famously rode through the streets of Massachusetts to warn residents about the approach of British troops, which culminated in the Battle of Lexington and Concord that kicked off America’s war for independence.
Now, 250 years later, U.S. Sen. Angus King is giving his own warning over what he sees as the imminent collapse of American democracy under President Donald Trump.
In an interview with writer, historian and Lincoln County resident Heather Cox Richardson, Maine’s independent senator discussed why this inflection point in American history is so resonant today.
“I believe we are in one of the most dangerous places our country has been in since the founding, because what is happening before our eyes is the collapse of the constitutional structure that the framers designed to protect us from the inevitable abuse that comes from the concentration of power,” King said, explaining that the U.S. Constitution purposefully divided power between the Legislature — or Congress — the President and the courts.
“But here’s what’s happening right now,” he said, “is that the executive branch is seizing more and more power.
“There are two levels of things going on here: one is bad and the other is dangerous,” he said. “There are bad things like what [the Department of Government Efficiency] is doing and messing around with Social Security and this sending people to El Salvador. That’s really bad, but what’s dangerous is the way it’s being done, by essentially violating the plain intent of the Constitution, by having the President be the legislator and the executive at the same time, that’s a recipe for the loss of our freedom.”
And for people who are “cheering on his agenda” and saying, “Well, we don’t care that he’s doing all this unconstitutional stuff,” King said, “They’re going to care because eventually the Eye of Sauron is going to turn on them,” referencing the evil, all-powerful symbol in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings.”
And while the courts are “doing pretty well so far” in pushing back, King repeatedly expressed alarm over what he sees as Congress’ abdication of its duty and the complicity of his Republican colleagues.
“What we have is a test between institutional loyalty, constitutional loyalty, and party loyalty. And so my Republican colleagues — who I’m doing everything I can to sort of peel off to say, ‘Enough is enough’ — so far, haven’t been willing to take that step,” he said. “They’re in control of the Senate, they’re in control of the House, and they’re looking at getting their tax bill through and getting their budget bill through, rather than what’s happening to the structure of our government in the process.”
He also said that he believes many Republicans are not speaking up because of Trump’s threat to challenge dissenters in upcoming elections by running primary opponents financed by billionaire advisor Elon Musk.
King also spoke about the frustration among voters, acknowledging the most frequent question he hears is, “I’m mad as hell. What can I do?’”
“They can get together, they can talk to each other, they can reach out to their neighbors,” King said. “They can participate in peaceful demonstrations that indicate to people like me that people want change, that they’re concerned…They also can communicate to our offices.”
He said American people actually have a lot of power and that members of Congress are influenced when they hear stories from constituents about how Trump’s actions are having a real negative impact on their lives — such as someone whose Social Security check didn’t come or a veteran unable to get a medical appointment.
“Believe it or not, anecdotes matter,” King said, “and so when people are in touch with us, if they are specific about what’s going on and what’s affecting them in their real life, that’s the kind of thing that breaks through with members of Congress — that their constituents are being hurt — and that’s one of the reasons I think we may see some progress on this over the next two or three weeks, because the damage that’s being done is just starting to manifest itself out in the communities.”
But King acknowledged he is “an optimist.”
As for Paul Revere, Maine is celebrating his midnight ride with a series of events that will feature the lighting of lanterns and lighthouses throughout the state. Organized by the Maine Semiquincentennial Commission, several of the ceremonies will include the reading of the famous 1861 poem by Portland native Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, “Paul Revere’s Ride,” which concludes:


So through the night rode Paul Revere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm,—
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts (Joe Raedle/Getty Images).For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Matthew Perschall / Louisiana Illuminator)It had been many years since Phyllis Taylor, widow to the creator of the TOPS program, had sat behind the presentation desk of the Louisiana House Education Committee. 
Her late husband, Patrick F. Taylor, a wealthy oilman who had served for many years on the LSU Board of Supervisors, is perhaps best remembered for creating the program that’s now known as the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students. The program began with 183 students that Taylor personally paid tuition for. After this pilot’s success, Taylor convinced the legislature to begin a state-financed version, which inspired similar programs in numerous other states. 
Started in 1989, it pays a significant chunk of tuition costs for qualified Louisiana students who attend college at state colleges and universities. Hundreds of thousands of students have paid for college with TOPS, many who would have otherwise been unable to afford an education. 
Every year, lawmakers debate tweaks to TOPS, some minor, some major. But Phyllis Taylor, a soft-spoken octogenarian philanthropist and one of the richest people in Louisiana, has refrained from weighing in — until this week. 
What piqued Taylor’s interest was House Bill 77 by Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston. It would create a flat rate for each TOPS award amount, rather than having a unique allotment for each school. 
The new rate would mean students at LSU, LSU’s two medical schools and the University of New Orleans would be paying more out of pocket, while students at other Louisiana schools would pay less. 
The bill would also create a higher award amount for high-achieving students. 
In its original state, Turner’s bill – designed to keep high-performing students in Louisiana – would add around $50 million annually to the cost of the TOPS program. That’s not a small sum as the state tightens its belt amid difficult fiscal times. 
“I come to remind everyone that we want, by all means, to preserve TOPS, even if that means that some changes might have to be deferred for a later time, because I realized that the state of Louisiana is going to be under dire fiscal constraints,” Taylor said. 
“There is more need than there is money,” she added. 
Taylor made her position on Turner’s bill clear; she’s unhappy with the proposal that would hurt LSU students, who make up the majority of TOPS recipients in the state. She reminded the committee that while they may want to reward the best and brightest, TOPS was meant to provide an opportunity for all students – not just those with the best ACT scores. 
“Let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water and jeopardize a program as a whole in order to maybe provide for a few that might not be as contributing to our state as we need,” Taylor said. 
The committee unanimously advanced Turner’s legislation, though only after adding amendments that would partially close the gap for students at LSU’s main campus and undergraduate programs at its medical school in New Orleans. Members also lowered the new award amount for high-achieving students from $12,000 to $11,300. 
House Education Chairwoman Laurie Schlegel, R-Metairie, one of the co-authors on Turner’s bill, said she believed the amendments would lower the TOPS cost increase from around $50 million annually to $30 million to $35 million. 
Because it involves spending state money,  the bill must receive a second hearing in the House Appropriations Committee, which oversees the state’s budget. 
Though Appropriations Chairman Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, acknowledged the need to keep the best and brightest in Louisiana, he said it would be very challenging to find the money to fund Turner’s bill, especially as lawmakers are digging into couch cushions to find the change necessary to prevent a K-12 teacher pay cut. 
“Before we go and we commit ourselves to more, I think we need to address what we currently have in front of us,” McFarland said.

‘It wasn’t fair’ 
Turner said his bill is meant to address what he sees as inequities among Louisiana colleges in the amount of TOPS assistance available to their students.
“It wasn’t fair to give this university more and not the other one,” Turner said in an interview.  “All the institutions would be treated equally.” 
The bill is being sold as a market solution: the money follows the student, who can make a financial decision about how they would like to use it. But its critics say that choice could potentially disfavor the LSU flagship campus. 
Currently, LSU students who receive TOPS pay about $5,000 out of pocket annually, while students at Louisiana Tech University, in Turner’s district, pay $5,202. 
If Turner’s bill passes, the base-level amount, which approximately half of Louisiana TOPS students receive, would be $6,000 annually. 
TOPS Performance students, who must have at least a 3.25 GPA and a 23 ACT score, would receive $6,500. TOPS Honors students, with at least a 3.5 GPA and a 27 ACT score, would receive $9,000. The bill’s proposed TOPS Excellence award, the new highest amount, would be $11,300 per qualifying student, who must earn at least a 31 on the ACT and a 3.5 GPA. 
LSU and LSU Health New Orleans students would receive an additional $700 per year on top of whatever award level they earn. 
That would mean baseline TOPS students would pay out of pocket approximately $5,770 to attend LSU and $4,755 to attend Louisiana Tech. 

For some schools with lower tuition and fees, the new award amounts would provide some students with an excess. Under present law, that money has to be applied to students’ room and board expenses, which typically are paid out of pocket. But under a law the legislature approved last year, schools have complete autonomy to raise their fees, meaning they could increase the cost of attendance to meet the new award amount — and add to their revenues. 
Increasing the out-of-pocket costs for LSU students came as a bit of a surprise after the House Education Committee held a series of hearings over the past year in which they repeatedly questioned university administrators about why so many Louisiana students were leaving the state — and why LSU was admitting so many out-of-state students. 
Lawmakers have raised this concern so frequently over the past year that LSU launched new software, LSU Insight, designed to answer questions lawmakers frequently put to the university about where LSU students live and work. They unveiled the new program at a Senate budget hearing earlier this month and with an email to each lawmaker. 
Legislators frequently raised the issue that students in their community were being offered more money to attend Alabama or Ole Miss. They then asked why LSU couldn’t offer more to keep them home — and why LSU offered thousands of dollars in tuition assistance to out of state students at the same time. 
LSU President William Tate said the university profits only about $500 over four years from an in-state student. But even with a generous financial aid package, the margin for each out-of-state student is so high that it subsidizes the tuition assistants for two Louisiana enrollees. 
Increasing out-of-pocket costs for Louisianians at LSU could lead more students to accept generous financial aid packages at its competitors, or to go to schools like Louisiana Tech or the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Any loss of in-state students would ultimately lead LSU to seek more out of state students, compounding the problem lawmakers have raised to them for months.

Feb. 25, 2025. Photo: Jim NeugerOngoing conflict over the state’s protections for transgender people is threatening to thwart the decades-long effort to pass an Equal Rights Amendment, which had been a major focus of late South Portland Rep. Lois Reckitt.
Though LD 260 passed the House with a majority of support, it will require two-thirds of lawmakers to back the measure for it to appear on the ballot.
And at long last, lawmakers came to a resolution as to whether the song “Welcome Home” would become the official state anthem (LD 373) after the House backed down from its support of the tune.
Other votes of note:
Following a positive vote in the Senate last week, members of the House voted 77-72 to pass LD 585, which will amend language in the Efficiency Maine Trust Act so that funds currently dedicated to subsidizing heat pumps could also be used for the state’s depleted electric vehicle incentive program.
Both chambers supported the committee recommendation against legislation that would modify the pending ban on products containing PFAS to exempt certain cookware, such as nonstick pans. During the Senate debate, Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), who opposed the bill, noted that initially the product ban, set to take effect January 2026, included all products with intentionally added PFAS but industry reps have repeatedly “sought to undo that good work.” LD 827 was rejected in the Senate 22-12 and the House 120-22.
Legislation (LD 1185) that raises the age for someone to be able to get married from 17 to 18 passed the House 93-52 and the Senate 23-11, but not without extensive debate in the House. Some critics of the measure pointed to the ability for young people to have abortions or access gender affirming care. However, Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth) pointed out that Maine is the only New England state that hasn’t raised the age to 18 and referenced data from the Bureau of Vital Statistics which showed about half a dozen minors a year are married, almost entirely minor girls marrying older adults. That disparity raises concerns, Kuhn said, adding she wouldn’t want Maine to become an attractive place for people seeking to marry minors. 
Following the House vote last week, the Senate on Tuesday rejected a bill (19-15 vote against) that would have prohibited any state agency from providing informational or educational materials about the COVID-19 vaccine for children under 18. Health committee chair Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York) said while the intent of the bill may be to limit the influence of government in health decisions, he warned that if passed the impacts would be far reaching. Read more about the bill here. 
A resolve directing the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women to study the extent of workforce gender segregation in the state passed the House 82-63 and Senate 22-12. Labor committee co-chair Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor), who supported the bill, said the legislation addresses the persistent issue of “occupational segregation,” which hampers true gender equity. However, critic Rep. Joseph Underwood (R-Presque Isle) said the bill represents the perfect definition of “identity politics.”

The House and Senate both voted to back the committee’s recommendation against a bill that would repeal a measure authorizing the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to potentially grant a permit for the development of an offshore wind port on Sears Island. The bill, LD 735, would also impose limits on who could propose similar legislation in the future. 
Both chambers also voted to accept the committee recommendation against LD 969, which would direct the Emergency Medical Services’ Board to adopt rules to allow municipalities to conduct or host emergency medical services licensing training. Bill sponsor Rep. Cheryl Golek (D-Harpswell) said that 15 of Maine’s counties are “ambulance deserts” and argued the bill would allow for much-needed training opportunities for volunteer medics but members of the committee said this bill is not the vehicle to solve that problem.
These bills also passed: LD 94, “An Act to Eliminate Miscarriage Reporting Requirements;” LD 415, “An Act to Support Hunger Prevention in Maine;” LD 815, “An Act to Provide Funding for Respite Care and Supplemental Services Provided by the Family Caregiver Support Program;” LD 905 “An Act to Clarify the Process to Transfer Funds Resulting from the Expiration of Unused Kilowatt-hour Credits to Be Used to Provide Assistance to Low-income Electricity Customers;” LD 1195, “An Act to Amend the Provisions of the Maine Workers’ Compensation Act of 1992 Governing Requirements for Self-insurers;” LD 678, “An Act to Provide for the 2025 and 2026 Allocations;” and LD 1240, “An Act to Align the Schedules for Climate Change Protection Plans and Grid-enhancing Technology Reviews with the Integrated Grid Planning Process,” among others.
Senate votes
Members of the Senate voted Tuesday to confirm Gigi Guyton Thompson of Peaks Island, Deborah Neuman of Hampden, and Daniel Piltch of Freeport to the Maine Retirement Savings Board.
The Senate on Thursday voted 21-13 to pass LD 143, which would provide an annual allocation of $6.18 million for family planning services, which include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. Such funding is not used for abortions. 
Providers have said this funding is particularly crucial given years of stagnant state funding in addition to the Trump administration’s recent freeze on Title X, the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services. 
House votes
Members of the House on Thursday voted 74-69 in support of a proposed constitutional amendment to establish that all Maine residents have equal rights under the law. Legislators for decades have pressed for an Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution but have so far fallen short. In order to be placed on the ballot for voters to decide on, LD 260 will ultimately need to secure two-thirds support of both chambers in reenactment votes. 
Sponsor Rep. Holly Sergent (D-York) said the U.S. Constitution “began with a narrow vision of to whom equal rights were given. But our national and state constitutions are living, evolving and expanding pronouncements of what Americans believe. Throughout our history, our constitutions have gradually redefined who is worthy of all of the rights to be bestowed and who can be excluded, who is viewed as less than human.” LD 260, she said, “sets Maine as a beacon that it proudly affirms the protections of the Maine Human Rights Act and embeds them in our constitution.”
But critics described the bill as a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” that would “hurt biological women” (Rep. Katrina Smith of Palmero and Rep. John Eder of Waterboro, respectively).
Legislators voted this week to pass LD 875, which provides $4 million dollars this year and next to fund essential services for victims of domestic violence. As an emergency measure, it needs to be enacted by two-thirds of lawmakers in order to be made available immediately. The House voted 140-0 and it now advances to the Senate.
Republican Alicia Collins of Sidney was the only representative to vote against LD 468, which would provide an additional $1.2 million per year to the Fund to Address Food Insecurity and Provide Nutritional Incentives, which supports programs that allow low-income Mainers to use their benefits to buy produce from farmers. More on that here.
Members of the House voted 75-68 to back the committee’s recommendation against LD 717, “An Act to Amend the Maine Criminal Code Governing Restitution to Include the Costs of All Analyses of Suspected Illegal Drugs.”

Authorities responded “almost immediately,” and “engaged, neutralized, and apprehended” the shooter, Tallahassee Police Department Chief Lawrence Revell said during a press conference Thursday afternoon, joined by officials from the FBI, FSU Police, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and university administrators.
Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare said two patients from the shooting are expected to be discharged Friday, while three are in good condition and another remains in fair condition.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)There have been additional resignations at the embattled Hope Florida Foundation, the nonprofit affiliated with Hope Florida, the initiative launched by First Lady Casey DeSantis.
Hope Florida Foundation President Joshua Hay announced Thursday that Tallahassee attorney Mohammad Jazil, who had been working with the foundation on completing its delinquent paperwork, had submitted his resignation.
“I know his name has come up regarding some things but, nonetheless, in my interactions, I’ve had pleasurable, nothing short of pleasurable experiences with him working on drafting the documents, getting actions cured, and also just trying to sort of brainstorm it on how we mitigate these instances of noncompliance going. So, thank you,” Hay said.
Hay was referencing comments made by House Health Care Budget Committee Chair Rep. Alex Andrade that he was “flabbergasted” to learn Jazil was working with the foundation to produce documents nonprofits are required to produce but that the board had not. The House has been probing the finances and other problems involving the foundation.
Jazil is a private attorney who frequently represents the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis in litigation and also served as an attorney for the political committee Keep Florida Clean, which campaigned against last year’s pot-legalization proposed constitutional amendment. The committee was run by James Uthemeir, former chief of staff to Ron DeSantis. Uthemeir is now state attorney general.
The Hope Florida Foundation received a $10 million one-time “donation” from health care giant Centene, part of a $67 million settlement reached with the state for Medicaid overpayments. The foundation gave $5 million grants to Secure Florida’s Future, a nonprofit tied to the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and Save our Society another political committee. Within days, those groups made contributions to keep Florida Clean.
Hay announced Jazil’s resignation during the second part of a virtual Hope Florida Foundation board of directors meeting. He also announced the resignation of Jake Farmer from the board during the first part of the virtual meeting. Jazil and Farmer’s resignations followed news that Hope Florida director Erik Dellenback is stepping down in May.
The board’s virtual meeting was cut short  after members of the public participating posted images of Nazi symbols and pornography as well as racial slurs. Unable to control the flow of images and sounds being shared, the board recessed for several hours before reconvening.
Hay said during the second part of the meeting that he would discuss with the foundation’s accounting firm whether there was any “illicit use of funds” and, if so, look at a potential “clawback” of those funds. 
Before the forced meeting recess, Andrade told the board its nonprofit status was in jeopardy because 80% of all the funds the it had disbursed were for political purposes. “I believe that will jeopardize your 501(c)(3) status if you as the board do not take the proper steps to recoup those funds,” the Pensacola legislator told the group.

(Maskot/Getty Images)Headphones on and intently staring at his screen, Hayden sat at his table reading about ice cream. He was totally engrossed in the test’s content, his lips moving  silently with the narrator’s voice.
Some of my 5th graders  sat at single desks to better focus as they read, others wore unplugged headphones to block out noise, and still others like Hayden readied their text-to-speech (TTS) settings on their devices to begin their read-along sessions.
Each student had the tools and options they needed to be successful in this most important task: reading.
When I walked by to check on Hayden, he gave me a thumbs up as he began answering explicit and inferential questions, a tough skill for any 5th grader.
Students like Hayden with learning differences make up about 23% of all students in Arkansas. Once they’ve put in the work to learn how to use tools like TTS, the results are remarkable.
Texthelp tools like Read&Write and Equatio, which are  provided by the Arkansas Department of Education’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education, help bridge the learning and literacy gaps for  students in grades 3-12.
Research shows that students with learning differences demonstrate increased comprehension scores when using text-to-speech technology on reading tests. This includes students with a range of learning differences, including dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and vision impairment.
The Arkansas Teaching, Learning & Assessment System (ATLAS), which is administered each spring, was designed to assess students on state standards for math, science, reading, language, and writing.
Cohorts of teachers vetted the assessment prior to its adoption in the 2023-24 academic year to ensure its alignment with Arkansas standards and rigor in the question types. However, assistive technology that is part of daily instruction in a classroom like mine is not allowed on state testing for students on Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) like Hayden.
As of 2023, 30 states allow for text-to-speech access on state testing for students with documented disabilities who use such  resources in their daily learning. Arkansas should join these states so every student has the opportunity to consistently use the same assistive technology across their daily tasks and the state test that measures what they know and can do.
Providing this crucial learning tool to Arkansas students on the ATLAS test would boost their reading confidence and reduce stress associated with high-stakes testing. For example, one of my students uses speech-to-text to capture his ideas on longer writing assignments, thereby overcoming the negative impacts of dysgraphia, a neurological condition in which someone has difficulty turning their thoughts into written language. He is able to bridge this neurological barrier and successfully express himself.
Students like Hayden find success in my classroom by leveraging the tools and resources available to them, which rewards  their effort and fuels their desire to succeed. By removing the barrier for Hayden to decode words, I can evaluate what he comprehends in the writing he produces and adjust my instruction accordingly. I can also support Hayden  in improving his decoding skills through individualized reading interventions, so that he eventually won’t  need the text-to-speech tool.
Having consistency in students’ use of assistive technology also helps teachers like me, who rely on assessment data to adjust instruction and implement interventions and supports. I spend time using this data to understand the strengths and weaknesses of incoming students each fall.
If TTS is allowed on state testing, we can ensure our instructional shifts are effective and efficient from year to year.
With the support of TTS, Hayden is growing more and more confident and is able to answer complex questions at grade level. All students should have the opportunity to demonstrate their learning in a way that does not create feelings of inadequacy and failure.  Giving students access to  these tools on state tests would empower them and help them  reach their full potential.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Student-with-headphones-Getty-041825-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-18 14:10:27.278002

Avelo announced earlier this month the airline has signed a partnership for a long-term charter program with ICE.
The airline will open a base at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (AZA) in Arizona for the ICE operations beginning May 12, according to the airline. Flights will be both domestic and international to support the deportation efforts, which Avelo crews will carry out via three dedicated Boeing 737-800 aircrafts.
These charter flights will not include commercial passengers.
“We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,” Avelo Airlines Founder and CEO Andrew Levy said. “We also flew these charters under the Biden administration. Regardless of the administration or party affiliation, as a U.S. flag carrier when our country calls and requests assistance our practice is to say yes.”
It’s a move that’s lead to backlash and protests. More than 30,000 people have signed a petition started last week by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition in Connecticut. Tweed-New Haven Regional Airport (HVN) is the airline’s largest operating base.
In the aviation industry, a “base” is an airport at which an airline permanently houses aircraft and crew and operates routes. Low-cost carriers like Avelo tend to operate with a “point-to-point” network with bases, often at smaller airports to reduce costs.
A “hub” has more to do with an airline’s style of operations, as hub airports in the “hub-and-spoke” model are where airlines choose to connect passengers through — more common with full-service, legacy carriers and major airports.
Avelo’s three operating bases in North Carolina — located at Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU), Concord-Padgett Regional Airport (USA) near Charlotte, and Wilmington International Airport (ILM) — will continue to be used strictly for commercial travel, according to the airline. The agreement with ICE will not directly affect operations in North Carolina.
The airline, which had previous incarnations as charter carriers known as “Casino Express” and “Xtra Airways” was rechristened as Avelo in 2021.
Nikki Marín Baena, co-founder and co-director of the immigrant rights advocacy group Siembra NC, said the partnership could make immigrants question whether they’re safe in North Carolina.
“It just adds to that sense of stress and the sense of fear and not knowing you know what’s going to come tomorrow,” she said.
Spanish-language media outlets have covered the agreement, leading to more worries for Latino immigrants, according to Baena.
Between the three airports across the state, Avelo has plans to operate flights for more than two dozen routes from North Carolina. New additions would connect the airports with locations in Michigan, New York, and the Bahamas.
Media teams for the North Carolina airports redirected NC Newsline to Avelo.
“With this, Avelo will open a base at AZA with Avelo pilots, flight attendants and aircraft technicians, as well as appropriate local leaders. We expect to begin hiring locally for these positions immediately. Current Avelo Crewmembers (employees) will have the first option to transfer to our new AZA base,” a spokesperson for Avelo told NC Newsline in a statement.
The airline did not indicate whether any crew members from North Carolina would move to the Arizona base.
Avelo recently cancelled six flights out of Concord, WCNC reported on Friday, due to “poor performance and low bookings.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2152058571-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 13:13:12.617514

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Investors watching the stock market jump up and down more times than a 6-month-old Lab puppy in recent weeks were able to take a breath as markets closed for Good Friday.
But one day off doesn’t make up for the stress and uncertainty and expectations of more market chaos next week. Investment experts from American Century Investments, which manages the Kansas 529 Plan, offer advice heard during past market downturns — diversify.
“The only or best defense in volatile economic and market environments like this is diversification,” said Rich Weiss, senior vice president and chief investment officer, multi-asset strategies, at American Century Investments. “You never know where the ball is going to land and which investments get favored or which suffer. You know, the markets hate uncertainty. It’s anathema to the market more than anything, and this is toxic uncertainty, which is a term I borrowed from Scott Galloway.”
Weiss, who brings a dry wit to talking about investment strategies and what’s happening in the volatile stock market, offered his assessment of what the country will see with the impacts of on-again, off-again tariffs.
“Externalities, or these shocks to the market, whether they’re acts of God or acts of man — COVID, earthquakes, wars etc. — these things happen on occasion,” he said. “They’re not forecastable, necessarily, although in this particular case a lot of the volatility could properly be ascribed to the new administration. The uncertainty, specifically in this case, is really on essentially the president himself and his close advisors. And it’s not necessarily the tariff program, but it’s the process by which they’re implementing it. I hesitate to call it trade policy, because that word ‘policy’ lends a degree of credibility or validity to it, which it doesn’t seem to have. It seems a little more capricious at times.”
 
  Rich Weiss, senior vice president & chief investment officer, multi-asset strategies, American Century Investments
Market expectations uncertain
Weiss said in his 40 years in the investment world, he’s never seen the Federal Reserve Board of Governors use the term “placeholder” in their minutes.
“The Fed Governors issue forecasts as part of their job for the economy, inflation, etc.,” Weiss said. “Several of the Fed governors used the word or term — we’re going to issue a ‘placeholder’ for GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth — because even they have no idea which way this thing is going. So where do we land? We have an 85% probability right now of a slowdown or a recession. We’ve lumped them all together, so it’s not necessarily a recession but clearly an economic slowdown. I think you’re seeing that already in the numbers.”
It’s the uncertainty that makes it hard to forecast. Even United Airlines, Weiss said, came out and said it was issuing two forecasts, something rarely seen.
“Which is a place a lot of us are at because it’s so dependent on the magnitude and duration of the tariff program, and whether that indeed pushes us into a full-blown trade war with China or even some of our other allies,” he said.
Right now, many forecasters are predicting a recession, a prolonged economic decline.
 
  Evan Mayhew, vice president, national accounts, at American Century Investments, said 529 accounts offer flexibility to adapt for volatile markets. (Submitted)
529 plans offer flexibility
It’s difficult to give general advice in the current situation, but there are a couple of good rules to follow, said Weiss and Evan Mayhew, vice president, national accounts. Mayhew manages the Kansas 529 Plan.
Understanding your own tolerance for risk is important, and then diversification of stocks, bonds and other assets mean that if the market moves down in one of those areas, other investments can stabilize accounts, both said. Weiss said to consider geographical diversification, as some international markets are stronger than the U.S. market right now.
The Kansas 529 Plan, which is an investment tool to save for children’s college education, has become more flexible over the years, allowing investors to choose their level of risk, among other things, Mayhew said.
“Originally, they were set up just for college savings,” he said. “Now there’s the option for you to use it on K through 12, also for post secondary. There’s a new provision that went into effect last year that allows unused funds to be rolled into a Roth IRA. So really, it’s identifying what’s the objective of those goals and then investing appropriately.”
If 529 participants are looking at using funds to pay for kindergarten through 12th-grade educational costs, they would probably be more conservative, Mayhew said, because of a close timeframe.
“If you’ve got a longer runway, then look at something potentially more aggressive that you’re comfortable with,” he said. “We have multiple investment options.”
During economic downturns in the past, Mayhew said most clients continue their automatic payments to their 529 accounts. They typically see only a slight pull-back that corresponds to market volatility.
“We’re looking at reports on a weekly basis of investor behavior and actually over the last week, our purchases and new accounts are actually on par with last year,” he said.
Looking back at other economic downturns, such as in 2008, Mayhew said they tend to see more of a slowdown in lump-sum payments, rather than in automatic investments.
Weiss said there is a risk of “abandonment” of accounts when the economy is down, meaning customers take their money out. Sometimes they do it voluntarily, but sometimes job losses and other economic factors contribute to that decision.
 
Impossible to predict
Whether investing in a 529 Plan, mutual funds or other vehicles, the market right now is impossible to predict, Weiss said.
“It’s fraught with peril if you rush to sell or, on the other hand, buy on the dips because you could potentially catch a falling knife, as they say, by doing that,” he said. “Examine your overall asset allocation, making sure it’s still roughly in line with your specific long-term goals and objectives. These are the tried and true principles of investing. We’re not knee-jerk reacting to daily movements.”
Risk, Weiss said, is not something to consider after the markets are in a fall.
“Risk is not something you react to after the fact,” he said. “It’s something you should address up front before you ever make your first investment to make sure that you can, for example, tolerate a 20, 30, 40% loss in stocks in the short term.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/stockmarket-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 14:10:27.278002

As defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, the term “hemp” is a cannabis plant with a no more than 0.3% concentration of the chemical that results in a high, known as THC.
According to the report,  which was released on Thursday, South Dakota farmers planted 3,900 acres of hemp – a 22% increase from 2023. They harvested 3,700 acres, up 27.6%. Most of that growth came from hemp grown for fiber, a product for which South Dakota reigns as the nation’s top supplier.
Texas farmers planted 4,900 acres, a 1,860% increase from last year. Only 1,500 acres of that was harvested, though.
Former Democratic state lawmaker Oren Lesmeister, a rancher from Parade, championed the bills that created South Dakota’s hemp industry. He now serves on the South Dakota Industrial Hemp Association’s board of directors. He said Texas’ numbers mean little if farmers do not have a place to process their hemp. 
“We’re kicking a– and taking names when it comes to production and processing,” Lesmeister said. 
South Dakota leads the nation in hemp processing and the production of hemp fiber, according to the report.  
There were 13.6 million pounds of hemp harvested for fiber in South Dakota last year. That’s a 14% decrease, even as the number of acres harvested,  3,550, increased by 22%. Every harvested pound was processed, according to the report. About 23% of the 59 million pounds of hemp processed in the U.S. was processed in South Dakota
The mismatch between pounds harvested and acres planted is the result of lower per-acre yields for farmers. The average yield in the state dropped sharply by 30% in 2024, to 3,840 pounds per acre. Despite that, the value of South Dakota’s fiber hemp climbed to $3.54 million, a 50% year-over-year increase, buoyed by a 73% rise in price per pound.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector) Gidley's bill that would require the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public K-12 schools passed the House on April 17, 2025.The Alabama House of Representatives Thursday passed a bill requiring public K-12 schools to display the Ten Commandments.
HB 178, sponsored by Rep. Mark Gidley, R-Hokes Bluff, passed the chamber 88-11. It requires schools to display the Ten Commandments in an entry way; a common area  an entry way or common areas like cafeterias, and in classrooms where the history of the United States is taught. The displays must be at least 11-by-14 inches in size and include text saying the commandments are “a key part of the Judeo-Christian religious and moral tradition that shaped Western Civilization and ultimately the founding of the United States,” as well as other arguments claiming they are foundational texts.

Displays would be made based on the availability of donations for them.

Gidley, a pastor, said in the House Thursday that  the country was founded on the principles of the Hebrew-derevied text, which makes it historical.
“This is about returning foundational principles to schools to be taught,” he said.
Alabama voters in 2018 approved a constitutional amendment allowing the Ten Commandments to be displayed on public property but not mandating such displays. Federal courts have allowed the displays of the Ten Commandments in historical contexts in schools but not as religious or moral displays. Local school boards do not have to use their state-allocated funds to purchase a poster to display, Gidley said. 
The legislation does not list any sanctions for schools that do not comply.
Louisiana passed similar legislation in 2024, but a federal district court ruled it unconstitutional in November, citing the separation of church and state. Louisiana’s law, unlike Gidley’s, required the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every classroom. 
Rep. Patrick Sellers, D-Pleasant Grove, was the only Democrat to support the legislation. Sellers, pastor of Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Birmingham, said the values in the Ten Commandments should be in schools.
“These are principles that our children need, and even if it’s just looking at it on the wall to remind them of what they are and how they should live from day to day,” Sellers said. “That’s what’s missing in our schools. That’s what’s missing in our homes, that’s what’s missing in our families.”
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, supported the legislation, but said putting the Ten Commandments in schools would not make more Christians. 
“As a Christian, we should be salt and light in the world. And I think that happens through relationships,” Garrett said. “But legislative mandates are not going to renew minds and change hearts.”
Rep. Marilyn Lands, D-Huntsville, said some of the commandments may not be age appropriate for young school children. 
“I think that the 10 commandments have their place, but I don’t know that we need to mandate that they be in our schools,” she said. “I think we teach our children well in our homes, and I think we have churches to teach them, but I’m not sure that they belong in our schools.”
Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said putting the Christian text in schools would disrespect other religions. 
“All I am saying is there are other faiths, those people deserve to practice whatever faith you practice,” Moore said.
The bill moves to the Senate. Sen. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, has a companion bill that was approved by the Senate Education Policy Committee last week.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-18 16:23:53+00:00,CT Mirror,"Trump is shifting cybersecurity to the states, but many aren’t prepared",Madyson Fitzgerald | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/18/trump-cybersecurity-states/,CT passed a law to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting technology investment.,"For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.” Cuts to federal resources In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added. Lawmakers step up In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”Stateline reporter Madyson Fitzgerald can be reached at mfitzgerald@stateline.org.

CHICAGO — Federal agents asked state Sen. Emil Jones III to wear a wire against a politically connected hospital CEO and his fellow lawmakers in Springfield, the senator testified Thursday in his own defense at his federal corruption trial.

Jones, D-Chicago, said he was prepared to cooperate with the FBI in a widespread investigation into public corruption in Illinois and attended a handful of meetings with agents and prosecutors with the intent to do so before he ultimately was charged in September 2022.

But the agents, Jones said, asked him “to do things that I was not willing to do” — including wearing a wire. The senator struggled to articulate the other requests the agents made, even after U.S. District Judge Andrea Wood stepped in to restate his attorney’s question.

“Wearing a wire and — I don’t know how to describe it, judge,” Jones said.

The senator took the witness stand for a third day Thursday in his trial over alleged bribes he agreed to take from a red-light camera entrepreneur-turned-FBI witness in exchange for limiting legislation he had proposed that worried the red-light camera industry — and lying to agents about it.

Not too long into questioning from his own attorney, Jones’ testimony was halted for more than an hour after he named Tim Egan, the CEO of Chicago’s Roseland Hospital in Jones’ South Side District, as someone the feds wanted him to help investigate.

""Agent (Timothy) O’Brien basically instructed me that he wanted me to wear a wire on Tim Egan and he wanted me to come up with a scenario to entrap Tim Egan,” Jones said.

Prosecutors immediately objected, which was followed by a lengthy sidebar discussion between Wood and attorneys on both sides. The arguments were intentionally masked by loud white noise in the courtroom, but Wood ultimately told jurors to disregard Jones’ answer and the senator’s lawyer, Vic Henderson, told his client to refrain from “naming names.”

Egan, who’s spent nearly a decade as a Cook County Democratic Party committeeman, has not been charged with any crimes. But Roseland Hospital has been mentioned several times throughout the trial.

Jones apparently made unsuccessful efforts to get his former intern hired there in the summer of 2019, though the senator instead connected him with Omar Maani, a co-founder of Chicago-based red-light camera company SafeSpeed. Maani, who was cooperating with the government, hired the former intern, Christopher Katz, which the feds say constituted part of a bribe.

Roseland Hospital also threw Jones an annual campaign fundraiser, which in 2019 was scheduled for August at a White Sox game. With his FBI-provided recording devices rolling during a dinner the month before, Maani offered Jones a contribution for the event. Eventually, the senator named a number — “five grand” — which became the other purported bribe Jones allegedly agreed to.

Prosecutors say it doesn’t matter that Maani never gave Jones any money or that Jones never amended his legislation in the way Maani wanted him to, the agreement is what counts.

But Jones said that while he was suspicious of Maani and his “used-car salesman” vibe, he fully believed that he and Maani never made an agreement. He said the same to FBI agents when they knocked on his door the morning of Sept. 24, 2019, who told him they were investigating his colleague, then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago, who’d connected him to Maani earlier that summer.

Five months later, however, Jones’ attorney received a letter from the U.S. Attorney’s office informing him that charges were imminent. In February 2019, Jones sat down with the feds twice within the span of a week. That’s when he was asked to wear a wire on Egan after identifying different people in photos and initialing them.

They also showed Jones “snippets” of Maani’s secretly recorded videos, he said.

But then the COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench into Jones’s plans for cooperating with the government. On Thursday, the senator noted he wasn’t “able to go to restaurants and eat dinner with folks,” which limited opportunities for covert FBI operations.

The next time Jones met with FBI agents was in September 2021, when he and his then-lawyer were allowed to listen to all of the recordings Maani had made in addition to tape of the FBI agents’ interview with Jones on which the feds allege the senator lied.

Jones on Thursday said he left that meeting knowing “I was gonna fight these charges,” which were still a year away from being filed. The senator said that after spending eight or so hours listening to the tapes, he “felt the government was misleading me” in the February 2020 meeting when they played selected portions of the recordings.

""You hear Omar basically trying to set me up,” Jones said of Maani. “And you hear me pushing back on him, trying to change the subject, all that.”

Over the next 12 months, Jones met with the feds three more times. The senator testified that the FBI was still hoping he’d agree to wear a wire during both a February 2022 Zoom videoconference and a downtown Chicago meeting in June of that year.

Asked Thursday why he kept attending the meetings even though he’d already decided to fight the charges, Jones said he did so at the direction of his lawyer — and because he was worried the feds would charge him before the November 2022 election, though he ran unopposed.

“Did you expect to hear anything different?” his lawyer Henderson asked.

""Only thing I did hear were things that I was not willing to do,” Jones said. “Wear wires on my colleagues.”

“And why were you not willing to wear a wire?” Henderson asked.

Jones exhaled deeply before answering.

“Because — if,” he said before sighing again. “I don’t know how to answer that question.”

Feds persist in their pursuit of Jones

The senator met with the feds one final time in August 2022 in a brief meeting in which he was informed the government was moving forward with plans to charge him.

Jones was charged on three counts the following month, but in November of that year, he was reelected to a four-year term in the General Assembly.

The senator was stripped of his committee chairmanship and leadership roles in the Senate but has refused to step down in the last 2 ½ years. The last sitting lawmaker who took his federal corruption case to trial was then-state Rep. Derrick Smith, D-Chicago, in 2014. And the last state official to take the witness stand at their own trial was then-state Rep. Patricia Bailey, D-Chicago, in 2005. Both were convicted.

Deciding to testify in his own defense was a risky move, as it opened Jones up to grueling cross-examination from prosecutors. Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany Ardam on Thursday attempted over and over to impeach the senator’s prior testimony, pointing out inconsistencies between the previously played secret recordings and what Jones told the jury.

Ardam questioned why Jones would portray what the government showed to him at one of the February 2020 meetings as “information shared with you” and act as if the “snippets” the agents showed were a surprise.

“The truth is you were at all of these meetings,” Ardam said.

“Yes,” Jones said.

“So you know everything that was said,” Ardam said.

“I can’t remember everything that was said,” Jones replied.

At one of those February 2020 meetings, prosecutors and one of the case agents have already told the jury that Jones acknowledged making an agreement with Maani, contrary to what he told the FBI in September 2019.

Read more: Feds set to rest case in Sen. Emil Jones III red-light camera bribery trial

The senator earlier Thursday told his own attorney a few different times that he never signed or initialed a document indicating that he was recanting his previous statements.

But Ardam waded into that territory herself.

“And you acknowledged you made a deal with Omar Maani,” she said.

“No. I. Did. Not,” Jones answered.

Ardam cast doubt on Jones’ earlier explanation on the witness stand that even though Maani made him “uncomfortable,” he still met with him because he was following a directive from Sandoval. As chair of the Senate Transportation committee, Sandoval had blocked Jones’ bill that called for a study of red-light camera systems across the state.

Jones had called Sandoval “intimidating” and “a bully” — but Ardam pointed out that in the recording of the dinner where between him, Sandoval and Maani at a suburban steakhouse in June 2025, they were cracking jokes and seemed relaxed.

""You were only intimidated by him at times?” Ardam asked.

""Yes,” Jones answered.

Later, Ardam asked whether Jones had trepidation about dealing with Sandoval in other ways.

“I never said I was scared of Senator Sandoval,” Jones said. “I said he could be a bully at times and he could be intimidating. I was never scared of him.”

Ardam also pointed out that Jones’ contention earlier in his testimony that Sandoval was arrested on Sept. 24, 2019, wasn’t true; in fact, federal agents had executed search warrants on his home and offices. He began cooperating and later pleaded guilty to bribery and tax fraud charges.

Jones held to his repeated claim, seemingly confused by her questions.

“And you know he’s no longer with us, he’s deceased,” Ardam said. “So you know that he can’t dispute anything you're saying today?”

“Yes,” Jones replied.

But Ardam had some mixups of her own. To catch Jones in a lie over his claim Wednesday that he’d never had one of his bills die on the Senate floor, the prosecutor pointed out that in 2019, roughly 30 bills that Jones had introduced died at the end of session. As Jones attempted to tell her, that’s different than the rare and fairly embarrassing scenario in which a senator allows for a bill to be called for a vote only to see it fail to garner the minimum number of votes for passage.

Ardam also spent time suggesting that Jones benefitted from nepotism as his father, Emil Jones Jr., had been a longtime legislator and served as president of the Illinois Senate from 2003 until 2009.

“You were elected in 2008?” Ardam asked, after reminding the jury of Jones’ testimony that “ever since I was a child,” he’d wanted to be a state senator like his father.

“Yes,” Jones said.

“You didn’t tell the jury how that happened, did you?” Ardam said, before falsely asserting that Jones was appointed to his father’s seat when the elder Jones announced his retirement in August 2008.

“Well I replaced him on the ballot,” the senator explained.

“So somebody had to replace him in the Senate,” Ardam said. “Were you appointed to fill your father’s seat from August 2008 to November 2008?”

“No,” Jones said.

“You were not?” Ardam asked skeptically.

Jones and his father caught heat when the Senate president withdrew from the ballot after he’d won his 2008 primary election and later withdrew from the ballot and advocated for his son to replace him. But Jones III wasn’t sworn in to the Senate until January 2009 after his father’s term officially ended.

After acknowledging to jurors that trial has stretched longer than originally planned, Judge Wood canceled trial on Good Friday while the attorneys work through final jury instructions. Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday.

Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez held his mother in a tight embrace and wept following his release from the Leon County Jail Thursday evening, where the U.S. citizen was held after his arrest for illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien.”
An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.
The pair didn’t reunite until the evening, after Lopez-Gomez’s first court appearance earlier in the day. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans ruled Thursday morning that she lacked jurisdiction to release him because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him for 48 hours.
After Riggans’ inspection of his Social Security card and birth certificate, which an advocate waved in the courtroom, the judge said she found no probable cause for the charge.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
The arrest record the trooper filed states that Lopez-Gomez had said he was in the country illegally but that he had handed over his ID. There was no mention of the Social Security card on the arrest report. However, Lopez-Gomez told the Phoenix he had shown the trooper a copy of his Social Security card and Georgia state ID.
The HSI agent who took Lopez-Gomez to Wendy’s directed questions to a spokesperson, who didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment or questions as of this publication.

After the reunion with his mom, Lopez-Gomez returned to the parking lot of the jail, where 30 protesters had been demanding his release. They met him with cheers and hugs.
Lopez-Gomez will have to return to the Leon County Courthouse on May 6. He was charged under a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention.
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also made their first appearances on the same charge on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)A national real estate company will have to pay back nearly $100,000 in fees charged to local residents who applied to live at any of its Rhode Island housing properties under a settlement announced Thursday by the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General.
The agreement comes four months after the AG’s office sued A.R. Building Co. in state Superior Court, alleging the Philadelphia company violated consumer protection laws by forcing prospective tenants to pay “excessive” application and screening fees. 
The state’s December lawsuit alleged the company violated Rhode Island’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act and a new state law which took effect on Jan. 1 that limits fees landlords can charge to prospective tenants. The 19-page complaint lists three anonymous consumers — identified as A, B, and C — as examples, but the AG’s office estimates nearly 400 applicants paid fees during the 13-month timeframe of the complaint, said Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for the AG.
The state also claimed in its complaint that the company violated state and federal fair housing protections by requiring a more difficult application process for applicants with disabilities.
As part of the settlement, which resolves all components of the complaint, A.R. Building will also pay $114,750 to the state for a total monetary compensation of $213,000. And, it has agreed to stop charging application fees to residents looking to live in any of its five local housing complexes, while allowing prospective tenants to avoid screening fees by submitting their own documents as part of the application.
“We will hold accountable any entity that attempts to take advantage of consumers by implementing illegal barriers to finding a home, a practice made all the more egregious by the fact that we are in the midst of a severe housing crisis,” Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement. “With this settlement, not only are we returning nearly $100,000 to Rhode Island consumers, we are barring this company from further engaging in behaviors that we allege are illegal and discriminatory. We must make it easier, not harder, for people to obtain safe, affordable housing, and that’s why my Office will continue to hold accountable bad actors who place profits over people. Let this settlement serve as a warning to those who may still be engaging in illegal housing practices; we won’t stand for it, and we won’t hesitate to take further action.”
Michael Gamboli, a partner at Partridge Snow & Hahn LLP in Providence representing A.R. Building Co., did not immediately return inquiries for comment Friday.
The company owns more than 800 apartments, condominiums and townhouses across five complexes in Rhode Island: East Providence’s Kettle Point and Newport Avenue Apartments, Dowling Village in Smithfield, Highland Hills in Cumberland and Reynolds Farm in North Kingstown.
State residents who paid application or administrative fees as part of an application to any of the local properties from Jan. 1 2024 to Jan. 30, 2025, should contact the property manager where they applied to receive a refund. Applicants have until July 1 to claim their refunds; unclaimed money will be donated to the Special Olympics of Rhode Island.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
Budget restrictions, staff issues and AI are threats to states’ cybersecurity

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.



The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Governments often struggle with massive new IT projects

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
Rhode Island state government hit by major cyberattack

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.


New Mexico developed a three-year cybersecurity plan, which it published in 2023. The plan includes four long-term goals:
• to manage and monitor information systems, data and networks
• to enhance cybersecurity resilience
• to develop statewide cybersecurity and risk management strategies
• to train and develop the cybersecurity workforce
 


In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) is calling on nature lovers to help protect some of the state’s most vulnerable shorebirds, including the federally threatened piping plover and the state-endangered American oystercatcher.
DNREC’s Division of Fish and Wildlife will host a training session for prospective volunteers from 10 a.m. to noon on Saturday, May 3, at the Officers Club Mess Hall in Cape Henlopen State Park.
The training is part of the agency’s annual effort to monitor and safeguard beach-nesting birds during the busy summer season.
Volunteers play a key role in DNREC’s conservation strategy, acting as on-the-ground monitors at designated nesting areas along Delaware’s beaches.
Their primary task is to educate the public about temporary beach closures and the importance of minimizing human disturbances that can threaten the nesting success of shorebirds.
The training will kick off with refreshments and a slideshow presentation, followed by a discussion about the monitoring program and volunteer responsibilities.
If weather allows, participants will also have the chance to head out to the Point at Cape Henlopen to spot shorebirds in their natural habitat. Binoculars will be provided, though attendees are encouraged to bring their own.
Submitting an interest form ahead of time is encouraged, but walk-ins are welcome. Park entrance fees will be waived for all training participants.

(Photo illustration from Getty Images)All that glitters is not gold.
Republican leaders are proposing three separate bills to give gambling a stronghold in South Carolina — one to legalize casinos and two to legalize online sports betting. A House Ways and Means subcommittee will consider two of them Tuesday.
The casino bill, H. 4176, is authored by Rep. Gary Brewer and co-sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Weston Newton and House Labor, Commerce, and Industry Chairman Bill Herbkersman, among others.
The online sports betting bills, S. 444 and H. 3625, are authored by Republicans.
Low-income individuals always get the brunt end of gambling because their financial stress makes them more prone to the risk of repeated gambling that leads to addiction.
In that sense, jobs are created by plundering the most vulnerable of our neighbors.
When video poker proliferated in South Carolina in the 1990s, we learned all too painfully about the increase in bankruptcy, domestic violence, divorce, mental health issues, and even suicide.
In turn, taxpayers bear the burden of those costs as the state must intervene with welfare, health care, criminal justice and the like, while the gambling profiteers dance their way to the bank.
Do we really want towns like Biloxi, Mississippi, in South Carolina, that are havens for crime and corruption?
I hope we learned our lesson with video poker.
The opening paragraph of the casino bill says, “The General Assembly finds that casino gaming is not consistent with nor compatible with the economic, labor, or tourism industry profile for most communities in South Carolina.”
I couldn’t agree more — but would say that principle applies to the entire state.
Casinos are predatory and placing one in Santee or along the economically depressed Interstate 95 corridor blatantly disregards the social disparities faced by our neighbors in that part of the state.
Consider a 2012 report in The Washington Post, citing a study’s findings that while casinos created jobs, they also “lead to a plethora of social ills, including increased substance abuse, mental illness and suicide, violent crime, auto theft and larceny, and bankruptcy. The latter three all increased by 10% in communities that allowed gambling.”
In addition to the social costs, casinos provide cover to sex traffickers as “casino crowds and co-located lodging facilities — coupled with the transient nature of sex trafficking — provide convenience and cover for sex traffickers,” wrote Dave Vialpando, a veteran law enforcement officer.
I-95 has long been cited as the main north-south route for smuggling drugs and human trafficking. A casino along this corridor would only exacerbate these problems.
While some may regard casinos as the dark underbelly of Big Gambling, its close cousin — online sports betting — seeks to cast itself as the more cultured, sophisticated form of gambling.
While online sports betting is illegal in South Carolina, none of us are naïve enough to believe that people in the Palmetto State aren’t doing it.
There are certainly ways to get around state law, but that — in and of itself — should not be a reason for us to dive headlong into an arena that has high costs.
Gambling in the privacy of your home on your iPhone or laptop is easy. Combine the convenience and accessibility of online gambling with sports and you have a potent combination.
Robert Strezo with The Center for Public Justice states, “Sports betting is having an enormous impact on society, and it is disproportionately impacting the lives of young men who are less risk-averse and interested in sports. Nearly 60 percent of 18 to 22-year-olds have bet on sports and 20-year-old males represent about 40% of the calls to hotlines for gambling addiction. The targeting of college youth, who often have access to financial aid — which can be redirected to fund their addiction — has compounded the burden of college debt with gambling debts and the costs of addiction therapy.”
Because of its very nature, it disproportionately affects young men.
According to a January 2024 study, 72% of sports bettors are young men.
Ultimately, there is neither a strong social nor fiscal argument for South Carolina to pursue casinos or online sports betting.
In addition to these and other concerns, Palmetto Family is committed to a biblical worldview that calls us to pursue human flourishing.
South Carolina is at a crossroads: We can either choose to pursue the “glitter” of gambling or embrace the core Judeo-Christian values of hard work, productivity, and using the fruits of God’s provision to meet our needs, the needs of other South Carolinians and expanding and invest to continue to make South Carolina a great place to live, work and raise a family.

(Video capture courtesy of the Iowa Supreme Court)  The Iowa Supreme Court has removed from the bench a magistrate who questioned the veracity of an alleged sexual assault victim because he was a teenage male and asked whether a defendant in a separate case was a “wetback.”
Magistrate David J. Hanson, who is based in Fayette County and has practiced law for more than 36 years, is “simply and unalterably unsuited to be a judge,” and is “unable to preside over any proceeding involving a sexual assault,” the court ruled on Friday.
Its decision to remove Hanson from the bench takes effect in 10 days, assuming Hanson has not resigned before then.
In March, the justices heard oral arguments in the disciplinary proceedings against Hanson. The Iowa Judicial Qualifications Commission, which hears complaints about judges’ conduct, had recommended that the justices suspend Hanson for 90 days due to his conduct in two separate criminal matters.
On Aug. 5, 2022, he refused to sign an arrest warrant for a 17-year-old girl in a sexual abuse case in which the alleged victim was a 15-year-old male. According to court records, Hanson reviewed the matter and denied the warrant, writing that “any self-respecting young male” would have simply removed himself from any sexual touching that was truly unwelcome and he described his own response as a teenager to “unwelcome” sexual advances.
Hanson went on to write that as a teenage boy, the alleged victim’s actions were “contrary to nature” because the “normal, hormone-ridden teenage boy’s reaction to being undressed by a teenage girl” is, “Alright! I’m gonna GET some!” His written decision then went into graphic detail about the physiology of the male sex organ.
In July 2023, Hanson was presiding over a case in which an individual was charged with driving without a license or insurance. A law-student intern who was prosecuting the case later complained that during the proceedings Hanson asked, “Is this guy a wetback? An illegal?”
According to the commission, Hanson also asked whether the prosecutor was sure the defendant, who wasn’t present at the time, hadn’t stolen someone’s identification.
Hanson says use of slur was once ‘common’
At last month’s hearing before the Iowa Supreme Court, Hanson told the justices that with regard to the allegations made by the victim in the sexual abuse case, “I honestly thought, ‘This is a lie. It reads like bad pornography.’ I hate pornography. Pornography is lies … I still, to this day, am convinced that the arrest warrant request, the complaint, was resting on lies.”
At the time, Chief Justice Susan Christensen appeared to bristle at Hanson’s comment and questioned his equation of pornography with lies.

“Sir, are you aware that things that happen to people are pornographic in nature? And sometimes, in order for there to be an arrest warrant, someone might have to give details that are really ugly to give (and) heartbreaking to hear? Just because you’re giving the adjective ‘porn’ — what if those things actually happened to that person? Because it qualifies as porn in your mind and you hate porn, you think it’s a lie?”
“I seriously questioned it,” Hanson replied. “The other problem I had was the utter lack of interest, as far as I could tell, in the policeman attempting to corroborate what the young man said.”
Hanson then likened the decision he faced in that case with what he called the “travesty” of the testimony that was given during the U.S. Supreme Court nomination hearings for conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, and for Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991.
“Those were lies,” Hanson said, pounding the podium as he addressed the Iowa justices. “Televised lies! And I was appalled by that, and I thought, ‘I will not be an instrument of anyone seeking to destroy someone without any backing up of what (the alleged victim) said here.’”
As to the second matter involving the case in which Hanson used the term “wetback,” Christensen asked Hanson, “Do you think the term ‘wetback’ is offensive?”
“I’ve learned since using it that it is,” Hanson said. “I grew up in west side, working class Waterloo, and it was fairly common.”
Christensen cut Hanson off, shaking her head and telling him, “You definitely, that one, I am gonna call ‘foul’ on that, that you didn’t know it was offensive.” Hanson told the justices he was agreeable to taking whatever educational courses the court might prescribe for him but asked that he not be removed from the bench due to the heavy caseloads in Fayette County.
Justices remove Hanson from the bench 
In the decision Friday to remove Hanson from the bench, Justice Dana Oxley, writing for the full court, stated that “it should go without saying that the term ‘w——‘ is a racially derogatory, highly offensive slur that does not belong in a courtroom — and especially not from the mouth of a judge … We cannot overemphasize how inappropriate it was for Magistrate Hanson to use the slur … Rather than recognize the term as the racial epithet that it is, he labels it as ‘someone’s taboo’ that he ‘apparently’ transgressed.”
In deciding that Hanson’s conduct warranted not just a suspension but his removal from the bench, the court stated that if Hanson “cannot recognize bias or prejudice in his own conduct, we cannot trust him to recognize it in those he is tasked with policing,” referring to attorneys and other officers of the court.
Hanson, the court added, “has not shown regret for his choice of words. He has not shown genuine remorse for the effect his statements likely had on the litigants. He has shown no aptitude for self-improvement. Indeed, he suggested in his brief that the commission simply provide him with a list of ‘bad words’ so that he can avoid them in conversation.”
With regard to the sexual assault case, the court found that Hanson is “unable to preside over any proceeding involving a sexual assault,” and noted that in a written brief, Hanson had explained his view of sexual assault allegations by writing, “All judges should know, and fear, false accusations of sexual crimes alleged long after the supposed events. I witnessed the televised atrocities visited upon U.S. Supreme Court Justice nominees … by women whom effective cross examinations showed to be telling falsehoods. I will never abet such ‘high-tech lynchings.’ ”

ST. MARY PARISH —  Amid the rapid erosion of Louisiana’s coast, something hopeful is happening where the Atchafalaya River meets the Gulf. A flow of sediment from a decades-old river diversion has accidentally given birth to new wetlands.
While that small delta is dwarfed by what’s washing away all around it, researchers have gained knowledge from Wax Lake Delta that could help save the rest of Louisiana’s coast and contribute to a better understanding of wetland science across the globe. 
“We have sea level rise, we have storms, but yet … the Wax Lake Delta remains and continues to grow and reach out into the Atchafalaya Basin,” said Alisha Renfro, a coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation.
Researchers at Louisiana State University’s Coastal Systems Ecology Lab, led by wetland scientist and professor Robert Twilley, take regular trips to Wax Lake to study what makes a healthy wetland. They monitor soil chemistry and study the way water moves throughout the delta, depositing sediment and building land as it flows. 
 This story is part of the series “Down the Drain” from the Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk, an independent reporting collaborative based at the University of Missouri in partnership with Report for America, with major funding from the Walton Family Foundation.
“Wax Lake has this beautiful, long history of researchers that literally wrote the textbook on what is a delta based on that region,” Twilley said. 

Rather than having to rely on computer modeling for their research, Wax Lake is known as a “living laboratory,” said Renfro, describing it as the perfect place to study what makes a healthy wetland. 
A happy accident
During a research trip on a bright February morning, alligators meandered through the marshy channels of the Wax Lake Delta, part of the Atchafalaya Wildlife Management Area. The scientists were happy to see them. The presence of so many apex predators in the muddy water is a testament to the health of the ecosystem, said Jessica Richardson, a data manager working with Twilley at LSU in the Coastal Sciences department.
White ibises gathered together on the land, and schools of silvery fish darted through the dark water.
“You’ve got different wildlife nesting, laying eggs, such as alligators … and birds that fly, that come in during different seasons and nest,” Twilley said.

Deltas are formed from sediment that collects at the end of a river, like the Mississippi or Atchafalaya. Over time, this sediment builds, creating new land and using nutrients carried by the river to grow vegetation, the roots of which stabilize the new soil and keep it from eroding. 
Deltaic wetlands are uniquely diverse and ecologically valuable. When a river flows into the delta, “it’s not just water,” said Ivan Vargas-Lopez, a wetland scientist and researcher with the Coastal Systems Ecology Lab. 
“It’s bringing a lot of nutrients, a lot of sediment, a lot of particles, a lot of material …” Vargas-Lopez said. “When the water recedes, a lot of that material stays.” 
This process can happen naturally over thousands of years, but the new land built from Wax Lake happened by mistake. 
“[Wax Lake] teaches us about the balance, that if you supply the right amount of 
sediment into an environment, that you outweigh the influence of subsidence and sea level. You will be able to establish and maintain a healthy ecosystem,” said Ehab Meselhe, a river and coastal scientist at Tulane University. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dug a channel in 1941 to try to reduce flooding in nearby Morgan City, redirecting the flow of water from the Atchafalaya. This started the process of sediment buildup, noticed only after a massive flood in 1973 flushed a torrent of dirt down the river. 
For Wax Lake, land is built through flooding. Floods bring in great heaps of sediment, spreading it out across the floodplain in a lobelike shape at the end of the river. 
“Under that water, you’re building a delta, and all of a sudden it sort of … pops up,” Twilley said.  
Over time, the process forms the wetlands so important to the integrity of Louisiana’s coast.

Reversing wetland loss
Subsidence, or the slow sinking of land, paired with ongoing oil and gas development and sea level rise caused by climate change is erasing Louisiana’s coastal wetlands — and fast. These wetlands are some of the most vulnerable in the world, with much of the coast washing away at a rate of about a football field every 100 minutes, endangering cities, towns and livelihoods all along the coast. 
Wax Lake Delta bucks this trend, with one estimate from LSU researchers suggesting land grows by about half a square mile a year. Louisiana officials and researchers are scrambling to respond to the wetland crisis and using Wax Lake’s land-building success to inform other coastal restoration efforts, such as marsh creation, manmade oyster reefs and rebuilding barrier islands. 
Meselhe used data from Wax Lake Delta in his work on the Mid-Barataria sediment diversion project, which would redirect the Mississippi River into the Barataria Basin to reverse land loss in coastal parishes. The diversion has been highly controversial due to its impact on fisheries, and it’s facing delays and legal challenges. 
The Wax Lake Delta data helped him to understand how the interaction between water flow, sediment buildup and plant growth worked to build land. He also looked at how land is being built by another diversion called West Bay and at the Bonnet Carré spillway to see how the diversion would impact the river itself. Then he used that information to calibrate models to help explain how Mid-Barataria would work. 
 “Wax Lake, West Bay and Bonnet Carré served as examples because they had data and measurements and maps over a number of years that helped us to have confidence and trust in the models we ended up using for the Mid-Barataria area,” he said.  
The LSU Center for River Studies houses a massive model of the Mississippi River in its Baton Rouge facility, built using data including water velocity and sediment concentrations observed at Wax Lake and other Louisiana deltas. Researchers and students use it to test how sediment moves with the Mississippi River and where it’s deposited.  
Physical models are useful and necessary; the Army Corps has used them since the early 20th century. But Twilley said field observations like those done at Wax Lake are crucial. 
“Models are not to do your thinking. Models are to help you think,” he said. “Once we build these models of the way we think these systems work and the way they operate, you know, it’s great to go visit somewhere else and see if your hypothesis stands or not.”
Added benefits of a healthy wetland
As scientists study how Wax Lake builds land, they can also better understand the added benefits of healthy wetlands, such as natural carbon storage and nutrient reduction.
Because Wax Lake has been building wetlands for decades, Twilley’s lab can compare older and newer areas of marsh. 
“The older delta does a much better job at holding the soil and serving as a hurricane protection system than the younger,” he said. 
Mature wetlands also store massive amounts of carbon in organic matter, found in dead plants. Buried in the marsh, they keep microorganisms from eating the carbon and releasing it as planet-warming CO2. Wetlands also filter excess nitrogen out of the water, sequestering it before it reaches the Gulf and contributes to harmful algal blooms and the “dead zone.”
That’s one of the reasons it’s important to protect existing wetlands, Twilley said. Their systems are already established and don’t have to play catch up. 
“You gotta let these deltas age before they really reach their full capacity,” he said. “You will get a jump start by already having some wetlands out there.”

An uncertain future
While the science is clear – wetlands have lots of benefits and we know how to build more of them – the future is not. America’s wetlands are under increased threat. After hundreds of years of draining them for agriculture and housing—and historic efforts to protect them—regulations are now being rolled back.  
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that wetlands covered about 6% of the lower 48 states as of 2019 – about half the amount of wetlands that existed around 1780.
The report also found that the rate of wetland loss increased 50% during the latest study period. Wetlands are now being lost faster than ever, from a combination of drainage for agriculture, development and the effects of climate change. 
Louisiana’s coastal wetlands make up about 40% of all coastal marshes in the United States, according to a series of reports from the U.S. Geological Survey conducted throughout the 1980s and finished in 1996, which found that “wetlands once covered more than one-half of the area that is now Louisiana, but wetland acreage has declined to less than one-third of the state’s land surface over the last 200 years.”
Changes at the federal level could also increase risk of continued wetland loss. 
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to redefine what are designated in federal law as Waters of the United States, sometimes called WOTUS. The changes affect what qualifies as a federally protected body of water under the Clean Water Act. 
The fate of the Mississippi River’s precious wetlands hangs in the balance. 
Research on Wax Lake Delta illustrates that wetlands are more important than ever. Renfro said that’s why it’s critical to take these lessons and use them to build more wetlands. 
“At the end of the day, reconnecting the river with those wetlands it once built is kind of the consistent way to build robust, healthy coastal ecosystems that continue to grow.”

South Carolina public school buses Monday Oct. 30, 2023.(Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)A 13-year-old boy was killed when a bus flipped over on Interstate 77 in Chester County on Thursday.
Jose Maria Gonzales Linares, a Pine Ridge Middle School student, died in the crash, Chester County Coroner Terry Tinker said Friday.
Three buses from the middle school were returning to the Lexington County school after a field trip near Charlotte, according to a Lexington School District Two news release.
A tire blew on the bus, which was carrying about 35 students and three adults, causing it to swerve, hit a guard rail and flip, according to the state Highway Patrol, which is investigating the crash.
The two buses that were following the bus that flipped “maneuvered to avoid the accident,” injuring several people on those buses, the district said in a news release.
Emergency services took 38 people to local hospitals, said Ed Darby, director of Chester County Emergency Management. That included three people airlifted to hospitals in helicopters, he said.
Darby did not have information on how many had been released as of Friday morning, or how many people were considered in critical condition, he said.
Highway Patrol and Lexington School District Two also had no new information to release Friday morning, spokespeople said.
Pine Ridge Middle School listed an eighth grade field trip on its online calendar Thursday, but the district has not said where the field trip was.
“Our hearts are broken by the tragic bus accident in Chester County this afternoon,” state Superintendent Ellen Weaver said in a statement. “Our entire state is mourning alongside the Pine Ridge Middle School families, friends, classmates, and educators. Please join me in praying for the Lexington Two community.”
Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that he and his wife, Peggy McMaster, were both praying for the students injured in the bus crash.
“Today’s school bus accident in Chester County is a tragedy no family should ever have to endure,” McMaster wrote.
Fatal school bus crashes are relatively rare in South Carolina. In 2022, the most recent data available, four people died in collisions involving school buses, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SC42-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 12:24:51.264178

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)“If I had my way, I’d take the tax out,” Republican Assemblymember P.K. O’Neill said last month about the state commerce tax paid by Nevada businesses.
It’s not a bad idea.
The commerce tax was crafted by quasi-governmental fixture, consultant to the publicly subsidized stars, and lobbyist in denial Jeremy Aguero at the request of then-Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval for the 2015 Nevada legislative session. 
The measure, which was enacted with bipartisan support, applies small levies well south of 1% (between 0.051% and 0.331%, depending on the industry) on the gross receipts of businesses that collect an annual revenue of more than $4 million.
O’Neill and Republican Assemblymember Jill Dickman are sponsoring a bill to have the $4 million exemption grow with inflation, effectively expanding the exemption a little more each year, and capturing a few less businesses in the process. It would have a negligible impact on state revenues and Nevada businesses alike in the short term, though the impact on state revenue would compound over time. 
Only seven states levy a tax on gross revenue. States name them differently — “corporate activity tax” (Oregon), “franchise tax” (Texas), “commerce tax” (Nevada), etc. — but tax policy think tanks such as the Tax Foundation and the Tax Policy Center categorize them collectively as a “gross receipts” tax.
And the center-right Tax Foundation, in particular, is not fond of gross receipts taxes at all.
Among the many faults the group finds in “this harmful tax,” perhaps the most pernicious is “tax pyramiding” — a good or service gets taxed again and again by every business at every step in the market process.
That “continual forward shifting of the tax burden” ultimately results in consumers paying higher prices.
Nevada consumers already pay higher sales tax rates than people in most of the rest of the country, which makes inflation hit households in Nevada harder than in other states (and is yet another reason Nevadans will also be hit harder by Trump’s tariffs than people in most other states). Nevada’s commerce tax exacerbates the problem.
  Nevada’s commerce tax on business is a wee slice. Nevada’s sales tax on working households is like a big honking third of the whole stinking pie. (Pie: Nevada Economic Forum)
Price increases driven by commerce tax pyramiding also make the tax regressive — the lower a household’s income, the higher the percentage of that income is paid as a tax. That’s in keeping with Nevada’s upside down tax structure in general, which is notorious for being one of the nation’s most regressive.
“Nevada’s Commerce Tax is a prime example of a state with a poorly structured and legally tenuous gross receipts tax,” the Tax Foundation wrote in a 2024 overview of taxes on gross receipts in the U.S. The group singled out the aforementioned $4 million exemption for “eliminating many small and medium-sized businesses in Nevada from the Commerce Tax altogether.” 
(The “legally tenuous” bit refers to an “in-state payroll” quirk in the tax that could make it ripe for challenge under the U.S. Constitution clause granting Congress the authority to regulate commerce between the states. But since Republicans who control Congress have relinquished power over everything and anything in deference to Trump’s authority, that potential constitutional transgression is unlikely to be anyone’s concern anytime soon.)
“Gross receipt taxes” such as Nevada’s commerce tax “can and should be left in the dustbin of history,” the Tax Foundation asserts.
“If states intend to levy a broad-based business tax,” the group’s overview concludes, “a properly corporate income tax that allows businesses to deduct the cost of goods sold, as well as qualifying business investments and inputs,” which would curb tax pyramiding, you see, “is — while far from an ideal tax — demonstrably better than a tax on gross receipts.”
Yeah well we won’t be doing that
When O’Neill, who previously has struggled to grasp the meaning of regressive taxation, says he’d like to “take the tax out,” he assuredly doesn’t mean he would like to replace it with a corporate income tax.
But ridding the state of its commerce tax without replacing it with something smarter would leave a projected $760 million hole in state revenue over the next two years.
The damage that Trump and Elon Musk have recklessly inflicted on federal programs and services is as yet still incalculable, and the prospect of repairing what they have broken is still unknown. 
What is known, however, is that states that stand the best chance of maintaining a semblance of vital public services will be those states with a history of at least trying to adequately fund and staff state and local government. 
Nevada isn’t one of them.
And barring a currently unthinkable outbreak of sense and sensibility among Trump and his congressional Republicans, Nevada will likely be facing intense budget challenges over the next two years, especially with diminished Medicaid funding, yet another thing that is projected to hit Nevada harder than most states. 
Nevada can’t “take the tax out.” 
And it can’t replace it with a corporate income tax, for the same reason Sandoval and Aguero came up with gross receipts tax ten years ago. Sure, it was convoluted, unfamiliar, and wracked with bizarre industrial tax rate variations that were inexplicable from a policy standpoint but grossly obvious from a political one (oh hi mining). And, if memory serves, opponents at the time warned of the tax pyramiding problem.
But the big attraction about the commerce tax is that as blunt and flawed and silly as it so obviously was/is, it wasn’t that one tax that Nevada politicians of both parties are horrified to entertain, let alone make an argument or — perish the thought — vote for: It wasn’t an income tax.
Technically, it is true that Nevada can replace its gross receipts tax with a corporate income tax that would treat businesses and working households more fairly. While the state constitution prohibits establishment of a personal income tax, it also explicitly allows a business and/or corporate income tax.
But replacing the commerce tax with a business income tax would require at least a few Republicans to vote for it, because of the  state’s daftly undemocratic requirement that any new or increased taxes must be approved by two-thirds of both houses of the Legislature.
And approving a business income tax — or any new or increased tax for that matter — would require Democrats to not only vote for it, but to make a public case for it.
That’s just not going to happen at any time in the foreseeable future, if ever.
Instead, O’Neill’s bill to make the commerce tax slightly more complicated and slightly less useful was passed out of a committee controlled by Democrats, and seems exactly the sort of thing that perhaps not most but enough legislative Democrats would vote to send to the desk of a Republican governor who would no doubt be delighted to sign it, Nevada legislative Democrats arguably being among the most business-compliant legislative Democrats in the nation.
If that’s what happens, a little bit more of the state’s tax burden will be lifted from business, a  little bit more of it will fall on the shoulders of working households, and Nevada’s tax structure will be a little bit more upside down, fairness wise. In other words, yet again, the Nevada way will win the day.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250115_StateofState_Current-1418-2-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-18 12:24:51.264178

(Courtesy of the Nebraska Supreme Court)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court sided with the Legislature on Friday, upholding its constitutional authority to pass new parole eligibility standards as part of a major criminal justice reform law in 2023 meant to help address prison crowding.
In an unsigned 37-page ruling, the high court unanimously overturned a Lancaster County District Court ruling that parts of Legislative Bill 50 from 2023 were unconstitutional. The sections deal with parole eligibility and legislative intent that the expanded provisions apply to all committed offenders. 
Those laws took effect Sept. 2, 2023, but on the advice of Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services refused to implement the parole provisions. The lower court sided with Hilgers in March 2024, leading to the appeal.
“Whether applied prospectively or retroactively, LB 50’s new parole eligibility provisions do not result in substituting a milder punishment for the sentence originally imposed,” the Supreme Court wrote.

The justices reasoned that parole is not the same as commutation, or imposing a “milder” sentence, which is a power reserved exclusively to the Nebraska Board of Pardons and the executive branch.
The court said parole “merely changes the circumstances under which the sentence is being served.”
While some offenders might get earlier parole, the justices said, it can’t be assumed that everyone who will become eligible will then be granted parole sooner than they would have if not for LB 50’s passage. It passed the Legislature in a 34-15 vote in June 2023.
“Because leaving an erroneous declaration of unconstitutionality uncorrected would result in damage to the integrity, reputation or fairness of the judicial process, we must reverse the judgment for plain error,” the justices said.
Justice Jason Bergevin had not yet joined the Supreme Court when oral arguments came up in January, so Chief Judge Francie Riedmann of the Nebraska Court of Appeals filled in.
Expanded parole eligibility
Hilgers and his office specifically targeted Sections 47 and 48 of LB 50, which the Legislature in Section 57 explicitly said it intended to apply retroactively.
The new law extended parole eligibility in the following ways:

For someone serving a maximum term of 20 years or less, two years prior to a person’s mandatory discharge date.


For someone serving a maximum term of more than 20 years, when the person has served 80% of the time until the sentence’s mandatory discharge date.

LB 50 also created the possibility of “geriatric parole” for someone who is at least 75 years old and who has served at least 15 years of the sentence. Persons serving a Class I, IA or IB felony or for a sex-related offense are ineligible, as are those serving life imprisonment.
As a condition of geriatric parole, the person would need to wear an electronic monitoring device for at least 17 months.
In late 2023 court filings, the Corrections Department said the “retroactive effect” of LB 50 would impact 1,794 current offenders:

529 committed offenders who were already parole eligible would have had a new, earlier parole eligibility date.


345 committed offenders who were not yet parole eligible under the previous law would now be parole eligible.


920 committed offenders who had not yet reached parole eligibility would have a new, earlier parole eligibility date.

‘Holding out hope’
At least five serving on the Supreme Court would have needed to agree to declare part or all of LB 50 unconstitutional. Statutes are presumed to be constitutional and “all reasonable doubts are resolved in favor of its constitutionality.”
“The burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute is on the one attacking its validity,” the court wrote. “It is not the province of a court to annul a legislative act unless it clearly contravenes the constitution and no other resort remains.”
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, a longtime member of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, joined former State Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha, the then-committee chair, to get LB 50 over the finish line. 
McKinney said he was a little surprised by Friday’s decision but felt good. He said he had received numerous calls and questions from individuals and families who will be impacted by LB 50.
“I feel happy, but I feel relief for those individuals who were holding out hope that the court would uphold what we passed,” McKinney told the Nebraska Examiner.

The Judiciary Committee in 2023 was split 4-4 between Republicans and Democrats, and LB 50 advanced 4-2 after a temporary vacancy caused by the resignation of former State Sen. Suzanne Geist of Lincoln, a Republican, making four members a majority. Geist is now chief of staff and chief policy adviser to Hilgers. Geist’s legislative successor, State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, now chairs the Judiciary Committee. Bosn was unavailable for comment Friday.
AG’s opinions are not law
When Hilgers’ office filed the case in late 2023, he did so under a previous law since repealed by the Legislature. It required his office to challenge the constitutionality of a law if, on the AG’s written advice, an agency refused to implement a state law. However, justices during January arguments said this was the first time the lawsuit had followed “informal” advice rather than an archived AG’s opinion.
Secretary of State Bob Evnen defended the law against the attorney general, as was his duty under the previous law. Spokespersons for Evnen and Hilgers did not immediately respond to Friday requests for comment, nor did the Corrections Department.
Friday’s ruling almost did not happen on technical grounds after the attorney for Evnen contained no “assignment of error section” in a brief to the high court, only headings alluding to alleged errors, the opinion states. However, the case was allowed to move forward to determine whether there was a “plain error” in the lower court ruling, leading to Friday’s ruling.

This isn’t the first time Hilgers has questioned the constitutionality of state laws at the request of state agency heads, He did so notably in August 2023 after the Corrections Department and the Department of Health and Human Services questioned legislative oversight of child welfare and corrections and in July 2024, when Evnen questioned restoring voting rights to formerly convicted felons after the completion of their sentences, rather than a two-year waiting period that Evnen also questioned.
Wayne, with McKinney’s support, led the voting rights law. The Supreme Court ruled against Hilgers in October. No lawsuit was ever launched in the oversight case. Legislation is pending to get around a legal fight.
McKinney said he and others often have to remind colleagues that AG’s opinions lack the force of law and that Friday’s decision upheld that state lawmakers were “working to do the right thing” and “crossing our t’s and dotting our i’s.”
“Just because another agency or individual wants to try to say, ‘No, y’all can’t do that,’ I think it shows that there’s power in the Legislature to do good things,” McKinney said. “When you do good things for the right reasons, things will be upheld.”
This is a developing story.

In April of 2018, the complaint says, an MGM customer wrote in an email to a corporate host that his casino hosts may be sharing information about him with Bowyer, including an allegation that “Mr. Bowyer is attempting to steal clients from the MGM, hence he is in the illegal bookmaking business and [casino host] is funneling MGM sportsbook clients to Mr. Bowyer.” The email was forwarded to two casino marketing managers, the GCB complaint states, however it was not reported to MGM Compliance executives. 
The revelation comes a year and a half after federal authorities from California agreed to allow MGM to pay a $7.45 million fine in lieu of prosecution for allowing another illegal bookmaker, Wayne Nix, to gamble and launder cash at MGM Grand and the Cosmopolitan, which the company now owns. 
Then-MGM Grand president Scott Sibella “approved complimentary rooms, food service, and event tickets for Mr. Nix, and invited Mr. Nix on marketing trips to encourage him to gamble at the MGM Grand,” the complaint says. 
The Nevada Gaming Commission will be asked next week to sign off on a stipulated agreement calling for MGM Resorts International to pay an $8.5 million fine for allowing illegal bookmakers to gamble and failing to adhere to anti-money laundering laws. 
The Current was first to report in 2023 that the Criminal Division of the Internal Revenue Service was investigating MGM and Resorts World. The Nevada Gaming Commission last month approved a stipulated agreement in which Resorts World agreed to pay a $10.5 million fine. Federal authorities have yet to take any action against Resorts World.  
Former MGM Resorts Chairman and CEO Jim Murren, who led the company during the time the alleged violations occurred, declined to comment. Earlier this year, Resorts World named Murren to head up its Board of Directors. 
The Current reported last year that Murren, the company’s general counsel John McManus, and the GCB were notified in 2019 that executives, including Sibella, were catering to gamblers with questionable bankrolls.
GCB officials have declined to say what, if any, action they took at the time. Las Vegas Raiders president Sandra Douglass Morgan, who served as chairperson of the GCB at the time, also did not respond. 
Nix gambled at MGM properties on 400 separate days, the GCB complaint asserts. Each day constitutes a separate violation. 
A Cosmopolitan host “went to dinner with Mr. Nix, invited Mr. Nix to casino-sponsored events, and encouraged Mr. Nix to travel and stay at the Cosmopolitan to use the illegal proceeds,” and referred at least one casino customer to place illegal sports bets with Nix.
The GCB’s “months long investigation” revealed MGM executives had “suspicions” from March 2015 until September 2018 about Bowyer’s source of funds, but did nothing to stop him from gambling on 300 separate days at MGM properties.  
MGM knew, or should have known, since April 2018 that Bowyer was involved in illegal bookmaking, the complaint alleges. 
The Current was first to report in November 2023 that federal authorities raided Bowyer’s California home a month earlier and seized his phone. He has since pleaded guilty to money laundering and illegal bookmaking.

(Photo: Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez held his mother in a tight embrace and wept following his release from the Leon County Jail Thursday evening, where the U.S. citizen was held after his arrest for illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien.”
An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.

The pair didn’t reunite until the evening, after Lopez-Gomez’s first court appearance earlier in the day. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans ruled Thursday morning that she lacked jurisdiction to release him because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him for 48 hours.
After Riggans’ inspection of his Social Security card and birth certificate, which an advocate waved in the courtroom, the judge said she found no probable cause for the charge.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
The arrest record the trooper filed states that Lopez-Gomez had said he was in the country illegally but that he had handed over his ID. There was no mention of the Social Security card on the arrest report. However, Lopez-Gomez told the Phoenix he had shown the trooper a copy of his Social Security card and Georgia state ID.
The HSI agent who took Lopez-Gomez to Wendy’s directed questions to a spokesperson, who didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment or questions as of this publication.
After the reunion with his mom, Lopez-Gomez returned to the parking lot of the jail, where 30 protesters had been demanding his release. They met him with cheers and hugs.
Lopez-Gomez will have to return to the Leon County Courthouse on May 6. He was charged under a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention.
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also made their first appearances on the same charge on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

(Photo courtesy of the Oregon Department of Transportation/Flickr)Fred Cuozzo barely made it out of the South Obenchain Fire that burned through his home, barn, pumphouse and garage in Eagle Point, north of Medford, on Sept. 8, 2020.
Three years later, PacifiCorp — owner of Oregon private utility Pacific Power — was found by a jury to have been reckless and negligent in causing that fire and three others. In January 2024, a jury ordered the utility company to pay millions in damages to Cuozzo and nine other survivors, among the first group in an ongoing class action lawsuit.
Cuozzo still has not seen that settlement money because PacifiCorp is appealing the jury’s verdict. In three months, Cuozzo turns 80. He fears he might not in his lifetime see that money — money he needs to rebuild.
“I’ve been waiting almost five years since my home, contents and four other structures burned up,” he said. “I think they’re just waiting, trying to wait people out, and they can get tired of waiting or die, right?”
The Oregon Legislature is considering a bill that would do something about that, and it’s moving through the session with bipartisan support and little fanfare.
Senate Bill 926, sponsored by state Sen. David Brock Smith, R-Port Orford, and co-sponsored by Democratic state Sens. Jeff Golden of Ashland and James Manning of Eugene, would impose some consequences on PacifiCorp, and the state’s two other investor-owned utilities, for delaying settlements and prolonging litigation if they are found to have recklessly or negligently caused a wildfire.
On April 8, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s four Democrats voted to pass it out of the committee and onto the Senate floor, recommending they also vote yes. The committee’s two Republicans opposed the bill. The larger Senate vote has not yet been scheduled.
Golden said he only recently learned about the bill and signed on as a sponsor.
“I am interested in faster settlements. I’m not interested in rate increases or favorable treatment (for utilities) until people who have been waiting for a remedy get it,” he said.
Unlike other bills this session related to private utilities and wildfire risk that have been more controversial — including bills to shield utilities from some financial liabilities, and one bill that would have prohibited utilities from raising rates if they had ongoing wildfire suits — Senate Bill 926 appears to be meeting little friction. Only one person spoke at its first public hearing in March: a father of three in Albany who supports the bill and expressed frustration over his rising electricity costs. Brock Smith, the bill’s chief sponsor, did not give testimony during the bill’s first hearing or in the run-up to the judiciary committee’s vote. He also didn’t respond to calls, emails or texts about the bill.
Utility companies oppose the bill. Portland General Electric lobbyist Greg Alderson called it “problematically broad” in a letter submitted to the committee two days after the hearing.
PacifiCorp spokesman Simon Gutierrez, said in an email to the Capital Chronicle on Tuesday that the company strongly opposes the bill, though it has not yet submitted any formal testimony against it.
The bill was amended after public comment closed, unfairly and fundamentally altering the original bill without the opportunity to weigh in on the changes, both utilities contend.
 Imposing consequences

Senate Bill 926 would prohibit Oregon’s private investor-owned utilities from recovering wildfire lawsuit costs from ratepayers — including fines, fees and settlements — if the company was found by a court or jury to have acted recklessly or negligently in causing the fire. It would also prohibit companies from raising rates to pay for repairing or replacing wildfire-damaged infrastructure if the company is found by court or jury to have been at fault for the fire.
Electric utilities indebted by a wildfire judgment would not be allowed to send dividends, income, interest or profits to corporate owners and shareholders and would pay 9% interest on any damages awarded to wildfire victims starting from the date of the fire, rather than the date the damages are awarded.
The bill would apply retroactively to all powerline-ignited wildfires since Jan. 1, 2020. For a company like PacifiCorp, that could mean millions in interest on cases that have been awaiting trial for years, and limits to the utilities’ now annual requests to raise rates.
“It is astounding that Senate leadership in the Oregon legislature is seeking to insert themselves into ongoing litigation involving PacifiCorp by retroactively imposing costs in the millions under a scheme that would apply to no other business in the state,” Gutierrez said.
He added that in light of a recent report from the Oregon Department of Forestry that concluded PacifiCorp did not start fires it was previously found to have started in the Santiam Canyon, the bill should be reconsidered.
That state report refutes statements from first responders from the U.S. Forest Service and months of trial testimony about the origins of the fires, and is unlikely to be admissible in PacifiCorp’s appeal because the company in 2023 moved to exclude all government reports at trial.

(Screenshots via YouTube)Social media posts have been falsely claiming that a man with connections to Arizona and far-right militias was the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who smashed a car’s window with an axe to apprehend a Guatemalan immigrant. But that man has not been hired by ICE and is currently in Oklahoma spreading conspiracy theories there.
Michael “Lewis Arthur” Meyer is the founder of a group known as Veterans on Patrol which has been involved with a number of militia activities along the southern border often with a QAnon theme.
Users on BlueSky and X, formerly Twitter, have been claiming that Meyer is an ICE agent who was seen breaking the window of a vehicle to arrest a Guatemalan immigrant woman as she was waiting for her attorney.
The Arizona Mirror found that Meyer was posting videos of himself in Oklahoma at the time of the incident in Massachusetts. Meyer has been making videos of himself at the Oklahoma state Capitol telling staff of lawmakers that he intends to “destroy” what he claims is “military weather manipulation” technology.
In an email to the Mirror, Meyer confirmed that he has been living in Oklahoma and said he does not work for ICE.
And ICE “vehemently” denied the claims that Meyer works for the agency in any capacity.
“The officer recorded making an arrest in New Bedford, Mass. is not militia leader Lewis Arthur,” an ICE spokesman said in an emailed statement to the Mirror. “The rumors circulating on social media that ICE Boston employed a militia leader from Arizona to make arrests in New England are not only false, but they are also inflammatory and place the safety of federal officers in jeopardy.”
ICE would not release the name of the officer seen in the video, and would only confirm that “he is a federal law enforcement officer who has worked with ICE to help keep New England communities safe for years.”
Meyer believes in the debunked chemtrail conspiracy theory that has been overtaking many state legislatures. His Telegram, a social media channel favored by the far-right for allowing hate speech and graphic content, if full of conspiratorial creeds and allusions to violence towards the alleged weather manipulation technology in Oklahoma.
Meyer’s group has long engaged in these sorts of antics and “operations.”
In 2018, his group found a homeless encampment and began spreading unfounded claims of sex trafficking and last year claimed that Hurricane Helene was created by the United States military.
Meyer also has a criminal record which includes damaging and stealing water meant for migrants along the border left by humanitarian groups in Arizona, disorderly conduct and trespassing at a cement factory he believed was part of a QAnon-style conspiracy.
Journalist Jessica Pishko also confirmed on X that she had recently seen Meyer in Oklahoma.

Other members of the new committee include South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, conservative talk show host Mark Levin, and former Fox News contributor Bo Dietl.

Congratulations to all!,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social Page.
Gruters, a former chair of the Republican Party of Florida, has served in the Florida Senate since 2018 and in the Legislature since 2016. His alliance with Trump began before that, as he was named co-chair of Trump’s first presidential campaign in Florida in Fall 2015 (along with Susie Wiles, now Trump’s White House chief of staff).
Trump has already endorsed Gruters’ campaign for Florida Chief Financial Officer for 2026.
“When President Trump asked me to run for Chief Financial Officer of Florida, I immediately said ‘yes’ knowing you never pass up an opportunity to serve the President and the great state of Florida,” Gruters said in a written statement. “The same goes with this appointment. There is nothing more important than the safety and security of the American people and I accept this appointment with the gravity it deserves.”
According to a press release issued from Gruters, the Homeland Security Advisory Council:

Provides organizationally independent advice and recommendations to the Secretary, including the creation and implementation of critical and actionable policies for the security of the homeland.
Conducts research and provides policy analysis and recommendations on a variety of security issues.
Evaluates the impact of security related public and private policies in an attempt to formulate prospective security policies.

Gruters has been a candidate for CFO since last June – months after Trump publicly urged him to run for the seat, saying on his Truth Social page, “Joe was on the ‘Trump Train’ before it even left the station and, if he decides to run, he will have my Complete and Total Endorsement.”
The Florida Chief Financial Officer seat remains vacant, weeks after Jimmy Patronis resigned before his election to Congress on April 1. Although Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he would select an interim CFO before choosing a successor to fill out the remaining year-and-half term, he has yet to do so.
Gruters will most likely not be that pick. He and DeSantis have never been close, and they clashed a year ago regarding Amendment 3, the proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis in Florida.

This week: State employees begin union contract negotiations; Minnesota posts strong job numbers despite economic uncertainty; union carpenters protest subcontractor Absolute Drywall; and whistleblower alleges serious data breach at National Labor Relations Board. 
State employees begin union contract negotiations
Negotiations kicked off this week between the state of Minnesota and tens of thousands of its unionized workers in what may shape up to be the most contentious round of contract talks in recent memory.
Members of the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees, which represents about 18,000 workers, continue to hold protests against Gov. Tim Walz’s order for most workers to return to the office 50% of the time beginning on June 1. The union has called for a full repeal of the rule and raised the prospect of a strike, though the soonest one could happen wouldn’t be until late in the summer.
The union says the flexibility and autonomy that comes with remote work has been a boon for recruitment and retention, while forcing workers back into the office will increase their costs and steal time away from their families.
In their opening offer, MAPE leaders proposed that their members have the right to work remotely unless the state can “clearly and convincingly demonstrate that essential job functions of the position cannot be completed when telecommuting.” The proposal would also have the state reimburse workers for parking expenses if they are mandated to be onsite on an incidental basis.
Walz said this week he has no plans to rescind or delay the return-to-office order, and brushed aside concerns that there wouldn’t be enough office space to accommodate workers after agencies began downsizing during the pandemic.
“I understand that there are disruptions for folks. But the ability to come back to work, work in there together 50% of the time is right in line with the majority, the vast majority of every other state government and most of our private employers,” Walz said at a news conference highlighting potential federal cuts to Medicaid.
Rules on layoffs will also be a key sticking point for the two sides, as the state stares down the likelihood of large federal funding cuts on top of a gloomy budget forecast for the near future. Minnesota Management and Budget, which is negotiating with the union, proposed creating “emergency layoffs” to be used in the event of “fiscal exigencies,” as well as epidemics, natural disasters and national security emergencies.
The new kind of layoff would allow the state to idle workers without having to follow the usual contractual procedures governing layoffs, like placing laid off workers in vacant positions at the same seniority level.
“We are deeply concerned about this proposal, especially given the timing. Workers are already being laid off across multiple agencies. Removing their only remaining protections in a moment of instability is unnecessary and harmful,” MAPE President Megan Dayton told the Reformer.
On Monday, the Minnesota Department of Health announced it was delaying layoffs for approximately 170 employees because a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing $11 billion in federal health grants, including about $220 million for Minnesota.
In an internal memo obtained by the Star Tribune, assistant Commissioner Mel Gresczyk also acknowledged the agency made errors in determining layoffs, discovering some employees who received notices were funded by other grants and revenue sources. The Department of Health plans to issue new layoff notices, which will take effect May 14.
In its opening bid, the union also proposed tying cost-of-living raises to inflation and adding protections from job losses from artificial intelligence.
Job growth remains strong in Minnesota
Minnesota added 10,700 jobs in March, the biggest monthly gain in a year, despite massive upheavals in the global economy driven by the Trump administration’s trade war.
“The recent on again, off again round of tariffs continues to cause significant uncertainty among Minnesota companies … but even so, I have to say Minnesota’s job market has so far shown impressive resilience,” said Matt Varilek, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, at a news briefing on Thursday.
Minnesota gained 37,581 jobs over the year, faster than the national rate of growth. Unemployment ticked up slightly, but it was driven by more people entering the workforce, with the labor force participation rate increasing to 68.2%, among the tops in the nation.
Trouble may be on the horizon, however, as businesses that rely on products from other countries stare down steep tariffs and a souring consumer sentiment that’s likely to lead to a pullback in spending and layoffs. Tourist-dependent industries may also take a hit this season as international workers and customers stay away, either in protest of the Trump administration or fear of being caught up in immigration enforcement.
Trump’s efforts to slash the size of the federal workforce through layoffs and buyouts have also not yet appeared in the jobs data, since the mass firings of probationary workers has been tied up in court and those who accepted voluntary buyouts may remain on the government’s payroll through September. More layoffs are planned, affecting Minnesota’s roughly 18,000 federal workers, with agency heads required to submit plans for massive staffing reductions by Monday.
Jobs in state and local government, meanwhile, saw strong growth and added 1,500 jobs over the month in March.
Carpenters union protests Absolute Drywall

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)
Members of the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters picketed outside an affordable housing development in Burnsville on Wednesday to protest Absolute Drywall, a subcontractor on the site with a long history of labor violations.
The demonstration was part of coordinated protests across the country by the carpenters union called Tax Fraud Days of Action aimed at shaming contractors the union says drive down industry wages by skirting labor laws.
Absolute Drywall has been cited repeatedly for various labor law violations, including illegally employing minors and misclassifying workers as independent contractors to avoid paying overtime, health insurance and payroll taxes. Minnesota loses upwards of $136 million a year in tax revenue because of payroll tax fraud, according to an estimate by the Midwest Economic Policy Institute.
The company is currently being sued by the state Department of Human Rights for sex discrimination for firing a female worker who was raped by a co-worker on a job site. The company is also being investigated by state labor regulators for alleged wage theft on an apartment complex built by the owners of the Minnesota Vikings.
The carpenters union also criticized MWF Properties — the developer of the Pillsbury Ridge development they picketed — and its general contractor, Eagle Building Company, for continuing to hire Absolute Drywall even after its checkered past has become public.
Eagle Building Company told the Reformer the company does not condone the behavior laid out in the allegations against Absolute Drywall and would reevaluate its business relationship with the subcontractor after the legal process played out.
“We have a rigorous program in place to identify and prevent worker abuses on our job sites,” Nick Williams, vice president at Eagle, wrote in an email.
MWF Properties did not respond to a request for comment.
Whistleblower warns of DOGE intrusion into private NLRB data
Members of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative appear to have taken reams of sensitive data from the National Labor Relations Board, according to a whistleblower’s account detailed by NPR.
The intrusion into the agency, which investigates and adjudicates unfair labor practices, has alarmed labor experts, who say it could expose personal information about union members, proprietary corporate data and witness testimony — data protected by the Privacy Act and other federal laws.
“It could result in damage to individual workers, to union-organizing campaigns and to unions themselves,” Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, told NPR.
DOGE’s effective leader, world’s richest man Elon Musk, owns companies with a number of cases before the NLRB, including alleged illegal firings of SpaceX employees. Lawyers for SpaceX have argued the NLRB’s structure is unconstitutional in that case.
In a report sent to Congress, NLRB information technology employee Daniel Berulis detailed how DOGE engineers were granted virtually unrestricted access to the agency’s computer system. Then they took steps to conceal their digital footprints across the system and appear to have exported gigabytes of data.
Berulis also noticed attempted logins from an IP address in Russia after DOGE accessed the system.
“If he didn’t know the backstory, any [chief information security officer] worth his salt would look at network activity like this and assume it’s a nation-state attack from China or Russia,” said Jake Braun, a former White House cyber official.
After Berulis raised concerns about the data intrusion, he found a printed letter taped to his door which included threatening language and a picture of him walking his dog.
The NLRB’s acting press secretary denies that DOGE was granted access to its systems.

Chris Van Hollen told reporters Friday.Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, met Thursday with Abrego Garcia and briefed reporters on the visit after landing Friday afternoon at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C.The meeting with Van Hollen was Abrego Garcia’s first contact outside of the U.S. and El Salvador immigration and legal systems since he was deported in March, the senator said.“His conversation with me was the first communication he’d had with anybody outside a prison since he was abducted,” Van Hollen said Friday.

Accompanied by Abrego Garcia’s wife, mother and brother at Dulles, Van Hollen said he’d been preparing to catch his plane out of El Salvador Thursday evening when he got word from the U.S. embassy that he would be able to meet with Abrego Garcia.The meeting came at the end of Van Hollen’s second day in the country, where he faced difficulties securing an in-person meeting or phone call with the Salvadoran citizen. The second-term senator traveled to the Central American country this week to urge the Salvadoran government to release Abrego Garcia and to meet with him.Abrego Garcia told Van Hollen he’d been taken to a detention center in Baltimore, Van Hollen said Friday. From there, he was transported to Texas and then flown to El Salvador, where he was detained at the notorious mega-prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.Abrego Garcia was moved on April 9 from CECOT to another El Salvador detention center, Van Hollen reported. The conditions at the new prison were better, but Abrego Garcia was still denied access to the outside world, including communication with his family or lawyers, which is a violation of international law, Van Hollen said.The meeting occurred under close supervision from Salvadoran officials, Van Hollen said, but Abrego Garcia appeared in adequate health.“On a very cursory examination, he appeared OK,” Van Hollen said.Van Hollen on Thursday shared a picture on social media of his meeting with Abrego Garcia, who appeared in civilian clothes.Constitutional conflictWhile he said Abrego Garcia’s individual case was tragic, Van Hollen said it had even larger implications for the strength of constitutional rights to due process.“This should not be an issue for Republicans or Democrats,” he said. “This is an issue for every American who cares about our Constitution, who cares about personal liberty, who cares about due process and who cares about what makes America so different, which is adherence to all of those things. This is an American issue.”Noting that the administration has ignored federal courts at every level — including a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last week that President Donald Trump’s administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States — Van Hollen said officials at the U.S. embassy in El Salvador told him they had not received any instruction from the administration to seek his release.“It’s very clear that the president, the Trump administration, are blatantly, flagrantly disagreeing with, defying, the order from the Supreme Court,” he said.White House says ‘he’s NOT coming back’The Trump administration, which has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error,” continued Friday to be steadfast in refusing to return him.The Trump administration has criticized Van Hollen’s advocacy for Abrego Garcia, and the White House targeted the senator on social media Friday.“Oh, and by the way, @ChrisVanHollen — he’s NOT coming back,” a post on X from the official White House account read. The post included an illustration of a New York Times headline on the meeting, with two sections crossed out and replaced with administration claims about Abrego Garcia. The administration has claimed there are logistical reasons it cannot repatriate Abrego Garcia, but some — including a Reagan-appointed federal appeals court judge on Thursday — have said the executive branch is defying the Supreme Court order.Payments to El SalvadorVan Hollen said the Trump administration has promised to pay El Salvador up to $15 million to detain the prisoners, but noted that Democrats in the U.S. Senate are not “totally powerless” to stop those payments.“Appropriations need to go through the Congress, and that $15 million, you can be sure we’re going to be looking for where it is because that wasn’t authorized in previous appropriations,” he said.He said that while Democrats are in the minority in both houses of Congress, they could block any Senate funding bill that included payments for detention in El Salvador.“You can be sure that I won’t support the use of one penny of taxpayer dollars to keep Abrego Garcia illegally detained in El Salvador,” he said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-18 18:07:53.748274

The Maryland Democrat traveled to the Central American country this week to help bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States or at least see how he was doing. “I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar,” Van Hollen wrote in a social media post late Thursday, where he shared a picture of his meeting with Abrego Garcia, who appeared in civilian clothes.“Tonight I had that chance.

Angus King (I-ME) speaks during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the conclusion of military operations in Afghanistan and plans for future counterterrorism operations on Capitol Hill on September 28, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Patrick Semansky-Pool/Getty Images)On April 18, 1775, Paul Revere famously rode through the streets of Massachusetts to warn residents about the approach of British troops, which culminated in the Battle of Lexington and Concord that kicked off America’s war for independence. 
Now, 250 years later, Sen. Angus King is giving his own warning over what he sees as the imminent collapse of American democracy under President Donald Trump. 
In an interview with writer, historian and Lincoln County resident Heather Cox Richardson, Maine’s independent senator discussed why this inflection point in American history is so resonant today.
“I believe we are in one of the most dangerous places our country has been in since the founding, because what is happening before our eyes is the collapse of the constitutional structure that the framers designed to protect us from the inevitable abuse that comes from the concentration of power,” King said, explaining that the U.S. Constitution purposefully divided power up between the Legislature — or Congress — the President and the courts. 
“But here’s what’s happening right now,” he said, “is that the executive branch is seizing more and more power.” 
He said “there are two levels of things going on here: one is bad and the other is dangerous. There are bad things like what [the Department of Government Efficiency] is doing and messing around with Social Security and this sending people to El Salvador. That’s really bad, but what’s dangerous is the way it’s being done, by essentially violating the plain intent of the Constitution, by having the President be the legislator and the executive at the same time, that’s a recipe for the loss of our freedom.”
And for people who are “cheering on his agenda” and saying, “Well, we don’t care that he’s doing all this unconstitutional stuff,” King said, “They’re going to care because eventually the Eye of Sauron is going to turn on them,” referencing the evil, all-powerful symbol in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings.”
And while the courts are “doing pretty well so far” in pushing back, King repeatedly expressed alarm over what he sees as Congress’ abdication of its duty and the complicity of his Republican colleagues.
“What we have is a test between institutional loyalty, constitutional loyalty, and party loyalty. And so my Republican colleagues — who I’m doing everything I can to sort of peel off to say, ‘Enough is enough’ — so far, haven’t been willing to take that step,” he said. “They’re in control of the Senate, they’re in control of the House, and they’re looking at getting their tax bill through and getting their budget bill through, rather than what’s happening to the structure of our government in the process.”
He also said that he believes many Republicans are not speaking up because of Trump’s threat to challenge dissenters in upcoming elections by running primary opponents financed by billionaire advisor Elon Musk.
King also spoke about the frustration among voters, acknowledging the most frequent question he hears is, “I’m mad as hell. What can I do?’”
“They can get together, they can talk to each other, they can reach out to their neighbors,” King said. “They can participate in peaceful demonstrations that indicate to people like me that people want change, that they’re concerned…They also can communicate to our offices.”
He said American people actually have a lot of power and that members of Congress are influenced when they hear stories from constituents about how Trump’s actions are having a real negative impact on their lives — such as someone whose Social Security check didn’t come or a veteran unable to get a medical appointment.
“Believe it or not, anecdotes matter,” King said, “and so when people are in touch with us, if they are specific about what’s going on and what’s affecting them in their real life, that’s the kind of thing that breaks through with members of Congress — that their constituents are being hurt — and that’s one of the reasons I think we may see some progress on this over the next two or three weeks, because the damage that’s being done is just starting to manifest itself out in the communities.”
But, King acknowledged, he is “an optimist.”
As for Paul Revere, Maine is celebrating his midnight ride with a series of events that will feature the lighting of lanterns and lighthouses throughout the state. Organized by the Maine Semiquincentennial Commission, several of the ceremonies will include the reading of the famous 1861 poem by Portland native Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, “Paul Revere’s Ride,” which concludes:

So through the night rode Paul Revere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm,—
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.

They warned of budget problems if the Legislature continued to expend more money than collected in revenue. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A bullish revenue picture for state government in Kansas through the current and next fiscal years couldn’t sugarcoat projections the state budget could end up with a $730 million deficit by 2029 if lawmakers continued spending more than what was collected in revenue.
The new forecast released Thursday by the Consensus Revenue Group, which is responsible for updating financial reports twice each year, indicated the treasury could expect to collect $157 million more in the current fiscal year than projected in November. In addition, the state could receive $219 million more in the 2026 fiscal year than predicted six months ago. The state general fund takes in about $10 billion annually.
The estimating group said the state’s budget ending balance could sit at $2.29 billion at close of the current fiscal year in June, but fall to $1.73 billion in 2026, $903 million in 2027 and $63 million in 2028 before going under water by $730 million in 2029.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said the latest revenue estimates from university economists and state financial experts could be viewed as positive news.
“In reality, they underscore the seriousness of the financial predicament ahead,” Kelly said. “The bizarre and irresponsible budget gimmicks used by the Republican-led Legislature spend more than the state takes in by nearly $800 million per year. Ultimately, this will lead to a historically large budget deficit.”
She said the revenue update came one week after GOP House and Senate leaders adjourned the annual legislative session. Traditionally, the Legislature remained in session until the revenue forecast was updated so spending and tax policy could be refined.
“Kansans need to demand their legislators restore fiscal sanity and fairness when they return in January,” Kelly said.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Republican from Wichita, said the Legislature successfully assumed a more direct approach to developing the new state budget and produced a plan that spent less than recommended by the governor.
He said the Legislature was confident in the wisdom of the three-year, $1.2 billion income tax cut adopted in the 2024 special session and the additional tax relief approved in the 2025 regular session.
“Be wary of those who want to make political hay by invoking the budget boogeyman and screaming that the sky is falling,” Hawkins said. “These positive consensus revenue estimates reaffirm we’re headed down a smart and sustainable path as we continue to monitor all fiscal data as it’s available.”
 
A structural imbalance
Adam Proffitt, secretary of the Kansas Department of administration and budget director for the governor, state tax reductions and elevated spending were significant drivers of the state’s financial prospectus.
He said the extended assessment was that state revenue could remain below expenditures during the next four years unless a different approach was taken by state lawmakers.
“We need to get more structurally balanced,” Proffitt said. “This is something we’ve been watching for a couple years. I think the governor’s been pretty consistent in her message that we need to be showing fiscal restraint and making sure we have a good handle on expenditures and don’t grow them unnecessarily.”
Proffitt said the projected $800 million decline in state budget ending balances in fiscal years 2027, 2028 and 2029 would leave the state in dire financial condition. An unknown for forecasters, for a couple more months after close of tax season, was the influence of retroactive income tax cuts approved by the state lawmakers in 2024, he said. In addition, he said, the forecast changes didn’t take into account the influence of tax bills on Kelly’s desk nor possible federal policy shifts.
Shirley Morrow, director of the nonpartisan Kansas Legislative Research Department, said during a news conference at the Capitol the solution to the state’s future budget predicament was obvious.
“To me,” she said, “the simple answer — and this is going to be too simple — is increase revenue and decrease expenditures.”
Morrow said forces that could influence the state’s bottom line were tied to volatility in the U.S. economy. Factors capable of altering the fiscal assessment included persistently elevated inflation, trade policy changes relevant to agriculture exports and aviation manufacturing, shifting unemployment rates, sustained high interest rates, cuts in federal funding to states, monetary policy and geopolitical dynamics, she said.
“The reoccurring theme throughout the forecast cycle is an increased volatility in the state’s economy,” Morrow said.
She said the Kansas inflation rate in 2025 was raised from 2.3% to 2.9% while the estimate for inflation in 2026 was raised from 2.2% to 2.5%. Kansas has added 3,300 jobs over the year, she said.
In terms of agriculture, she said, crop producers continued to struggle with low commodity prices and high input costs. Livestock producers were looking to expand beef herds based on continued escalation in market prices, she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Proffitt-and-Morrow-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 11:03:16.031178

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A coalition of businesses and the state’s biggest police union are sparring over a New Jersey law meant to protect prosecutors, judges, and cops by shielding their home addresses and phone numbers from disclosure.
Businesses that use data for things like real estate, lending, fraud detection, background checks, and credit reporting say changes legislators made in 2023 to strengthen the law instead allowed data privacy companies to profit by suing and seeking damages from companies that don’t remove personal information from the internet. The businesses recently formed the Public Safety Information Protection Coalition to fight the state statute, known as Daniel’s Law.
The businesses asked a federal judge last June to declare Daniel’s Law an unconstitutional, impermissibly broad violation of the First Amendment. The judge rejected that challenge, and last month the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to review the judge’s ruling.
John Molinelli, a former Bergen County prosecutor, is the coalition’s spokesman.
“Daniel’s Law serves a noble purpose, but the law is broken,” Molinelli said in a statement last week.
The New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association wrote an open letter Wednesday to Molinelli, accusing him of falling prey to “the data industry’s latest ploy to avoid accountability for putting public servants in harm’s way.” The letter, signed by state PBA President Peter Andreyev and 43 leaders of other PBA chapters statewide, said members of the data business coalition “pretend to be advocates for Daniel’s Law while secretly seeking to undermine and weaken it.”
“They would rather spend millions of dollars spreading misinformation and lies than simply comply with a law meant to keep us and our families safe,” the letter says.
New Jersey enacted Daniel’s Law in 2020. It’s named after federal Judge Esther Salas’ son, Daniel Anderl, who was slain at the judge’s home that year by a gunman who wanted to harm Salas. Since state legislators passed the law soon after Anderl’s death, they have expanded it several times to protect additional public workers, including child welfare investigators.
Lawmakers amended it in 2023 to establish mandatory monetary damages for violations, among other things. The following year, Atlas Data Privacy Corp. filed 118 class-action lawsuits on behalf of law enforcement officers against data brokers accused of ignoring requests to remove the officers’ data from various websites.
Molinelli had called such lawsuits predatory, accusing Atlas of “engineering” the 2023 legislative amendments so that it could sue violators and reap the profits.
The PBA officials defended the lawsuits, saying the data brokers and businesses Molinelli represents continue to violate Daniel’s Law by selling law enforcement officers’ private information despite the ongoing litigation and officers’ pleas to them to stop.
“What you call ‘predatory lawsuits’ we call a fight to protect ourselves and our families from predators who seek to cause us harm,” the PBA officials wrote.
PBA officials have cited a leaked conference call, first reported by Politico earlier this month, during which data brokers and industry groups plotted how to weaken the law.
Molinelli, in a statement from a spokesman, said the PBA’s letter fails to address how best to protect public officials who do not want their personal information published.
“Many of those who signed this letter are friends of mine and I respect them greatly for what they do. Their misplaced efforts to attack me for wanting Daniel’s Law to work as intended are regrettably shrouded by the financial plans of Atlas Data Privacy Corporation,” he said.
Daniel’s Law has inspired similar legislation in other states, even though it has prompted several legal challenges here.
Still, legislators aim to expand it further.
One bill now in the Statehouse pipeline would extend privacy protections under Daniel’s Law to court administrators and deputy court administrators, while another would allow people protected under the law to use a post office box or address other than their home address on their driver’s license or other official identification cards.
Salas has recently said judges and their families have received unsolicited pizza deliveries from unknown persons — a signal, she says, that the people know where the judges live — and some of them are sent using her late son’s name.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)South Minneapolis along East Lake Street is a thriving immigrant neighborhood with block after block of family-run restaurants, churches and more businesses than you can shake a stick at, ordinarily serving a bustling foot traffic.  
As Sahan Journal reported not long after inauguration day, employees there are now scared to come to work. Customers are afraid to walk in the door. ICE raids and the threat of them frighten an entire populace witless, wreaking economic havoc.  
Undocumented immigrants already had to worry about being exploited by unscrupulous employers. 
In President Trump’s America, those who need protection are instead being targeted; the outrageous, mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador is just one example we know about. 
The U.S. Department of Justice, which not long ago prided itself on its independence, has now become a key lever in Trump’s effort to reverse the gains of the Civil Rights Movement. The first step was freezing the work of the Civil Rights Division, as the Washington Post first reported, “halting much of its investigative activity dating from the Biden administration and not pursuing new indictments, cases or settlements, according to a memo sent to the temporary head of the division.” 
That means stopping cases enforcing important civil rights statutes, like the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Here in Minnesota the changes are affecting federal oversight of the Minneapolis Police Department and its long history of unconstitutional policing, including off-the-charts levels of racial profiling as revealed in the 2023 DOJ report. 
What was catalogued in that report, former U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said, “made what happened to George Floyd possible.” After Floyd’s murder and days of ensuing carnage, it took nearly five years to put the federal police reform agreement in place. 
But Trump’s DOJ seems uncommitted to getting final approval. DOJ attorneys recently won a second 30-day stay on the pending consent decree case between Minneapolis and the federal government.
Trump’s right-wing pals are even pressuring him to pardon Derek Chauvin for his federal crimes. Thankfully, Trump can’t pardon the state murder charge. But still, expect all hell to break loose on Minneapolis streets should he issue the pardon for the federal civil rights charge.
Even if Trump holds off on the pardon, the prospects of a federal consent decree to oversee MPD aren’t great. The head of the once-proud DOJ Civil Rights Division is Harmeet Dhillon. As NBC News reported, Dhillon has “alleged fraud in the 2020 election, accused Google of discriminating against white men and spoken out against state laws to protect doctors who perform gender-affirming surgery for transgender minors.”
Luckily, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights already put its own agreement with the city of Minneapolis in place, but federal oversight would be good belt-and-suspenders insurance. 
Trump, who was once accused by the federal government of refusing to rent to Black tenants, issued an executive order “ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity,” which is double-talk, the effect of which is de facto legalized discrimination. 
“Federal civil-rights laws protect individual Americans from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, [protections supporting] equality of opportunity for all Americans. As President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced for the benefit of all Americans,” he wrote.  
He is, to be crass about it, taking a leak on our heads and calling it rain.
This gravely impacts women, racial and ethnic and religious minorities, lesbians and gays, not to mention the now frequently targeted transgender community. Everyone who isn’t a white heterosexual male and counts on established civil rights legislation is straight out of luck. The DOJ’s Civil Rights Division was created to protect citizens from the actions of bigots after the Civil War, enforcing the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution. They expanded that brief to protect other vulnerable folks. Now, contrary to Trump-speak, the DOJ is about the business of doing exactly the opposite.
A key area is the workplace, where women, Black and immigrant workers have made strides thanks to enforcement of anti-discrimination laws and, yes, diversity efforts by both the federal government and corporations. With Trump turning the clock back, Meta, Ford, McDonald’s, Walmart and Target all got in line. 
It took public outrage to restore recognition of the likes of the late Colin Powell, Jackie Robinson and other prominent Black veterans after Trump’s order to scrub government websites of “DEI,” i.e., Black achievement. 
Sadly, a prevailing reality is that some people of color like Justice Clarence Thomas — a disgrace to Thurgood Marshall’s legacy — will pull the ladder up after them. Where the clarion call once was “We shall overcome,” their credo is “I have overcome.” 
Erec Smith of the Koch-funded Cato Institute endorsed Trump’s sweeping edict, saying “the Trump administration isn’t getting rid of the concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion as they are typically understood. He’s getting rid of the critical social justice version, which is inherently divisive.”
A Trump executive order asserts, “The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination.” 
If you buy that, the proverbial bridge in Brooklyn is still available.

(Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)The Bible says pain and agony engulfed Jesus Christ in the final hours before his death, while fear of the future gripped his followers. 
Fear once again is prevalent in churches as Christians gather for Easter. This time it is because “roughly one in 12 Christians in the United States are vulnerable to deportation or live with a family member who could be deported.” 
That’s according to a new report, “One Part of the Body: The Potential Impact of Deportations on American Christian Families,” published by a coalition of Christian organizations.
“Many American Christians, we suspect, have not realized that among immigrants at risk of deportation, the vast majority — four out of five — are fellow Christians,” the report’s introductory letter said. 
Noem cheers court order requiring immigrants without legal status to register and carry documents

The report’s purpose “is to invite American Christians — within our congregations and within the halls of governmental power — to recognize that, if even a fraction of those vulnerable to deportation are actually deported, the ramifications are profound — for those individuals, of course, but also for their U.S.-citizen family members and, because when one part of the body suffers, every part suffers with it, for all Christians.”
Four South Dakotans with government power who could make a difference are U.S. Senators John Thune and Mike Rounds, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
Government action, or inaction as the case may be, is the source of great distress in churches today. 
“There is just a strong emphasis on fear,” among parishioners, said The Very Rev. Kristopher Cowles, vicar for Hispanic ministry in the Catholic Diocese of Sioux Falls. He also serves Our Lady of Guadalupe church in Sioux Falls. 
“They don’t know from day to day what is going to happen.”
Cowles is featured prominently in the report, which said that “80 percent of all of those at risk of deportation are Christians. Sixty-one percent of those at risk of deportation are Catholic, 13 percent are evangelical and 7 percent are adherents to other Christian traditions.”
The report notes that President Donald Trump said during his campaign there were as many as 20 million deportable immigrants present in the U.S. How many will be targeted for deportation is unknown. 
Noem, who said in a 2021 Newsmax interview that “our faith is everything — we love the Lord,” has been the tip of the spear in deporting immigrants.
The report quoted Cowles saying government policies often cause the problem. “So many of our laws make it nearly impossible to have a course forward even if they want to do so legally,” he said of immigrants. 
He wished there was more empathy among elected leaders. 
“I wish lawmakers would understand the sacrifices that so many people have gone through, and what so many of them are running from,” he said in the report. “Some are just looking for a better life and some are looking to just survive.”
Most people, the report said, want violent criminals and those with final orders of deportation to be the priority for immigration enforcement. But they don’t want blanket deportation. 
Reforming the immigration system must be a priority. Congress, which largely created this humanitarian problem, has the power to solve it.

Thune, Rounds and Johnson all say religion is central to their lives. 
Thune has said his faith in Christ is “the foundation for pretty much everything I do.” 
Rounds, in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, reflected on faith and his job. “I think part of it goes back to asking for wisdom and asking for the ability and the help to do what’s right, to make the right decisions. A lot of decisions are not black and white. It’s a matter of making the right decision long term. That saves lives. I think that’s something that all of us as Christians should be doing.”
Johnson has said “faith, family and freedom are pillars of our nation.”
Given their faith, and their powerful political positions and ability to influence this issue, they should not sit on the sidelines. It shouldn’t be that hard to sway Congress when 87% of voting members say they are Christians. 
Cowles reminded everyone that Jesus was an immigrant. “He made his way from Galilee and Judea into Egypt to flee the persecution of Herod.”
He pointed to the Catholic Church’s position on immigration. It says people have a right to migrate to sustain their lives and the lives of their families. It acknowledges that a country has a right to regulate its borders but that it should regulate them with “justice and mercy.”
“That is the issue we are running into right now,” he said.
Cowles added that Jesus “would stand with the immigrants because he understands the persecution of people.”
As Christians gather in churches this week and gaze at the image of Christ nailed to the cross, the authors of the “One Part of the Body” report have one wish.
“We hope that you will prayerfully ask the Lord what part you should play at a time when so many of your brothers and sisters are fearful of the impacts of deportation.”

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez held his mother in a tight embrace and wept following his release from the Leon County Jail Thursday evening, where the U.S. citizen was held after his arrest for illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien.”
An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.

The pair didn’t reunite until the evening, after Lopez-Gomez’s first court appearance earlier in the day. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans ruled Thursday morning that she lacked jurisdiction to release him because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him for 48 hours.
After Riggans’ inspection of his Social Security card and birth certificate, which an advocate waved in the courtroom, the judge said she found no probable cause for the charge.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
The arrest record the trooper filed states that Lopez-Gomez had said he was in the country illegally but that he had handed over his ID. There was no mention of the Social Security card on the arrest report. However, Lopez-Gomez told the Phoenix he had shown the trooper a copy of his Social Security card and Georgia state ID.
The HSI agent who took Lopez-Gomez to Wendy’s directed questions to a spokesperson, who didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment or questions as of this publication.
After the reunion with his mom, Lopez-Gomez returned to the parking lot of the jail, where 30 protesters had been demanding his release. They met him with cheers and hugs.
Lopez-Gomez will have to return to the Leon County Courthouse on May 6. He was charged under a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention.
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also made their first appearances on the same charge on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s voter-approved mandate for paid sick leave has not yet gone into effect, but some lawmakers are already trying to reduce the number of workers who would benefit from it.
A bill pending in the Alaska Legislature, House Bill 161, would exempt businesses with fewer than 50 employees, a change from the 15-employee threshold in the labor-rights initiative that voters approved in November. The bill would also drop seasonal workers from the mandate for accrued paid sick leave.The bill was introduced on March 28 by Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, with Rep. Julie Coulombe, R-Anchorage, as a co-sponsor. Both are members of the House minority. It has the support of a key majority member; House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, signed on as a co-sponsor on April 14.
It addresses Ballot Measure 1, a three-part citizen initiative that will raise Alaska’s minimum wage and protect workers against any employer-imposed political or religious meetings, as well as mandate paid sick leave, based on time accrued over work periods. Voters approved Ballot Measure 1 by a 58-42 percent margin. The new law is set to go into effect on July 1.
Ruffridge and Coulombe, during the bill’s first hearing on Wednesday, described the proposed changes as modifications that fit within the state constitution’s limits. While the constitution forbids sweeping changes within two years to any voter-passed initiatives, the bill “in no way seeks to repeal or change some of the key provisions of Ballot Measure 1,” chiefly the minimum-wage hike that was probably the most popular element, Ruffridge told the House Labor and Commerce Committee.
Coulombe said the changes amounted to a “few tweaks” that are necessary to help small businesses.
“What will happen if we don’t try to amend this a little bit, make the language a little cleaner and make it more adaptable to small businesses, we have small businesses that might actually just go out of business,” she told the committee.
The bill has the enthusiastic backing of the Alaska Chamber, a business group that campaigned against the ballot measure.
In testimony at Wednesday’s hearing of the House Labor and Commerce Committee, Kati Capozzi, the chamber’s president, called it a “vital correction” to a pending mandate that burdens small businesses, especially in the tourism and hospitality sectors.
“Maybe well-intentioned or maybe not, Ballot Measure 1 introduced a one-size-fits-all mandate that failed to account for Alaska’s unique economic landscape,” she said.
Echoing earlier comments by Ruffridge and Coulombe, Capozzi said voters were less aware of Ballot Measure 1’s sick-leave provisions than they were of the wage hike. “It’s become clear that many voters did not understand the true and full implications of the ballot measure,” she said.
One of the leaders of the Ballot Measure 1 campaign vowed to work against House Bill 161.
“For me, it’s really important that the voters will be respected here,” Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, said Thursday. “The voters have made this choice. The voters have said, ‘We would like this to happen.’ And whether or not the business groups can use a smaller group of people, the Alaska Legislature, to try to undo their will — that is something we will fight.”
Hall disputed the bill sponsors’ characterization of the changes as minor.
“This, in my mind, is a substantial change. It is repealing the benefit that the voters voted for,” she said.
She also disputed the contention that voters had not paid attention to the sick-leave provisions in the initiative.
“That is just silliness, because we were very clear that it was earned sick leave,” she said. “Almost all of our advertising was about that, so almost every single ad we put out was about somebody’s earned sick-leave benefit.”
She said she was expecting some pushback on the bill’s provisions, but not this soon.
“It’s a little bit shocking to me that it’s such an aggressive overreach of what the voters passed,” she said. “I’m not surprised that they’re going to fight us on this tooth and nail every single session, to try to claw it back. I’m a little surprised they’re starting before it’s even a law.”
Alaska was not the only state where voters in November approved a mandate for paid sick leave. Similar initiatives passed in Missouri and Nebraska.
Several other states already required paid sick leave prior to last year’s election.

It was supposed to be a trial that would be closely watched by California homelessness advocates, public defenders and legal experts. But instead, the case was thrown out by the judge — leaving some stakeholders wondering whether it makes sense to arrest homeless people at all.
As CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall explains, following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year granting local governments more authority to clear homeless encampments, cities across California have enacted more punitive policies banning public camping — including citing and arresting unhoused residents. 
But some attorneys and the unhoused residents they represent are eager to bring their cases before juries in order to demonstrate the shortcomings of enforcing camping bans and clear their names. That includes Wickey Two Hands, a 77-year-old homeless man who was poised to be the first person tried in court under Fresno’s anti-camping ban after police arrested him last year.
On April 10, however, a judge ended up dismissing all charges because the city waited too long to prosecute. 
The case’s conclusion underscores the considerable amount of time, labor and resources used — not only from the city and county, but also Two Hands’ lawyer, activists and local journalists — to enforce a policy that seeks to penalize public camping.

Ron Hochbaum, a law professor at the University of the Pacific: “When you think about all the people who were involved, from police to the city attorney’s office to judges and court clerks and so on. That’s probably hundreds of hours of work and thousands of dollars wasted. And that money would be better spent by simply offering Mr. Two Hands housing without arresting him.”

What will happen with new crop of CA crime bills?

In the aftermath of voters passing Proposition 36 in November to increase penalties for theft and other crimes, some Republican legislators have found their tough-on-crime bills are advancing further than before in a Legislature dominated by Democrats, reports CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
Senate GOP Leader Brian Jones of San Diego, for example, authored a bill that would add regulatory guardrails before the Department of State Hospitals releases sexually violent predators. In his fourth attempt to push the proposal, the Senate Public Safety Committee unanimously approved the bill earlier this month. Last year the proposal died in the Assembly after advancing through the Senate, and in previous years the bill never passed through committee. 
Jones says that after Prop. 36, he noticed a shift among Democrats and their attitudes toward stricter incarceration measures.

Jones: “The smart Democrats are getting it. The voters spoke overwhelmingly.”

But some criminal justice advocates don’t see it that way. Tinisch Hollins, the executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice, pointed out that the Legislature is also advancing bills the organization is sponsoring, including ones that would expand the state’s efforts to clear criminal records and require the California Department of Corrections to apply more good behavior credits to reduce prisoners’ time served.

Hollins: “Even Prop. 36 wasn’t a referendum on reform. There’s still plenty of support for different approaches to public safety that really address the root cause and prevent crime from happening in the first place.”

More federal attacks on CA college students

As part of President Donald Trump’s push to cut assistance to undocumented immigrants, his administration is revoking one vital policy that allows California to help students who don’t have legal status, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
In 2022 the federal TRIO programs — which provides financial assistance and counseling to low-income and first-generation college students — granted California special permission to also serve students who don’t have legal status. But in March, the U.S. Department of Education said it was revoking waivers to California colleges and universities that use federal funds to “provide services to illegal aliens.”
It’s difficult to track how many California college students lack legal status, but some data suggests that it could number in the thousands — most of whom attend community colleges. More than 100,000 California students are reportedly enrolled in TRIO programs.

Often, not much",Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/04/homeless-camping-california-trial/,"Wickey Two Hands was supposed to be the first person tried for camping in Fresno. Instead, after the city and county poured resources into his case, it was dismissed at the last minute.","In summary
Wickey Two Hands was supposed to be the first person tried for camping in Fresno. Instead, after the city and county poured resources into his case, it was dismissed at the last minute.


Wickey Two Hands sat at the defense table on a recent Thursday morning, holding in his lap the red baseball cap he’d doffed out of respect for the judge. 
The 77-year-old homeless man was supposed to be the first person tried in court under an ordinance Fresno passed last year making it a crime to camp in all public places. Over the past six months, he’d spent hours in a courtroom, arriving early for each hearing. He’d packed up and moved his campsite multiple times, trying to find out-of-the-way spots where he could avoid getting arrested again. 
But instead of sending Two Hands’ case before a jury, the judge — on the day trial was supposed to begin — dismissed all charges. The reason? The city waited too long to prosecute. 
Two Hands’ case shines a spotlight on a contradiction seen around the state in recent months. California cities are passing ordinances left and right that allow police to arrest or cite unhoused people for camping on their streets and sidewalks, or in their parks. Police are making arrests. But when it comes to prosecuting, trying or sentencing people for violating these ordinances, some cities haven’t been able to follow through. In many cases, prosecutors aren’t filing charges. If people are charged, their cases often are dismissed quickly. Two Hands’ case was a rarity for how close it came to trial. But in the end, it too was thrown out.
That has some wondering: what’s the point of arresting people at all?
Two Hands’ case was set to be a bellwether to see if Fresno’s camping ban — under which police have made several hundred arrests already — would hold up before a jury. The city and county — as well as Two Hands’ lawyer, activists and even local journalists — invested a considerable amount of resources in the case before it was ultimately dismissed last week without a trial or any public hearings on its merits.
“They wasted a lot of time and money pursuing this case,” said Ron Hochbaum, a law professor at the University of the Pacific who specializes in homelessness and poverty law. “When you think about all the people who were involved, from police to the city attorney’s office to judges and court clerks and so on. That’s probably hundreds of hours of work and thousands of dollars wasted. And that money would be better spent by simply offering Mr. Two Hands housing without arresting him.”

CalMatters analyzed the resources that went into prosecuting Two Hands’ case: 
At 8:40 a.m. on Oct. 14, 2024, two Fresno police officers came across Two Hands and his belongings on the side of the road and arrested him for camping in a public place and illegally possessing a shopping cart. 
Over the next six months, Two Hands attended four hearings in three different courtrooms. Before each hearing, he dropped off his belongings at a friend’s house and then caught the bus to the downtown Fresno courthouse, sometimes arriving as much as an hour early so he didn’t miss anything. After court, an advocate sometimes drove him back to his campsite. On April 10, the day his trial was supposed to begin, he missed work to attend court, skipping his scheduled shift at a wrecking yard and with it, his chance to earn money for food and other necessities for the day. 
City and county resources also went into each hearing. Public funds paid for the presence of a judge, a bailiff and staff from the city attorney’s office. The city brought on outside law firm Manning Kass to help prosecute the case. 
Kevin Little, a private attorney who specializes in civil rights litigation, signed on to defend Two Hands pro bono. Little estimates he spent between 100 and 150 hours on Two Hands’ case. He had two additional staff members helping him, and they put in another 50 to 100 hours. The week the case was supposed to go to trial, Little said he spent a couple nights working in his office until 3 a.m. 
“They wasted a lot of time and money pursuing this case.”Ron Hochbaum, law professor, University of the Pacific
Another attorney, Patience Milrod, was also in court on April 10. She was there to represent Pablo Orihuela, a Fresnoland journalist who had been covering Two Hands’ case and received a subpoena to testify on behalf of the prosecution. Attorney Karl Olson was standing by to contest a subpoena issued to Fresno Bee reporter Thaddeus Miller, according to the Bee.
In addition to Orihuela and Miller, journalists from CalMatters and ABC30 were there to cover the trial.
About two-dozen activists and local community members also showed up at the courthouse — some arriving as early as 7 a.m. despite work and childcare obligations — to support Two Hands on the day his trial was set to start. Activist Wes White drove two-and-a-half hours from Salinas to be there. 
After all that, Judge Brian Alvarez dismissed the case. He found that the trial should have started by March 6, and going past that date would violate Two Hands’ right to a speedy trial. Two Hands’ supporters filed out of the courtroom and filled the hallway, cheering, until a bailiff asked them to keep it down.

“I’m really shocked by how much money and resources they put into this,” said advocate Dez Martinez, who recently helped Two Hands get into a shelter. “There was so much money used in this so they can make a point because they don’t want to lose a case. It just bothers me that they used that (many resources) and finances into punishing Wickey instead of doing what I did: sit down and talk to him, figure out why does he not want to go inside.”
The trial originally was set to start Feb. 20, but the city asked for a delay, which was granted by Judge Carlos Cabrera. Judge Alvarez appeared to disagree with that ruling. 
The city blamed Two Hands’ team for the case getting thrown out. The defense’s subpoena request forced the city to review an extensive amount of documents, which took extra time, Deputy City Attorney Daniel Cisneros told the court. The city also had tried to prevent the case from going to trial by offering Two Hands a plea deal, which it said would come with a shelter bed. Two Hands declined, instead opting to try to clear his name through a trial. 
“The City’s position is to continue to offer plea deals to defendants who accept housing and services offered by the City,” the city attorney’s office said in an emailed statement from Noemi Schwartz. “It is unfortunate that this defendant declined the services and housing offered by City at a congregate shelter at Travel Inn and will likely end up back on the streets without shelter and assistance.”
Fresno’s new camping ordinance went into effect in September, making it a misdemeanor to sit, lie, sleep or camp in a public place. But most people arrested aren’t prosecuted, and even fewer come close to a trial. Fresno police made 322 arrests under that ordinance from October 2024 through January 2025. During that time, the city attorney’s office filed charges in just 132 camping cases. The defendant failed to show up in court in more than half of the cases in which charges were filed. Only one other case, in addition to Two Hands’, was listed as headed toward trial. 
It’s a similar situation in other cities, from the Bay Area to Southern California. Police in Los Angeles made 238 camping arrests last year, and the city attorney’s office declined to file charges in two-thirds of those cases. In San Francisco, nearly four in five illegal lodging arrests made since August 2024 have not resulted in charges, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
“Cities and district attorneys aren’t interested in prosecuting the cases because they know they don’t have enough room in jail and prisons to incarcerate everyone who is experiencing homelessness,” Hochbaum said. And they know slapping someone with a fine won’t stop them from sleeping outside, he said.
Instead, he said, many cities are using the threat of arrest to force unhoused people to move when they want to clear an encampment. 
For the time being, Two Hands is sleeping inside after five years on the street. Martinez said she got him a 90-day stay at a city-run shelter — with no help from the city attorney’s office. 
“(It’s) a pretty good day in my life,” Two Hands said outside the courthouse, after his case was dismissed. “77 seasons I’ve been here, you know, I think I deserve it.”
While Two Hands was hesitant to accept a shelter bed at first, Martinez said after spending months talking to him, getting to know him and showing up at his side to his court dates, she won his trust. She promised to keep fighting to get Two Hands into permanent housing, sign him up for Social Security, help him access health care, and get him whatever else he needs. 
“It’s not that he wants to stay outside,” Martinez said. “He’s tired. He doesn’t want to die on the sidewalk. He didn’t want to be given something and have it be taken away.”
Fresno still has yet to try anyone for sleeping outside, but that could change. Little is representing another unhoused man who was arrested for camping — and plans on bringing that case to trial. 
“I hope the message the city gets,” Little said, “is leave the unhoused alone. Help them and don’t prosecute them. But if you are going to choose unfortunately to prosecute these cases, then you better come ready, because we’re not backing down.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041025_Homeless-Case_AP_CM_35.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

Are Democrats shifting their way?,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/04/california-democrats-crime/,A California Republican state senator finds his crime bills getting a warmer welcome this year. Democrats say they’re just responding to their voters.,"In summary
A California Republican state senator finds his crime bills getting a warmer welcome this year. Democrats say they’re just responding to their voters.


Republican state Sen. Brian Jones has been trying to block sex offenders from being released from prison through California’s elderly parole program for several years. Last week, for the first time, his bill to do so made it out of its first committee. 
It was just one of many votes Senate Bill 286 will have to survive in a long road ahead in the Capitol, but it caught Jones’ attention. In a Legislature dominated by Democrats who often shelve Republican tough-on-crime proposals, the approval from the Senate Public Safety Committee was unanimous.
“I don’t think it would have passed a committee last year,” said Jones, the Senate minority leader.
California’s Democratic legislators — who for years have been passing progressive measures designed to reduce sentences and lessen mass incarceration by emphasizing more rehabilitative solutions to crime — were dealt a blow last fall when an overwhelming majority of voters approved Proposition 36. 
The measure backed by business owners, police and Republicans, increased sentences for some drug and theft crimes, partially undoing more lenient measures that voters approved just 10 years ago. Though many Democrats opposed the measure, they’re now tasked with providing funding to carry it out.
Jones, of San Diego, said he’s seeing Democrats inching toward stricter incarceration measures as a result. He said he saw a window to bring back the legislation this year.
“The smart Democrats are getting it,” he said. “The voters spoke overwhelmingly.”
The Public Safety Committee also gave unanimous approval this month for another bill Jones authored, SB 379, that would add regulatory guardrails before the Department of State Hospitals releases sexually violent predators. It’s his fourth year in a row pushing that measure; the proposal passed the Senate and died in the Assembly last year, after failing to clear a single committee both years before that. SB 432, authored by a different Republican senator to increase penalties for selling or giving fentanyl to minors, also got unanimous approval in the committee this month. 
Freshman Sen. Jesse Arreguín, an Oakland Democrat who chairs the committee, said his fellow Democrats don’t intend to return to an era of overcrowded prisons or harsh penalties for lower-level crimes. But he acknowledged they’re also shifting their thinking in response to their voters, and called that approach “pragmatic.”
“That was the direction I was given as chair of the Public Safety Committee, was that we need to provide more balance in terms of how we look at criminal justice policy,” he said, referring to the Democratic caucus. “Just focusing specifically on restorative justice and prevention, and not focusing on accountability (for offenders), that’s not where the voters are now.”
Criminal justice reforms still advancing
So far, the shift hasn’t been enough to worry Tinisch Hollins, executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice, a group that advocates for reduced imprisonment and pushed for the 2014 sentencing changes that voters approved.
She pointed to bills her organization has sponsored that are also advancing through the Legislature, including legislation to expand the state’s efforts to clear criminal records to give past offenders second chances, and to require that the California Department of Corrections apply more good behavior credits to reduce prisoners’ time served. With the state tight on cash, she said she doesn’t believe lawmakers will be eager to significantly increase imprisonment and sees a “consensus that we shouldn’t go back that way.”
“Even Prop. 36 wasn’t a referendum on reform,” Hollins said. “There’s still plenty of support for different approaches to public safety that really address the root cause and prevent crime from happening in the first place.”
Any stricter measures the Legislature approves this year will ultimately be narrow, with Republicans pointing to extreme examples to push their case.

Jones’ elderly parole bill targets a program the Corrections Department first created in 2014, in response to a court order to reduce prison crowding, that allows prisoners who are older than 60 and have served at least 25 years of their sentences to petition for release. 
He tried in 2019 to restrict those convicted of sex offenses from being eligible; the bill never got a hearing. In 2020, lawmakers quietly lowered the eligibility for some prisoners to age 50, if they’ve served at least 20 years, though many have not been approved for release. The following year, Jones proposed a bill undoing that change for sex offenders, which went nowhere.
Between January 2021 and June 2024, the Board of Parole Hearings released 1,762 people through the elderly parole program, corrections spokesperson Emily Humpal wrote in an email. Department data analyzed by CalMatters show that while more people have been released under the elder program since 2021, the rates at which the board grants parole fluctuate between 14% and 20% each year, hovering just above the board’s overall parole-granting rate. The department would not immediately provide a breakdown of their convictions, nor of how many of those released were between the ages of 50 and 60.
Now, 12,303 people currently imprisoned – nearly 14% of the prison population – are eligible for either form of elderly parole, Humpal said.
Jones’ bill would bar those convicted of sexual felonies such as rape and child sexual abuse from parole eligibility at age 50. It would not affect their eligibility upon turning 60, or the parole eligibility date in their original sentences. 
He also proposed blocking the earlier eligibility from people convicted of murder, but Arreguín’s committee removed that provision with Jones’ agreement before voting to advance the bill. 
Proponents of the measure, including San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan, say victims shouldn’t be forced to relive the trauma of parole hearings and the prospect of their abusers’ release before the end of their original sentences. 
They point to Mary Johnson, who identified herself as the childhood victim of rape and sexual abuse by her uncle. The abuser, Cody Klemp, was originally sentenced in the 1990s to 170 years. In 2023, under the elderly parole program, the Board of Parole Hearings recommended his release — then rescinded the decision last year. His next hearing is scheduled for 2029.
“Suddenly, I was no longer a 49-year-old woman, but I was a 13-year-old trapped and powerless and fighting again,” Johnson said in a press conference. “No victim’s family should have to fight over and over again to ensure that a dangerous predator serves the sentence that they were given.”
Closing the doors on the rehabilitated?
A group of criminal justice reform and civil rights advocates including the American Civil Liberties Union opposes the legislation, arguing it would close the door on those who have been rehabilitated in prison and pose less of a public safety risk. Studies have found the chances of re-offense decrease as a defendant ages. 
Gary Harrell, who was given a life sentence for his participation in a murder, testified that despite becoming eligible for parole in 1984, he wasn’t released until about 40 years later, after he had gone before the parole board about 20 times. He said in the last two decades of his incarceration, he turned his life around, and now works a day job while in his spare time giving homeless Sacramento residents food and hygiene products. 
“I have taken so much from others and now it’s time to give back and do my part to make the world a better place,” he said. “I hope you can see that the people who will be impacted by this bill are people like me who have changed and want to give back.”
Arreguín said he proposed removing Jones’ exclusion of people convicted of murder to focus the bill on sex offenses. 
That tactic has yielded bipartisan backing in the last legislative session.
In 2023, Republican Sen. Shannon Grove of Bakersfield pushed a bill to increase penalties for child sex trafficking. Democrats in the Assembly Public Safety Committee resisted but, after a public outcry, Gov. Gavin Newsom stepped in with rare public comments in support of the legislation, which ultimately won more Democratic support and his signature.
Last year Grove’s bill to increase penalties for soliciting a minor for prostitution — targeting the buyers of sex — also prevailed. Senate Democrats carved out exclusions for 16- and 17-year-olds who are allegedly solicited, out of concern it would inadvertently rope in older teenagers who aren’t actually involved in or victims of trafficking. (The legal age of consent is 18.) This year, Grove is turning heads with a bill, Assembly Bill 379, co-authored with an Assembly Democrat, to undo those exclusions and apply the changes to all minors. 
Jones acknowledged the tactic of focusing on sexual offenses is an incremental step toward tightening criminal sentences overall. 
“We’re smart enough to know how far we can go,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/031723-SAN-QUENTIN-REHABILITATION-CENTER-MHN-08-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

Why California shouldn’t give up hope,Chuck Bonham,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/salmon-fishing-shutdown-california-hope/,"The cancelation of the commercial salmon fishing season for the third consecutive year in California is a grim milestone, but there are glimmers of hope, a top wildlife official argues.","Guest Commentary written by

Chuck Bonham
Charlton H. Bonham is the director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.


This week, a public federal process determined there will be no commercial salmon fishing off California’s coast for the third year in a row. It’s a grim milestone for our state. 
While we will see some recreational ocean fishing, we’re at the low-water mark. With so few fish available, we know this won’t be enough to meet the demand of our state. That’s hard news in hard times.
Thirty years ago, the idea we would be implementing — yet alone discussing — these restrictions would have been unthinkable. Back then, millions of salmon swam through the rivers of California every year. It was a bountiful, thriving species.
But last year, the number of adult salmon in the Sacramento Index, a critical measure of the Sacramento River salmon population and an indicator of the overall health of California’s salmon, shrunk to roughly 100,000 fish. It’s a tiny fraction of salmon’s former might.
The reasons for the decline are numerous and complicated. Decades of severe drought, climate disruption, water management challenges and habitat loss threaten the future of salmon in California. The loss of salmon would wound California deeply.
Salmon are the basis of a multibillion-dollar fishing economy that creates jobs across the state. They support thriving forests, rivers and floodplains, and serve as one of the most popular seafood choices across the country. Salmon provide vital subsistence to numerous California Tribes. Recreational salmon fishing trips form the basis of family legend and lore.
For the salmon lovers among us, these are dark times. But I see glimmers of hope.
Two weeks ago, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife revealed the progress on California’s “Salmon Strategy for a Hotter, Drier Future.” It was an update on the strategy Gov. Gavin Newsom released last year, which outlined dozens of key action items the state must take to better support healthy salmon populations.
In the last year alone, state fish and wildlife and its partner agencies have made critical headway on nearly 70% of the action items set by Gov. Newsom. Another 26% are already done.
California finished removing the outdated and obsolete Klamath River dams, allowing for a free-flowing river and access to cold-water habitats blocked for more than a century.
California’s initiative to fast-track approvals for salmon restoration projects led to the streamlining of more than 60 important projects to support salmon populations over the past year.
Fish and wildlife has also worked with the State Water Resources Control Board to develop flow recommendations in drought-prone watersheds like the Scott and Shasta rivers and Mill and Deer creeks, ensuring salmon populations have enough cold water to survive during dry periods.
Investments to expand and modernize the state’s fish hatcheries, ensuring California is supporting the production of a resilient salmon population, have increased fall run production from state-operated hatcheries in the Central Valley by over 9.7 million fish.
The state’s salmon strategy was designed for long-term salmon support. But we’re already seeing early benefits, some that even surprised fish and wildlife officials. Ten days after the final Klamath dam came down, state scientists spotted salmon swimming north of the dam sites into Oregon. 
Experts originally estimated that would take 10 years.
Data shows that, while salmon numbers from 2024 are down, California saw the highest number of jacks (2-year-old fish) returning to the Central Valley since 2019. Jacks are an important predictor of the number of adult salmon that will return to spawn the following year.
In Lagunitas Creek, there’s been a 60% increase in spawning of endangered Coho salmon. In Mendocino County, adult coho returns have almost quadrupled their 15-year average.
To be clear, these wins are just the beginning. The road to reviving California salmon will be long. But these successes give me hope and the drive to keep fighting for salmon.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/110723-Yreka-And-Klamath-Falls-LV_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

(Photo: Alejanda Rubio/Nevada Current)President Donald Trump’s efforts to carry out mass deportations and detain legal permanent residents and green card recipients has created increased “fear and uncertainty” throughout the state, immigrant groups have told Nevada lawmakers. 
Two bills proposed this session, which recently passed out of committee, seek to provide a measure of reassurance to anxious families. One would protect students from being taken from school by immigration officials. Another would establish a procedure for families to select potential temporary guardians if parents are deported. 
“While we may not have control over the events that are unfolding on a national scale, we do have the power to make a meaningful impact within our own communities,” Noé Orosco, the Government Affairs Manager with Make the Road Nevada, told lawmakers in March. 
The Trump administration has defied court orders seeking to restrict aggressive federal immigration tactics, and rescinded long-standing policies that prohibit immigration enforcement in “sensitive” places such as schools, churches, and hospitals.
‘Afraid to attend school’
Assembly Bill 217 would prohibit school employees from granting permission to immigration officers to enter a school, or provide student records, including information on a student’s family, without a warrant.
“Across the nation, we have seen instances where officers have gone to schools and have intimidated teachers, staff and students,” said Democratic Assemblymember Cecelia González, who sponsored the bill. “This is really a response to the fears of our students, staff and families and mixed-status families.”
González, who presented the bill to the Assembly Education Committee in March, said Clark and Washoe county school districts already have existing policies to prevent employees from granting permission to immigration enforcement officials seeking to enter a school.
The bill would simply codify that policy and ensure other districts throughout the state follow suit. 
González sought to make a violation of the law a misdemeanor, which received pushback from Nevada Association of School Boards.
The bill was amended so the first violation “will be disciplined under the discretion of each school district.” School employees could face a misdemeanor charge for any subsequent violation. 
The original version of the bill also prevented school police from using tasers and “chemical agents” such as pepper spray on students but was edited out of the legislation to focus on immigration enforcement. 
Orosco, who presented the bill alongside González, said the legislation was needed to address “an overwhelming sense of fear and uncertainty, particularly those who come from mixed-status families.”
The anxiety students feel about losing a parent to deportation, or being taken as well, “follows them into the classroom where it severely impacts their ability to concentrate and engage in learning,” he said.
“Many students are afraid to attend school because they worry about their family safety,” he said. “The thought of immigration enforcement officers potentially being present on campuses creates an environment of distress.” 
AB 217 passed out of committee in late March with only Republican Assemblymember Richard Delong opposed.
“My concern with the bill, and I will be a no on this, is because there’s a chance that federal law could change in the future and thus we set up a situation where no matter what a school official does, they’re going to be in violation of one law or another,” he said. “I don’t want to put anyone in that position”
Democratic Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett, the committee chair, pointed out that “federal law can change at any point, and our state laws could be a violation of federal law at any point.”
‘Solutions that prioritize family unity’
González, along with Democratic state Sen. Fabian Doñate, are also sponsoring Assembly Bill 460 that seeks a streamlined process for selecting a temporary guardian for minors prior to any immigration action.
“I think there’s some value in the fact that individuals were coming to us with this solution, and so that’s why we’re putting that bill forward,” Doñate said during the March bill hearing.
Nevada is home to one of the largest populations of mixed-status families in the country, González said at the hearing.
A 2020 report published by the American Immigration Council estimated that “about one in seven children in the state was a U.S. citizen living with at least one undocumented family member.” Some estimates put that number in Nevada at one in 10 households 
Both figures make it likely that throughout the state “that in every single one of our districts there are hard working families that pay taxes and contribute to our community, yet live with the daily fear of separation,” González said. 
The legislation, which passed unanimously out of committee last week, would establish a form for parents or guardians to nominate a temporary guardian for a minor. 
The form would need to be signed by the parent or guardian, two “impartial adult witnesses” and notarized before being placed in the Nevada Lockbox, an electronic registry maintained by the Nevada Secretary of State.
The legislation would require “a court to consider the form requesting to nominate a guardian of a minor in determining which person is most suitable to be the guardian for the minor,” González said. 
“Regardless of where we stand on immigration policy, we can all agree that children should not bear the brunt of these challenges,” González said. “As policymakers, we have a responsibility to provide solutions that prioritize family unity, stability and the well being of our most vulnerable children.”
The original version of the bill also sought to expand eligibility for welfare support assistance for children living with guardians if an immigration order led to their separation. It also allocated $2 million to the Nevada’s Department of Education for the Trauma Recovery Grant Project, which provides funding for trauma support for children.  
Both were removed from the bill. 
“It’s not lost on me the conversations that we’ve been having about our state’s budget and what that is going to look like this session and beyond,” she said. “If we have the opportunity to include (the funding), we would love to.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CeciliaGonzalez-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) was finally able to meet Thursday night with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Beltsville resident who was erroneously deported last month to his native El Salvador, where he has been held incommunicado in that country’s megaprison for terrorists.
The meeting followed two days of attempts by Van Hollen to see Abrego Garcia, including an attempt earlier Thursday when soldiers turned away him and Chris Newman — the lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s wife and his mother — at a checkpoint about 3 kilometers away from the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, where Abrego Garcia is being held.
Van Hollen said that while the soldiers allowed other cars to pass, they said they had “been ordered not to allow us to proceed any further than that point.”
It is unclear what led to the the change in policy, but Van Hollen posted a photo on social media after 9 p.m. Thursday of him talking with Abrego Garcia.
“I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance,” Van Hollen said in his post. “I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.”
Abrego Garcia, seen in the photos in jeans, a checkered shirt and a Kansas City Chiefs ballcap, appears healthy. It was a different look than the shaved heads, baggy white shorts and T-shirts and Crocs or sandals that CECOT inmates are wearing in most photos of the facility.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who insisted during a White House meeting Monday with President Donald Trump that his country had no intention of releasing Abrego Garcia, trolled Van Hollen with his own social media posts of the meeting shortly before the senator’s Thursday. Bukele mockingly referred to Abrego Garcia “miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture,’ now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador.”
“Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody,” Bukele posted.
Van Hollen unsuccessfully sought a meeting when Bukele was in Washington, and again when he traveled to El Salvador Wednesday. He was able to meet instead with Salvadoran Vice President Félix Ulloa, who denied his requests Wednesday to either visit or speak on the phone with Abrego Garcia.
The Maryland Democrat arrived in the Central American country Wednesday in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia, whom the Justice Department admitted in court was deported in error, back to the United States, or at least check on his wellness.
A U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 allowing Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant in the U,S., to daus here because sending him back to his home country would put him in grave danger from gangs there that he said caused him to flee in the first place.
Van Hollen said that since Abrego Garcia was sent to CECOT, he had not spoken with anyone outside of the prison walls until their meeting Thursday. “This inability to communicate with his lawyers is a violation of international law,” Van Hollen had said earlier Thursday.
The senator pointed out that El Salvador is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
“That covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,’” he said.
Van Hollen also said he met with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and they discussed “the full range of important bilateral relations between the United States and El Salvador.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other Republicans have criticized Van Hollen for making the trip, repeating the accusation that Abrego Garcia is a gang member.
Representatives for the White House and DHS did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.
Appeals court slams administration’s inaction
Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s case continues to work its way through U.S. courts as a flashpoint conflict between two branches of government that has led to the precipice of a constitutional crisis.
On Thursday, a federal appeals court panel dismantled the administration’s latest appeal, saying the government had done “essentially nothing” to attempt to return Abrego Garcia in compliance with last week’s Supreme Court order.
A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said the executive branch was due deference in conducting foreign policy, but that the administration’s inaction in seeking Abrego Garcia’s return amounted to defiance of a judicial order.
The unanimous ruling was written by 4th Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan. The other two judges, Robert Bruce King and Stephanie Thacker, were nominated by Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done,” the panel wrote. “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”
The appeals ruling responded to the government’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ order this week for the Trump administration to offer evidence on how it has sought to help with Abrego Garcia’s release from CECOT.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” — but stopped short of requiring — his return to the United States.
In unusually frank language, the 4th Circuit panel warned Thursday the conflict between the executive and judicial branches threatened the foundation of U.S. government.
“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” the court asked. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present.”
Near the end of the order, the panel urged the administration to obey the judicial branch.
“We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos,” the judges wrote. “This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.”
Neither country taking action
The 4th Circuit panel pointed out that the leaders of both the United States and El Salvador claimed they had no power to return Abrego Garcia.
“We are told that neither government has the power to act,” they wrote. “The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.”
During a White House visit this week, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he would not bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.
The Trump administration has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error.” The administration continues to accuse him of being part of the gang MS-13, despite no charges or convictions of any criminal offenses against him, including gang-related crimes.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Utah has rates of sexual violence that often trump the national average — according to the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office, 1 in 3 Utah women will experience sexual violence, compared to 1 in 5 women nationally.  
Yet this year, the state’s service providers are forced to fundraise and solicit federal money, which is increasingly short supply, after lawmakers snubbed the Utah Coalition Against Sexual Assault’s request for funding that would have gone to the state’s rape crisis programs. According to the request, the money was intended to provide “meaningful sexual prevention work,” like education and training. 
“Prevention education works. It can change the way individuals think. It can change the way communities interact. It changes relationships. It is the least funded source of service for victims in the state of Utah,” said Gary Scheller, associate director of the Rape Recovery Center.
The coalition asked lawmakers for almost $3.3 million — the Legislature’s Social Services Appropriations Committee recommended just over $1.6 million. But ultimately, funding for the coalition was not included in the final budget.

Now, with April being Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Scheller’s nonprofit, which provides advocacy for victims, clinical therapy, education and training, will be forced to fundraise and look to the federal government to fill the void.  
Lawmakers said it was a tight budget year, and a number of programs never received funding. Still, some of the programs funded by the state’s nearly $30 billion budget include $40 million in annual funds for the Utah Fits All Scholarship voucher program, $20 million in one-time funding for the state’s first-time home buyer program, and dozens of other programs and allocations that cost far more than what the Coalition Against Sexual Assault was asking for. 
“What I would like to say really loudly to our state Legislature is, what you fund reflects your priorities,” Scheller said on Thursday during an event at the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office marking Sexual Assault Awareness Month. “So when we see millions going here and millions going there and this being cut and that being cut, that is equivalent to the state Legislature saying, these are our priorities, these not so much.”
The Utah Domestic Violence Coalition is in a similar boat, after their request for $200,000 in annual funds was also left out of the state’s budget. The money would have allowed police departments around the state to continue to administer a critical health care service for victims of domestic violence while bolstering investigations.
Legislature snubs funding for domestic violence health care service, forcing nonprofit to fundraise

Scheller said the lack of state funds will have a “significant” impact to the Rape Recovery Center.  
The center, and other sexual assault support programs, have been sharing a $600,000 allocation from the state spread out over three years — for the Rape Recovery Center, that’s about $15,000 to $20,000 each year, according to Scheller. 
Now that the Legislature snubbed their request this year, Scheller said education and prevention programs, which are already underfunded, will continue to be spread thin. 
“These prevention and education programs, with state school board approved curriculum, where we can get into schools and talk to students about consent and healthy relationships — those will be greatly minimized. So now we’re going to go looking for other ways to continue to do that,” Scheller said. 
Sex crimes continue to be an issue in Utah. According to Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill, 88 out of 100 women who are sexually assaulted in Utah will choose not to come forward. Of the 12 that do report the crime, six will likely be re-victimized “though the way that we respond to them,” Gill said. “Because we’re not trauma informed, because we’re not victim centered.” 
Data from Gill’s office shows the extent of sexual violence in the county, which fluctuates year to year. 
The office filed 81 rape charges in 2023, compared to 89 in 2024; 51 object rape charges in 2023, compared to 54 in 2024; 22 rape of a child charges in 2023, compared to 10 in 2024; 104 sex battery charges in 2024, compared to 72 in 2024; 100 lewdness charges in 2023, compared to 90 in 2024; 35 sodomy of a child charges in 2023, compared to 26 in 2024; and 20 aggravated sexual assault charges in 2023, compared to 15 in 2024. 
“I hope this encourages our policymakers to know that they need to fully fund our institutional partners and our community partners,” Gill said.

Drummond and other House Democrats filibustered the House's agenda, saying it would not ""move Alabama forward."" (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Tensions mounted in the Alabama Legislature Thursday as Republicans pushed through several bills dealing with religion and targeting LGBTQ+ Alabamians and immigrants. 
The legislation passed despite attempts from minority Democrats in both chambers to counter passage of the legislation. In the Senate, the majority GOP used cloture petitions and procedural moves to effectively prevent Democrats from debating the measures.  
Speaking after the House adjourned Thursday, Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, said HB 437, sponsored by Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, establishing a shark alert system and the first bill on the agenda, was the exception to a day where time “was spent on things that will not move Alabama forward.” 
Other than that, the agenda consisted of an expansion of the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law; a ban on drag performances; a mandate for displaying the Ten Commandments in public schools; a bill allowing local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws and a bill renaming the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.”
Drummond said the Legislature should be preparing for cuts to federal spending proposed by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. The possible reduction include more than $800 million to Alabama Medicaid, a cornerstone of health care in the state. 
“We’ve got about, what about less than 10 days left in this session. And when we leave and those cuts happen, our children, as well as the citizens of Alabama, are going to be left with no recourse,” Drummond said. “What will they do? How will we fill these holes?”
High tension in the Senate
The atmosphere in the Senate became tense as majority Republicans clotured debate six times and kept Democratic senators from speaking on bills. Republican senators spoke at length on each of their own bills and asked for their bills to be read at length after calling for cloture, effectively excluding Democrats from debate for most of the Thursday session.
That led to a brief, heated exchange between Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, and Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth. Singleton, who tried to get Ainsworth’s attention several times, asked what he needed to do to be recognized.
“Do we have to shout?” Singleton asked.
Ainsworth maintained Singleton was out of order and he would be recognized when appropriate.
“Here’s the deal – It’s my decision who to recognize. For seven years, right now seven years, since I’ve been in here, always to the sponsor and I always go back to the sponsor and I’m going to continue doing that,” Ainsworth said to Singleton.
Senate Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said in a statement sent during the session that “Senate Republicans are serious about promoting conservative policies.”
“Senate Republicans are holding the line. We’re standing up for Alabama families and fighting for the values that make this state such a special place to live, work, worship, and raise children,” Gudger said in the statement.

‘Fundamentally unconstitutional’

Democrats in the House got more opportunities to speak, though Republicans clotured debate on the “Gulf of America” bill.
Thursday was the 23rd day of the 2025 legislative session. The Legislature can meet for up to 30 days in a 105-day calendar period. The last day the Legislature can meet is May 20. 
“The Legislature is not taking any action. The leadership of the state has not taken any action to put forth information so we can be working on a plan to help the people in our town, our state, absorb some of these cuts, or we rearrange some of the things we are doing to make up for some of the things that’s going to be lost,” Rep. Sam Jones, D-Mobile, said.
Rep. Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, criticized the agenda, saying most of the bills would end up in court and cost Alabama over $500,000, like previously challenged laws. 
“The number one thing that we did today was taxpayers money by passing out of this house bills that are fundamentally unconstitutional on its face,” Tillman said. “There will be a ton of challenges to these bills if they become law.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9167-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

“This bill will expand the existing prohibitions that are currently in K-5 schools on the classroom discussions of gender identity or sexual orientation,” he said.

The chamber adopted a committee substitute 76-8 that removed a portion of the bill that would prohibit educators from referring to students by their preferred gender if it conflicts with their assigned sex at birth.
Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, objected to the measure, saying kids would be less receptive to learning if they did not feel welcome in a classroom. 
“If they don’t trust a teacher, if they think a teacher doesn’t like them or use them differently or views them as unequal, they’re not going to be as open to learning,” he said.
Gidley rebutted, saying students could still confide in a teacher, but the teacher has to stick to the curriculum during instructional time. He said he has received complaints from a student that said their teacher could not teach without mentioning “all things gay and transgender.” He did not say, and has previously declined to say, which school this happened in.
“That is not part of the curriculum, or what the parents signed up for, and not what the parents are paying for,” he said.
Rep. Neil Rafferty, D-Birmingham, the only openly gay member of the House, used his debate time to address LGBTQ+ Alabamians.
“I want you to know you are not the problem. You are not broken, and you’re absolutely not alone,” Rafferty said. “They’re not theories. They’re not talking points, not threats to be neutralized. They’re people. They’re Alabamian, and they deserve better than what we are offering them right now.”
The bill now moves to the Senate.
The House also passed a bill that prohibits public schools and libraries from hosting drag performances in the presence of children without parental consent.
HB 67, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, passed 76-9 with no discussion. The legislation defines drag performances as “a performance in which a performer exhibits a sex identity that is different from the sex assigned to the performer at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers.”
The bill now moves to the Senate.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), right, meets with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident who was erroneously deported to El Salvador by ICE agents last month. (Photo courtesy Sen. Van Hollen)Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) was finally able to meet Thursday night with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident who was erroneously deported last month to his native El Salvador, where he has been held incommunicado in that country’s megaprison for terrorists.
The meeting followed two days of attempts by Van Hollen to see Abrego Garcia, including an attempt earlier Thursday when soldiers turned away him and Chris Newman — the lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s wife and his mother — at a checkpoint about 3 kilometers away from the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, where Abrego Garcia is being held.
Van Hollen said that while the soldiers allowed other cars to pass, they said they had “been ordered not to allow us to proceed any further than that point.”
It is unclear what led to the the change in policy, but Van Hollen posted a photo on social media after 9 p.m. Thursday of him talking with Abrego Garcia.
“I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance,” Van Hollen said in his post. “I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.”
Abrego Garcia, seen in the photos in jeans, a checkered shirt and a Kansas City Chiefs ballcap, appears healthy. It was a different look than the shaved heads, baggy white shorts and T-shirts and Crocs or sandals that CECOT inmates are wearing in most photos of the facility.
Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who insisted during a White House meeting Monday with President Donald Trump that his country had no intention of releasing Abrego Garcia, trolled Van Hollen with his own social media posts of the meeting shortly before the senator’s Thursday. Bukele mockingly referred to Abrego Garcia “miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture,’ now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador.”
“Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody,” Bukele posted.
Van Hollen unsuccessfully sought a meeting when Bukele was in Washington, and again when he traveled to El Salvador Wednesday. He was able to meet instead with Salvadoran Vice President Félix Ulloa, who denied his requests Wednesday to either visit or speak on the phone with Abrego Garcia.
The Maryland Democrat arrived in the Central American country Wednesday in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia, whom the Justice Department admitted in court was deported in error, back to the United States, or at least check on his wellness.
A U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 allowing Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant, to stay in the U.S. because sending him back to his home country would put him in grave danger from gangs there that he said caused him to flee in the first place.
Van Hollen said that since Abrego Garcia was sent to CECOT, he had not spoken with anyone outside of the prison walls until their meeting Thursday. “This inability to communicate with his lawyers is a violation of international law,” Van Hollen had said earlier Thursday.
The senator pointed out that El Salvador is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
“That covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,’” he said.
Van Hollen also said he met with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and they discussed “the full range of important bilateral relations between the United States and El Salvador.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other Republicans have criticized Van Hollen for making the trip, repeating the accusation that Abrego Garcia is a gang member.
Representatives for the White House and DHS did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.
 Appeals court slams administration’s inaction

Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s case continues to work its way through U.S. courts as a flashpoint conflict between two branches of government that has led to the precipice of a constitutional crisis.
On Thursday, a federal appeals court panel dismantled the administration’s latest appeal, saying the government had done “essentially nothing” to attempt to return Abrego Garcia in compliance with last week’s Supreme Court order.










“This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”


– 4th Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III



	A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said the executive branch was due deference in conducting foreign policy, but that the administration’s inaction in seeking Abrego Garcia’s return amounted to defiance of a judicial order.
The unanimous ruling was written by 4th Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan. The other two judges, Robert Bruce King and Stephanie Thacker, were nominated by Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done,” the panel wrote. “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”
The appeals ruling responded to the government’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ order this week for the Trump administration to offer evidence on how it has sought to help with Abrego Garcia’s release from CECOT.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” — but stopped short of requiring — his return to the United States.
In unusually frank language, the 4th Circuit panel warned Thursday the conflict between the executive and judicial branches threatened the foundation of U.S. government.
“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” the court asked. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present.”
Near the end of the order, the panel urged the administration to obey the judicial branch.
“We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos,” the judges wrote. “This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.”
 Neither country taking action

The 4th Circuit panel pointed out that the leaders of both the United States and El Salvador claimed they had no power to return Abrego Garcia.
“We are told that neither government has the power to act,” they wrote. “The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.”
During a White House visit this week, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he would not bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.
The Trump administration has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error.” The administration continues to accuse him of being part of the gang MS-13, despite no charges or convictions of any criminal offenses against him, including gang-related crimes.

SB 5, sponsored by Sen. Chris Elliot, R-Josephine, would remove the board’s appointing authority and increase its membership by one, from 16 to 17 members. The governor would be the appointing authority for most seats, including members from each congressional district, with eight at-large appointments coming from the speaker, president pro tempore, and the minority leaders of the House and Senate.
“What this bill does is make those appointments not self-appointments, where they may continue to appoint themselves or their friends, but rather appointments from other elected officials that are accountable to the people of the state of Alabama,” Elliot said on the floor.

The Department of Archives & History did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Currently, the Alabama Department of Archives and History has two trustees from each congressional district and two additional at-large members, plus the governor or their designees. The Senate must approve each appointment, which Elliot kept in the proposed bill.
Elliot said when introducing the bill that while the governor gets a majority of appointments, he tried to ensure geographical diversity and kept “standard diversity language … to assure that the membership of the board is inclusive and reflects the racial, gender, geographic, urban and rural and economic diversity of the state.”
Senate Republicans killed debate on every bill Thursday, and Democrats did not have a chance to speak on the board legislation. After the Senate adjourned, Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, said that “this is all about DEI” and that the board has not done anything wrong to warrant the restructuring.
“This is a board that allowed someone, a third party, to come in to be able to utilize their facilities to be able to do history about gay and lesbians in this state. That’s what this is all about,” Singleton said.
Elliot was one of several Republicans who attacked the Archives Department for hosting a presentation on LGBTQ+ history in Alabama in June 2023, claiming the board is not accountable to elected officials, calling it a “unicorn.”
Elliott then introduced a bill in the redistricting special session in mid-2023 to strip Archives of $5 million, which did not pass.
He also introduced a similar bill for the 2024 legislative session that would have given state officials and legislative leaders the power to appoint board members, while keeping the board size the same. The bill passed the Senate and a House committee but did not reach the House floor.

In response to economic uncertainty, the University of Missouri System is imposing immediate hiring restrictions, purchasing controls and slowing spending.
The cost-saving measures, which aim for a minimum $16 million in savings for fiscal year 2025, were presented Thursday at the Board of Curators meeting in Rolla.
While the system “remains well positioned with a strong balance sheet,” broader pressures on the higher education sector are spurring such cuts, said Ryan Rapp, UM System executive vice president for Finance and Operations.
One of the key concerns is potential cuts to federal research funding, such as those from the National Institutes of Health.
“NIH is the largest funder of university research throughout the United States. And so to replace the level of funding that potentially can be at risk is very significant,” UM System President Mun Choi said. “We will continue to make the case to NIH and other agencies and educate them on the value of our research so that the funds will continue to flow to the University of Missouri.”
Part of the system’s financial strategy, Rapp said, is keeping administrative spending low and maintaining current academic spending.
The system spends just over a quarter of its labor budget on administration, Rapp said, compared to a 38.5% benchmark average. Additionally, 56.8% of its labor budget is allotted to academics, exceeding the 52.5% average at peer institutions.
The University of Missouri has also cut educational expenses per degree awarded by 20% since 2017, according to Rapp’s report. More “moderate” tuition increases are expected, with state appropriations projected to rise by 1.5%. The curators increased tuition by 5% for all undergraduates in May 2024, and will vote on tuition and fee rates for fiscal year 2026 at its May meeting.
Even amid the UM system’s economic stress, Choi boasted increased application rates for fall 2025 at all four universities. First-time college applications showed double-digit increases with MU at 12%, the University of Missouri-Kansas City at 15%, Missouri University of Science and Technology at 15% and the University of Missouri-St. Louis at 5%.
“We are very proud of the work that our faculty, staff and administrators have done to share the message that we provide a very high-quality, affordable education at our universities,” Choi said.
The curators also approved two new degree programs at the meeting: a doctoral program in human development and family science at MU and a masters in geospatial engineering at Missouri S&T.
MU’s Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory building was officially renamed the Dr. Dan Brown Building, in honor of the late veterinarian and former state senator.
Board Chair Todd Graves highlighted recent system milestones, including the April 2 ribbon cutting for a 47,000 square foot addition to the MU’s research reactor and the Wednesday groundbreaking of a 127,000-square-foot Bioplex research hub at Missouri S&T.

“If we want people to work and pay off tax debt, we can’t take their driver’s license in the meantime,” said Jeff Gentes, a lawyer with the Connecticut Fair Housing Center specializing in fair lending and foreclosure issues. “It’s an abuse of government power.”
Violette Haldane, executive director of Advocacy to Legacy, a Hartford nonprofit that teaches youth leadership and civic engagement, said the bill pending before the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee is “very punitive.
“And to take away someone’s driver’s license [when] that has nothing to do with driving, nothing to do with safety, just seems so wrong.”
The bill raised by the committee is designed to whittle down state government’s estimated $3 billion tax gap — the margin between what it’s owed and what it currently collects.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration reported the 2022 tax gap in January as directed by the legislature. It also notified legislators that the Department of Revenue Services is facing a real challenge in resources.
DRS Commissioner Mark Boughton said the department is seeking authorization to hire attorneys to help with collections from delinquent taxpayers who have left Connecticut. Boughton said the state faces “thousands of thousands” of cases like this, with an aggregate outstanding debt of about $258 million.
But critics note the committee’s bill is much broader in scope than the tax department’s current request.
First, it authorizes DRS to contract with collection agencies as well as with lawyers. Second, they can use these to pursue delinquents residing both in and out of Connecticut.
Legislators balked three years ago when the Lamont administration sought permission to sell delinquent tax debt to private collection agencies.
The Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent office within the IRS, classified privatized collections as one of the IRS’ “most serious problems” in its 2017 report to Congress.
About 44% of all taxpayers targeted by private collection agencies on behalf of the IRS “are at risk of economic hardship,” according to the report. And the median income of households targeted by collection agencies that later entered into installment agreements to repay their debt was $38,021 per year.
“With unacceptable frequency,” the Taxpayer Advocate Service added, “taxpayers whose debts are assigned to PCAs [private collection agencies] are placed in installment agreements they cannot afford.”
Critics also noted that while Connecticut continues to explore using collection agencies that target poor households, its history with wealthy tax delinquents is marked by extreme patience.
The state offered seven tax amnesty programs — a benefit typically used by households and businesses that can afford specialized legal counsel or accounting services — between 1990 and 2021. That means once every 4.6 years, on average, the state waives certain penalties on overdue filers to enhance revenue collections.
Besides raising the issue of collection agencies, the new legislation also stipulates that once a filer’s tax payment is overdue for 30 days, the state would notify that person that in another 60 days, the delinquent status would be reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
The license wouldn’t be suspended. But unless the taxpayer successfully appeals the matter, the DMV “shall not issue or renew” that person’s license or vehicle registration until delinquent taxes, including interest and other penalties, have been paid.
Gentes, who also supervises a clinic at Yale Law School, said that provision — like the option to employ collection agencies — is designed chiefly to intimidate low-income residents who lack the resources to overcome a temporary loss of transportation.
“We should not be using government to punish poor people,” he added.
The committee drafted the measure largely in response to the administration’s tax gap report. But, according to that report, most of Connecticut’s tax gap isn’t tied to the low-income households that, critics say, the bill would target the most.
According to that analysis, nearly 80% of Connecticut’s uncollected taxes involve under-reporting of income, a problem typically connected with businesses and households that can afford tax attorneys and accountants. 
Another 14% involves filers who don’t pay the full amount they claim to owe, and 6% involves those who don’t file altogether.
Complicating matters, the department’s contingent of auditors, who are essential to targeting underreporting, has been shrinking for more than a decade, according to the tax gap report.
DRS had 228 auditor positions this fiscal year, down 20% since 2012 and 11% since Lamont became governor six years ago.
Boughton said most states audit 3% of tax returns each year. Connecticut audits less than 1%.
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the Democratic-controlled committee, said the measure remains a work in progress, adding that she and others on the panel have several concerns. The finance committee must complete action on all bills it had raised by Thursday.
Horn said while Connecticut should seek ways to recoup delinquent tax dollars, particularly from taxpayers who leave the state, it cannot craft a system that targets one income group. She added that the need for more auditors to tackle the largest portion of the tax gap also must be addressed.
“I do believe DRS is understaffed,” she said.
Rep. Joe Polletta of Watertown, ranking House Republican on the finance panel, said he also wants lawmakers to make a serious effort to reduce tax delinquency — but in a fair manner across all income groups.
“If you owe a single dollar to the state of Connecticut, you should pay in a timely manner,” he said. “No one should get preferential treatment.”
But Polletta said he thinks withholding driver’s licenses for tax reasons only will make it harder for many households to pay what they owe. And he noted DMV Commissioner Antonio Guerrera testified before the committee that administering the withholding of driver’s licenses and vehicle registrations would be a burden on the agency and should be stripped from the bill.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_071-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 08:01:30.211429

(Getty Images)There are some big opinions on the overall impact of the property tax bill that lawmakers passed and Gov. Mike Braun celebrated. I don’t think it’s either as good or as bad as some believe — but today, I want to focus on some smaller provisions that deserve notice.
They aren’t sexy, like a $300 homeowner credit or a business personal property tax cut. But they do make a difference.
The first is a bond debt cooling-off period.
Under current law, when a local unit of government is planning to bond for a new project, it’ll often do it when another bond is set to expire. That means local officials can tell taxpayers they won’t see an increase in their tax bill. That is technically true, but they also won’t see a decrease.
Senate Enrolled Act 1 requires a one-year freeze after a bond expires so that taxpayers see the reduction.
Indiana Senate sends finalized local property, income tax plan to governor

Another change is moving all referenda votes to the general election. Schools use referenda largely for construction projects but can also hold them for school security and operational needs if they feel the state hasn’t provided what they need.
Of course, they still have to convince taxpayers to fund those needs.
For years, these votes were allowed in primary elections, when fewer Hoosiers go to the polls. Lawmakers believe moving them to general elections gives more transparency to the costs that lie above the percent caps for bills.
According to data collected by the Indiana School Boards Association, the school referendum pass rate in Indiana is 16 percentage points higher at the primary election than at the general election. The organization believes this is because primary voters are better informed and highly motivated to vote for or against the referendum. But voters in the general election are often surprised by the referendum and reflexively vote no.
Several provisions in the new law require affirmative voting on taxes, which can only be a good thing.
One section says if a unit’s assessed value remains the same, its levy cannot exceed the year before unless its fiscal body votes to do so by ordinance following a separate public hearing. Also, if assessed value does grow, it requires a decrease in the tax rate to bring in the same amount of money unless it’s affirmatively raised.
This language is meant to draw attention to the automatic nature of property taxes, which are essentially a calculation involving tax rate and assessed value.
Similarly, local income taxes — which got a lot of attention in discussion over the property tax package — will revert to zero each year. This forces an annual vote by fiscal leaders of local government to continue collecting that money.
I’m not actually sure this is necessary, and I can’t imagine state lawmakers would want to vote on the state income or sales tax every single year. But it is consistent with other moves to make the overall taxation system more open and understandable.
In the weeds
The last bits of language I want to highlight are deep in the weeds of property taxes.
The maximum levy growth quotient currently limits how much local property tax levies can rise in a year based on a six-year rolling average of non-farm personal income growth. Because of inflation, it rose to 5% in 2023 compared to 3.4% in 2019. Lawmakers last year put in an artificial cap of 4% and Senate Enrolled Act 1 extends that another year.
The bill also limits excess levy appeals by units. In that past, cities, counties and other units were allowed to ask for more revenue based on certain circumstances, such as assessed value growth and school transportation costs. Those won’t be allowed any longer, though an appeal would still be an option in case of natural disaster or other emergency.
None of these items individually — or even collectively — will likely drop your tax obligation in any massive way. But they do create a more responsive and open system so that Hoosiers can more easily understand the decisions that are being made. It also puts local officials on the hot seat instead of state lawmakers.
“They’re waving a flag, saying we’re the ones cutting your taxes … when what they’re doing is shifting everything on to the local government and saying, ‘You be the bad guys,’” Sen. Ron Alting told Based in Lafayette.
He was one of 12 Republicans to vote against the bill. Some believe it didn’t go far enough to cut property taxes.
In the end, those who simply disagree with the mechanism of property taxes will never be pleased with what occurred. But from a pragmatic standpoint, this package was more than I thought Gov. Mike Braun could get.

(Photo by Veronica Gabriela Cardenas, Pool/Getty Images)The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.






During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation, and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director for public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
 ‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’

Private immigration detention dates to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corp. of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.


Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada, and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, although those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.
Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county, and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting, and food safety.
State inspectors would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.










They're incentivized to cut corners.


– Setareh Ghandehari, Detention Watch Network’s advocacy director


CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.

In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio, and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
 Troubling conditions

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.

State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

A Minnesota Reformer analysis of ICE contracts also found that a gun range jointly owned by the cities of Cottage Grove and Woodbury holds one of the largest contracts for gun range leasing to ICE in the country, while a manufacturer in Anoka, Minn. provides more ammunition to the agency than any other contractor. 
Overall, contractors in Minnesota receive less in ICE contracts than those in states like Virginia and Texas, which each have had over $400 million in contracts since Jan. 2024, compared to Minnesota’s $7 million. Still, the data shows the two ways that Minnesota stands out: in producing ammunition and leasing gun range facilities to the agency. 
The findings come at a time when the Trump administration has been actively ramping up its immigration enforcement tactics, which have included a flurry of executive actions and what legal experts deem a legally questionable expansion of ICE’s reach. Immigration enforcement is becoming notably more aggressive in higher education, with hundreds of foreign students, including five from Minnesota State-Mankato, getting their visas revoked in recent days. Students and faculty nationwide have responded with protests against ICE, including at the University of Minnesota, where the existence of the gun range contract seems largely unknown. 
University of Minnesota leases gun range, making it ICE’s only existing contract with a university
The University of Minnesota has received $17,395 since 2022 to lease its Rosemount gun range to federal immigration enforcement for training, according to the spending data. The currently active contract, which ends in May, amounts to $18,867 to be paid over twelve months. 
Apprehension around immigration enforcement is high at the university, where Turkish graduate student Doğukan Günaydin was arrested and stripped of his student visa on March 27 for a 2023 drunken driving conviction, the New York Times reported. University president Rebecca Cunningham called the arrest, whose reasons were initially unknown, “deeply concerning” in a statement the day after. Elected officials quickly responded on social media, and activists organized a protest in downtown Minneapolis. 
In an email, university spokesperson Jake Ricker confirmed that the campus police department manages a firearm range on university property, which ICE, along with other law enforcement agencies, has reserved and used “for several years.” 
“As a public university, decisions about reviewing space requests” are required to be made “in a viewpoint neutral manner,” Ricker added. 
The last time another educational institution received contracts from ICE was when the Vermont State Colleges provided leadership training to the agency in 2023, according to the spending data. Johns Hopkins previously received over $1 million in ICE contracts, which, after a year of campus protests, were ended in September 2019 — though the school has since signed contracts with Customs and Border Protection, according to a Mother Jones report. 
The larger University of Minnesota community seems unaware of the agreement. Luisa Gaona, president of the university’s chapter of Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social, an organization that helped circulate a petition to support immigrants and non-citizens on campus, said she was surprised to hear about the contract. 
“I just don’t know why the university is collaborating,” Gaona said. “I don’t see the point there.” 
Gaona said that the contract will likely diminish trust in campus police among already-wary students. 
In her statement, university president Cunningham noted that campus departments “do not enforce federal immigration laws, and our officers do not inquire about an individual’s immigration status.” 
“Their focus remains on public safety, fostering trust and maintaining strong relationships across the University community,” Cunningham wrote. 
Still, Ricker previously told the campus newspaper that the university “cannot ignore federal court orders or subpoenas.” 
The Trump administration has rescinded prior protections from immigration enforcement in schools and is detaining international students with no charges. ICE had largely been targeting students who have expressed criticism of U.S. support of Israel in the Israel-Gaza war. The decision to arrest and jail Günaydin for an old DWI signals a worrying expansion of ICE’s authority, according to immigration lawyers. 


Twenty miles away from the university gun range is HERO Center and Shooting Range, a gun range jointly owned by Cottage Grove and Woodbury, Minn., that has received over $290k in contract payments from ICE since 2020, according to Cottage Grove spokesperson Phil Jents. 
That’s the second highest of active agreements ICE has with gun ranges, according to the spending database. In February alone, ICE spent $5,292 using the facility, Jents said. 
In other cities, contracts with ICE to use local training facilities have been controversial. In September 2019, Portland, Ore., police terminated a two-year contract to lease its training facility to immigration enforcement following criticism. 
Minnesota leads in ammunition manufacturing for ICE
Minnesota is also the top producer of rifle ammunition for immigration enforcement, with over $28 million in contracts since 2020. That number is driven largely by the Kinetic Group, formerly Vista Outdoors, a Czech-owned ammunition manufacturer based in Anoka, Minn. with over $6 million in active contracts with ICE. 

A 2023 press release confirms that one of the company’s brands received a contract from the Department of Homeland Security for ammunition “made exclusively for law enforcement and at our Anoka, MN headquarters,” though the press release did not give a dollar amount. 
The company’s most recent contract was signed in February for over $500k of ammunition and lists the principal place of performance as Fort Benning, Ga., a U.S. Army post where, as of 2019, ICE had plans to build a “hyper realistic” urban combat training facility modeled after a city in Arizona.

Finding the right balance between reducing distractions and supporting students' needs will require thoughtful, evidence-based decisions (Getty Images).In math class, Emma’s phone buzzes again, pulling her away from the lesson. It’s just one of the 273 notifications the average teen receives daily, according to Common Sense Media.
Her focus fades and learning stalls. A United Nations study found that it can take up to 20 minutes to regain concentration after such an interruption—making the cost of distraction cumulative, not momentary.
Students spend an average of 43 minutes on their phones each school day—nearly a full class period. Over the course of a school year, that equals roughly 130 hours of missed instruction. Missouri students cannot afford these losses, especially when more than a third of the state’s fourth- and eighth-graders score below basic proficiency in reading, with similar concerns in math, as reported by the National Assessment of Educational Progress.
Research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development shows that even the mere presence of a phone—or being seated near one—can negatively impact academic performance, particularly in math. A recent survey found that 53% of school leaders believe phones harm academic progress, while 73% report they diminish students’ attention spans. This distraction doesn’t just affect individual students; it erodes focus throughout the entire classroom.
Several St. Louis-area districts have adopted stricter cellphone bans after previous attempts failed to curb phone use in class. These early successes offer a practical roadmap for schools statewide, proving that focused classroom environments are possible with clear phone policies.
If we are serious about raising achievement and closing learning gaps, we must prioritize focus—beginning with limiting phone use during class.
The February 2025 SLU/YouGov Poll found that 70% of likely Missouri voters support banning phones during class across all K-12 schools. Nationally, 53% of adults favor similar restrictions for middle and high schoolers, and 83% of National Education Association members back a full school-day phone ban. Teachers, parents, researchers, and voters are all aligned in this rare moment of consensus on the need for change.
School safety bill advances in Missouri House with restrictions on cell phone use

Banning phones promotes equity by addressing the digital divide. Not every student has access to the latest devices, and phone use in class can exacerbate inequalities. Students with ADHD, learning differences, or trauma histories are especially vulnerable to digital distraction. Well-defined policies level the playing field, fostering more focused, inclusive classrooms.
Some families raise safety concerns, particularly in light of school shootings. However, experts recommend structured communication systems—not student cell phones. In a crisis, phones can spread misinformation, jam emergency lines, and prevent students from hearing or following safety instructions.
The Missouri House recently advanced a school safety bill that includes provisions for limiting cellphone use, reflecting ongoing discussions on how to address distractions in schools. This bill is one approach among many that seek to balance safety and learning environments, and it has garnered significant attention for its potential to create clear, student-centered policies.
While some schools have implemented phone restrictions, the lack of a statewide policy creates inequities for students, families, and teachers. A consistent framework at the state level would ensure that all schools, regardless of where they live, can create environments that support learning.
Schools don’t need to start from scratch. Many districts already use effective tools like wall-mounted phone caddies, magnetically sealed pouches, or classroom tech agreements. The goal is to create classroom norms that promote learning. With clear guidance and local flexibility, districts can implement practical, age-appropriate policies supported by staff and families.
Missouri wouldn’t be going it alone. Currently, at least 19 states have laws or policies banning or restricting cellphone use in schools or recommending local districts adopt similar measures, according to an Education Week analysis. Additionally, another 16 states have introduced similar legislation this year.
The issue of cellphone use in classrooms is complex. Finding the right balance between reducing distractions and supporting students’ needs will require thoughtful, evidence-based decisions. The stakes are high for student engagement and success, and thoughtful, evidence-based decisions will be key to shaping effective policies moving forward.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/teacher-in-a-classroom-1536x864-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-18 08:01:30.211429

Facing the continued collapse of Chinook salmon, officials this week shut down California’s commercial salmon fishing season for an unprecedented third year in a row.
Under the decision by an interstate fisheries agency, recreational salmon fishing will be allowed in California for only brief windows of time this spring. This will be the first year that any sportfishing of Chinook has been allowed since 2022.
The decision by the Pacific Fishery Management Council means that no salmon caught off California can be sold to retail consumers and restaurants for at least another year. In Oregon and Washington, commercial salmon fishing will remain open, although limited.
“From a salmon standpoint, it’s an environmental disaster. For the fishing industry, it’s a human tragedy, and it’s also an economic disaster,” said Scott Artis, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Association, an industry organization that has lobbied for river restoration and improved hatchery programs.
The decline of California’s salmon follows decades of deteriorating conditions in the waterways where the fish spawn each year, including the Sacramento and Klamath rivers.
California’s salmon are an ecological icon and a valued source of food for Native American tribes. The shutdown also has an economic toll: It has already put hundreds of commercial fishers and sportfishing boat operators out of work and affected thousands of people in communities and industries reliant on processing, selling and serving locally caught salmon.
California’s commercial fishery has never been closed for three years in a row before.
Some experts fear the conditions in California have been so poor for so long that Chinook may never rebound to fishable levels. Others remain hopeful for major recovery if the amounts of water diverted to farms and cities are reduced and wetlands kept dry by flood-control levees are restored.

 
This year’s recreational season includes several brief windows for fishing, including a weekend in June and another in July, or a quota of 7,000 fish.
Jared Davis, owner and operator of the Salty Lady in Sausalito, one of dozens of party boats that take paying customers fishing, thinks it’s likely that this quota will be met on the first open weekend for recreational fishing, scheduled for June 7-8.
“Obviously, the pressure is going to be intense, so everybody and their mother is going to be out on the water on those days,” he said. “When they hit that quota, it’s done.”
One member of the fishery council, Corey Ridings, voted against the proposed regulations after saying she was concerned that the first weekend would overshoot the 7,000-fish quota.
Davis said such a miniscule recreational season won’t help boat owners like him recover from past closures, though it will carry symbolic meaning.
“It might give California anglers a glimmer of hope and keep them from selling all their rods and buying golf clubs,” he said.
Sarah Bates, a commercial fisher based at San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf, said the ongoing closure has stripped many boat owners of most of their income.
“It continues to be devastating,” she said. “Salmon has been the cornerstone of many of our ports for a long time.”
She said the shutdown also has trickle-down effects on a range of businesses that support the salmon fishery, such as fuel services, grocery stores and dockside ice machines.
“We’re also seeing a sort of a third wave … the general seafood market for local products has tanked,” such as rockfish and halibut. She said that many buyers are turning to farmed and wild salmon delivered from other regions instead.
Davis noted that federal emergency relief funds promised for the 2023 closure still have not arrived. “Nobody has seen a dime,” he said.
 Fewer returning salmon

Before the Gold Rush, several million Chinook spawned annually in the river systems of the Central Valley and the state’s northern coast. Through much of the 20th century, California’s salmon fishery formed the economic backbone of coastal fishing ports, with fishers using hook and line pulling in millions of pounds in good years.
But in 2024, just 99,274 fall-run Chinook — the most commercially viable of the Central Valley’s four subpopulations — returned to the Sacramento River and its tributaries, substantially lower than the numbers in 2023. In 2022, fewer than 70,000 returned, one of the lowest estimates ever.

 
About 40,000 returned to the San Joaquin River. Fewer than 30,000 Chinook reached their spawning grounds in the Klamath River system, where the Hoopa, Yurok and Karuk tribes rely on the fish in years of abundance.
The decline of California’s salmon stems from nearly two centuries of damage inflicted on the rivers where salmon spend the first and final stages of their lives. Gold mining, logging and dam construction devastated watersheds. Levees constrained rivers, turning them into relatively sterile channels of fast-moving water while converting floodplains and wetlands into irrigated farmland.
Today, many of these impacts persist, along with water diversions, reduced flows and elevated river temperatures that frequently spell death for fertilized eggs and juvenile fish.
 The future of California salmon is murky

Peter Moyle, a UC Davis fish biologist and professor emeritus, said recovery of self-sustaining populations may be possible in some tributaries of the Sacramento River.
“There are some opportunities for at least keeping runs going in parts of the Central Valley, but getting naturally spawning fish back in large numbers, I just can’t see it happening,” he said.
Jacob Katz, a biologist with the group California Trout, holds out hope for a future of flourishing Sacramento River Chinook. “We could have vibrant fall-run populations in a decade,” he said.
That will require major habitat restoration involving dam removals, reconstruction of levee systems to revive wetlands and floodplains, and reduced water diversions for agriculture — all measures fraught with cost, regulatory constraints, and controversy.
State officials, recognizing the risk of extinction, have promoted salmon recovery as a policy goal for years. In early 2024, the Newsom administration released its California Salmon Strategy for a Hotter, Drier Future, a 37-page catalogue of proposed actions to mitigate environmental impacts and restore flows and habitat, all in the face of climate change.
California Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Charlton H. Bonham said the decision to allow limited recreational fishing “brings hope. We know, however, that this news brings little relief” to the industry.
He said salmon “are still recovering from severe drought and other climate challenges and have not yet benefitted from our consecutive years of wet winters and other actions taken to boost populations.”
However, Artis of Golden State Salmon Association said while the state’s salmon strategy includes some important items, it leaves out equally critical steps, such as protecting minimum flows for fish. He said salmon are threatened by proposed water projects endorsed by the Newsom administration.
“It fails to include some of the upcoming salmon-killing projects that the governor is pushing like Sites Reservoir and the Delta tunnel, and it ignores the fact that the Voluntary Agreements are designed to allow massive diversions of water,” he said.
Experts agree that an important key to rebuilding salmon runs is increasing the frequency and duration of shallow flooding in riverside riparian areas, or even fallow rice paddies — a program Katz has helped develop through his career.
On such seasonal floodplains, a shallow layer of water can help trigger an explosion of photosynthesis and food production, ultimately providing nutrition for juvenile salmon as they migrate out of the river system each spring.
Through meetings with farmers, urban water agencies and government officials, Rene Henery, California science director with Trout Unlimited, has helped draft an ambitious salmon recovery plan dubbed “Reorienting to Recovery.” Featuring habitat restoration, carefully managed harvests and generously enhanced river flows — especially in dry years — this framework, Henery said, could rebuild diminished Central Valley Chinook runs to more than 1.6 million adult fish per year over a 20-year period.
He said adversaries — often farmers and environmentalists — must shift from traditional feuds over water to more collaborative programs of restoring productive watersheds while maintaining productive agriculture.
As the recovery needle for Chinook moves in the wrong direction, Katz said deliberate action is urgent.
“We’re balanced on the edge of losing these populations,” he said. “We have to go big now. We have no other option.”

Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, speaks on a bill to establish Medicaid work requirements on April 17, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A signature from Gov. Mike Braun is all that remains for a Medicaid work requirements bill to become law, though such a move would require federal approval before it could go into effect.
Under Senate Bill 2, Hoosiers getting their health insurance under the Healthy Indiana Plan would need to log at least 20 work or volunteer hours a week with the overseeing state agency, a move that supporters hope will curb the program’s enrollment numbers. 
“I’d like to remind everybody who Medicaid is for: it is for our poor and our disabled. So every dollar … that is being redirected to somebody who should not be eligible, is taking a dollar away from somebody — some Hoosier — who is poor and or disabled,” said Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown. 
  Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, pushes back against Senate Bill 2 on April 17, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Every other member of the voting Republican caucus agreed: moving the bill forward on a 37-10 vote.
The program, otherwise known as HIP, covers working-age Hoosiers with low-to-moderate incomes and has been in place — in some form or another — since former Gov. Mitch Daniels’ administration. 
But Democrats decried the move, countering the belief that it would decrease costs. Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, pointed to a provision that quadruples eligibility checks from an annual process to a quarterly effort.
“My concern is Senate Bill 2 will eventually continue to drive up the costs of administering Indiana’s Medicaid program. So while we’re trying to save money, the way the language sits now … will drive up costs, administrative costs, bureaucracy,” said Yoder. “… Making Indiana’s Medicaid program more complicated will only increase the likelihood of eligible Medicaid members losing their coverage.” 
She also worried that the proposal would have a ripple effect on greater health care access across the state, such as the closure of clinics and longer emergency department waits.
Breaking down budgets: Why Medicaid expenses are growing

Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, said his daughter accessed disability services under a Medicaid waiver. 
“You’ll find that those of us that rely on Medicaid are also the most defensive of Medicaid and making sure that those folks that are on the program are eligible … and are being served appropriately,” said Bohacek. “… the path that we’re going on now, it will make the entire program untenable. And this program is way too important for those that quality.”
The Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimate that imposing Medicaid work requirements could cull between 102,000-116,000 Hoosiers from the expansion population rolls, far short of the more than 250,000 who would have to be cut in order to meet the 500,000 cap suggested in an earlier version of the bill. 
Though the bill no longer includes an explicit numerical cap, the language allows the Family and Social Services Administration to limit enrollment based on funding, which Sen. Fady Qaddoura called an “appropriation cap.”
“I see this as a policy goal of capping Medicaid enrollment based on appropriations,” said the Indianapolis Democrat. “… there are other solutions. The solution is not to reduce eligibility. The solution is not to reduce appropriations.”
 Details

Republicans point to the bill as a way to save much-needed money going into the next two-year budget cycle — though the Healthy Indiana Plan isn’t funded by state dollars. Instead, the federal government pays for 90% of the insurance program while provider and cigarette taxes cover the remainder. 
Several patient and anti-poverty advocates rallied earlier this month to oppose the restrictions proposed under Senate Bill 2, including the Indiana chapter of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. 
Lucy Dagneau, a senior director overseeing the organization’s national Medicaid campaigns, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that work requirements, specifically, can have a detrimental impact on those with cancer. Such constraints can “impose additional barriers to care and paperwork between cancer patients and their doctors,” Dagneau said.
“I think in a state like Indiana, it seems so unfortunate that the state would take steps backward when the Healthy Indiana Plan has been so successful and such a lifeline for people with cancer and a support in the lives of people who could be diagnosed with cancer,” said Dagneau.

According to ACS CAN, Medicaid covers the care of an estimated one in ten adults with a history of cancer and one in three children diagnosed with cancer.
“ACS has done a number of studies that show that Medicaid expansion specifically improves cancer survival rates. It reduces cancer mortality (and) it increases the likelihood that cancer patients receive timely treatment and an earlier stage diagnosis,” Dagneau said. “Pretty much across the cancer care continuum, Medicaid expansion makes dealing with cancer, preventing cancer and treating cancer better.”
Though listed exemptions to the bill’s work requirements would likely include someone diagnosed with cancer, “qualifying for and maintaining an exemption can be confusing and onerous,” according to ACS CAN. 
The biggest driver of Medicaid costs is Indiana’s aging population, many of whom rely on it to pay for nursing homes, assisted living facilities, home health aides and other long-term care costs. 
Senate Bill 2 also includes language that would assess the so-called “lookback period,” where regulators assess an individual’s financial assets before determining their Medicaid eligibility. 
“That’s actually how wealthy people get on Medicaid … you can sign all your assets over to a family member and then you have to wait five years and then you go on Medicaid,” said Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka. “We’re just not sure that they’re really waiting five years and we just wanted to … report on what they’re doing to claw back from those violators.”
However, like with the Medicaid work requirements and increased administrative workload, such a provision would need federal approval.

The hope is that creating an alliance between the 14 universities in the Big Ten Conference to defend “academic freedom, institutional integrity, and the research enterprise,” as the resolution reads, will make schools stronger together.
Just this week, the faculty senate at fellow Big Ten school Michigan State University adopted such a resolution, as have Indiana University and the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.

Schools are already seeing the negative impacts of President Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric and threatening executive orders, Sandra Levitsky, a professor of sociology and law at the University of Michigan said Thursday during the faculty senate meeting. The university’s administration quickly folded to Trump’s demands to shut down diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies, shuttering the doors of the school’s DEI office, Levitsky said.
“The University of Michigan abandoned DEI in-part to avoid the wrath of Trump and most schools, not just ours, have been cowed into this kind of preemptive capitulation. Most schools, not just ours, have gone silent, just when we need them to speak up,” Levisky said. “Hoping that our university is going to step out of this defensive crouch is not going to be enough, because the reality is, this is an existential moment for higher education and most schools, not just ours, are genuinely terrified about what might happen next.”
U-M-Motion-to-establish-alliance
 
The United States is on the cusp of an authoritarian administration, Associate Professor of History and Gender Studies Yi-Li Wu said during the faculty senate meeting, and everyone must look themselves in the mirror and determine what they will do as democratic institutions like higher education are attacked.
And silence or eager compliance are not survival strategies, Wu said, noting that Columbia University, which has had hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding pulled and several Pro-Palestinian students arrested, is a prime example of the reality that compromising on core values will not save schools from Trump’s wrath.
In reflecting on U of M’s smothering of the DEI office, Wu said it would appear the administration is trying to play a quiet game to stay out of the spotlight, but it won’t work.
“They apparently think that the best course is to work behind the scenes with lobbyists and to avoid making any public noise that might draw attention to us. They apparently think that ‘do it to the other guy, not us’, is a viable strategy for survival,” Wu said. “But we have seen that complying and silence do not work.”
The university’s faculty senate will have until Sunday to vote on whether to adopt the resolution.
The resolution is a “mutual suicide pact”, physics professor Keith Riles said, urging his colleagues to vote against the the Mutual Defense Compact Thursday.
It’s important to choose battles and allies wisely, Riles said, and after years of the university disregarding anti-discrimination laws, faculty members have “provoked the understandable anger of voters for whom Donald Trump is a vehicle for retribution.”
“Many of you have deluded yourselves into thinking that discrimination against whites and Asian Americans, especially males, is somehow magically permissible,” Riles said. “The Trump administration is, yes, it’s attacking this university, I understand that, but the university has much to answer for…You brought this on all of us.”
Though the Thursday meeting of the faculty senate was in large part called in response to the university’s recent decisions on DEI policies, Fred Terry, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science, said the stakes are much higher and broader.
What the Trump administration has set into motion is a regime where any research area, public discourse or curriculum that the president disagrees with will be gutted, with universities risking severe consequences if they don’t give in to Trump’s wishes, Terry said. This defies academic freedom and defiles the university’s mission to serve the state and the world through research and cultivating citizens for the betterment of the future.
But that doesn’t mean that banding together will protect schools, Terry said, but the cost of not trying presents a greater danger.
“I do have to observe that with a unified effort, we may not win, particularly in the near term. This is not a low stakes game. There may be real suffering by many in our community. We cannot engage in this fight lightly, but we cannot give up without giving up our intellectual integrity. Measures like motion one are clearly our best hope,” Terry said.
Following the faculty senate meeting, Democratic elected officials gathered at the Diag on the Ann Arbor campus to rail against the Trump administration cancelling student visas in recent weeks at schools across the country, including U of M and MSU.
It’s two weeks until graduation at plenty of Michigan schools, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) told a small crowd at the Diag Thursday, and Democrats in Congress are demanding answers about why this crackdown on visas is happening just before students are about to have their hard work rewarded on the graduation stage.

“I’m here to make this promise to all of you. We are demanding answers. No one will silence my voice. Do not let them silence yours,” Dingell told students on campus, affirming the crowd that diverse students and diverse perspectives are what makes campuses and the dialogues that can happen richer.
After announcing his campaign Thursday morning for the 2026 race for the open U.S. Senate seat to represent Michigan, Democrat Abdul El-Sayed joined the rally on campus to encourage students to “fight back” against Trump’s fear tactics.
Trump’s policies prey on people’s pain, El-Sayed said. By coercing his followers into cynicism about the economy and creating divisions between people groups, El-Sayed said Trump has won back the White House where he is implementing policies that will help his billionaire friends like Elon Musk, while leaving the middle class worse off than before.
“If we’re not willing to protect our democracy, if we’re not willing to go back to back working with one another to protect what it means to be an American, the question we have to ask ourselves is, ‘who will’,” El-Sayed said.

While Trump has used his power to pardon January 6 protestors who vandalized the U.S. Capitol and assaulted law enforcement in support of him in 2021, he’s calling for the arrest and deportation of students who speak out against his policies, U of M Junior and member of the College Democrats group Amber Henson said.
The First Amendment rights of students are on the line, and as college campuses have long been the stage of social movements throughout American history, threats to these rights must be answered, Henson said.
Leading up to Thursday, as the U of M College Democrats were organizing the rally, Henson said there was one student in the group who was concerned that their visa status would be revoked if they attended. As the daughter of Polish immigrants and as an International Studies student, the pull to protect international students and speak against federal acts to attack them is strong.
Young people have a lot to lose right now for speaking out, Henson said, but they also have a lot to gain as they face what decades of ramifications of this current administration could mean for their lives.

Phil Murphy says ""market manipulation"" is behind rising energy costs. Critics say Murphy's focus on offshore wind is to blame.","Gov. Phil Murphy says ""market manipulation"" is behind rising energy costs. Critics say Murphy's focus on offshore wind is to blame. (Amalie Hindash for New Jersey Monitor)The fight between New Jersey Democrats and the state’s electric grid operator escalated this week, with Murphy asking federal officials to investigate whether the company is responsible for the “exorbitant” rate increases set to take effect in less than two months. 
In a Wednesday letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Murphy asked officials to probe whether grid operator PJM Interconnection’s most recent electricity auction may have been “subject to market manipulation” that will result in ratepayers’ bills increasing by hundreds of dollars a year beginning June 1. 
“I believe that billions of dollars in excessive costs for consumers are the direct result of fundamental flaws in PJM’s capacity market and were foreseeable and preventable,” Murphy wrote. 
PJM operates the grid for New Jersey and 12 other states. The company held a rate-setting capacity auction last July — in New Jersey, utilities annually buy electricity supply through auctions — and the state Board of Public Utilities has blamed the auction as the “main driver of these increases.” The board announced in February it approved the new rates, resulting in increases of about 17% to 20%, depending on the service territory. 
Democrats are anxious over the skyrocketing costs, which will kick in days before voters cast their ballots in the June 10 primary, when all 80 Assembly seats and the governor’s race will be on the ballot. Lawmakers have introduced a seven-bill package they say is intended to lower costs for consumers, including bills that would set new processes to determine a utility company’s profit margins and end a surcharge tacked onto monthly bills. 
In a statement, PJM officials blamed the price hikes on “insufficient generation in-state” and denied any market manipulation in the auction. PJM echoed complaints of New Jersey Republicans who say Murphy’s focus on offshore wind projects has resulted in energy supply issues.
“Consumers are now paying the price for this failure,” said Jeff Shields, PJM spokesman. 
During a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting Thursday, commission chairman Mark Christie praised PJM and said politicians have been too critical of PJM. The company is “actually deserving of praise,” Christie said.
“I think is in many ways misplaced and lot of it is because of state policies that have sort of come to a head just recently. So I just want to say that with regard to defending PJM and defending their staff who work very hard, and work in good faith, by the way,” Christie said. “I never doubted PJM’s good faith.”
Another commissioner, Willie Phillips, said that those comments were “spot on and very well said.”
Christie said during a press conference that while he hadn’t seen Murphy’s recent letter, he’s seen his complaints, adding “a lot of these problems are some 20 years in the making, and I think a lot of it is just the very construct of a mandatory capacity market.” 
State Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris) has argued that the state’s energy policies under Murphy have led to supply-demand imbalances, and this, rather than market manipulation or anything PJM did, caused electricity prices to soar.
“You can’t increase demand to the point where the state can’t meet it, and they don’t have the supply to meet it. When you do that, it’s purely economics,” Bucco told the New Jersey Monitor. “Prices go up, and now our residents are going to be faced with that.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_1729_1-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-04-18 07:00:17.247106

The bill package cleared a legislative hurdle on Wednesday when the House Education and Workforce Committee voted to move it forward.
Last year, the legislature passed several bipartisan school safety bills that were introduced after a student shot and killed four students at Oxford High School in 2021. Those measures took lawmakers more than three years to approve, in part, because Democrats wanted to include gun reforms in proposed measures, and Republicans wanted to leave those measures out. A bipartisan House of Representatives school safety task force also researched the issues and interviewed school and public safety officials, community members, and survivors of school shootings, including Oxford, and their families.
Democrats eventually altered their proposals to gain support from Republicans.
Some of the newly introduced Republican bills touch on areas the original school safety task force agreed would be priorities: physical security, mental health, data processes, staff, and education. The bills do not address firearms and criminal justice, which were also among the original goals of the task force.
Rep. Kelly Breen, a Democrat from Novi, said in a March 26 hearing for the bills she was “alarmed” that the legwork the taskforce did and the input from school and public safety officials was not reflected in the new Republican bills. For example, Breen said the bills require hiring of hundreds of new mental health staff while schools already struggle to fill open positions.
One of the bills that moved forward this week would require every intermediate school district — or regional agencies that work with the Michigan Department of Education and local school districts to develop programs and meet goals — in Michigan to hire a mental health coordinator to develop and implement the comprehensive system. It would integrate community or faith-based mental health services in public and private schools. Few details about how this would play out in schools were available.
With state funds, the coordinator would also facilitate and deploy a behavioral health care technology platform for schools, as well as oversee and monitor Medicaid billing and the Caring 4 Students program, which partially reimburses school districts for mental health services for students who are eligible for Medicaid.
The bill would also require each ISD to have at least one emergency and safety manager to serve as a liaison between state and local school and law enforcement entities. The manager would perform risk assessments, facilitate response training with schools, and implement prevention programs.
It could cost an estimated $16.8 million in state funding for every ISD in the state to add the staff, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill. Schools would not have to meet the requirements if the state does not allocate the money to fund the positions, according to the bill.
The House Education and Workforce Committee voted to move the bill forward during a meeting Wednesday.
Republican state Reps. Nancy DeBoer, Rylee Linting, Joseph Fox, Tom Kunse, Joseph Pavlov, and Alicia St. Germain voted in favor of moving the bill to a vote in the full House. Democratic state Reps. Matt Koleszar and Regina Weiss voted against it.
Democratic state Reps. Jimmie Wilson Jr. and Erin Byrnes abstained, as did Republican state Rep. Brad Paquette.
 Here’s what the other new Republican proposals would do


Require every public school to establish its own crisis team by July 1, 2026. The team would be responsible for initiating lockdowns, helping evacuate students and staff, as well as reuniting families after a safety crisis. The teams would include the school’s principal, vice principal, a school resource officer, and other school personnel. Private schools would have to establish an emergency operations plan.
Change the requirement for public schools to review their emergency preparedness plans with local law enforcement from every two years to every three years. Private schools, which currently are not required to share their plans, would also have to adhere to the requirement.
Local schools that don’t currently have temporary locking systems – or systems that immediately lock doors as a barrier in active shooter situations – would have to install them.
Increase the number of lockdown drills schools must complete each school year from three to four. At least one of the drills would have to take place during lunch, recess, or another time when students are gathered outside of classrooms. At least one would have to take place between class periods.
Require public and private school identification cards to include contact information for the OK2SAY program, which facilitates anonymous tips on potential threats to school and student safety. An existing provision that schools are not legally liable when suicide prevention numbers are not included on student IDs would be extended to situations in which schools don’t include OK2SAY information.
Require the Michigan Department of Heath and Human Services to make materials related to suicide, depression, and anxiety available to private schools that request it. Public schools can already receive such materials.
Require the Michigan State Police’s Office of School Safety to compile quarterly reports on the OK2SAY tips it receives for the School Safety and Mental Health Commission.

The bills will go forward for a full vote in the Republican-controlled House. In order to become law, they would also need to pass votes in the Democratically controlled Senate, and be signed by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Earlier this year, Whitmer signed several other school safety bills into law. Among the measures, public schools now must have behavior threat assessment and management teams.

(Photo by Althea Dotzour / UW–Madison)Federal funding cuts and national culture war politics cast a long shadow over a state legislative committee hearing Thursday as Wisconsin’s higher education leaders asked lawmakers for additional investments in the next state budget — warning that disinvestment by the state could damage  public universities’, private nonprofit schools’ and technical colleges’ ability to serve students and the state. 
Lawmakers working on the 2025-27 state budget are gathering feedback from agency heads and members of the public just as higher education institutions across the country are facing an onslaught of threats from the Trump administration. 
As Republican lawmakers on the Assembly Colleges and Universities Committee grilled Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman and other higher education leaders on their budget goals, they appeared skeptical about providing additional funding. They pointed to current levels of spending and diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which state Republicans have demanded be cut from the UW. Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, expressed concerns about federal cuts to research and recent targeting of international students whose visas have been revoked. 
Rothman defends $855 million budget request
Rothman asked lawmakers whether the state is going to let its public universities “atrophy.” If not, he said,  new investments need to be made. The UW system has requested an additional $855 million, with the support of  Gov. Tony Evers, in the upcoming budget. 
The money  would be used to keep college affordable and accessible for Wisconsinites,  invest in retaining talented staff and support innovation, Rothman said. He told lawmakers the money would help UW maintain its two-year campuses and avoid raising tuition.
“We are at a state that without additional support from the state, student successes that we are seeing across our universities are at risk,” Rothman said. He noted that the state’s investment in the system has not kept up with inflation, and the money would put Wisconsin at the median nationwide. This would be up from Wisconsin’s current position of 43rd out of 50 when it comes to state investment in public universities.
This is not the first time Rothman has testified to lawmakers about the system’s request, having addressed lawmakers on the Joint Finance Committee, which is in charge of writing the budget on April 1.
Committee Chair Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Greenville) asked Rothman where he thought the money would come from.
“That is a challenge for the Legislature… This is an investment in the future of the state. We are returning $23 for every dollar that is invested in the Universities of Wisconsin,” Rothman said, citing a number that comes from a 2018 study.
Murphy told Rothman that he was “leery” of that number.
“If we’re increasing the money to the university by $855 million, are you telling me that I can expect $20 billion?” Murphy asked.
Rothman pointed out that lawmakers and their constituents have benefited from the existence of UW schools.
“At this table, you represent districts that have 9,000 students currently in school at the Universities of Wisconsin… More than half of you have attended one of our universities and hopefully you have benefitted from that,” Rothman said.
Murphy attended UW-Fox Valley from 1972 to 1974, according to his legislative biography. The school was merged with UW-Fond du Lac and UW-Oshkosh in 2018, and is now known as UW Oshkosh-Fox Cities. That campus is set to close in June.
Trump administration threats hanging over college campuses across the nation were central to the discussion over whether lawmakers should provide universities additional state funding.
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) brought up diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at UW institutions. An audit released last week found campuses haven’t been tracking their spending on these efforts. The audit was part of Republican lawmakers’ ongoing targeting of DEI, and comes as the Trump administration has also ramped up efforts to try to eliminate diversity programs in education. 
Republican lawmakers used staff pay and capital projects funding during the last legislative cycle as a negotiating tool with the UW system to get concessions on DEI efforts, including a reduction in positions focused on DEI. 
“We’re trying to see more of an effort to see in money savings, and I know there’s been reductions in positions, but there’s also been requests to add more,” Nedweski said. “We had a deal on DEI. Would you say that the UW system kept up their end of the deal?”
“Yes,” Rothman said.
“I wouldn’t say that’s what the audit says,” Nedweski said. 
Rothman responded that the UW has gone above and beyond the terms of  the deal, having reduced staffing by 43 positions even though the agreed upon deadline won’t arrive until December 2026. 
“We were on our way when the [Legislative Audit Bureau] did its field work in May of 2024,” Rothman said. “Since that time, we have made significant progress, and we are in compliance with the agreement as it relates to the positions. We’ve exceeded what we said we were going to do.” 
Nedweski said she was concerned about being able to measure the outcomes of the investments in DEI programs. 
“We now have a pattern within the UW system and our other state agencies where taxpayers are making investments in things like employees teleworking without knowing if there’s productivity. We’ve heard repeatedly from the UW system that we don’t really know their actual impact,” Nedweski said. 
Rothman noted that nearly 36,000 students graduate with degrees from Universities of Wisconsin schools each year. 
“I think that is an extraordinary [return-on-investment] for our state,” Rothman said. 
Murphy asked Rothman about a letter from the Trump administration sent to over 60 schools, including UW-Madison, warning that they could face consequences if they don’t address “antisemitism” on campus. UW-Madison is one of many schools where students joined encampment protests against the war in Gaza last spring. The Trump administration has said the university didn’t properly protect Jewish students.
“How do we control this antisemitism problem on our campuses?” Murphy asked. 
Before Rothman answered the question, Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) interjected, asking what the topic had to do with the budget. 
Murphy shot back that, as chair of the committee, he could ask what he wanted. 
“If you think this isn’t a budgetary issue, I think you should talk to Columbia University and see what they would say about that,” Murphy said. Columbia became a target of the Trump administration after large student protests there and has had over $400 million in federal funding, mostly for medical and other scientific research, terminated, despite agreeing to police student protesters and place the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies under scrutiny.
Rothman said the UW system is navigating First Amendment issues and being inclusive, but that the UW has done a lot of work to ensure that all students, including Jewish students, those with conservative beliefs, veterans, those who are disabled, “feel they are part of the campus community.”
Democrats on the committee expressed concerns about federal cuts to research funding, potential threats to Pell Grants and student loans and the targeting of international students. 
Emerson asked about the impact of federal cuts to research. The Trump administration has been targeting funding for higher education institutions across the country, including cutting over $12 million in research funding to UW-Madison. The flagship campus has laid off six employees so far.
Rothman said he is deeply concerned about the federal cuts. UW-Madison and UW-Milwaukee are both tier one research institutions and the federal government invests about $1 billion annually in UW schools for research, Rothman said. 
“It’s not like we can start five years from now, six years from now… These research engines were built over generations,” Rothman said. “If they are not maintained, that’s gone.” 
Rothman said the impact would be felt in sectors across the state including as research would be lost and researchers even in the private sector could be affected as many are educated at public universities. 
Rothman said that philanthropic support would be incapable of filling the gap that would be left from federal funding cuts.
Nedweski said she thought there is skepticism among taxpayers about the federal funding of research. She asked whether the UW system is expecting Wisconsin taxpayers to pick up the cost. 
“I don’t think that the state could afford to pick up what could be lost,” Rothman said. “I think what’s going to happen if that occurs is that research capacity is going to decline, research infrastructure is going to decline and that will be our new reality going forward.” 
Emerson also asked Rothman whether the Trump administration’s move to cancel foreign students’ visas is having a “chilling effect” on prospective international students. Dozens of UW students and alumni, including 26 at UW-Madison, have had their visas cancelled by the Trump administration in recent weeks as a part of an unprecedented nationwide move by the federal government targeting international students. 
“Do we have fewer applications from international students for next school year?… Are there international students who are thinking of finishing their bachelor’s or higher education back home?” Emerson asked.
Rothman said that it was too early to know as most applications have already been submitted. He said that about 10,000 international students attend UW schools.
“We may have a number of international students who might be accepted into our universities that will not come because of this. We know there is anxiety among our international students just generally, for reasons that are understandable,” Rothman said, adding that the university is seeking to support students, but is  not providing legal representation to them.
Private, nonprofit schools and tech colleges on budget requests
Wisconsin Association of Independent Colleges and Universities President Eric Fulcomer told lawmakers the top priority for private nonprofit colleges and universities is doubling the funding for the Wisconsin Grant (WG-PNP) Program, which provides assistance to undergraduate, Wisconsin residents enrolled in a degree or certificate program at non-profit, independent colleges or universities based in Wisconsin, from $57 million to $114 million.
Fulcomer’s organization represents 22 private nonprofit colleges and universities in Wisconsin, including Marquette University, the Medical College of Wisconsin, Beloit College and St. Norbert College. It also includes Northland College, which was founded in 1892, but announced in February the school will be closing after this year’s graduation due to financial hardships.
There has been no additional investment in the grant program in the last two state budgets. Private, nonprofit schools don’t receive state funding to sustain their operations, but many students rely on the funding to be able to attend the schools. 
Among its neighboring states, Wisconsin ranks last when it comes to the amount of need-based grants awarded to students attending private nonprofit schools. The investment would not bring Wisconsin to the top, but would bring it to the middle among states in the Midwest. Currently, Wisconsin can give a maximum amount of $4,400.
The schools’ request is more than the governor’s budget request; Evers  proposed a 20% increase.
“I would prefer a larger increase,” Fulcomer said. “20% would be welcomed but it’s not enough to move the needle.”
If there is no increase in the budget, Fulcomer said the award will need to be reduced to $3,850, bringing Wisconsin even further below its peers.
Nedweski asked if he had suggestions for where the money for the budget request could come from. The state has a $4 billion budget surplus, which Evers wants to pull from to fund many priorities in his budget.
Fulcomer noted that about a quarter of all bachelor’s degrees and a third of all master’s degrees come from Wisconsin’s private, nonprofit schools and that students are providing millions in revenue to the state via taxes. 
“It’s a good investment, but I’m not in a position to tell you where you might find those dollars,” Fulcomer said.
“We are not operating with a lot of extra money in the next biennium. If you get more, it has to come out of somebody else’s bucket,” Nedweski said.
Rep. Rob Kreibich (R-New Richmond) commented that he thinks lawmakers “should reward success” and he admires the retention and placement rates for the private schools. 
Emerson asked about what would happen if the Pell Grants were reduced or eliminated — a question that comes as the federal grants face a shortfall and as there is also uncertainty surrounding the future of student loans. 
“Potentially we’d be looking at a 27% cut to enrollment,” Fulcomer said. “Cutting the Pell Grant or eliminating the Pell Grant would be devastating for our sector.”
Wisconsin Technical College System President Layla Merrifield asked for  about $60 million from the state, including $45 million that would go toward general aid for its 16 colleges. The technical college system’s budget for 2024-25 totaled about $1.3 billion with $592.9 million coming from state aid. 
“There’s almost no better investment that you could make in Wisconsin’s economy, in its workforce and its people than the technical college system,” Merrifield said. “Our outcomes are well documented. We are transparent with our data, both our failings and our successes.”
Murphy thanked Merrifield for her approach to the budget. 
It is “a little bit what we were looking for from the UW today…,” Murphy said. “They want $855 million, but it’s taken nine months, and we still don’t have very much detail around what they expect to do with that money.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin has issued a letter asking elected leaders in Milwaukee to temper the acquisition and use of surveillance technologies by the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD). On Thursday evening, the police department went before the Fire and Police Commission (FPC) to push for the use of facial recognition technology. This, along with the common council’s recent approval of drone usage by the MPD, has spurred the ACLU to call for a two-year pause on the adoption of new surveillance technologies, and craft frameworks to regulate the technology MPD already has “with meaningful opportunities for community input.” 
Although it acknowledges that many on the council and within MPD “care deeply about the safety and well-being of our city,” the ACLU’s letter also warns that “history has shown time and again, authoritarianism does not always arrive with flashing lights and villainous speeches — it often comes wrapped in routine procedure, paperwork, and people ‘just doing their jobs.’” 
“We are already seeing how surveillance technology is being weaponized in real time,” the ACLU continued, citing data-gathering, automatic license plate readers, artificial intelligence (AI), and other tools that are used to “target and detain individuals.” 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The MPD has long denied that it uses facial recognition technology. As part of an investigation into surveillance technologies which the department obtained ahead of the 2020 Democratic National Convention (DNC), Wisconsin Examiner reviewed “investment justification” records from the state’s Homeland Security Council which suggested that the Southeastern Threat Analysis Center — a homeland security-focused aspect of the MPD’s intel-gathering Fusion Center — utilized Clear facial recognition technology. It was described as a “mobile device” that would allow police to “conduct timely identification of individuals in the field to prevent terrorist attack.” 
By contrast, MPD PowerPoint presentations prepared for the April 17 FPC meeting openly advertise the use of facial recognition. The PowerPoint details two examples of arrests made using facial recognition software. One “case study” from March 2024 involved a fatal gun violence incident where the suspects fled. The PowerPoint said that they were later seen at a gas station, and that facial recognition software provided leads to both suspects. Noting that “facial recognition results are advisory in nature and are to be treated as investigative leads only,” the PowerPoint states that a Department of Corrections agent confirmed the software’s results, leading to arrests the next morning. 
One of the PowerPoint slides shows in-custody photographs of the arrested men above pictures of them masked in a gas station. The slides showed that the facial recognition software had a “similarity” rating of 99.7% for one man, and 98.1% for another. Both men are waiting for a trial. The other case study focused on a sexual assault incident involving a gun. Like the other example, surveillance footage of the suspect from a gas station helped lead to the arrest. MPD sent out a facial recognition request to local agencies. It was answered by the Wauwatosa Police Department, which returned two pictures of the same individual. The pictures had similarity ratings of 99.1% and 98.9% respectively. The arrested man was sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
The PowerPoint presentation lists 14 cases from the North and South Sides of Milwaukee. It states that MPD “would be diligent in balancing the need for effective, accurate investigations and the need to respect the privacy of others,” and that facial recognition does not establish probable cause to arrest someone or obtain a warrant. “It may generate investigative leads through a combination of automated biometric comparisons and human analysis,” the PowerPoint states. “Corroborating information must be developed through additional investigation.” 
 
PUBLIC Facial Rec for FPC
A PowerPoint presentation detailing the Milwaukee PD’s plans for facial recognition software. 
 
MPD has reviewed procedures for the technology’s use nationwide, and stated that “oversight of the system will consist of an audit report showing information requested, accessed, searched, or disseminated.” All requests for facial recognition must be approved by a supervisor, and the department will keep a log of each search and the type of crime involved. Biometrica is the chosen facial recognition vendor. The PowerPoint states that the company has worked with the NAACP and the ACLU to provide anti-bias training for users of the software. 
The reassurances, however, do little to quell the concerns of privacy advocates. In their letter to the MPD and common council, the ACLU of Wisconsin highlighted ongoing immigrant roundups by  the Trump administration, and the deportation of Milwaukee residents to a notorious maximum security terrorism prison in El Salvador. “It is being used to monitor and prosecute political protesters, people seeking reproductive health care, LGBTQ+ individuals, and doctors trying to provide care,” the letter states. “These are not projections — these are present-day realities carried out by bad actors within the federal government and local jurisdictions.” 
The ACLU letter warns, “while we trust that our local leaders and police officers have good intentions, history reminds us how quickly larger systems can override those intentions.” 
In recent years MPD has expanded its network of surveillance cameras and other activities such as its phone surveillance operations remain shrouded in secrecy. MPD has also built up its social media surveillance footprint using AI-powered software, after downplaying the very existence of those activities in years past. 
“Data collected in Milwaukee does not stay in Milwaukee,” the ACLU states. “Once it enters a federal pipeline, it can be accessed, shared, and used in ways we cannot predict — or stop. That’s why now, more than ever, we must choose restraint. The rule of law at the federal level is unraveling before our eyes.”

The same set of concerns came up during a March 20 FPC meeting, where commissioners discussed the MPD’s use of drones and facial recognition technology. Police officials claimed that complaints about law enforcement using drones lagged behind the rate of agencies acquiring the technology, suggesting that the public approves. Police officials said that MPD’s “Airborne Assessment Team,” which is attached to the department’s Specialized Patrol Division, would help increase situational awareness, de-escalate dangerous situations, aid search-and-rescue, help manage major events and offer unique opportunities to “positively engage” with the community. In protest situations, drones would allow MPD to monitor an area while not physically placing officers nearby, whose presence could trigger an escalation among the protest crowd. 
MPD said that its drones do not have facial recognition capabilities. Still, the growth of MPD’s surveillance powers have worried some community members. Commissioner Bri Spencer said during the meeting that it would be nice for a community-based tech advisory board to be established to help review MPD’s surveillance requests. Spencer said that nationwide and historically, it’s not unheard-of for law enforcement surveillance programs to get out of hand. 
“I get it for water rescue, I’m very worried about things like protests,” said Spencer. “I think for very good reason. Our federal government is doing some very funky things right now with protesters. So I get what you’re saying, and I see in the SOP that you’re like, ‘We’re not going to do that.’ I don’t know if that’s sufficient in terms of a protection, particularly for people who are skeptical about the use of these technologies.” 
Police officials said that drones are a crowd management tool, and that during the Republican National Convention (RNC) they helped monitor protest movements to ensure opposing groups didn’t come into contact with one another. Spencer reiterated, “I think I just worry about the cost to individual civil rights and, like, how that’s going to just keep growing in our society…I wish the public had more input into whether or not the use of this type of technology is happening here. Talking to the community is not the same as letting them have a decision about whether or not they want drones in their city being run by police.” 
MPD spokespeople said the department based its drone usage procedures on best practice guidance from the ACLU, and that the department is “very late” to the drone game. The Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office, for example, officially announced its drone program in 2021.

Ahead of the DNC nearly five years ago, the MPD acquired large white vans called “critical response vehicles”, which are also attached to the Specialized Patrol Division and came equipped with their own tethered aerial drones. Wisconsin Examiner found that the sheriff’s drones were used to monitor police accountability protests, with the number of flights dropping significantly once the protests subsided. 
In its letter Thursday, the ACLU stressed that police abuse of surveillance “is not ancient history” but rather “it’s living memory for many in our city.” Some may remember the reign of police chief Harold Breier, who surveilled civil rights activists, LGBTQ+ communities, and Black Milwaukeeans. “And those who carried out that surveillance often believed they were ‘just doing their jobs.’” The ACLU’s letter questions what a personality like Chief Breier would do with today’s surveillance powers. 
“We’re not calling for a ban,” the letter states. Instead, the ACLU calls for a  two-year pause on acquiring new surveillance technologies, especially facial recognition technology, “while we assess the potential risks.” In the meantime, the letter urges city leaders to “pass a framework for regulating existing surveillance technology, such as adopting a Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) Ordinance to bring accountability to these decisions before it’s too late.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot_2021-03-15-Wisconsin-Examiner.png,,,2025-04-18 07:00:17.247106

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Dozens of bills are headed to the governor’s desk for final sign-off, but even more have stalled — or appear to be dead altogether.
Despite earlier momentum, legislation dealing with rape kit backlogs, immigration enforcement, social media restrictions for minors, and more ultimately missed key deadlines and failed to advance in the final weeks of the session.
Those issues won’t be officially settled, however, until lawmakers close out the session for good. Bill language could still reappear elsewhere — via closed-door conference committees — during the coming days.
Republican leadership said they plan to finish this year’s business by Thursday, April 24, but the session isn’t legally required to end until end-of-day on the following Tuesday, April 29.
‘Dead for good’
Although a bill prohibiting some Hoosier minors from using social media without their parents’ permission got bipartisan support in the Senate, the House took no action.

Senate Bill 11 would have required anyone under the age of 16 to secure permission from their guardians before accessing apps like Facebook, Instagram or TikTok. Another provision allowed Indiana’s attorney general to issue a civil investigative demand to determine if a social media site violated the law, with civil penalties up to $250,000. 
Following a 42-7 vote in the Senate in January, the bill was assigned to the House Judiciary Committee. Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, never gave the proposal a hearing.
The bill’s author, Sen. Ryan Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, attempted to amend the language into a foreign trade bill during the second half of the session, but he told the Indiana Capital Chronicle it was deemed non-germane, so he never called it for a vote.
“It’s dead for good,” Bohacek said, but he’s open to bringing the bill back in 2026.
One of several controversial anti-immigration bills this session also died in the second-half of session despite passing the full House in February.
House Bill 1531 would have mandated local compliance with federal immigration detainer requests and leveraged local government funding to ensure cooperation with federal authorities like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
It also would have targeted employers who hire a person who is not legally allowed in the U.S.
The bill died after the Senate Judiciary Committee, helmed by Fort Wayne Republican Sen. Liz Brown, declined to hold a hearing.
“I’ve had a lot of conversation with Sen. Brown in the second half of the session … she’s not comfortable moving it this year due to a few different things in the bill,” said bill author Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, who could file a similar bill in a future session. “I’m still looking at other options, but more than likely, it’s not moving this year.”
Still, a separate immigration-focused proposal, House Bill 1393, is headed to Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.

The bill requires jails and detention facilities to tell county sheriffs when they have probable cause to believe that someone they’re booking on unrelated misdemeanor or felony charges isn’t legally in the country. Sheriffs would have to report that information to ICE.
Senators additionally killed a contested elections bill that aimed to put school referendums and public questions only on general election ballots. 
Rep. Tim Wesco, R-Osceola, who authored House Bill 1681, previously emphasized that more voters participate in general elections than primaries. Democrats opposed, arguing that the change would strip local control and put more financial stress on schools.
Ultimately, though, the referenda language was signed into law in Senate Enrolled Act 1.
Also dead is House Bill 1413, which sought to eliminate the state’s backlog of rape kits and help counties with legal costs. Rep. Becky Cash, who authored the proposal, pointed to the current six- to eight-month wait for rape kit processing in Indiana, which crime technicians and law enforcement have attributed to a lack of equipment and staff.
The bill earned unanimous support from the House, and the chamber’s budget-drafting committee created a $2.5 million line item for the proposed Rape Kit Backlog Fund. Momentum continued in the Senate corrections committee, but the multi-million dollar appropriation is likely in jeopardy following this week’s grim revenue forecast. State budget writers said cuts are on the way.
Left out of the budget, too, was a $500 tax credit per newborn child for eligible taxpayers — or $250 for a married person filing a separate return.
Originally offered in Senate Bill 497, the credit would have been available for families earning up to 720% of the federal poverty level. The proposal passed 47-0 from the Senate but never made it into the state’s spending plan.
Other bills on the chopping block
Hundreds of other bills additionally failed to cross the finish line. Among those are:
House Bill 1174, pay day loans: The House narrowly advanced Rep. Jake Teshka’s bill to create new, longer-term loans of up to $5,000 — with steep monthly service fees stacked atop interest and other charges. The measure would have also allowed lenders overseeing larger borrowing, like car loans, to charge interest rates as high as 36%, up from the current cap of 25%. The Senate’s insurance committee left the bill untouched.

House Bill 1285, special education classroom cameras: A repeat attempt by Rep. Beck Cash, R-Zionsville, to mandate round-the-clock electronic recording equipment in special education classrooms, sensory rooms, seclusion spaces and time-out areas was stripped from the underlying bill by the House Education Committee. What’s left in the measure — which has since advanced from the Senate and is awaiting final House approval — are provisions to allow parents an opportunity to collect their student’s property if the child no longer attends the school, and another to permit parents to record meetings concerning their child’s individualized education program. The bill also requires schools to always have present in each building at least one employee who has obtained nonviolent crisis intervention training.
Senate Bill 126, annexation: An attempt to bridge the differences between House and Senate lawmakers in an annexation compromise met its demise last month after the author criticized the process and rebuked committee members. Sen. Jim Buck, R-Kokomo, has repeatedly authored legislation to rein in what he describes as an “abusive” form of annexation that’s “tilted in favor of the municipalities.” But he rejected an attempt to meld two bills into an annexation compromise, seemingly killing the effort altogether.
House Bill 1432, iGaming: A push to legalize online lottery and casino games passed easily out of the House Public Policy Committee earlier this year but didn’t get a hearing in the Ways and Means Committee, which would’ve taken a closer look at the financial aspects of the proposal. Rep. Ethan Manning, R-Logansport, authored the bill and estimated that the digital lottery and casino games, coupled with sports wagering tax hikes, could bring the state of Indiana more than $300 million annually in new revenue. But some were concerned that online options would cannibalize in-person gaming or lottery sales.
House Bills 1618 and 1237, new state emblems: A lively committee presentation by Jasper Elementary School fourth-graders was not enough to convince lawmakers to name the persimmon as Indiana’s state fruit. That bill died in committee without a vote, as did another proposal to make Myotis sodalis, also known as the Indiana bat, the official mammal of the Hoosier State.
Opposition brings likely end to Indiana utility siting bill, but the issue isn’t going away

House Bill 1628, utility siting: Overwhelming opposition from county officials killed the Republican proposal to shift authority over large-scale utility infrastructure projects from local governments to the state. The bill received multiple hours of discussion in the House utilities committee, but it was never put to a vote and failed to advance to the full chamber. Bill author Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, called it a response to ongoing resistance of local governments to greenlight solar, wind and other renewables projects that are increasingly necessary to support the state’s growing energy demands. Locals said decision-making control over the zoning and approval processes for those proposals was theirs, not the state’s.
Senate Bill 171, abortion pills: A move to ban pill-based abortions, and to require women to file an affidavit of rape to meet one of the state’s few exceptions, got no traction. Filed by Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, the bill would have outlawed the use of abortion pills even in abortions that meet the state’s narrow exemptions. And it would have required a woman who seeks an abortion under the state’s rape or incest exceptions to provide the doctor with an affidavit under penalties of perjury attesting to the rape or incest. The same requirement was defeated in 2022 during an amendment fight.
Senate Bills 201 and 284, closed primaries and early voting: Legislation slashing early in-person voting days and closing primary elections to unaffiliated voters garnered mixed committee testimony in early February before quietly dying in the Senate. Sen. Gary Byrne’s bill would’ve cut Indiana’s early voting timeline from 28 days down to two weeks. Another measure offered by Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, would have added text to voter registration forms asking Hoosiers to choose their political parties and warning that affiliation is required to vote in a primary election. It also would’ve required county election officials to affiliate registered voters with either the Democratic or Republican Party based on their last primary election votes, and would’ve created a way for voters to change their affiliations.

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Mental illness doesn’t check voter registration. Suicide doesn’t screen for partisanship. These crises are indiscriminate and omnipresent, cutting across class, race and creed. 
Yet Oklahoma’s failure to fully fund its 988 mental health crisis hotline reveals something chilling: for many state leaders, saving lives is negotiable — so long as it’s politically inconvenient.
In 2024, more than 39,000 Oklahomans called 988 in moments of acute distress. The hotline has become a vital alternative to 911 for those experiencing suicidal ideation, substance abuse crises, or psychosis — circumstances in which police presence is often inappropriate, and occasionally lethal. 
This is not a theoretical benefit. It is a demonstrable public health tool. And yet, lawmakers continue to defer, delay, and dilute every serious effort to secure its future.
The preferred mechanism to sustain 988 — a modest monthly telecom fee — has failed in the Oklahoma Legislature. Despite being modeled after the fee that funds 911, lawmakers balk at this proposal, wary of the optics. Some cite inflation. Others gesture vaguely toward “tax fatigue.” But all of them are missing the point.
This is not a fiscal debate. It is a referendum on priorities.
When the state wants to fund something, it does — and Oklahoma is proving that. Even as the legality is still being debated by the U.S. Supreme Court, Oklahoma has been fighting to direct public dollars toward a religious charter school. Meanwhile, State Superintendent Ryan Walters has proposed spending $3 million to put Bibles in classrooms.
As of mid-2024, the Office of Management and Enterprise Services reported $8.5 billion in state collections — 2.1% above the year’s projected estimate. 
There is no budgetary emergency. There is, however, a chronic unwillingness to spend political capital on the unglamorous work of mental health care.
But the clock is ticking. Federal funding might carry Oklahoma through fiscal year 2026, but how much longer can we keep kicking the can down the road? Hard decisions can only be postponed for so long. Without a sustainable revenue stream, Oklahoma risks gutting a system that has already proven its value.
And people will die. Not metaphorically. Not someday. Actually. Soon.
When the state abdicates responsibility, the burden does not vanish — it shifts. It falls to emergency rooms, already overwhelmed. It falls to police, untrained and ill-equipped. It falls to families, who are left to navigate overdose, psychosis, and suicidal crisis without trained professionals. 
And when the system fails, it is not the politicians who pay the price. It is the parent identifying a child in the morgue. It is the patient handcuffed during a panic attack. It is the person who dies on hold.
Let’s be clear: this is not about the money. It’s about optics. About cowardice. About lawmakers who want credit for caring, but not the consequences of doing.
To call 988 “life-saving” in a press release and then vote against funding it is not just hypocrisy — it’s complicity. 
The same legislators who boast of their mental health platforms during campaign season are the ones now waffling over 60 cents a year. That’s the cost of the proposed surcharge. Less than a drive-thru meal. Less than a single Starbucks run. And yet, for some, even that is too much.
Nationally, the need is unmistakable. Suicide remains the 11th leading cause of death in the United States, and Oklahoma’s suicide rate has risen by nearly 49% over the last two decades. Oklahoma ranks among the worst in the nation for health and well-being, and 1 in 5 adults report a diagnosable mental illness. In rural counties, access is often nonexistent.
The 988 line isn’t a silver bullet. But it is a start — a bridge between crisis and care. The hotline connects callers to trained behavioral health responders, often dispatching mobile crisis teams instead of law enforcement. It prevents unnecessary ER visits. It de-escalates violent episodes. It saves lives. All for less than a dollar per person per month.
This is policy at its most basic: spend a little to save a lot. But too many lawmakers are focused on ideological optics over empirical outcomes. They fear being labeled as tax-and-spend liberals. They fear their own base. And so they equivocate, allowing a proven, necessary, life-saving system to twist in the political wind.
There is no bipartisan spin that can reconcile this contradiction. You cannot champion mental health while defunding its infrastructure. You cannot claim to care about life and then balk at funding the system that protects it. And you cannot, in good conscience, govern a state where the price of survival is deemed too high at 60 cents.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Attorneys in a lawsuit against Idaho pathologist Dr. Ryan Cole for his alleged false cancer diagnosis that led a woman to undergo major surgery reached an agreement to dismiss the case.
But almost no information about the agreement is public.
Idaho 4th District Judge James Cawthon on April 10 agreed to dismiss the medical malpractice lawsuit, following a stipulation between attorneys on both sides. That came months after Cole and the patient’s attorneys began mediation, which is a legal process to work toward agreement. 
Filed in April 2023, the lawsuit was scheduled for a jury trial in April. Granting a request from both sides’ attorneys, the judge dismissed the case with prejudice. Each party will pay their own costs and attorneys’ fees. 
In November, patient J.B.’s attorneys submitted a ream of additional evidence in court. Those included statements from six doctors — who either worked with the patient, or were independent from her medical care — that disagreed with Cole’s diagnosis of a rare and aggressive form of endometrial cancer. The Idaho Capital Sun is identifying the patient only by her initials to protect her medical privacy.
In legal declarations, two independent pathologist doctors called Cole “reckless” in rendering the patient’s cancer diagnosis.

Cole, an Idaho pathologist, gained fame for false and misleading statements he made about COVID-19. He serves as an appointed Idaho health official.
Early last year, Washington state regulators restricted Cole’s medical license in the state after they found he spread COVID disinformation and broke medical practice by virtually prescribing ivermectin to COVID patients. The drug — long used as an anti-parsitic in humans but which lacks evidence to treat COVID — can now be sold over the counter in Idaho, after the Legislature widely approved the deregulation this year.
Cole and his attorney, Nancy Garrett, could not be immediately reached for comment. Mallam Prior, an attorney for the patient, declined to comment to the Idaho Capital Sun, saying the lawsuit’s outcome was confidential.
 Two pathologist doctors call Cole’s misdiagnosis ‘reckless’ in legal declarations

In 2021, Cole ran a laboratory being used by women’s health practices in the Boise area. J.B.’s nurse practitioner sent Cole’s lab a biopsy from her body that summer. 
She had invasive surgery after Idaho Dr. Ryan Cole misdiagnosed her. Now she’s suing.

After she underwent surgery to remove her female reproductive system, J.B. learned she didn’t have cancer, the Sun previously reported.
Part of Cole’s stance against COVID vaccines included false claims that they cause cancer.
There is no evidence that COVID vaccines can raise, or lower, a person’s risk of cancer. There is evidence that they lower a person’s risk of severe illness, death and chronic health issues after a COVID infection.
“I have seen a 10- to 20-fold increase of uterine cancer in the last six months in my laboratory,” Cole said at a meeting of America’s Frontline Doctors in San Antonio, Texas, about two weeks after he misdiagnosed J.B. with cancer of the uterine lining. “In the last six months. When did we start shots? January? How much solid-tumor cancer increase are we going to see over the next several years? Probably a lot.”
In November, as part of the plaintiff’s additional evidence submission, J.B’s attorneys wrote that Cole “claims to have retracted his comment that he was seeing a 20-fold increase of endometrial cancer in 2021 when there is nothing he can point to in order to demonstrate he has actually done so.”
Actually, Cole’s cancer diagnosis records — which the plaintiffs’ attorneys obtained as part of the lawsuit’s evidence discovery process — show “less than a 1% increase,” the legal filing alleged. 
That was part of the patient’s attorneys’ request for a jury to require Cole to pay punitive damages in the lawsuit.
  Dr. Ryan Cole speaks at a “Defeat the Mandates” rally in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 23, 2022. “Let doctors be doctors, and let us treat patients and save their lives. Don’t shackle our hands. We will not comply with your silliness,” he said. (Screenshot from livestream video)
Six other doctors — including five pathologists — evaluated the patient’s tissue samples and disagreed with Cole’s diagnosis, the filing alleged.
Dr. Matt Tannenbaum, an Idaho Falls pathologist who disagreed with Cole’s diagnosis of the patient, wrote “it is my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability and far more likely than not that Dr. Cole was negligent and reckless when misdiagnosing (the patient) with serous carcinoma.”

Dr. Paul Cohen, who serves as chair of pathology at Yale University’s hospital in Connecticut, wrote that “Dr. Cole’s level of incompetence in this case rises to the level of being reckless.”
“He either knew or should have known that there were problems with the diagnosis of serous carcinoma, that it was an incorrect diagnosis, and that by rendering such diagnosis it was creating an unreasonable risk of harm to (the patient) and a high probability that such harm would actually result,” Cohen wrote. 
Cole maintained his cancer diagnosis for J.B. was correct, despite the lawsuit and another review of the slides since his initial diagnosis, the filing alleged. 
 Cole is still licensed as doctor in Idaho, and serves on Central District Health board

The medical malpractice suit J.B. filed in Ada County accused Cole of negligence and other harms. The lawsuit also was against his business Cole Diagnostics, based in Garden City. 
Washington regulators restrict medical license of Idaho doctor who spread COVID-19 disinformation

The company is still registered as an Idaho business and lists Cole as president, business filings from the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office showed Thursday night.
Cole is still licensed to practice medicine in Idaho, the Idaho Board of Medicine’s licensing records website shows.
In 2024, his Idaho license temporarily lapsed, prompting questions about his status on the Central District Health board, the Sun previously reported. In September, Cole renewed his Idaho medical license.
Central District Health is a regional Idaho government public health agency that serves Idaho’s two most populated counties in and around Boise — Ada and Canyon — and two rural counties: Elmore and Valley. 
Cole remains on the Central District Health board.
In the state of Washington, Cole’s medical license is active with restrictions, the Washington State Department of Health’s website shows.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont said his message of money out of politics resonates across the political spectrum. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)How strange that due to the disastrous policies of “their president,” Montana’s all-Republican Congressional delegation and governor are now too scared to even face Montanans in town halls.  And yet Bernie Sanders flies into Missoula on his national “Fighting Oligarchy” tour and draws “thunderous applause and standing ovations” from an over-capacity crowd of 9,000 Montanans on an afternoon in the middle of the week.  
Why?  Because people know Bernie is telling the truth about what’s going on in this nation, not fabricating excuses and downplaying the very real damages taking place while they hide under their MAGA hats.  
He’s also correctly calling out the fact that both Republicans and Democrats are responsible for the on-going tragedy that sees American democracy, once the envy of the world, turning into an oligarchy of billionaires whose greed knows no bounds or even a scintilla of concern for “the little people.”
Nor was Bernie speaking from a bullet-proof cage surrounded by nasty looking thugs with sunglasses and earbuds to ensure no one gets close to him.  Quite the opposite — top Republicans nowadays don’t dare do what Bernie did — walk out into the overflow crowd of thousands to shake hands and talk directly to the people who couldn’t get in.  
The few Republican politicians who dare venture into the realm of “we the people” are being met by angry crowds whose interests and hope for a better future they have so grievously betrayed.  Just ask 91-year old GOP Senator Chuck Grassley, who was bluntly told “his” people in supposedly “red state” Iowa are now really “pissed” because he won’t stand up to “dictator” Trump.   
In an astounding contrast, there’s no denying that Bernie’s huge crowds are showering this 83-year old dynamo with love and hope, many with tears in their eyes because his words go straight to the challenges they are experiencing and they want to believe that somehow we can overcome the insulated and isolated billionaires and return our government to the people, not the 1 percenters who want ever more, no matter the cost to the rest of us.
That’s part of the reason Bernie Sanders is the most popular Senator in the nation. In his own words from his Missoula speech: “We can either have extreme wealth inequality, with the toxic division and corruption that it requires to survive, or we can have a fair economy for working people along with the democracy and freedoms that uphold it. But we cannot have both.” 
Speaking truth to power, Bernie laid it out: ““We don’t accept this blue state–red state nonsense. We are the United States of America, not red states, not blue states.  I believe honestly that I speak for conservatives, moderates and progressives, for the overwhelming majority of the American people, who understand that there is something fundamentally wrong in our campaign finance system where billionaires can buy elections.”
Apparently that rankled Montana’s millionaire governor, Greg Gianforte, who posted: “Bernie Sanders and AOC are in Montana pushing their far–left agenda — but Montanans rejected them and their puppet Joe Biden after four years of failed policies. The people have spoken. They aren’t feeling the Bern.”
I got news for the gov — who has never drawn anything close to Bernie’s crowds or approval ratings. Bernie won the Montana Democratic primary election in 2016 because he, not Hillary Clinton, spoke to Montanans’ concerns. They “felt the Bern” then and obviously are “feeling the Bern” again.  Why?  Because they’re feeling burned — by Gianforte, our do-nothing congressional delegation, and by the eternally lying fool in the Oval Office.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bernie-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 07:00:17.247106
